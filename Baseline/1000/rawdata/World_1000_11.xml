      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44043">The '''ATP Rankings''' are the objective merit-based method used by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) for determining the qualification for entry as well as the seeding of players in all singles and doubles tournaments.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/-/media/files/rulebook/2017/2017-atp-rulebook_chapter-ix_31jan17.pdf |title=ATP World Tour - Rulebook, Chapter IX, ATP Rankings |date= |accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first rankings for singles were published on 23 August 1973 while the doubles players were ranked for the first time on 1 March 1976. Ranking points are awarded according to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament, with the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]]s awarding the most points. The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after being awarded (with the exception of the [[ATP Finals]], from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP World Tour event of the following year.

==History==
The ATP began as the men's [[trade union]] in 1972, through the combined efforts of [[Jack Kramer]], [[Cliff Drysdale]], and [[Donald Dell]], and rose to prominence when 81 of its members boycotted the [[1973 Wimbledon Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tignor|first1=Steve|title=1973: The men boycott Wimbledon and shift power to the players|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/03/1973-men-boycott-wimbledon-and-shift-power-players/54385/|accessdate=26 June 2016|publisher=tennis.com|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two months later, in August, the ATP introduced its ranking system intended to objectify tournament entry criteria, which up to that point was controlled by national federations and tournament directors.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt1"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rankings That Changed Tennis (Part I)|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/heritage-1973-atp-rankings-celebration-part-i|last1=Buddell|first1=James|publisher=atpworldtour.com|date=23 August 2013|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ATP's new ranking system was quickly adopted by men's tennis.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rankings That Changed Tennis (Part II)|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/heritage-1973-atp-rankings-celebration-part-ii|last1=Buddell|first1=James|publisher=atpworldtour.com|date=23 August 2013|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While virtually all ATP members were in favor of objectifying event participation, the system's first No. 1, [[Ilie Năstase]], lamented that "everyone had a number hanging over them," fostering a more competitive and less collegial atmosphere among the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tignor|first1=Steve|title=1973: The ATP institutes computer rankings|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/03/1973-atp-institutes-computer-rankings/54439/|accessdate=26 June 2016|publisher=tennis.com|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original ATP ranking criteria, which persisted through the 1980s, was based on averaging each player's results, though the details were revised a number of times.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt2"/&gt; Starting in 1990, in conjunction with the expansion of ATP purview as the new men's tour operator, the ranking criteria was replaced with a 'best of' system modeled after competitive downhill skiing.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt2"/&gt; This 'best of' system originally used 14 events but expanded to 18 in 2000.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt2"/&gt;

==Overview==
A player's ATP Ranking is based on the total points he accrued in the following 19 tournaments (18 if he did not qualify for the ATP Finals):
*The four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments
*The eight mandatory [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]] tournaments,{{efn|In weeks where there are not four Grand Slam tournaments and eight ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments in the ranking period, the number of a player's best results from all eligible tournaments in the ranking period will be adjusted accordingly.}}
*The previous ATP Finals count until the Monday following the final regular-season ATP event of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx#yeartodate |title=Rankings FAQ |publisher=Atpworldtour.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The best six results from the non-mandatory ATP World Tour 1000, all [[ATP World Tour 500]], [[ATP World Tour 250]], [[ATP Challenger Tour]], [[Futures tournament|Futures Series]] and [[Davis Cup]] tournaments played in the calendar year{{efn|At least one of these tournaments must follow the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]].}}
The requirement to play in four ATP World Tour 500 events does not apply to a player who was outside the top 30 in the previous year-end ranking; however, no more than four of his results from 500 level events may be counted.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt; For a better result within the same tour type to be transposed one has to wait for the expiry of the first worse result from previous year. It only expires at the drop date of that tournament and only if the player reached a worse result or has not entered the current year.

Ranking points gained in a tournament are dropped 52 weeks later, with the exception of the [[ATP Finals]], from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP World Tour event of the following year.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt;

The [[Monte-Carlo Masters]] 1000 became optional in 2009, but if a player chooses to participate in it, its result is counted and his fourth-best result in an ATP 500 event is ignored (his three best ATP 500 results remain). From 2009 until 2015, if a player did not play enough ATP 500 events and did not have an ATP 250 or Challenger appearance with a better result, the Davis Cup was counted in the 500's table.&lt;ref name=DC&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|work=atpworldtour.com|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx#daviscup|date=|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Team Cup]] was also included before its cancellation in 2012.

For the Davis Cup, from 2009 until 2015, points were distributed for the World Group countries. Instead of having an exact drop date they were gradually updated at each phase of the competition, comparing the player's results with his results from the previous year. E.g. if a player played two matches in a semifinal but plays one the next year only that one missing match will be extracted from his points).&lt;ref name=DC /&gt;

A player who is out of competition for 30 or more days, due to a verified injury, will not receive any penalty. The ATP Finals will count as an additional 19th tournament in the ranking of its eight qualifiers at season's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=ATP World Tour |title=Rankings-FAQ |url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For every Grand Slam tournament or mandatory ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournament for which a player is not in the main draw, and was not (and, in the case of a Grand Slam tournament, would not have been, had he and all other players entered) a main draw direct acceptance on the original acceptance list, and never became a main draw direct acceptance, the number of his results from all other eligible tournaments in the ranking period that count for his ranking is increased by one.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt;

Once a player is accepted in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament or ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournament,{{efn|"Accepted" means a direct acceptance, a qualifier, a special exempt, or a lucky loser, or having accepted a wild card.}} his result in this tournament counts for his ranking, regardless of whether he participates. A player's withdrawal from an ATP World Tour 500 event, regardless of whether the withdrawal was on time, results in a zero point included as one of his best of four results. Further non-consecutive withdrawals results in a zero point allocation replacing the next best positive result for each additional withdrawal.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt;

Players with multiple consecutive withdrawals who are out of competition for 30 days or longer because of injury are not subject to a ranking penalty as long as verified and approved medical forms are provided; or, a player will not have the ranking penalty imposed if he completes the Promotional Activities requirement as specified under "Repeal of Withdrawal Fines and/or Penalties" or if the on-site withdrawal procedures apply.  Players may also appeal withdrawal penalties to a Tribunal who will determine whether the penalties are affirmed or set aside.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt;

Between 2000 and 2012, ranking points were awarded based on results in the Summer Olympics. This was changed before the 2016 Olympics where no ranking points were awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/sports/tennis/points-and-prize-money-mean-more-to-olympic-tennis-holdouts.html|title=Points and Prize Money Mean More to Olympic Tennis Holdouts|last=Rothenberg|first=Ben|date=2016-05-29|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With these rules, a player playing and winning the mandatory 4 Grand Slams and 8 ATP Masters 1000 events, a further 5 ATP 500 events and the [[Monte-Carlo Masters]] 1000 can amass a total of 19,500 points before the ATP Finals and end the calendar year with a maximum of 21,000 points. Novak Djokovic's haul of 16,585 points in the 2015 season is the best in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Novak_Djokovic_tennis_season|title=Novak Djokovic Season of 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

==Ranking method==

Since the introduction of the ATP rankings the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Douglas Robson|title=Happy 40th birthday, ATP computer rankings|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2013/08/19/atp-computer-rankings-turn-40/2674637/|publisher=USA Today|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Simon Cambers |title=40 years on, how have the ATP World Rankings developed? |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2013-02-15/201302151360936685683.html |website=www.wimbledon.com |publisher=[[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|AELTC]] |date=15 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231175147/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2013-02-15/201302151360936685683.html |archivedate=2014-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Points distribution (2009 – present)===

{{ATP Entry Ranking Points Distribution 2009}}

*(ATP 1000 series) Qualifying points changes to 16 points only if the main draw is larger than 56.
*(ATP 500 series) Qualifying points changes to 10 points only if the main draw is larger than 32
*(ATP 250 series) Qualifying points changes to 10 points only if the main draw is larger than 32
*Players who draw a bye in the first round in the ATP 1000 series and lose their first match in the second round are considered to have lost their first round and receive the points equivalent to first round loss. Similarly, loss in the second round of the ATP 500 series and the ATP 250 series after drawing bye in first round will result in 0 points being awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/-/media/files/rulebook/2017/2017-atp-rulebook_chapter-ix.pdf |title=ATP World Tour 2017 Rulebook |publisher=ATP World Tour }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition qualifiers and main draw entry players will then also receive the points in brackets for the rounds they reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx?#points |title=Tennis - ATP World Tour - Rankings FAQ |publisher=ATP World Tour |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2016, points were no longer awarded for [[Davis Cup]] ties,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/rankings/rankings-faq|title=Rankings {{!}} FAQ {{!}} ATP World Tour {{!}} Tennis|newspaper=ATP World Tour|language=en|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor for the tennis tournament at the Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennisworldusa.org/news/news/ATP_Tennis/27978/itf-confirms-no-atp-points-will-be-assigned-at-olympic-games-in-rio-2016/|title=ITF confirms no ATP points will be assigned at Olympic Games in Rio 2016|newspaper=Tennis World|language=en|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Big Brother Award.jpg|thumb|right|Big Brother Award, USA sculpture ("If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face— forever.")]] --&gt;
The '''Big Brother Awards''' ('''BBAs''') recognize "the government and private sector organizations ... which have done the most to threaten [[personal privacy]]". They are named after the [[George Orwell]] character [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]] from the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. They are awarded yearly to authorities, companies, organizations, and persons that have been acting particularly and consistently to threaten or violate people's privacy, or disclosed people's [[personal data]] to third parties.

The awards are intended to draw public attention to [[privacy]] issues and related alarming trends in society, especially in [[data privacy]]. The contest is organized by loose coalition of  [[nongovernmental organization]], including Iuridicum Remedium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iure.org/|title=Lidská práva, watchdog, advocacy (Aktuality) - Iuridicum Remedium - IuRe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Privacy International]],&lt;ref name="BBAI"&gt;http://www.bigbrotherawards.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and others, although some national-level BBAs are organized by specific sponsors.

The German Big Brother Awards are organized and hosted by [[Digitalcourage]] (formerly FoeBuD) in [[Bielefeld]].

The United States most recently hosted its Big Brother Awards – also known as the '''Orwell Awards''' or simply '''the Orwells''' – on 14 April 2005 in Seattle, Washington.  They had previously been hosted in Berkeley, California, on 12 April 2004; New York City on 3 April 2003; San Francisco, California, on 18 April 2002; and Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 7 March 2001. The first annual US Big Brother Awards were made at the [[Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference]] in Washington, D.C., on 7 April 1999, the 50th anniversary of the publication of Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.&lt;ref name="Diederich99"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diederich |first1=Tom |title=Intel, US Govt "honored" for breaches of privacy |url=http://linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-04/lw-04-orwell.html |accessdate=25 Jul 2014 |work=Computerworld |date=8 April 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991004233003/http://linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-04/lw-04-orwell.html |archivedate=October 4, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were made by [[Simon Davies (privacy advocate)|Simon Davies]], managing director&lt;ref name=Boodhoo99&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boodhoo |first1=Niala |title=Orwell's Legacy: Big Brother Awards |url=http://www.pcworld.com/pcwtoday/article/0,1510,10441,00.html |accessdate=25 Jul 2014 |work=PC World Today |date=8 April 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508055915/http://www.pcworld.com/pcwtoday/article/0%2C1510%2C10441%2C00.html |archivedate=May 8, 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the London-based Privacy International to recognize "the government and private sector organizations which have done the most to invade personal privacy in the United States."&lt;ref name="Diederich99"/&gt; The awards were given in five categories: Greatest Corporate Invader, Lifetime Menace, Most Invasive Program, People's Choice, and Worst Public Official.&lt;ref name="Boodhoo99"/&gt;

==History==

The history of CMMB (known as a committee of the [[Catholic Health Association of the United States|Catholic Hospital Association]] until 1927) dates back to 1912, when a personal tragedy inspired CMMB’s founder Dr. Paluel J. Flagg to commit to medical [[missionary]] work, beginning with [[leprosy]] patients in Haiti.&lt;ref name="Flagg"/&gt;

For many decades, CMMB prioritized the shipping of medical supplies and equipment to missionaries and health partners around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Edward F. Garesche, [http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=lnq The Catholic Medical Mission Board and its Work], ''The Linacre Quarterly'', Volume 2, Number 4. September 1934&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, [[Fulton J. Sheen|Bishop Fulton J. Sheen]], television personality and national director of the [[Society of the Propagation of the Faith]], joined CMMB’s board and served for 26 years.&lt;ref name="Flagg"/&gt; Another stalwart supporter of CMMB has been the surgeon [[Tom Catena]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex Perry, [http://world.time.com/2012/04/25/alone-and-forgotten-one-american-doctor-saves-lives-in-sudans-nuba-mountains/ Alone and Forgotten, One American Doctor Saves Lives in Sudan’s Nuba Mountains], ''Time''.

'''Dependency theory''' is the notion that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and [[Developing country|underdeveloped states]] to a "core" of [[Developed country|wealthy states]], enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[world system]]".

The theory arose as a reaction to [[modernization theory]], an earlier [[development theory|theory of development]] which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of [[poverty]] is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as [[investment]], [[technology transfer]]s, and closer integration into the [[World economy|world market]]. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Newschool, [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm "Economic Development"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714063027/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm|date=14 July 2009}}, retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency theory no longer has many proponents as an overall theory, though some writers have argued for its continuing relevance as a conceptual orientation to the global division of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1997|last1=James|first1=Paul|authorlink2=Paul James (academic)|title=Post-Dependency: The Third World in an Era of Globalism and Late Capitalism|url=https://www.academia.edu/7311042/Post-Dependency_The_Third_World_in_an_Era_of_Globalism_and_Late_Capitalism|journal=Alternatives: Social Transformation and Human Governance|volume=22|issue=2|pages=205–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dependency theory originates with two papers published in 1949 – one by [[Hans Singer]], one by [[Raúl Prebisch]] – in which the authors observe that the [[terms of trade]] for underdeveloped countries relative to the developed countries had deteriorated over time: the underdeveloped countries were able to purchase fewer and fewer [[Final good|manufactured goods]] from the developed countries in exchange for a given quantity of their raw materials exports. This idea is known as the [[Prebisch–Singer hypothesis|Prebisch–Singer thesis]]. Prebisch, an Argentine economist at the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|United Nations Commission for Latin America]] (UNCLA), went on to conclude that the underdeveloped nations must employ some degree of [[protectionism]] in trade if they were to enter a self-sustaining development path. He argued that [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substitution industrialisation]] (ISI), not a [[Export-oriented industrialization|trade-and-export orientation]], was the best strategy for underdeveloped countries.&lt;ref&gt;Short [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/prebisch.htm Prebisch biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812085123/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/prebisch.htm |date=2009-08-12 }} at Newschool; retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was developed from a [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] perspective by [[Paul A. Baran]] in 1957 with the publication of his ''The Political Economy of Growth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matias Vernengo|url=http://www.econ.utah.edu/activities/papers/2004_06.pdf|title=Technology, Finance and Dependency: Latin American Radical Political Economy in Retospect|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317085658/http://www.econ.utah.edu/activities/papers/2004_06.pdf|archivedate=17 March 2012|year=2004|page=5}}Working Paper No. 2004-06, University of Utah Dept. of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency theory shares many points with earlier, Marxist, theories of [[imperialism]] by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]], and has attracted continued interest from Marxists. Some authors identify two main streams in dependency theory: the Latin American Structuralist, typified by the work of Prebisch, [[Celso Furtado]], and [[Aníbal Pinto Santa Cruz|Aníbal Pinto]] at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC, or, in Spanish, CEPAL); and the American Marxist, developed by [[Paul A. Baran]], [[Paul Sweezy]], and [[Andre Gunder Frank]].

Using the Latin American dependency model, the Guyanese Marxist historian [[Walter Rodney]], in his book ''How Europe Underdeveloped Africa'', described in 1972 an Africa that had been consciously exploited by European imperialists, leading directly to the modern underdevelopment of most of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney, W. (1972). How Europe underdeveloped Africa. Beyond borders: Thinking critically about global issues, 107-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was popular in the 1960s and 1970s as a criticism of modernization theory, which was falling increasingly out of favor because of continued widespread poverty in much of the world. It was used to explain the causes of [[overurbanization]], a theory that urbanization rates outpaced industrial growth in several developing countries.&lt;ref name=Shandra&gt;Shandra, John M., Bruce London, and John B. Williamson. "Environmental Degradation, Environmental Sustainability, and Overurbanization in the Developing World: A Quantitative, Cross-National Analysis." Sociological Perspectives 46, no. 3 (1 September 2003): 309–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin American Structuralist and the American Marxist schools had significant differences but agreed on some basic points:{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;blockquote&gt;[B]oth groups would agree that at the core of the dependency relation between center and periphery lays [lies] the inability of the periphery to develop an autonomous and dynamic process of technological innovation. Technology &lt;span role="presentation"&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; the Promethean force unleashed by the [[Industrial Revolution]] &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; is at the center of stage. The Center countries controlled the technology and the systems for generating technology. Foreign [[Capital (economics)|capital]] could not solve the problem, since it only led to limited transmission of technology, but not the process of innovation itself. Baran and others frequently spoke of the [[international division of labour]] – skilled workers in the center; unskilled in the periphery – when discussing key features of dependency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Baran placed surplus extraction and [[capital accumulation]] at the center of his analysis. Development depends on a population's producing more than it needs for bare subsistence (a surplus). Further, some of that surplus must be used for capital accumulation – the purchase of new [[means of production]] – if development is to occur; spending the surplus on things like luxury consumption does not produce development. Baran noted two predominant kinds of economic activity in poor countries. In the older of the two, plantation agriculture, which originated in [[Colonialism|colonial times]], most of the surplus goes to the landowners, who use it to emulate the consumption patterns of wealthy people in the developed world; much of it thus goes to purchase foreign-produced luxury items –automobiles, clothes, etc. – and little is accumulated for investing in development. The more recent kind of economic activity in the periphery is industry—but of a particular kind. It is usually carried out by foreigners, although often in conjunction with local interests. It is often under special [[tariff]] protection or other government concessions. The surplus from this production mostly goes to two places: part of it is sent back to the foreign [[shareholder]]s as [[Profit (economics)|profit]]; the other part is spent on conspicuous consumption in a similar fashion to that of the plantation aristocracy. Again, little is used for development. Baran thought that political revolution was necessary to break this pattern.

In the 1960s, members of the Latin American Structuralist school argued that there is more latitude in the system than the Marxists believed. They argued that it allows for partial development or "dependent development"&amp;ndash;development, but still under the control of outside decision makers. They cited the partly successful attempts at [[industrialisation]] in Latin America around that time (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico) as evidence for this hypothesis. They were led to the position that dependency is not a relation between commodity exporters and industrialised countries, but between countries with different degrees of industrialisation. In their approach, there is a distinction made between the economic and political spheres: economically, one may be developed or underdeveloped; but even if (somewhat) economically developed, one may be politically autonomous or dependent.&lt;ref&gt;So, Alvin Y. 1990. Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory. Newbury Park, London and New Delhi: Sage Publications
&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Guillermo O'Donnell]] has argued that constraints placed on development by [[neoliberalism]] were lifted by the military coups in Latin America that came to promote development in authoritarian guise (O'Donnell, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;G O'Donnell, ''El Estado Burocrático Autoritario: Triunfos, Derrotas y Crisis'', Buenos Aires, Universidad de Belgrano, written 1982, published 1996, cited in Vernengo, ''Technology, Finance and Dependency'', p 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of [[multinational corporation]]s and state promotion of technology were emphasised by the Latin American Structuralists.

Fajnzybler has made a distinction between systemic or authentic competitiveness, which is the ability to compete based on higher productivity, and spurious competitiveness, which is based on low wages.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Vernengo, p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Debt of developing countries|third-world debt]] crisis of the 1980s and continued stagnation in Africa and Latin America in the 1990s caused some doubt as to the feasibility or desirability of "dependent development".&lt;ref&gt;Vernengo, p 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sine qua non'' of the dependency relationship is not the difference in technological sophistication, as traditional dependency theorists believe, but rather the difference in financial strength between core and peripheral countries&amp;ndash;particularly the inability of peripheral countries to borrow in their own currency. He believes that the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] position of the United States is very strong because of the importance of its financial markets and because it controls the international [[reserve currency]] &amp;ndash; the [[United States dollar|US dollar]]. He believes that the end of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international financial agreements]] in the early 1970s considerably strengthened the United States' position because it removed some constraints on their financial actions.

"Standard" dependency theory differs from Marxism, in arguing against [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and any hope of progress in less developed nations towards industrialization and a liberating revolution. Theotonio dos Santos described a "new dependency", which focused on both the internal and external relations of less-developed countries of the periphery, derived from a Marxian analysis. Former Brazilian President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] (in office 1995&amp;ndash;2002) wrote extensively on dependency theory while in political exile during the 1960s, arguing that it was an approach to studying the economic disparities between the centre and periphery. Cardoso summarized his version of dependency theory as follows:
*there is a financial and technological penetration by the developed capitalist centers of the countries of the periphery and semi-periphery;
*this produces an unbalanced economic structure both within the peripheral societies and between them and the centers;
*this leads to limitations on self-sustained growth in the periphery;
*this favors the appearance of specific patterns of [[Social class|class]] relations;
*these require modifications in the role of the state to guarantee both the functioning of the economy and the political articulation of a society, which contains, within itself, foci of inarticulateness and structural imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Cardoso &amp; Faletto, 1979, cited in Tausch, ''Sustainable Development and Turkey's Accession'', about 1/6 of way through.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of development patterns in the 1990s and beyond is complicated by the fact that capitalism develops not smoothly, but with very strong and self-repeating ups and downs, called cycles. Relevant results are given in studies by Joshua Goldstein, Volker Bornschier, and Luigi Scandella.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With the economic growth of India and some East Asian economies, dependency theory has lost some of its former influence. It still influences some [[NGO]] campaigns, such as [[Make Poverty History]] and the [[fair trade]] movement.

==Other theorists and related theories==
Two other early writers relevant to dependency theory were [[François Perroux]] and [[Kurt W. Rothschild|Kurt Rothschild]]. Other leading dependency theorists include Herb Addo, [[Walden Bello]], Ruy Mauro Marini, Enzo Faletto, Armando Cordova, Ernest Feder, Pablo González Casanova, [[Keith Griffin (economist)|Keith Griffin]], [[Kunibert Raffer]], Paul Israel Singer, and Osvaldo Sunkel. Many of these authors focused their attention on Latin America; the leading dependency theorist in the Islamic world is the Egyptian economist [[Samir Amin]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tausch|first=Arno|date=2003|title=Social Cohesion, Sustainable Development and Turkey's Accession to the European Union: Implications from a Global Model|url=http://alternativesjournal.net/article/view/5000159492/5000143927|journal=[[Alternatives: Turkish Journal of International Relations]]|volume=2|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|via=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827004744/http://alternativesjournal.net/article/view/5000159492/5000143927|archivedate=27 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Regression in both agriculture and small scale industry characterizes the period after the onslaught of foreign domination and colonialism
#Unequal international specialization of the periphery leads to the concentration of activities in export-oriented agriculture and or mining. Some industrialization of the periphery is possible under the condition of low wages, which, together with rising productivity, determine that unequal exchange sets in (double factorial terms of trade &lt; 1.0; see Raffer, 1987)
#These structures determine in the long run a rapidly growing tertiary sector with hidden unemployment and the rising importance of rent in the overall social and economic system
#Chronic current account balance deficits, re-exported profits of foreign investments, and deficient business cycles at the periphery that provide important markets for the centers during world economic upswings
#Structural imbalances in the political and social relationships, inter alia a strong '[[wikt:comprador|compradore]]' element and the rising importance of state capitalism and an indebted state class&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The American sociologist [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] refined the Marxist aspect of the theory and expanded on it, to form [[world-systems theory]]. This postulates a third category of countries, the ''semi-periphery'', intermediate between the core and periphery. Wallerstein believed in a tri-modal rather than a bi-modal system because he viewed the world-systems as more complicated than a simplistic classification as either core or periphery nations. To Wallerstein, many nations do not fit into one of these two categories, so he proposed the idea of a semi-periphery as an in between state within his model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory|last=So|first=Alvin|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|year=1990|isbn=|location=Newbury Park, London|pages=169-199|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the semi-periphery is industrialized, but with less sophistication of technology than in the core; and it does not control finances. The rise of one group of semi-peripheries tends to be at the cost of another group, but the unequal structure of the world economy based on unequal exchange tends to remain stable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tausch&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; traces the beginnings of world-systems theory to the writings of the Austro-Hungarian socialist [[Karl Polanyi]] after the [[World War I|First World War]], but its present form is usually associated with the work of Wallerstein.

Dependency theory has also been associated with [[Johan Galtung]]'s structural theory of imperialism.

Dependency theorists hold that short-term spurts of growth notwithstanding, long-term growth in the periphery will be imbalanced and unequal, and will tend towards high negative [[current account]] balances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cyclical fluctuations also have a profound effect on cross-national comparisons of economic growth and societal development in the medium and long run. What seemed like spectacular long-run growth may in the end turn out to be just a short run cyclical spurt after a long recession. Cycle time plays an important role. [[Giovanni Arrighi]] believed that the logic of accumulation on a world scale shifts over time, and that the 1980s and beyond once more showed a deregulated phase of world capitalism with a logic, characterized - in contrast to earlier regulatory cycles - by the dominance of financial capital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is argued that, at this stage, the role of [[unequal exchange]] in the entire relationship of dependency cannot be underestimated.{{Clarify|date=August 2016}} Unequal exchange is given if double factorial terms of trade of the respective country are &lt; 1.0 (Raffer, 1987, Amin, 1975).

The former ideological head of the [[Blekingegade Gang]] and political activist [[Torkil Lauesen]] argues in his book ''The Global Perspective'' that political theory and practice stemming from dependency theory are more relevant than ever.&lt;ref&gt;Lauesen, Torkil. ''The Global Perspective: Reflections on Imperialism and Resistance''. Montreal: Kersplebedeb, 2018. p. 321ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He postulates that the conflict between countries in the core and countries in the periphery has been ever-intensifying and that the world is at the onset of a resolution of the core-periphery contradiction – that humanity is "in for an economic and political rollercoaster ride".&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Economic policies based on dependency theory has been criticized by [[Free market|free-market]] economists such as [[Peter Thomas Bauer|Peter Bauer]] and [[Martin Wolf]] and others:&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Zinkina J. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=361&amp;Itemid=1 On the structure of the present-day convergence. ''Campus-Wide Information Systems''. Vol. 31 No. 2/3, 2014, pp. 139–152]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Lack of competition: by subsidizing in-country industries and preventing outside imports, these companies may have less incentive to improve their products, to try to become more efficient in their processes, to please customers, or to research new innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Michelle|title=The End of the Developmental State?|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415854822|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sustainability: industries reliant on government support may not be sustainable for very long, particularly in poorer countries and countries which largely depend on foreign aid from more developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
*Domestic opportunity costs: subsidies on domestic industries come out of state coffers and therefore represent money not spent in other ways, like development of domestic infrastructure, seed capital or need-based social welfare programs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} At the same time, the higher prices caused by tariffs and restrictions on imports require the people either to forgo these goods altogether or buy them at higher prices, forgoing other goods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Market economists cite a number of examples in their arguments against dependency theory. The improvement of [[India]]'s economy after it moved from state-controlled business to open trade is one of the most often cited (''see also'' [[economy of India]], ''[[The Commanding Heights]]''). India's example seems to contradict dependency theorists' claims concerning comparative advantage and mobility, as much as its economic growth originated from movements such as [[outsourcing]] – one of the most mobile forms of capital transfer. [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]] provide another example of trade-based development vs. autocratic self-sufficiency. Following the Korean War, North Korea pursued a policy of [[import substitution industrialization]] as suggested by dependency theory, while South Korea pursued a policy of [[export-oriented industrialization]] as suggested by comparative advantage theory. In 2013, South Korea's per capita GDP was 18 times that of North Korea. In Africa, states which have emphasized import-substitution development, such as [[Zimbabwe]], have typically been among the worst performers, while the continent's most successful non-oil based economies, such as [[Egypt]], [[South Africa]], and [[Tunisia]], have pursued trade-based development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/economic_studies/whats_driving_africas_growth&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economic historian Robert C. Allen, dependency theory's claims are "debatable", and that the protectionism that was implemented in Latin America as a solution ended up failing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780199596652.html|title=Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction {{!}} Robert C.

==Definition==
The [[Science Education Resource Center]], [[Carleton College]], offers the following description: "Earth system science embraces chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics and applied sciences in transcending disciplinary boundaries to treat the Earth as an integrated system. It seeks a deeper understanding of the physical, chemical, biological and human interactions that determine the past, current and future states of the Earth. Earth system science provides a physical basis for understanding the world in which we live and upon which humankind seeks to achieve sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/earthsystem/nutshell/|title=Earth System Science in a Nutshell|publisher=[[Carleton College]] |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
For millennia, humans have speculated how the physical and living elements on the surface of the Earth combine, with gods and goddesses frequently posited to embody specific elements. The notion that the Earth, itself, is alive was a regular theme of Greek philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name="Tickell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tickell |first=Crispin |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ebulletin-archive/ebulletin/features/2000-2009/2006/11/nparticle.2006-11-20.html |title=Earth Systems Science: Are We Pushing Gaia Too Hard? |work= 46th Annual Bennett Lecture - University of Leicester |location=London |publisher=University of Leicester |date=2006 |accessdate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early scientific interpretations of the Earth system began in the field of [[geology]], initially in the Middle East&lt;ref&gt;Fielding H. Garrison, ''An introduction to the history of medicine'', W.B. Saunders, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; and China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Age of Achievement: A.D. 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century : The Achievements |series=History of civilizations of Central Asia |editor1-first=M.

As [[History of geology|geology developed as a science]], understanding of the interplay of different facets of the Earth system increased, leading to the inclusion of factors such as the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's interior]], [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|planetary geology]] and [[Biosphere|living systems]].

In many respects, the foundational concepts of Earth system science can be seen in the holistic interpretations of nature promoted by the 19th century geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |journal=Science |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |pages=596-597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] (1863–1945) saw the functioning of the [[biosphere]] as a geological force generating a dynamic disequilibrium, which in turn promoted the diversity of life. In the mid-1960s, [[James Lovelock]] first postulated a regulatory role for the biosphere in [[feedback]] mechanisms within the Earth system. Initially named the "Earth Feedback hypothesis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Kasting| first1=James| title=The Gaia Hypothesis is Still Giving Us Feedback| url=http://nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/the-gaia-hypothesis-is-still-giving-us-feedback| accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/GAIA_hypothesis.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Gaia Hypothesis and Earth System Science |last=Schneider |first=Stephen |last2=Boston |first2=Penelope |work=University of Florida |publisher=MIT Press |date=1992 |accessdate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Highfield| first1=Roger| title=Unlocking Lovelock, science's greatest maverick| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/10735286/Unlocking-James-Lovelock-sciences-greatest-maverick.html| website=The Telegraph| publisher=The Telegraph| accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock later renamed it the [[Gaia hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="Tickell"/&gt; and subsequently further developed the theory with American evolutionary theorist [[Lynn Margulis]] during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Gribbon| first1=John and Mary| title=James Lovelock: In Search of Gaia| date=2009| publisher=Princeton University Press| location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the field of [[systems science]] was developing across numerous other scientific fields, driven in part by the increasing availability and [[Computer performance|power]] of [[computer]]s, and leading to the development of [[climate model]]s that began to allow the detailed and interacting [[numerical weather prediction|simulation]]s of the Earth's [[weather]] and [[climate]].&lt;ref name=edwards2010&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edwards |first=P.N. |date=2010 |title=History of climate modelling |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.95/abstract |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |volume=2 |issue= |pages=128–139 |doi=10.1002/wcc.95 |access-date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent extension of these models has led to the development of "Earth system models" (ESMs) that include facets such as the cryosphere and the biosphere.&lt;ref name=washington2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Washington |first=W.M. |last2=Buja |first2=L. |last3=Craig |first3=A. |date=2009 |title=The computational future for climate and Earth system models: on the path to petaflop and beyond |url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1890/833 |journal=Phil.

As an integrative field, Earth system science assumes the histories of a vast range of scientific disciplines, but as a discrete study it evolved in the 1980s, particularly at [[NASA]], where a committee called the Earth System Science Committee was formed in 1983. The earliest reports of NASA's ESSC, [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104410706;view=1up;seq=3 ''Earth System Science: Overview''] (1986), and the book-length [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj4rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Earth System Science: A Closer View''] (1988), constitute a major landmark in the formal development of Earth system science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Mooney| first1=Harold| title=Evolution of natural and social science interactions in global change research programs| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| date=February 26, 2013| volume= 110| issue = Supplement 1, 3665-3672| pages=3665–3672| doi=10.1073/pnas.1107484110| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/Supplement_1/3665.full| accessdate=7 September 2015| display-authors=etal| pmid=23297237| pmc=3586612| bibcode=2013PNAS..110.3665M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early works discussing Earth system science, like these NASA reports, generally emphasized the increasing human impacts on the Earth system as a primary driver for the need of greater integration among the life and geo-sciences, making the origins of Earth system science parallel to the beginnings of [[global change]] studies and programs.

== Climate science ==
[[File:Ocean &amp; Earth System.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The dynamic interaction of the Earth's [[ocean]]s, [[climate|climatological]], [[Geochemical cycle|geochemical systems]].]]
Climatology and climate change have been central to Earth system science since its inception, as evidenced by the prominent place given to climate change in the early NASA reports discussed above. The Earth's climate system is a prime example of an emergent property of the whole planetary system which cannot be fully understood without regarding it as a single integrated entity. It is also a property of the system where human impacts have been growing rapidly in recent decades, lending immense importance to the successful development and advancement of Earth system science research. As just one example of the centrality of climatology to the field, leading American climatologist [[Michael E. Mann]] is the Director of one of the earliest centers for Earth system science research, the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, and its mission statement reads, "the Earth System Science Center (ESSC) maintains a mission to describe, model, and understand the Earth's climate system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mann|first1=Michael|title=Earth System Science Center|url=http://www.essc.psu.edu/|publisher=Penn State University|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the Gaia hypothesis==
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}
The Gaia hypothesis posits that living systems interact with physical components of the Earth system to form a [[homeostasis|self-regulating]] whole that maintains conditions that are favourable for life. Developed initially by James Lovelock, the hypothesis attempts to account for key features of the Earth system, including the long period (several billion years) of relatively favourable climatic conditions against a backdrop of [[Sun#Main sequence|steadily increasing]] [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]]. Consequently, the Gaia hypothesis has important implications for Earth system science, as noted by NASA's Director for Planetary Science, James Green, in October 2010: "Dr. Lovelock and Dr. Margulis played a key role in the origins of what we now know as Earth system science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NASA|first1=50th Anniversary Symposium: Seeking Signs of Life|title=Opening Keynote - 'Exobiology in the Beginning'|url=http://original.livestream.com/astrobiology50th/video?clipId=pla_89adff36-bad9-43a2-b416-29a41cb9fab1|website=livestream.com|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Gaia hypothesis and Earth system science take an interdisciplinary approach to studying systems operations on a planetary-scale,&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"/&gt; they are not synonymous with one another. A number of potential Gaian feedback mechanisms have been proposed—such as the [[CLAW hypothesis]]&lt;ref name="CLAW87"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/326655a0 |author=[[Robert Jay Charlson|Charlson, R.

== Education ==
Earth system science can be studied at a postgraduate level at some universities, with notable programs at such institutions as the [https://www.ess.uci.edu/ University of California, Irvine], [http://www.essc.psu.edu/ University of Pennsylvania], and [https://earth.stanford.edu/ess Stanford University]. In general education, the [[American Geophysical Union]], in cooperation with the [[Keck Geology Consortium]] and with support from five divisions within the [[National Science Foundation]], convened a workshop in 1996, "to define common educational goals among all disciplines in the Earth sciences". In its report, participants noted that, "The fields that make up the Earth and space sciences are currently undergoing a major advancement that promotes understanding the Earth as a number of interrelated systems". Recognizing the rise of this [[systems approach]], the workshop report recommended that an Earth system science curriculum be developed with support from the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/spheres/intro.htm |title=Shaping the Future of Undergraduate Earth Science Education |publisher=American Geophysical Union |accessdate=2009-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916214004/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/spheres/intro.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Earth System Science Education Alliance was begun, and currently includes the participation of 40+ institutions, with over 3,000 teachers having completed an ESSEA course as of fall 2009".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth System Science Education Alliance|url=http://essea.strategies.org/background.html|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions''', (also known as ''European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions'') abbreviated '''EU-SILC''', is a survey department of the [[EU]].
It replaced in 2004 the ''European Community Household Panel'' (ECHP), which covered the years 1994-2003. The EU-SILC includes only minor changes relative to its predecessor the ECHP; most importantly, it significantly expands the number of countries included in the sample.

'''Global Handwashing Day''' ('''GHD''') is a campaign to motivate and mobilize people around the [[world]] to improve their [[Hand washing|handwashing]] habits.  Washing hands at critical points during the day and washing with [[soap]] are both important. 

Global Handwashing Day occurs on 15 October of each year. The global campaign is dedicated to raising awareness of handwashing with soap as a key factor in [[Preventive healthcare|disease prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=20091015004104007&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Lae Marks Global Handwashing Day|last = Rai|first = Frank|date = 12 August 2009|work = Post-Courier (Papua New Guinea)|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = Newspaper Source – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Respiratory and intestinal diseases can be reduced by 25-50%.

==Implementation and management==
The Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP) (formerly called "[[Public-private partnership|Public Private Partnership]]&amp;nbsp;for Handwashing" (PPPHW)) established Global Handwashing Day in 2008 as a way to promote a global and local vision of handwashing with soap.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=12 October 2012|title=Global Handwashing Day|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=82513752&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume=61|issue=40|page=821|doi=|pmid=|access-date=24 July 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steering Committee members of the GHP include Colgate-Palmolive; FHI 360; The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Procter &amp; Gamble; UNICEF; Unilever; University at Buffalo; USAID; the Water and Sanitation Programme at the World Bank; and the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalhandwashing.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=The Global Handwashing Partnership|website=globalhandwashing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued research on handwashing habits and practices is commissioned in conjunction with GHD. In 2011, [[Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget]] (SCA), sponsored a study to assess the handwashing habits of American and Canadian adults, finding that many were not using soap when washing their hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=bizwire.c37268574&amp;site=ehost-live|title = New Research Reveals Poor Handwashing Practices|last = |first = |date = 14 October 2011|work = Business Wire|access-date = 10 August 2015|via = Regional Business News – EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aims===
The aims of Global Handwashing Day are to:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Foster and support a general culture of handwashing with soap in all societies
* Shine a spotlight on the state of handwashing in each country
* Raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing with soap.

==Activities==

==History==
Global Handwashing Day was initiated by the Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP) in August 2008 at the annual [[World Water Week]] in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://globalhandwashing.org/about-us/our-history/|title = The Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing – Our History|date = |accessdate = 18 December 2015|website = The Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the first Global Handwashing Day took place on 15 October 2008. The date was appointed by the UN General Assembly. The year 2008 was also the [[International Year of Sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/gpsc/events/2008/15_10_08/en/index.html|title = Global Handwashing Day|date = 15 October 2008|accessdate = 24 July 2015|website = World Health Organization|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding bodies in 2008 included: FHI360 (a nonprofit human development organization based in the US),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fhi360.org/about-us|title=fhi360 About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=fhi360|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[UNICEF]], [[Unilever]], [[Water and sanitation program|World Bank Water &amp; Sanitation Program]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]].

===Themes===
*The focus for Global Handwashing Day's inaugural year in 2008 was school children. In that year, the members pledged to get the maximum number of school children handwashing with soap in more than 70 countries. In [[India]] in 2008, [[cricket]] legend [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and his teammates joined an estimated 100 million schoolchildren around the country in lathering up for better health and hygiene as part of the first Global Handwashing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/india_45974.html|title = Star Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar Promotes Handwashing in India|last = Walker|first = Angela|date = 16 October 2008|work = UNICEF|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was initiated to reduce childhood mortality rates and related [[respiratory]] and [[Diarrhea|diarrheal diseases]] by introducing simple [[Behaviour change (public health)|behavioral changes]], such as [[handwashing]] with [[soap]]. This simple action can reduce the [[mortality rate]] of respiratory disease by 25%. Death from diarrheal diseases can be reduced by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Val|last2=Cairncross|first2=Sandy|date=May 2003|title=Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=3|issue=5|pages=275–281|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6|pmid=12726975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the world, more than 60 percent of health workers do not adhere to proper hand hygiene. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US health care providers, on average, wash their hands less than half of the time they should. On any given day, one in 25 US hospital patients has at least one health care-associated infection.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings |url=https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/index.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of handwashing ===
{{Main article|Handwashing}}
{{tone|section|date=April 2018}}
Handwashing with soap is very effective and the least expensive way to prevent [[diarrhea]] and [[acute respiratory infection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=6FI3204107250&amp;site=ehost-live|title=MOH Celebrates Global Handwashing Day|last=|first=|date=15 October 2009|work=Arabia 2000|access-date=24 July 2015|via=Newspaper Source – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pneumonia]], a major ARI (acute respiratory infection), is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, killing an estimated 1.8&amp;nbsp;million children per year. [[Diarrhea]] and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5&amp;nbsp;million child deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/The_State_of_the_Worlds_Children_2008.pdf|title=The State of the World’s Children 2008. Child Survival. UNICEF|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handwashing with soap is estimated to reduce cases of diarrhea by 30% and respiratory infections by 21% in children under the age of five.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is important to make handwashing into a [[habit]]. Good handwashing with soap before [[eating]] and after using the toilet into a regular habit can save more lives than any single [[vaccine]] or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute [[respiratory infection]]s by one-quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2013/today-is-global-handwashing-day/|title=Today is Global Handwashing Day|last=Larsen|first=Linda|date=15 October 2013|work=Food Poisoning Bulletin|access-date=24 July 2015|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handwashing is usually done together with other [[sanitation]] interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene [[WASH]] programmes.

The Global Handwashing Day helps raise awareness of the importance of washing with soap, but it also makes it fun for children to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=wapo.ea30fbe0-e86a-11e0-8a05-c10ec107dc66&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Getting All Lathered Up|last=Sawyer|first=Kem Knapp|date=10 October 2011|work=The Washington Post|access-date=24 July 2015|via=Regional Business News – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper hygiene requires that individuals know the importance of good hygiene and develop the habits to carry it out.  There are people with plenty of money but nonetheless, they lack the important habits of timely handwashing with soap, and thereby unknowingly endanger themselves and others around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/global-handwashing-day-in_b_5989280.html|title=Global Handwashing Day in the Time of Ebola|author=Jeffrey Sachs|author2=Myriam Sidibe|date=15 October 2014|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peer pressure|Peer influence]] is significant to seeing increased handwashing among students. In a study conducted in [[Kenya]], researchers found that students were much more likely to wash their hands when another student is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickering|first=Amy J.|last2=Blum|first2=Annalise G.|last3=Breiman|first3=Robert F.|last4=Ram|first4=Pavani K.|last5=Davis|first5=Jennifer|date=27 March 2014|title=Video Surveillance Captures Student Hand Hygiene Behavior, Reactivity to Observation, and Peer Influence in Kenyan Primary Schools|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092571|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e92571|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092571|pmc=3968003|pmid=24676389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer influence is only successful, however, when students know that handwashing is a desirable action.

=== Related awareness days ===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) celebrates a  World Hand Hygiene Day on 5 May. In 2018 the theme was prevention of [[sepsis]] in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/infection-prevention/campaigns/clean-hands/5may2018/en/|title=Infection prevention and control|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the year before was to combat [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]] (AMR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/infection-prevention/campaigns/clean-hands/2017/en/|title=Infection prevention and control|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50029">'''Global citizenship''' is the idea that all [[person|people]] have [[rights]] and [[civic duties|civic responsibilities]] that come with being a member of the [[world]], with whole-world philosophy and sensibilities, rather than as a citizen of a particular [[nation]] or place. The idea is that one’s identity transcends geography or political borders and that responsibilities or rights are derived from membership in a broader class: "humanity". This does not mean that such a person denounces or waives their nationality or other, more local identities, but such identities are given "second place" to their membership in a global community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-global-citizen  Israel, Ronald C. (Spring|Summer 2012). "What Does it Mean to be a Global Citizen?" ''Kosmos.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Extended, the idea leads to questions about the state of global society in the age of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/hafa3/global.htm | title=Global Society and International Relations: Sociological and Political Perspectives | publisher=Polity Press | author=Shaw, Martin | year=2000 | location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, the term may have much the same meaning as "[[#World citizen|world citizen]]" or [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]], but it also has additional, specialized meanings in differing contexts. Various organizations, such as the [[World Service Authority]], have advocated global citizenship.

==Usage==

===Education===

In education, the term is most often used to describe a [[worldview]] or a set of [[values]] toward which education is oriented (see, for example, the priorities of the ''Global Education First Initiative'' led by the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaleducationfirst.org/220.htm "Priority #3: Foster Global Citizenship." ''Global Education First Initiative,'' Secretary-General of the United Nations.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "global society" is sometimes used to indicate a [[global studies]] set of learning objectives for students to prepare them for global citizenship (see, for example, the Global Studies Center at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/global/node/483| title=Global Studies Center | publisher=University of Pittsburgh| accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global citizenship education ====
{{Main|Global Citizenship Education}}

Within the educational system, the concept of global citizenship education (GCED) is beginning to supersede or overarch movements such as [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] education, [[peace education]], [[human rights education]], [[Education for Sustainable Development]] and [[international education]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government (2008). ''Global Perspectives: A framework for global education in Australian schools''. Carlton South Victoria, Australia: Curriculum Corporation. {{ISBN|978 1 74200 075 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, GCED rapidly incorporates references to the aforementioned movements. The concept of global citizenship has been linked with awards offered for helping humanity.&lt;ref name="twsJun16gb"&gt;{{cite news

New York: Economic Policy Institute and Teachers College. {{ISBN|978-0807748817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audrey Osler, director of the ''Centre for Citizenship and Human Rights Education'', the [[University of Leeds]], affirms that "Education for living together in an interdependent world is not an optional extra, but an essential foundation".&lt;ref&gt;Osler, Audrey and Hugh Starkey  (2010). ''Teachers and Human Rights Education.''  London:Trentham Books. {{ISBN|978-1858563848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With GCED gaining attention, scholars are investigating the field and developing perspectives. The following are a few of the more common perspectives:
* ''Critical and transformative perspective''. Citizenship is defined by being a member with rights and responsibilities. Therefore, GCED must encourage active involvement. GCED can be taught from a [[Critical thinking|critical]] and [[Transformative learning|transformative]] perspective, whereby students are thinking, feeling, and doing. In this approach, GCED requires students to be politically critical and personally transformative. Teachers provide [[social issues]] in a neutral and grade-appropriate way for students to understand, grapple with, and do something about.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, M. (2008). "You can’t criticize what you don’t understand: Teachers as social change agents in neo liberal times."  Pp. 113-126 in O’Sullivan, Michael &amp; K. Pashby (eds.) ''Citizenship in the era of globalization: Canadian perspectives''. Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Sense Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Worldmindedness''. Graham Pike and David Selby view GCED as having two strands. Worldmindedness, the first strand, refers to understanding the world as one unified system and a responsibility to view the interests of individual nations with the overall needs of the planet in mind. The second strand, [[Student-centered learning|Child-centeredness]], is a pedagogical approach that encourages students to explore and discover on their own and addresses each learner as an individual with inimitable beliefs, experiences, and talents.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, G. &amp; D. Selby (2000). ''In the Global Classroom 2''. Toronto: Pippin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Holistic Understanding''. The Holistic Understanding perspective was founded by Merry Merryfield, focusing on understanding the self in relation to a global community. This perspective follows a curriculum that attends to human values and beliefs, global systems, issues, history, [[cross-cultural]] understandings, and the development of [[Analysis|analytical]] and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] skills.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Philosophy===

Global citizenship, in some contexts, may refer to a brand of [[ethics]] or political philosophy in which it is proposed that the core [[social]], [[political]], [[economic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] realities of the world today should be addressed at all levels—by individuals, civil society organizations, communities and nation states—through a global lens.  It refers to a broad, culturally- and environmentally-inclusive worldview that accepts the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Political, geographic borders become irrelevant and solutions to today's challenges are seen to be beyond the narrow vision of national interests. Proponents of this philosophy often point to [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.) as an example, given his reported declaration that "I am a citizen of the world (κοσμοπολίτης, ''cosmopolites'')" in response to a question about his place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Book VI, Chapter 2, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sanskrit]] term, ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]]'', has the meaning of "the world is one family".&lt;ref name="malhotra"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7TlAgAAQBAJ | title=Indra's Net | publisher=Harper Collins, India. | author=Malhotra, Rajiv.| isbn=9789351362487 | date=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest reference to this phrase is found in the Hitopadesha, a collection of parables. In the [[Mahopanishad]] VI.71-73, ślokas describe how one finds the Brahman (the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the phenomenal universe). The statement is not just about peace and harmony among the societies in the world, but also about a truth that somehow the whole world has to live together like a family.&lt;ref name="malhotra" /&gt;

===Psychological studies===
{{Missing|statistics reported by polls|date=October 2018}}
Global pollsters and psychologists have studied individual differences in the sense of global citizenship. Beginning in 2005, the [[World Values Survey]], administered across almost 100 countries, included the statement, “I see myself as a world citizen.”  For smaller studies, several multi-item scales have been developed, including Sam McFarland and colleagues’ Identification with All Humanity scale (e.g., “How much do you identify with (that is, feel a part of, feel love toward, have concern for) . . . all humans everywhere?”),&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; Anna Malsch and Alan Omoto’s Psychological Sense of Global Community (e.g., “I feel a sense of connection to people all over the world, even if I don’t know them personally”),&lt;ref&gt;Malsch, A. M., &amp; Omoto, A. M. (2007). Prosocial behavior beyond borders: Understanding a psychological sense of global community. Claremont, CA: Unpublished manuscript, Department of Psychology, Claremont Graduate University.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerhard Reese and colleagues’ Global Social Identity scale (e.g. “I feel strongly connected to the world community as a whole.”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reese | first1 = G. | last2 = Proch | first2 = J. | last3 = Cohrs | first3 = J.C. | year = 2014 | title = Individual differences in responses to global inequality | doi = 10.1080/00224545.2014.992850 | journal = Analyses of Social issues and Public Policy | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 217–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Reysen and Katzarska-Miller's global citizenship identification scale (e.g., “I strongly identify with global citizens.”).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reysen | first1 = S. | last2 = Katzarska-Miller | first2 = I. | year = 2013 | title = A model of global citizenship: Antecedents and outcomes | doi = 10.1080/00207594.2012.701749 | journal = International Journal of Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 858–870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are strongly related to one another, but they are not fully identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. | last2 = Hornsby | first2 = W. | year = 2015 | title = An analysis of five measures of global human identification | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2161 | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 806–817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the psychological roots of global citizenship have found that persons high in global citizenship are also high on the personality traits of openness to experience and agreeableness from the [[Big Five personality traits]] and high in empathy and caring. Oppositely, the [[authoritarian personality]], the [[social dominance orientation]] and [[psychopathy]] are all associated with less global human identification. Some of these traits are influenced by heredity as well as by early experiences, which, in turn, likely influence individuals' receptiveness to global human identification.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. Webb | last2 = Brown | first2 = D. | year = 2012 | title = All humanity is my ingroup: A measure and studies of Identification with All Humanity | doi = 10.1037/a0028724 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 830–853 | pmid=22708625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that those who are high in global human identification are less prejudiced toward many groups, care more about international human rights, worldwide inequality, global poverty and human suffering. They attend more actively to global concerns, value the lives of all human beings more equally, and give more in time and money to international humanitarian causes. They tend to be more politically liberal on both domestic and international issues.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; They want their countries to do more to alleviate global suffering.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;

Following a [[social identity approach]], Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org" /&gt; Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural environment in which one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected to others in the world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of [[prosocial behavior]]s and values, including: intergroup [[empathy]], valuing diversity, [[social justice]], environmental [[sustainability]], intergroup [[Helping behavior|helping]], and a felt responsibility to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Student Learning: Improving Practice |last=Reysen |first=Stephen |publisher=Nova |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-62618-938-6 |location=New York |pages=121–137 |last2=Katzarska-Miller |first2=Iva |editor-last=Boyle |editor-first=Christopher |chapter=Student pathways to global citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has examined variables that influence the model such as: participation in a college course with global components,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ioep/ijdegl/2012/00000004/00000003/art00003 |title=College course curriculum and global citizenship |last=Reysen |first=Stephen |journal=International Journal of Development Education and Global Learning |doi= 10.18546/ijdegl.04.3.03|pmid= |access-date= |last2=Larey |first2=Loretta |year=2012 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=27–40 |last3=Katzarska-Miller |first3=Iva |issn=1756-526X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

===Geography, sovereignty, and citizenship===

At the same time that [[globalization]] is reducing the importance of [[nation-states]],&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of global citizenship may require a redefinition of ties between civic engagement and geography.  Face-to-face [[town hall meeting]]s seem increasingly supplanted by electronic "town halls" not limited by space and time.{{fact|date=October 2018}} [[Absentee ballot]]s opened the way for [[expatriate]]s to vote while living in another country; the Internet may carry this several steps further. Another interpretation given by several scholars of the changing configurations of citizenship due to globalization is the possibility that citizenship becomes a changed institution; even if situated within territorial boundaries that are national, if the meaning of the national itself has changed, then the meaning of being a citizen of that nation changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sassen|first=Saskia|title=Towards post-national and denationalized citizenship|year=2003|publisher=Sage|location=New York|pages=286|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sjs2/PDFs/Towards_Post-National_and_Denationalized_Citizenship.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
The lack of a universally recognized world body can put the initiative upon global citizens themselves to create rights and obligations. Rights and obligations as they arose at the formation of nation-states (e.g. the right to vote and obligation to serve in time of war) are being expanded. Thus, new concepts that accord certain "human rights" which arose in the 20th century are increasingly being universalized across nations and governments. This is the result of many factors, including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by the United Nations in 1948, the aftermath of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] and growing sentiments towards legitimizing marginalized peoples (e.g., pre-industrialized peoples found in the jungles of Brazil and Borneo). Couple this with growing awareness of our impact on the environment, and there is the rising feeling that citizen rights may extend to include the right to dignity and [[self-determination]]. If national citizenship does not foster these new rights, then global citizenship may seem more accessible.

Global citizenship advocates may confer specific rights and obligations of human beings trapped in conflicts, those incarcerated as part of [[ethnic cleansing]], and pre-industrialized tribes newly discovered by scientists living in the depths of dense jungle

====UN General Assembly====
On 10 December 1948, the UN General Assembly Adopted Resolution 217A (III), also known as "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/history.shtml "History of the Document." U.N.: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 1 states that "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

====US Declaration of Independence====
The opening of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776, states as follows:
{{quote|We hold these truths to be [[self-evident]], that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their [[Creator deity|Creator]] with certain [[Inalienable rights|unalienable Rights]], that among these are [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness]]. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]];&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Global citizenship in the United States" was a term used by former [[United States|U.S.]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 in a speech in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="twsJun16ga"&gt;{{cite news

===World citizen===
{{original research|date=November 2017}}
[[File:World Citizen Flag.svg|thumb| World Citizen flag by Garry Davis]]
[[File:World citizen badge.svg|thumb|World Citizen badge]]
In general, a world citizen is a person who places global citizenship above any nationalistic or local identities and relationships. An early expression of this value is found in [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.; mentioned above), the founding father of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic movement]] in Ancient Greece.  Of Diogenes it is said: "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Chapter VI, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a ground-breaking concept because the broadest basis of social identity in Greece at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet Kaniyan Poongundran wrote in ''[[Purananuru]]'', "To us all towns are one, all men our kin." In later years, political philosopher [[Thomas Paine]] would declare, "my country is the world, and my religion is to do good."&lt;ref name="Paine1792"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Paine|title=The Rights of Man|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rights_of_Man|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=1792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the increase in worldwide globalization has led to the formation of a "world citizen" [[social movement]] under a proposed [[world government]].&lt;ref name="worldservice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldservice.org/ | title=World Government of World Citizens | accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a non-political definition, it has been suggested that a world citizen may provide value to society by using knowledge acquired across cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="number"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/index.php/2007/03/22/the-utmost-global-citizen/  | title = the utmost global citizen| publisher = Global Culture}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also consider themselves world citizens, as they feel at home wherever they may go.

[[Albert Einstein]] described himself as a world citizen and supported the idea throughout his life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php Einstein - World Citizen, Erasing National Boundaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704235850/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php |date=4 July 2012 }}, [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;/ref&gt; famously saying "Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, George Sylvester (26 October 1929), "What Life Means to Einstein: An Interview by George Sylvester Viereck", The Saturday Evening Post: 117, http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/what_life_means_to_einstein.pdf retrieved on 7 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; World citizenship has been promoted by distinguished people including [[Garry Davis]], who lived for 60 years as a citizen of no nation, only the world.  Davis founded the [[World Service Authority]] in Washington, DC, which sells [[World Passport]]s, a [[Camouflage passport|fantasy passport]] to world citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MyCountryIsTheWorld.net My Country Is the World] By Garry Davis&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 [[Hugh J. Schonfield]] founded the [[Commonwealth of World Citizens]], later known by its [[Esperanto]] name "Mondcivitana Respubliko", which also issued a world passport; it declined after the 1980s.

The [[Bahá'í faith]] promotes the concept through its founder's proclamation (in the late 19th century) that "The Earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh |origyear = 1873-92 |year = 1994 |title = Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-174-4 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/ | page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term defined by the Bahá'í International Community in a concept paper shared at the 1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, New York, U.S.A. on 14–25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="bic"&gt;{{cite conference | title = World Citizenship: A Global Ethic for Sustainable Development | date = 1993-06-14 | location = New York, NY | author = Bahá'í International Community | booktitle =  1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; "World citizenship begins with an acceptance of the oneness of the human family and the interconnectedness of the nations of 'the earth, our home.' While it encourages a sane and legitimate patriotism, it also insists upon a wider loyalty, a love of humanity as a whole. It does not, however, imply abandonment of legitimate loyalties, the suppression of cultural diversity, the abolition of national autonomy, nor the imposition of uniformity. Its hallmark is 'unity in diversity.' World citizenship encompasses the principles of social and economic justice, both within and between nations; non-adversarial decision making at all levels of society; equality of the sexes; racial, ethnic, national and religious harmony; and the willingness to sacrifice for the common good. Other facets of world citizenship—including the promotion of human honour and dignity, understanding, amity, co-operation, trustworthiness, compassion and the desire to serve—can be deduced from those already mentioned."&lt;ref name="bic"/&gt;

===Mundialization===
Philosophically, mundialization (French, ''mondialisation'') is seen as a response to globalization’s "dehumanisation through [despatialised] planetarisation" (Teilhard de Chardin quoted in Capdepuy 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cybergeo.revues.org/24903 | title=Au prisme des mots | author=Capdepuy, Vincent | journal=Cybergeo: European Journal of Geography. | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early use of ''mondialisation'' was to refer to the act of a city or a local authority declaring itself a "world citizen" city, by voting a charter stating its awareness of global problems and its sense of shared responsibility. The concept was promoted by the self-declared World Citizen [[Garry Davis]] in 1949, as a logical extension of the idea of individuals declaring themselves world citizens, and promoted by Robert Sarrazac, a former leader of the [[French Resistance]] who created the Human Front of World Citizens in 1945.   The first city to be officially mundialised was the small French city of [[Cahors]] (only 20,000 in 2006), the capital city of the Département of [[Lot (department)|Lot]] in central [[France]], on 20 July 1949. Hundreds of cities mundialised themselves over a few years, most of them in France, and then it spread internationally, including to many German cities and to [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. In less than a year, 10 General Councils (the elected councils of the French "Départements"), and hundreds of cities in France covering 3.4 million inhabitants voted mundialisation charters. One of the goals was to elect one delegate per million inhabitants to a People's World Constitutional Convention given the already then historical failure of the [[United Nations]] in creating a global institution able to negotiate a final [[world peace]].  To date, more than 1000 cities and towns have declared themselves [[World cities]], including [[Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Minneapolis]], [[St. Louis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Toronto]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Tokyo]], [[Nivelles]], and [[Königswinter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldservice.org/mundcity.html|title=LIST OF MUNDIALIZED COMMUNITIES AND TOWNS|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a social movement, mundialization expresses the solidarity of populations of the globe and aims to establish institutions and [[supranational]] [[law]]s of a [[federation|federative]] structure common to them, while respecting the diversity of cultures and peoples. The movement advocates for a new political organization governing [[all humanity]], involving the transfer of certain parts of national [[sovereignty]] to a [[Federal World Authority]], [[Federal World Government]] and [[Federal World Court]]. Basing its authority on the will of the people, supporters hope it could develop new systems to draw on the highest and best wisdom of all humanity, and solve major planetary problems like [[hunger]], access to [[water]], [[war]], [[peace-keeping]], [[pollution]] and energy.  The mundialization movement includes the declaration of specified territory - a city, town, or state, for example - as world territory, with responsibilities and rights on a world scale. Currently the nation-state system and the United Nations offer no way for the people of the world to vote for world officials or participate in governing our world.  International [[treaties]] or agreements lack the [[force of law]]. Mundialization seeks to address this lack by presenting a way to build, one city at a time, such a system of true World Law based upon the sovereignty of the whole.

===Earth Anthem===
Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire [[planetary consciousness]] and global citizenship among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Not all interpretations of global citizenship are positive. For example, [[Bhikhu Parekh|Parekh]] advocates what he calls globally oriented citizenship, and states, "If global citizenship means being a citizen of the world, it is neither practicable nor desirable."&lt;ref name="Parekh1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parekh | first1 = B | year = 2003 | title = Cosmopolitanism and Global Citizenship | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 3–17 | doi=10.1017/s0260210503000019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community.&lt;ref name="Parekh1"/&gt; He also notes that such a world state would inevitably be "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh presents his alternative option with the statement: "Since the conditions of life of our fellow human beings in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become what I might call a globally oriented citizen."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt;

Michael Byers, a professor in Political Science at the [[University of British Columbia]], questions the assumption that there is one definition of global citizenship, and unpacks aspects of potential definitions. In the introduction to his public lecture, the UBC Internalization website states, "'Global citizenship' remains undefined. What, if anything, does it really mean? Is global citizenship just the latest buzzword?"&lt;ref name="Byers1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byers|first=Michael|title=The Meanings of Global Citizenship|year=2005|publisher=UBC Global Citizenship Speaker Series|url=http://www.internationalization.ubc.ca/gcss.htm#Meanings|accessdate=2009-10-28|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;inconsistent citations&amp;#125;&amp;#125;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415002147/http://www.internationalization.ubc.ca/gcss.htm#Meanings|archivedate=15 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byers notes the existence of [[stateless persons]], whom he remarks ought to be the primary candidates for global citizenship, yet continue to live without access to basic freedoms and citizenship rights.&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; Byers does not oppose the concept of global citizenship, however he criticizes potential implications of the term depending on one's definition of it, such as ones that provide support for the "ruthlessly capitalist economic system that now dominates the planet."&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; Byers states that global citizenship is a "powerful term"&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; because "people that invoke it do so to provoke and justify action,"&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; and encourages the attendees of his lecture to re-appropriate it in order for its meaning to have a positive purpose, based on idealistic values.&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt;

Neither criticism of global citizenship is anything new.  [[Gouverneur Morris]], a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)]], criticized "citizens of the world" while he was on the floor of the convention; August 9, 1787.  "As to those philosophical gentlemen, those Citizens of the World as they call themselves, He owned he did not wish to see any of them in our public Councils. He would not trust them. The men who can shake off their attachments to their own Country can never love any other. These attachments are the wholesome prejudices which uphold all Governments, Admit a Frenchman into your Senate, and he will study to increase the commerce of France: an Englishman, and he will feel an equal biass in favor of that of England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_809.asp | title= Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention | publisher=[[Yale University]] Avalon Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant agency associated with global health (and international health) is the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). Other important agencies impacting global health include [[UNICEF]] and [[World Food Programme]]. The United Nations system has also played a part with cross-sectoral actions to address global health and its underlying socioeconomic determinants with the declaration of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ |title=Millennium Development Goals |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the more recent [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

==Definition==

Global health employs several perspectives that focus on the determinants and distribution of health in international contexts:

* [[Medicine]] describes the pathology of diseases and promotes prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Weatherall, D. J., &amp; Clegg, J. B. (2001). Inherited haemoglobin disorders: an increasing global health problem. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 79(8), 704-712.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Public health]] emphasizes the health of populations.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, L. P., Bentley, M. E., Buekens, P., Burke, D. S., Frenk, J. J., Klag, M. J., &amp; Spencer, H. C. (2010). Global health is public health. The Lancet, 375(9714), 535-537.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Epidemiology]] helps identify risk factors and causes of health problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, M., Kovats, R. S., Wilkinson, P., Few, R., &amp; Matthies, F. (2005). Global health impacts of floods: epidemiologic evidence. Epidemiologic Reviews, 27(1), 36-46.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Demography]] provides data for policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Verano, J. W., &amp; Ubelaker, D. H. (1992). Disease and Demography in the Americas.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Economics]] emphasizes the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit approaches for the optimal allocation of health resources.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, D., Cafiero, E., Jané-Llopis, E., Abrahams-Gessel, S., Bloom, L., Fathima, S., ... &amp; O’Farrell, D. (2012). The global economic burden of noncommunicable diseases. Program on the Global Demography of Aging.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other social sciences such as [[sociology]], [[development studies]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], and [[law]] can help understand the determinants of health in societies.

Both individuals and organizations working in the domain of global health often face many questions regarding [[ethics|ethical]] and [[human rights]]. Critical examination of the various causes and justifications of health inequities is necessary for the success of proposed solutions. Such issues are discussed at the bi-annual [https://www.globalsummit-berlin2016.de Global Summits of National Ethics/Bioethics Councils, next in March 2016 in Berlin], with experts from WHO and UNESCO, by invitation of the German Ethics Council.

==History==

{{see also|Timeline of global health}}

The 19th century held major discoveries in [[medicine]] and [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalhealthhub.org/timeline Global Health Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Broad Street cholera outbreak]] of 1854 was central to the development of modern [[epidemiology]]. The microorganisms responsible for [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] were identified in 1880 and 1882, respectively. The 20th century saw the development of preventive and curative treatments for many diseases, including the [[BCG vaccine]] (for tuberculosis) and [[penicillin]] in the 1920s. The eradication of [[smallpox]], with the last naturally occurring case recorded in 1977, raised hope that other diseases could be eradicated as well.

Important steps were taken towards global cooperation in health with the formation of the [[United Nations]] (UN) and the [[World Bank Group]] in 1945, after [[World War II]]. In 1948, the member states of the newly formed United Nations gathered to create the [[World Health Organization]]. A cholera epidemic that took 20,000 lives in Egypt in 1947 and 1948 helped spur the international community to action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of WHO|author=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/library/historical/access/who/index.en.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207150944/http://www.who.int/library/historical/access/who/index.en.shtml|archivedate=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO published its [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|Model List of Essential Medicines]], and the 1978 [[Alma Ata declaration]] underlined the importance of [[primary health care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Primary Health Care: Report of the International Conference on Primary Health Care|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|year=1978|url=http://www.unicef.org/about/history/files/Alma_Ata_conference_1978_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a United Nations Summit in 2000, member nations declared eight [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), which reflected the major challenges facing human development globally, to be achieved by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly, 55/2|date=18 September 2000|publisher=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration was matched by unprecedented global investment by donor and recipient countries. According to the UN, these MDGs provided an important framework for development and significant progress has been made in a number of areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, progress has been uneven and some of the MDGs were not fully realized including maternal, newborn and child health and reproductive health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Building on the MDGs, a new Sustainable Development Agenda with 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) has been established for the years 2016-2030.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The first goal being an ambitious and historic pledge to end poverty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled ''Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2015 a book titled "[[To Save Humanity]]" was published, with nearly 100 essays regarding today's most pressing global health issues.&lt;ref&gt;S.J. Hoffman. 2011. "Ending Medical Complicity in State-Sponsored Torture," The Lancet 378(9802): 1535-1537. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60816-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The essays were authored by global figures in politics, science, and advocacy ranging from [[Bill Clinton]] to [[Peter Piot]], and addressed a wide range of issues including vaccinations, [[antimicrobial resistance]], health coverage, tobacco use, research methodology, [[climate change]], equity, access to medicine, and media coverage of health research.

==Measures==

Measures of global health include [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and [[mortality rate]].&lt;ref name="etches2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Etches V, Frank J, Di Ruggiero E, Manuel D |title=Measuring population health: a review of indicators |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=27 |issue= |pages=29–55 |year=2006 |pmid=16533108 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102141 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102141?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed|last2=Frank |last3=Di Ruggiero |last4=Manuel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability-adjusted life years===

{{legend|#cb0000|Over 80000}}
&lt;/div&gt;]]
{{Main|Disability-adjusted life year}}
The DALY is a summary measure that combines the impact of [[illness]], [[disability]], and mortality by measuring the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of "healthy" life. The DALY for a disease is the sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality and the years lost due to disability for incident cases of the health condition.

===Quality-adjusted life years===
{{Main|Quality-adjusted life year}}
QALYs combine expected survival with expected quality of life into a single number: if an additional year of healthy life is worth a value of one (year), then a year of less healthy life is worth less than one (year). QALY calculations are based on measurements of the value that individuals place on expected years of survival. Measurements can be made in several ways: by techniques that simulate gambles about preferences for alternative states of health, with surveys or analyses that infer willingness to pay for alternative states of health, or through instruments that are based on trading off some or all likely survival time that a medical intervention might provide in order to gain less survival time of higher quality.&lt;ref name="etches2006" /&gt;

===Infant and child mortality===
{{Main|Infant mortality|Child mortality}}
Infant mortality and child mortality for children under age 5 are more specific than DALYs or QALYs in representing the health in the poorest sections of a population, and are thus especially useful when focusing on [[health equity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mulholland E, Smith L, Carneiro I, Becher H, Lehmann D |title=Equity and child-survival strategies |journal=Bull. World Health Organ. |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=399–407 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18545743 |pmc=2647438 |url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0042-96862008000500018&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |doi=10.2471/BLT.07.044545|last2=Smith |last3=Carneiro |last4=Becher |last5=Lehmann }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morbidity===
{{Main|Morbidity}}
Morbidity measures include [[incidence rate]], [[prevalence]], and [[cumulative incidence]], with incidence rate referring to the risk of developing a new health condition within a specified period of time. Although sometimes loosely expressed simply as the number of new cases during a time period, morbidity is better expressed as a proportion or a rate.

==Health conditions==
The diseases and health conditions targeted by global health initiatives are sometimes grouped under "[[diseases of poverty]]" versus "[[diseases of affluence]]", although the impact of globalization is increasingly blurring the lines between the two.

===Respiratory infections===
Infections of the respiratory tract and middle ear are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.&lt;ref name="Lopez AD 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ |title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9524 |pages=1747–57 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16731270 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(06)68770-9|last2=Mathers |last3=Ezzati |last4=Jamison |last5=Murray }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some respiratory infections of global significance include [[tuberculosis]], [[measles]], [[influenza]], and [[pneumonia]]s caused by [[pneumococci]] and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''. The spread of respiratory infections is exacerbated by crowded conditions, and poverty is associated with more than a 20-fold increase in the relative burden of lung infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mizgerd JP |year=2006 |title=Lung Infection—A Public Health Priority |journal=PLoS Med |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages= e76|publisher= |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030076 |pmid= 16401173|pmc= 1326257|url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030076 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diarrheal diseases===
[[Diarrhea]] is the second most common cause of child mortality worldwide, responsible for 17% of deaths of children under age 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childinfo.org/709.htm |title=Statistics by Area – Diarrhoeal disease – The challenge |publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor [[sanitation]] can increase transmission of bacteria and viruses through water, food, utensils, hands, and flies. Dehydration due to diarrhea can be effectively treated through [[oral rehydration therapy]] with dramatic reductions in mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taylor CE, Greenough WB |title=Control of diarrheal diseases |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=10 |issue= |pages=221–44 |year=1989 |pmid=2655632 |doi=10.1146/annurev.pu.10.050189.001253 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.pu.10.050189.001253?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed|last2=Greenough Wb }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Victora CG, Bryce J, Fontaine O, Monasch R |title=Reducing deaths from diarrhoea through oral rehydration therapy |journal=Bull.

While hygienic measures alone may be insufficient for the prevention of rotavirus diarrhea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rotavirusvaccine.org/documents/WHO_position_paper_rotavirus_2007_000.pdf |title=Rotavirus Vaccine Access and Delivery - PATH |publisher=Rotavirusvaccine.org |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222043141/http://www.rotavirusvaccine.org/documents/WHO_position_paper_rotavirus_2007_000.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it can be prevented by a safe and potentially cost-effective vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Valencia-Mendoza A, Bertozzi SM, Gutierrez JP, Itzler R |title=Cost-effectiveness of introducing a rotavirus vaccine in developing countries: the case of Mexico |journal=BMC Infect.

===Maternal health===
[[Image:Merlin Maternal.jpg|thumb|Maternal health clinic in Afghanistan (source: [[Merlin]])]]
{{Main|Maternal health|Reproductive health}}
[[Complications of pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] are the leading causes of [[maternal mortality|death among women]] of reproductive age in many developing countries: a woman dies from complications from childbirth approximately every minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/mdg/maternal.html|publisher=UNICEF|title=Improve Maternal Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Health Organization's 2005 [[World Health Report]], poor maternal conditions are the fourth leading cause of death for women worldwide, after HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2005|title=World Health Report 2005: make every mother and child count|location=Geneva|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2005/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most maternal deaths and injuries can be prevented, and such deaths have been largely eradicated in the [[developed world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/02/100218092852.htm|work=Science Daily|title=Most Maternal Deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa Could Be Avoided|date= 2 March 2010|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targets for improving maternal health include increasing the number of  deliveries accompanied by skilled [[birth attendant]]s.&lt;ref name=bhutta2008 /&gt;

68 low-income countries tracked by the WHO- and UNICEF-led collaboration ''Countdown to 2015'' are estimated to hold for 97% of worldwide maternal and child deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countdown2015mnch.org/reports-publications|work=Countdown to 2015|title=Progress reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
{{Main|HIV|AIDS|}}
The HIV/AIDS epidemic has highlighted the global nature of human health and welfare and globalisation has given rise to a trend toward finding common solutions to global health challenges. Numerous international funds have been set up in recent times to address global health challenges such as HIV. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1744-8603-1-13|title=HIV/AIDS: global trends, global funds and delivery bottlenecks|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 35 million people have died of HIV. Globally, 36.9 million [31.1–43.9 million] people were living with HIV at the end of 2017. An estimated 0.8% [0.6-0.9%] of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with HIV, although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably between countries and regions. The WHO African region remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults (4.1%) living with HIV and accounting for nearly two-thirds of the people living with HIV worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/hiv/en/|title=HIV/AIDS|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted through unprotected sex, unclean needles, blood transfusions, and from mother to child during birth or lactation. Globally, HIV is primarily spread through sexual intercourse. The risk-per-exposure with vaginal sex in low-income countries from female to male is 0.38% and male to female is 0.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aidsmap.com/Estimated-risk-per-exposure/page/1324038/#item1324093|title=Estimated HIV transmission risk per exposure for specific activities and events|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The infection damages the immune system, leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and eventually, death. [[Management of HIV/AIDS|Antiretroviral drugs]] prolong life and delay the onset of AIDS by minimizing the amount of HIV in the body.

===Malaria===
{{Main|Malaria}}
Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the parasites of the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]''. Symptoms may include fever, headaches, chills, and nausea. Each year, there are approximately 500 million cases of malaria worldwide, most commonly among children and pregnant women in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Birn"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Birn, A., Pillay |author2=Yogan, Holtz, T. |year=2009|title=Textbook of International Health|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=273|isbn=9780199719853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2016, the region was home to 90% of malaria cases and 91% of malaria deaths. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria|title=Malaria key facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The use of [[Mosquito net|insecticide-treated bednets]] is a cost-effective way to reduce deaths from malaria, as is prompt [[artemisinin]]-based combination therapy, supported by [[intermittent preventive therapy]] in pregnancy. International travellers to [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] zones are advised [[chemoprophylaxis]] with [[antimalarial drugs]] like Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/country_table/a.html|title=CDC - Malaria - Travelers - Malaria Information and Prophylaxis, by Country|last=Prevention|first=CDC - Centers for Disease Control and|date=2018-01-26|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition===
In 2010, about 104 million children were underweight, and undernutrition contributes to about one third of child deaths around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Health Organization|work=Nutrition|title=Challenges|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/challenges/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Undernutrition is not to be confused with ''malnutrition'', which refers to poor ''proportion'' of food intake and can thus refer to obesity.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shetty | first=Prakash | title=Malnutrition and Undernutrition | journal=Medicine | series=Nutrition | year=2003 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357303906004786 | volume=31 | issue=4 | pages=18–22 | doi=10.1383/medc.31.4.18.27958 | issn=1357-3039 | quote=Malnutrition refers to all deviations from adequate and optimal nutritional status, including energy undernutrition and over-nutrition (obesity is a form of malnutrition).

===Violence against women===
{{Main|Domestic violence}}
[[Violence against women]] has been defined as: "physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family and in the general community, including battering, sexual abuse of children, dowry-related violence, rape, [[female genital mutilation]] and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women, forced prostitution and violence perpetrated or condoned by the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The United Nations Population Fund|year=2005|title=Violence Against Women Fact Sheet|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/presskit/factsheets/facts_vaw.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to causing injury, violence may increase "women’s long-term risk of a number of other health problems, including chronic pain, physical disability, drug and alcohol abuse, and depression".&lt;ref&gt;Ellsberg M, and Heise L. Researching Violence Against Women: A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists. Washington DC, United States: World Health Organization, PATH; 2005. Accessed September 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although statistics can be difficult to obtain as many cases go unreported, it is estimated that one in every five women faces some form of violence during her lifetime, in some cases leading to serious injury or even death.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. Addressing violence against women and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization; 2005. Retrieved from http://www.who.int/gender/documents/MDGs&amp;VAWSept05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors for being a perpetrator include low education, past exposure to child maltreatment or witnessing violence between parents, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes accepting of violence and gender inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2011|title=Violence against women: Intimate partner and sexual violence against women fact sheet|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equality of women has been addressed in the [[Millennium development goals]].

===Chronic disease===
{{Main|Non-communicable disease}}
Approximately 80% of deaths linked to non-communicable diseases occur in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=WHO: Global Status Report on Noncommunicable Diseases 2010|year=2011| url=http://www.who.int/nmh/publications/ncd_report2010/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;For instance, urbanization and aging have led to increasing poor health conditions related to non-communicable diseases in India. The fastest-growing causes of disease burden over the last 26 years were diabetes (rate increased by 80%) and ischemic heart disease (up 34%). More than 60% of deaths, about 6.1 million, in 2016 were due to NCDs, up from about 38% in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/comprehensive-health-study-india-finds-rise-non-communicable-diseases|title=Comprehensive health study in India finds rise of non-communicable diseases|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in refugee urbanization, has led to a growing number of people diagnosed with chronic noncommunicable diseases.&lt;ref name="amara"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Amara | first=Ahmed Hassan | last2=Aljunid | first2=Syed Mohamed | title=Noncommunicable diseases among urban refugees and asylum-seekers in developing countries: a neglected health care need | journal=Globalization and health | year=2014 | pmid=24708876 | pmc=3978000 | volume=10 | pages=24 | doi=10.1186/1744-8603-10-24 | issn=1744-8603 | url=http://www.globalizationandhealth.com/content/10/1/24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the United Nations is hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United Nations|title=Press Conference on General Assembly Decision to Convene Summit in September 2011 on Non-Communicable Diseases|location=New York|date=13 May 2010|url=https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs//2010/100513_Diseases.doc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that non-communicable diseases are the cause of some 35 million deaths each year, the international community is being increasingly called to take measures for the prevention and control of chronic diseases and mitigate their impacts on the world population, especially on women, who are usually the primary caregivers.

For example, the rate of [[Diabetes mellitus|type 2 diabetes]], associated with [[obesity]], has been on the rise in countries previously plagued by hunger. In low-income countries, the number of individuals with diabetes is expected to increase from 84 million to 228 million by 2030.&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hossain P, Kawar B, El Nahas M |title=Obesity and diabetes in the developing world—a growing challenge |journal=N.

About 16% of the global burden of disease, measured as DALYs, has been accounted for by obesity.&lt;ref name="nejm" /&gt;

Many populations face an "outcome gap", which refers to the gap between members of a population who have access to medical treatment versus those who do not. Countries facing outcome gaps lack sustainable infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farmer P |title=The major infectious diseases in the world—to treat or not to treat? |journal=N. Engl.

Journalist [[Laurie Garrett]] argues that the field of global health is not plagued by a lack of funds, but that more funds do not always translate into positive outcomes. The problem lies in the way these funds are allocated, as they are often disproportionately allocated to alleviating a single disease.&lt;ref name="Garrett, Laurie 2007"&gt;{{cite web|author=Garrett, Laurie|year=2007|title=The Challenge of Global Health|work=Foreign Affairs|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/62268/laurie-garrett/the-challenge-of-global-health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Health Security Agenda ==
The Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) is "a multilateral, multi-sector effort that includes 60 participating countries and numerous private and public international organizations focused on building up worldwide health security capabilities toward meeting such threats" as the spread of infectious disease. On March 26-28, 2018, the GHSA held its last high-level meeting which was located in Tbilisi, Georgia on biosurveillance of infectious disease threats, "which include such modern-day examples as HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis — any emerging or reemerging disease that threatens human health and global economic stability."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/27450-u-s-critical-juncture-global-health-security-agenda/|title=U.S. at critical juncture with Global Health Security Agenda|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2018-03-21|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2018-03-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event brought together GHSA partner countries, contributing countries of Real-Time Surveillance Action Package, and international partner organizations supporting the strengthening of capacities to detect infectious disease threats within the Real-Time Surveillance Action Package and other cross-cutting packages.

A '''global network''' is any [[communication network]] which spans the entire [[Earth]]. The term, as used in this article refers in a more restricted way to ''bidirectional'' communication networks, and to technology-based networks. Early networks such as [[international mail]] and unidirectional communication networks, such as [[radio network|radio]] and [[television network|television]], are described elsewhere.

The first global network was established using [[electrical telegraph]]y and global span was achieved in 1899. The [[public switched telephone network|telephony network]] was the second to achieve global status, in the 1950s. More recently, interconnected [[IP network]]s (principally the [[Internet]], with estimated 2.5 billion users worldwide in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;http://export.gov/northcarolina/build/groups/public/@eg_us_nc/documents/webcontent/komarketingpresentation065541.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[GSM]] [[mobile communication]] network (with over 6 billion worldwide users in 2014) form the largest global networks of all.

Setting up global networks requires immensely costly and lengthy efforts lasting for decades. Elaborate interconnections, [[Telephone exchange|switching]] and [[routing]] devices, laying out physical carriers of information, such as land and [[submarine communications cable|submarine cables]] and [[earth station]]s must be set in operation. In addition, international [[communication protocol]]s, legislation and agreements are involved.

Global networks might also refer to networks of individuals (such as [[Scientific collaboration network|scientists]]), communities (such as [[city network|cities]]) and organizations (such as [[Civil society#Global|civil organizations]]) worldwide which, for instance, might have formed for the management, mitigation and resolval of [[global issue]]s.

==Satellite global networks==

[[Communication satellite]]s are an important part of global networks. However, there are specific [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) global [[satellite constellation]]s, such as [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]], [[Globalstar]] and [[Orbcomm]], which are comprised by dozens of similar satellites which are put in orbit at regularly spaced positions and form a [[mesh network]], sometimes sending and receiving information directly among themselves. Using [[VSAT]] technology, [[satellite internet access]] has become possible.

==Mobile wireless networks==

It is estimated that 80% of the global mobile market uses the GSM standard, present in more than 212 countries and territories. Its [[wikt:ubiquity|ubiquity]] makes international [[roaming]] very common between mobile phone operators, enabling subscribers to use their phones in many parts of the world. In order to achieve this, these networks must be interconnected by way of [[peering]] arrangements, and therefore the GSM network is a truly global one.

==Network interconnection==

The telegraph and [[telex]] communication networks have been phased out, so [[interconnection]] among existing global networks arise at several points, such as between the voice [[telephony]] and digital [[data network]]s, and between these and satellite networks. Many applications run now on several networks, such as [[VoIP]] (voice over IP). [[Mobile communication]] (voice and data) networks are also intimately intertwinned, because the majority of 21st century [[cell phone]]s have both voice and data (internet navigation and [[email]]ing) capabilities.

Digital global networks require huge carrying capacity in the main [[internet backbone|backbone]]s. This is currently achieved by [[fiber optic cable]]s.

==Social and economic impact==
The Canadian [[sociologist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] was the first to forecast the huge impact of the matrix of global networks upon [[society]], coining the term [[global village (term)|global village]]. His work, however, related to radio and television networks, which are [[broadcast]] (unidirectional) networks, thus predating the much larger impact of the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Harasim, L. (Ed.) - [https://books.google.com/books?id=9RAnJzaiqvMC Global Networks: Computers and International Networks, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

Global networks have revolutionized human communication several times. The first to do so was the electrical telegraph. Its impact was so large that it has been dubbed the [[Victorian Internet]]. It was expanded many times in its coverage with the advent of [[radiotelegraphy]], and with text messaging using [[telex]] machines.

The Internet and mobile communication networks have made possible entirely new forms of [[social interaction]], activities and organizing, thanks to its basic features such as widespread [[usability]] and access, and instant communication from any connected point to another. Thus, its [[Internet#Social impact|social impact]] has been, and still is, enormous. Finally, the impact on governance have been significant facilitating the emergence of 'transnational policy networks' &lt;ref&gt;Stone, Diane. Knowledge actors and transnational governance: The private-public policy nexus in the global agora. Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza''' in [[bird]]s is considered a significant [[Influenza pandemic|pandemic]] threat.

While other [[H5N1]] influenza &lt;ref&gt;http://www.yangtse.com/epaper/yzwb/2007-06/28/content_9354072.htm&lt;/ref&gt; strains are known, they are significantly different from a current, highly pathogenic H5N1 strain on a genetic level, making the global spread of this new strain unprecedented. The H5N1 strain is a [[Mutation|fast-mutating]], highly [[pathogen]]ic [[avian influenza]] virus (HPAI) found in multiple bird species. It is both epizootic (an epidemic in non-humans) and panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species especially over a wide area). Unless otherwise indicated, "H5N1" in this [[timeline]] refers to the recent highly pathogenic strain of H5N1.

"Since 1997, studies of H5N1 influenza indicate that these viruses continue to evolve, with changes in antigenicity and internal [[gene]] constellations; an expanded host range in avian species and the ability to infect [[Felidae|felids]]; enhanced pathogenicity in experimentally infected [[mouse|mice]] and ferrets, in which they cause systemic infections; and increased environmental stability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{H5N1 case graph}}
Tens of millions of birds have died of [[H5N1]] influenza and hundreds of millions of birds have been slaughtered and disposed of, to limit the spread of H5N1. Countries that have reported one or more major highly pathogenic H5N1 outbreaks in birds (causing at least thousands but in some cases millions of dead birds) are (in order of first outbreak occurrence): [[South Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Indonesia]], [[China]], [[Malaysia]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Croatia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Cyprus]], [[Iraq]], [[Nigeria]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[France]], [[Niger]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Albania]], [[Cameroon]], [[Myanmar]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Israel]], [[Pakistan]], [[Jordan]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Germany]], [[Sudan]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Djibouti]], [[Hungary]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Ghana]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Togo]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bhutan]].

{{H5N1}}
Highly pathogenic H5N1 has been found in birds in the wild in numerous other countries: [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Denmark]], [[Greece]], [[Iran]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and [[Switzerland]]. Surveillance of [[H5N1]] in humans, poultry, wild birds, cats and other animals remains very weak in many parts of Asia and Africa. Much remains unknown about the exact extent of its spread.

H5N1 has low pathogenic varieties [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in [[bird]]s in North America. H5N1 has a highly pathogenic variety that is endemic in dozens of species of birds throughout south [[Asia]] and parts of [[Africa]]. So far, it is very difficult for [[human]]s to become infected with H5N1. The presence of highly pathogenic (deadly) H5N1 around the world in both birds in the wild ([[swan]]s, [[magpie]]s, [[duck]]s, [[geese]], [[pigeon]]s, [[eagle]]s, etc.) and in [[chicken]]s and [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]] on farms has been demonstrated in millions of cases with the [[virus]] isolate actually [[Sequencing|sequenced]] in hundreds of cases yielding definitive proof of the [[evolution]] of this strain of this subtype of the species [[Influenzavirus A]] (bird flu virus).

According to [[Robert G. Webster]]:
{{quote|The epicenters of both the [[H2N2#Asian flu|Asian influenza pandemic]] of 1957 and the [[H3N2#Hong Kong Flu|Hong Kong influenza pandemic]] of 1968 were in Southeast Asia, and it is in this region that multiple clades of H5N1 influenza virus have already emerged. The Asian H5N1 virus was first detected in [[Guangdong Province]], China, in 1996, when it killed some geese, but it received little attention until it spread through live-poultry markets in Hong Kong to humans in May 1997, killing 6 of 18 infected people. [...] From 1997 to May 2005, H5N1 viruses were largely confined to Southeast Asia, but after they had infected wild birds in Qinghai Lake, China, they rapidly spread westward. [...] The intermittent spread to humans will continue, and the virus will continue to evolve.[http://content.nejm.org/content/vol355/issue21/images/large/03f1.jpeg Map]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As of the July 25, 2008 [[FAO]] Avian Influenza Disease Emergency Situation Update, H5N1 [[pathogenicity]] is continuing to gradually rise in endemic areas but the avian influenza disease situation in farmed birds is being held in check by vaccination. Eleven outbreaks of H5N1 were reported worldwide in June 2008 in five countries (China, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) compared to 65 outbreaks in June 2006 and 55 in June 2007. The "global HPAI situation can be said to have
improved markedly in the first half of 2008 [but] cases of HPAI are still underestimated and underreported in many countries because of limitations in country disease surveillance systems".&lt;ref name="fao.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//246457/aj097e00.pdf|title=July 25, 2008 FAO Avian Influenza Disease Emergency Situation Update|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These strains were somewhat similar to the current pathogenic strain of H5N1 in two of its ten genes, the gene that causes it to be type H5 and the gene that causes it to be N1. The other genes can and have been [[reassortment|reassorted]] from other subtypes of the bird flu species (their ease at exchanging genes is part of what makes them all one species). [[Evolution]] by reassortment of H5N1 from 1999 to 2002 created the Z genotype which became the dominant strain of highly pathogenic H5N1 in 2004 and is now spreading across the entire world in both wild and domestic birds.

===2004===
{{main|Global spread of H5N1 in 2004}}

In January 2004 a major new outbreak of [[H5N1]] surfaced in [[Vietnam]] and [[Thailand]]'s [[poultry]] industry, and within weeks spread to ten countries and regions in [[Asia]], including [[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[China]]. In October 2004 researchers discovered [[H5N1]] is far more dangerous than previously believed because [[waterfowl]], especially [[duck]]s, were directly spreading the highly pathogenic strain of [[H5N1]] to [[chicken]]s, [[crow]]s, [[pigeon]]s, and other birds and that it was increasing its ability to infect mammals as well. From this point on, [[avian influenza]] experts increasingly refer to containment as a strategy that can delay but not prevent a future avian flu pandemic.

===2005===
[[Image:Avian influenza spread map.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The spread of avian influenza in the eastern hemisphere.]]
{{main|Global spread of H5N1 in 2005}}

In January 2005 an outbreak of avian influenza affected thirty three out of sixty four cities and provinces in [[Vietnam]], leading to the forced killing of nearly 1.2 million poultry. Up to 140 million birds are believed to have died or been killed because of the outbreak. In April 2005 there begins an unprecedented die-off of over 6,000 migratory birds at [[Qinghai Lake]] in central [[China]] over three months. This strain of H5N1 is the same strain as is spread west by migratory birds over at least the next ten months. In August 2005 H5N1 spread to [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Russia]]. On September 29, 2005, [[David Nabarro]], the newly appointed Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza, warned the world that an outbreak of avian influenza could kill 5 to 150 million people. David Nabarro later stated that as the virus had spread to migratory birds, an outbreak could start in [[Africa]] or the [[Middle East]]. Later in 2005 H5N1 spread to [[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Croatia]] and [[Kuwait]].

===2006===
{{main|Global spread of H5N1 in 2006}}
* In the first two months of 2006 H5N1 spread to other [[Asia]]n countries (such as [[Bird flu in India|India]]), north [[Africa]], and [[Europe]] in wild bird populations possibly signaling the beginning of [[H5N1]] being endemic in wild migratory bird populations on multiple continents for decades, permanently changing the way [[poultry]] are [[farm]]ed.
* By April 2006 scientists had concluded that containment had failed due to the role of wild [[bird]]s in transmitting the virus and were now emphasizing far more comprehensive risk mitigation and management measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2006 [[WHO]] predicted an upsurge in human deaths due to H5N1 during late 2006 or early 2007 following a summer/fall lull in most countries, as H5N1 appears to be somewhat seasonal in nature. In July and August 2006 significantly increased numbers of bird deaths due to H5N1 were recorded in [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Laos]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Thailand]] while continuing unabated a rate unparalleled in [[Indonesia]].
* In June, there was a human outbreak in Indonesia when 8 members of a family in [[Sumatra]] became infected and 7 died. The WHO reported that this may have been the first recorded instance of human-to-human transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Protecting Poultry Workers from Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) (2008-128)|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2008-128/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September, [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] joined the list of nations seeing a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1.
* In November and December, [[South Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] joined the list of nations seeing a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1.

===2007===
{{main|Global spread of H5N1 in 2007}}
In January, [[Japan]], [[Hungary]], [[Russia]], and the [[United Kingdom]] joined the list of nations seeing a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1. In February, [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Myanmar]] joined the list and [[Kuwait]] saw its first major outbreak of [[H5N1]] [[avian influenza]].

In March [[Bangladesh]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] each saw their first major outbreak of [[H5N1]] [[avian influenza]] and [[Ghana]] in May.

As H5N1 continued killing many birds and a few people throughout the spring in countries where it is now endemic, in June [[Malaysia]] and [[Germany]] saw a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1, while the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Togo]] experienced their first major outbreak of [[H5N1]] [[avian influenza]].

In July [[France]] and [[India]] also saw a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1.

====July====
As of the July 25, 2008 [[FAO]] Avian Influenza Disease Emergency Situation Update, H5N1 [[pathogenicity]] is continuing to gradually rise in wild birds in endemic areas but the avian influenza disease situation in farmed birds is being held in check by vaccination. Eleven outbreaks of H5N1 were reported worldwide in June 2008 in five countries (China, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) compared to 65 outbreaks in June 2006 and 55 in June 2007. The "global HPAI situation can be said to have
improved markedly in the first half of 2008 [but] cases of HPAI are still underestimated and underreported in many countries because of limitations in country disease surveillance systems".&lt;ref name="fao.org"/&gt;

Over 150 chickens died in the Indian border town, 35&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Kankarbhitta. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives declared the area surrounding Sharanamati a "bird-flu affected area" and increased surveillance along the border. A Rapid Response Team (RRT) was dispatched to control the virus. The government also banned the transportation of poultry products throughout the country. The first outbreak was confirmed in Kankarbhitta on January 16. 28,000 chickens were killed in the area to control the virus. Earlier, Agriculture Minister Jayprakash Gupta asked the international community and donor agencies to provide help to Nepal fight the disease.

==''Suidae'' (Pigs)==
[[Image:Sow with piglet.jpg|thumb|right|Pigs can harbor influenza viruses adapted to humans and others that are adapted to birds, allowing the viruses to exchange genes and create a pandemic strain.]]
Avian influenza virus [[H3N2]] is endemic in [[pig]]s ("[[swine flu]]") in [[China]] and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. Health experts say pigs can carry human [[influenza]] viruses, which can combine (i.e. exchange homologous genome sub-units by genetic [[reassortment]]) with [[H5N1]], passing [[gene]]s and mutating into a form which can pass easily among humans. [[H3N2]] evolved from [[H2N2]] by [[antigenic shift]] and caused the [[Hong Kong Flu]] pandemic of 1968 and 1969 that killed up to 750,000 humans. The dominant strain of annual [[flu]] in humans in January 2006 is [[H3N2]]. Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]] in H3N2 in humans has increased to 91% in 2005. A combination of these two subtypes of the species known as the [[avian influenza]] virus in a country like [[China]] is a worst-case scenario. In August 2004, researchers in [[China]] found [[H5N1]] in pigs.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

In 2005, it was discovered that [[H5N1]] "could be infecting up to half of the pig population in some areas of [[Indonesia]], but without causing symptoms [...] Chairul Nidom, a virologist at [[Airlangga University]]'s tropical disease center in [[Surabaya]], Java, was conducting independent research earlier this year. He tested the blood of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in western Java where avian flu had broken out, ''Nature'' reported. Five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus. The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region, Nature reported. Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/may2705avflu.html CIDRAP] article ''Indonesian pigs have avian flu virus; bird cases double in China'' published May 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Felidae'' (cats)==
[[Image:Cat03.jpg|thumb|right|Domestic cats can get H5N1 from eating birds, and can transmit it to other cats and possibly to people.]]

"In Bangkok, [[Thailand]], all the cats in one household are known to have died of [[H5N1]] in 2004. [[Tiger]]s and [[leopard]]s in Thai [[zoo]]s also died, while in 2007 two cats near an outbreak in poultry and people in [[Iraq]] were confirmed to have died of H5N1, as were three [[Germany|German]] cats that ate wild birds. In [[Austria]], cats were infected but remained healthy". Cats in [[Indonesia]] were also found to have been infected with H5N1.&lt;ref name="Chairul Nidom"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325883.800-deadly-h5n1-may-be-brewing-in-cats.html New Scientist] article ''Deadly H5N1 may be brewing in cats'' published January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread to more and more types and populations of birds and the ability of [[felidae]] (cats) to catch [[H5N1]] from eating this natural prey means the creation of a reservoir for H5N1 in cats where the virus can adapt to mammals is one of the many possible pathways to a [[pandemic]].

===August 2006===
It was announced in the August 2006 CDC EID journal that while literature describing HPAI H5N1 infection in cats had been limited to a subset of clade I viruses; a Qinghai-like virus (they are genetically distinct from other clade II viruses) killed up to five cats and 51 chickens from February 3 to 5, 2006 in Grd Jotyar (~10&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Arbil|Erbil City]], Iraq). Two of the cats were available for examination.

:"An influenza A H5 virus was present in multiple organs in all species from the outbreak site in Grd Jotyar (Table). cDNA for sequencing was amplified directly from RNA extracts from pathologic materials without virus isolation. On the basis of sequence analysis of the full HA1 gene and 219 amino acids of the HA2 gene, the viruses from the goose and 1 cat from Grd Jotyar and from the person who died from Sarcapcarn (sequence derived from PCR amplification from first-passage egg material) are &gt;99% identical at the nucleotide and amino acid levels (GenBank nos. DQ435200–02). Thus, no indication of virus adaptation to cats was found. The viruses from Iraq are most closely related to currently circulating Qinghai-like viruses, but when compared with A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/65/2005 (H5N1) (GenBank no. DQ095622), they share only 97.4% identity at the nucleic acid level with 3 amino acid substitutions of unknown significance. On the other hand, the virus from the cat is only 93.4% identical to A/tiger/Thailand/CU-T4/2004(H5N1) (GenBank no. AY972539). These results are not surprising, given that these strains are representative of different clades (8,9). Sequencing of 1,349 bp of the N gene from cat 1 and the goose (to be submitted to GenBank) show identity at the amino acid level, and that the N genes of viruses infecting the cat and goose are &gt;99% identical to that of A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/65/2005(H5N1). These findings support the notion that cats may be broadly susceptible to circulating H5N1 viruses and thus may play a role in reassortment, antigenic drift, and transmission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

"Chairul Anwar Nidom of [[Airlangga University]] in Surabaya, [[Indonesia]], told journalists last week that he had taken blood samples from 500 stray cats near poultry markets in four areas of [[Java]], including the capital, [[Jakarta]], and one area in [[Sumatra]], all of which have recently had outbreaks of [[H5N1]] in [[poultry]] and people. Of these cats, 20% carried [[antibodies]] to H5N1. This does not mean that they were still carrying the virus, only that they had been infected - probably through eating birds that had H5N1. Many other cats that were infected are likely to have died from the resulting illness, so many more than 20% of the original cat populations may have acquired H5N1."&lt;ref name="Chairul Nidom"/&gt;

People living in areas where the A(H5N1) virus has infected birds are advised to keep their cats indoors. "Cats can be infected through the respiratory tract. Cats can also be infected when they ingest the virus, which is a novel route for influenza transmission in mammals. But cats excrete only one-thousandth the amount of virus that chickens do [...] The concern is that if large numbers of felines and other carnivores become infected, the virus might mutate in a series of events that could lead to an epidemic among humans. Dogs, foxes, seals, and other carnivores may be vulnerable to A(H5N1) virus infection, Dr. Osterhaus said. Tests in Thailand have shown that the virus has infected dogs without causing apparent symptoms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

H5N1 has the potential to infect [[cattle]]. Asymptomatic shedding of H5N1 by infected calves and subsequent seroconversion is possible. Bird-to-calf transmission resulting in seroconversion is probable. While the incidence of clinical infections of cattle with H5N1 in H5N1 endemic regions should be low, "serum from [[bovine]] species would be a valuable source of additional information about transmission events, especially in regions like Asia and Egypt, where HPAIV (H5N1) is endemic and probability of contact between poultry and cattle is high."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/14/7/1132.htm Emerg Infect Dis] article ''Experimental Infection of Cattle with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus (H5N1)'' published  July 2008 - Suggested Citation for this Article: "Kalthoff D, Hoffmann B, Harder T, Durban M, Beer M.

*April 2013 FISC Order demanding that Verizon hand over all telephony metadata to NSA. The order had been initially granted in May 2006. In 2009 the FISC discovered that the government had made repeated and substantial misrepresentations to the court about its use, and had routinely been "running queries of the metadata using querying terms that did not meet the required standard for querying." It further concluded that the violations had been routine and systematic.&lt;ref name="FiscPrivacyRuling2011a"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/fisc_opinion_-_unconstitutional_surveillance_0.pdf|page=16|date=October 3, 2011|author=John D Bates|title=[redacted]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*March 2009 FISC ruling showing a consistent pattern of misrepresentations of the bulk telephone metadata collection program by the government to the Court. It also held that the data was being routinely queried in ways that did not meet "reasonable articulatable suspicion", demonstrating inadequate safeguards in the software and training of analysts. Showing that "thousands of violations resulted from the use of identifiers that were not "RAS-approved by analysts who were not even aware that they were accessing BR metadata," and that in 2006 "there was no single person [in the NSA] who had a complete understanding of the BR FISA system architecture," a situation which persisted until February 2009 or later. RAS is shorthand for Reasonable Articulatable Suspicion. The Court nonetheless reapproved the collection of bulk phone metadata, while mandating additional safeguards and training, and "end-to-end system engineering reviews," and reports from the review.

The data has not been scrubbed to eliminate US persons, it asks Israel not to deliberately target US persons, however the agreement allows Israel to retain US person data for one full year.

The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. And further he ruled that, when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment. He also concluded that the controlling precedent is [[Smith v. Maryland]]: "Smith's bedrock holding is that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information provided to third parties," Judge Pauley wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Upholds N.S.A.'s Bulk Collection of Data on Calls|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/us/nsa-phone-surveillance-is-lawful-federal-judge-rules.html?ref=us&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=28 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 December 2013|author1=Adam Liptak |author2=Michael S.

*Extracts from reports relating to [[XKeyscore]]. One entitled "Tales from the Land of [[Brothers Grimm]]" and others detailing the successes of said software, another is a note from an analyst who felt that he always had one foot in prison when using it. XKeyscore is also described as "big and scary, strong and powerful" and lets an analyst do whatever they like.&lt;ref name =Spiegel3/&gt;

*Numerous reports relating to drones, including "Threats to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles", a report summarizing attempts to shoot down, intercept, control or otherwise spoof drones. While the report details vulnerabilities of specific aircraft, the document itself has not been published, but only excerpts described. Other reports detail American spin efforts, suggesting that the phrases "drone strike," "kill list," "robot warfare," "Aerial Assassins" be avoided, offering "lethal UAV operations" instead, and also terms like "Pre-emptive and Preventive Military Action" and "Inherent Right of Self Defense." Likewise, reports detail efforts by Al-Qaeda to spin, portraying attacks as cowardly and immoral. Analysts also questioned whether America was losing rhetorical battle in courts, media, and public opinion. Another report stated that drone strikes "could be brought under increased scrutiny, perceived to be illegitimate, openly resisted or undermined."&lt;ref name="wapo20130903"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-documents-detail-al-qaedas-efforts-to-fight-back-against-drones/2013/09/03/b83e7654-11c0-11e3-b630-36617ca6640f_story_3.html|title=U.S. documents detail al-Qaeda's efforts to fight back against drones|authors= Craig Whitlock and Barton Gellman|date=September 3, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2013|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suggested protective measures from surveillance ==

=== Encryption ===
In [[cryptography]], [[encryption]] is the process of encoding information in such a way that eavesdroppers or hackers cannot read it, but that authorized parties can. According to Snowden's recommendations published by ''The Guardian Edward'' in September 2013,&lt;ref name="Encryp" /&gt; properly implemented strong [[Cryptosystem|crypto systems]] were among the few things which one can rely on. However, [[Communication endpoint|endpoint]] security is often too weak to prevent the [[NSA]] from finding ways around it.&lt;ref name="Encryp"&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA surveillance: A guide to staying secure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underground bunkers ===
In September 2013, it was reported by the press that a number of countries deemed by the US and its allies to be [[rogue state]]s, such as [[Syria]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]], had successfully evaded U.S. government surveillance by constructing secret bunkers deep below the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|last=Narayan Lakshman|title=Secret bunkers, a challenge for U.S. intelligence|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/secret-bunkers-a-challenge-for-us-intelligence/article5164833.ece?ref=relatedNews|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|accessdate=September 24, 2013|location=Chennai, India|date=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]]'s underground megaproject, the [[816 Nuclear Military Plant]] in [[Chongqing]] (now declassified and opened to tourists), was reported to be "most worrying" for the U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;

[[Libya]] evaded surveillance by building "hardened and buried" bunkers at least 40 feet below ground level.&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;

'''Globalization''' [[-ise vs -ize|or]] '''[[wiktionary:globalisation#English|globalisation]]''' is the process  of [[foreign relations|interaction]] and integration between people, companies, and governments [[world]]wide. Globalization has grown due to advances in [[transportation]] and [[communication]] technology. With increased global interactions comes the growth of international [[trade]], [[idea]]s, and [[culture]]. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, [[wiktionary:conflict|conflicts]] and [[diplomacy]] are also large parts of the [[history of globalization]], and modern globalization.

Economically, globalization involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology, and data.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;Albrow, Martin and Elizabeth King (eds.) (1990).

In 2000, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: [[trade]] and [[Financial transaction|transactions]], [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[investment]] movements, [[Human migration|migration]] and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"&gt;International Monetary Fund .

==Etymology and usage==
The term ''globalization'' derives from the word ''globalize'', which refers to the emergence of an international network of economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=globalization|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest known usages of the term as a noun was in a 1930 publication entitled ''Towards New Education'', where it denoted a holistic view of human experience in education.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50297775?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Globalization&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|date=September 2009|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'globalization' had been used in its economic sense at least as early as 1981, and in other senses since at least as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/06levitt.html | title=Theodore Levitt, 81, Who Coined the Term 'Globalization', Is Dead | date=6 July 2006 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=Feder, Barnaby J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Levitt is credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later half of the 1980s. Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations. Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and [[empire]] across [[Asia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] from the 15th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G. (ed.). (2004). ''Globalization in World History.'' London: Norton, pp. 4–8. {{ISBN|978-0393979428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakari13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakari|first=Mohamed El-Kamel|title=Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?|journal=New Global Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=23–56|issn=1940-0004|doi=10.1515/ngs-2013-021|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the complexity of the concept, various research projects, articles, and discussions often stay focused on a single aspect of globalization.&lt;ref name="GCSP"&gt;Al-Rodhan, R.F. Nayef and Gérard Stoudmann. (2006). [http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf Definitions of the Globalization: A Comprehensive Overview and a Proposed Definition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119215401/http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] [[Martin Albrow]] and Elizabeth King define globalization as "all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society."&lt;ref name="Albrow" /&gt; In ''The Consequences of Modernity'', [[Anthony Giddens]] writes: "Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide [[social relation]]s which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony. (1991). ''The Consequences of Modernity'' Cambridge: Polity Press. p. 64. {{ISBN|9780745609232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Roland Robertson]], professor of sociology at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and an early writer in the field, described globalization as "the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization : social theory and global culture|last=Robertson|first=Roland|publisher=Sage|year=1992|isbn=0803981872|edition= Reprint.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Global Transformations'', [[David Held]] and his co-writers state:
{{quote|text=Although in its simplistic sense globalization refers to the widening, deepening and speeding up of global interconnection, such a definition begs further elaboration. ... Globalization can be on a continuum with the local, national and regional. At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions. Globalization can refer to those spatial-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents. Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term. ... A satisfactory definition of globalization must capture each of these elements: extensity (stretching), intensity, velocity and impact.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David; Goldblatt, David; McGrew, Anthony; Perraton, Jonathan (1999). ''Global Transformations'' Cambridge: Polity Press. {{ISBN|9780745614984}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=|}}

Held and his co-writers' definition of globalization in that same book as "transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions—assessed in terms of their extensity, intensity, velocity and impact—generating transcontinental or inter-regional flows" was called "probably the most widely-cited definition" in the 2014 [[Pankaj Ghemawat|DHL Global Connectiveness Index]].&lt;ref name="DHL"/&gt;

Swedish journalist Thomas Larsson, in his book ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'', states that globalization:
{{quote|is the process of world shrinkage, of distances getting shorter, things moving closer. It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact, to mutual benefit, with somebody on the other side of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Thomas. (2001). ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'' Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute. p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1930865150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines globalization with a more direct and historically contextualized emphasis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Globalization is the extension of social relations across world-space, defining that world-space in terms of the historically variable ways that it has been practiced and socially understood through changing world-time.&lt;ref name=James2005&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2005 | last=James |first=Paul | title=  ‘Arguing Globalizations: Propositions Towards an Investigation of Global Formation’ | url= https://www.academia.edu/5246805/Arguing_Globalizations_Propositions_Towards_an_Investigation_of_Global_Formation | journal= Globalizations | volume= 2 | issue=  2 | pages=193–209 | doi=10.1080/14747730500202206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Manfred Steger]], professor of [[global studies]] and research leader in the [[Global Cities Institute]] at [[RMIT University]], identifies four main empirical [[dimensions of globalization]]: economic, political, cultural, and [[Ecology|ecological]]. A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four. The ideological dimension, according to Steger, is filled with a range of [[Norm (social)|norms]], claims, beliefs, and narratives about the phenomenon itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last=Steger|first=Manfred|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955226-9|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Steger stated that the concept of globalization "emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of '[[Community of practice|communities of practice]]' ([[Étienne Wenger|Wenger]], 1998): academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians."&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;{{Rp|424}} They note the term was used "in education to describe the global life of the mind"; in [[international relations]] to describe the extension of the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]]; and in journalism to describe how the "American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt; They have also argued that four different forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions.&lt;ref name=James2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=‘Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies’|url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113/Levels_of_Subjective_Globalization_Ideologies_Imaginaries_Ontologies|journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|volume=12|issue=1–2|author1=Manfred B. Steger|author2=Paul James}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people. A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and [[Polity|polities]], including [[Imperialism|imperial]] agents. Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of [[Commodity|commodities]] and other objects of exchange. He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization. James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how, today, the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of [[refugee]]s and [[Immigration|migrants]] are increasingly restricted, while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most [[Deregulation|deregulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|title=‘Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens’|url=https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens|journal=Citizenship Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=208–23|doi=10.1080/13621025.2014.886440|pmid=|access-date=|via=|last1=James|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] popularized the term [[The World Is Flat|"flat world"]], arguing that [[Global trade|globalized trade]], [[outsourcing]], [[supply chain|supply-chaining]], and political forces had permanently changed the world, for better and worse. He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. "The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention". ''Emerging: A Reader.'' Ed. Barclay Barrios. Boston: Bedford, St. Martins, 2008. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] defined "economic globalization" as the opening and deregulation of [[Commodity market|commodity]], [[Capital market|capital]], and [[Labour economics|labor markets]] that led toward present [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization. He used "political globalization" to refer to the emergence of a transnational [[élite]] and a phasing out of the [[nation-state]]. Meanwhile, he used "cultural globalization" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture. Other of his usages included "[[Ideology|ideological]] globalization", "[[Technology|technological]] globalization", and "social globalization".&lt;ref&gt;Fotopoulos, Takis. (2001). "Globalization, the reformist Left and the Anti-Globalization 'Movement.'" [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/dn/vol7/takis_globalisation.htm ''Democracy &amp; Nature: The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', 7:(2) (July 2001).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lechner and Boli (2012) define globalization as more people across large distances becoming connected in more and different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner,  Frank J. and John Boli (eds.) (2011). ''The Globalization Reader.'' New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Globophobia" is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the [[balloon phobia|fear of balloons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henwood|first1=Doug|title=Beyond Globophobia|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/beyond-globophobia|work=[[The Nation]]|date=1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Ross|title=Globophobia|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/12049/globophobia-17/|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=20 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor=George Ritzer|editorlink=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XKnmvRATtfAC|page=16}}|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of globalization}}
{{See also|Timeline of international trade}}

There are both [[Proximate and ultimate causation|distal and proximate causes]] which can be traced in the historical factors affecting globalization. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Rourke |first=Kevin H. |first2=Jeffrey G. |last2=Williamson |year=2002 |title=When Did Globalization Begin? |journal=European Review of Economic History |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=23–50 |doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaic===
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The 13th century world-system, as described by [[Janet Abu-Lughod]]]]
{{Main|Archaic globalization}}

Archaic globalization conventionally refers to a phase in the history of globalization including globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly the 1600s. This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and [[State (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.&lt;ref name="M 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how [[Western world|Western states]] have adapted and implemented learned principles from the [[Eastern world|East]].&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and certain parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own [[Production (economics)|production]] and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt;

Also posited is a "multi-polar" nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, where [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of [[industrial production]] and [[Output (economics)|economic output]], archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal [[China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans Köchler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], 17th-century Japanese [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]]]]

The German [[Economic history|historical economist]] and sociologist [[Andre Gunder Frank]] argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the third millennium [[Common Era|B.C.E.]]  This archaic globalization existed during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]], when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture that reached from [[India]] to [[Spain]], including [[Alexandria]] and the other [[Alexander the Great|Alexandrine]] cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of [[import]]ing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade. Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09"&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. (1998). ''ReOrient: Global economy in the Asian age.''

Trade on the [[Silk Road]] was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China, [[South Asian history|Indian subcontinent]], [[Persia]], Europe, and [[Arabia]], opening long-distance political and economic interactions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and [[religion]]s, [[syncretic]] philosophies, and various technologies, as well as [[disease]]s, also traveled along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people, such as refugees, artists, craftsmen, [[Missionary|missionaries]], robbers, and envoys, resulted in the exchange of religions, art, [[language]]s, and new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/legacy-silk-road | title = The Legacy of the Silk Road | publisher = Yale Global | date = 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
{{Main|Proto-globalization}}

"[[Early modern period|Early modern]]-" or "proto-globalization" covers a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800. The concept of "proto-globalization" was first introduced by [[historian]]s [[A. G. Hopkins]] and [[Christopher Bayly]]. The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high "modern globalization" in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G., ed., 2003. Globalization in World History. New York City, NY: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-97942-3}} pp. 4–5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s, and later the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire]]s. In the 17th century, world trade developed further when [[Chartered company|chartered companies]] like the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602, often described as the first [[multinational corporation]] in which [[stock]] was offered) were established.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, K.N. (1965\1999). ''The English East India Company: The Study of an Early Joint-stock Company 1600–1640 (Vol. 4).'' London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of [[expansionism]], the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the rise of newfound commodities—most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s concept of the [[Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process. European, [[Muslim]], Indian, [[Southeast Asia]]n, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.

===Modern===
According to economic historians Kevin H. O'Rourke, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, and Guillaume Daudin, several factors promoted globalization in the period 1815-1870:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-economic-history-of-modern-europe/trade-and-empire/BE789F27408634F4749D61F013897C04|title=Trade and empire (Chapter 4) - The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|pages=100–101|language=en|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars brought in an era of relative peace in Europe.
* Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.

During the 19th century, globalization approached its form as a direct result of the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] allowed [[standardization|standardized]] production of household items using [[economies of scale]] while rapid [[population growth]] created sustained [[demand]] for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transport significantly and [[railroads]] made inland transportation cheaper. The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; More nations embraced [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] such as in [[Scramble for Africa|Africa]] and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]]. The invention of [[shipping container]]s in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/how-the-invention-of-a-box-changed-our-world/2006/06/11/1149964409162.html%0A|title=How the invention of a box changed our world – Business – smh.com.au|last=Gittins|first=Ross|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], work by politicians led to the agreements of the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], in which major governments laid down the framework for [[International monetary systems|international monetary policy]], commerce, and finance, and the founding of several [[international institution]]s intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering [[trade barrier]]s. Initially, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process. Exports nearly doubled from 8.5% of total gross world product in 1970 to 16.2% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | title = World Exports as Percentage of Gross World Product | publisher=[[Global Policy Forum]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712023541/http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | archivedate = 12 July 2008 | accessdate =11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the [[Doha Development Round]] of trade negotiation. Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 [[South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement]].

Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to [[middle class]]es in [[developed countries]]. [[Open skies]] policies and [[low-cost carrier]]s have helped to bring [[Competition (economics)|competition]] to the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between different countries. More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location. This included accounting, software development, and engineering design.

[[Student exchange program]]s became popular after [[World War II]], and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.&lt;ref name=varghese/&gt;

NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[revolutions of 1989]] and subsequent [[liberalization]] in many parts of the world resulted in a significant expansion of global interconnectedness. The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process. In the period between 1965 and 1990, the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled. Most migration occurred between the [[Developing country|developing countries]] and [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs).&lt;ref name =Saggi2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saggi | first1 = Kamal | year = 2002 | title = Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and International Technology Transfer: A Survey | url = | journal = World Bank Research Observer | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 191–235 | doi = 10.1093/wbro/17.2.191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy.

Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-[[border]] movement of goods, services, technology, and capital.&lt;ref name="Joshi, Rakesh Mohan 2009"&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2009) International Business, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-568909-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as [[tariff]]s, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing [[economic integration]] between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, T: "Year 12 Economics", p. 9. Tim Riley Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality. Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace. Economic globalization also includes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864808614|title=International business: competing in the global marketplace|last=Hill|first=Charles W.

Current globalization trends can be largely accounted for by developed economies integrating with less developed economies by means of [[foreign direct investment]], the reduction of trade barriers as well as other economic reforms, and, in many cases, [[immigration]].

[[International standard]]s have made trade in goods and services more efficient. An example of such standard is the [[intermodal container]]. [[Containerization]] dramatically reduced transport of its costs, supported the post-war boom in [[international trade]], and was a major element in globalization.&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|title=Sample Chapter for Levinson, M.: The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger.|last=Levinson|first=Marc|work=[[The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=17 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122131825/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Organization for Standardization]] is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national [[standards organizations]].

A [[free-trade area]] is the region encompassing a [[trade bloc]] whose member countries have signed a [[Free trade|free-trade]] agreement (FTA).

If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an [[open border]].
Arguably the most significant free-trade area in the world is the [[European Union]], a [[Political union|politico]]-[[economic union]] of [[Member state of the European Union|{{EUnum}} member states]] that are primarily located in [[Europe]]. The EU has developed [[European Single Market]] through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states.

[[Trade facilitation]] looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximise efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives.

Global trade in services is also significant. For example, in [[India]], [[business process outsourcing]] has been described as the "primary engine of the country's development over the next few decades, contributing broadly to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth, employment growth, and poverty alleviation".&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuruvilla |first=Sarosh |last2=Ranganathan |first2=Aruna |title=Economic Development Strategies And Macro- And Micro-Level Human Resource Policies: The Case Of India's "Outsourcing" Industry|journal=Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review|date=October 2008|volume=62|issue=1|pages=39–72|ref=harv |doi=10.1177/001979390806200103|url=http://ilr.sagepub.com/content/62/1/39.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15777592?story_id=E1_TVSSSVJN|accessdate=16 April 2011|title=Outsourcing to Africa: The world economy calls &amp;#124; The Economist|date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William I. Robinson]]'s theoretical approach to globalization is a critique of Wallerstein's World Systems Theory.  He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s.  Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|journal=International Sociology|volume=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One important aspect of Robinson's globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global.  This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six different countries, each contributing to a part of the production process.

{{Main|Cultural globalization}}

Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Paul|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, [[popular culture]] media, and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B. Steger, eds, [https://uws.academia.edu/PaulJames Globalization and Culture: Vol. 4, Ideologies of Globalism], Sage Publications, London, 2010.  {{Cite book|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|last1=Inda|first1=Jonathan|last2=Rosaldo|first2=Renato|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|chapter=Introduction: A World in Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-cultural communication]] is a field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavour to communicate across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.

[[Cultural diffusion]] is the spread of [[culture|cultural]] items—such as [[idea]]s, [[fashion|styles]], [[religion]]s, [[technology|technologies]], [[contact linguistics|languages]] etc.
Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities. For example, [[sushi]] is available in Germany as well as Japan, but [[Disneyland Paris|Euro-Disney]] outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for "authentic" French pastry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v25n3/globalization.pdf |title=Globalization and Culture |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |last2=Barber |first2=Benjamin |journal=Cato Policy Report |date=May–June 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India].

Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture, particularly via the Internet and satellite television.

Religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, [[evangelism|evangelists]], imperialists, and traders. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and more recently sects such as [[Mormonism]] are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins.&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Elizabeth. 2005.

The term globalization implies transformation. Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments. Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Thomas. 2004.

Music has an important role in economic and cultural development during globalization. Music genres such as [[jazz]] and [[reggae]] began locally and later became international phenomena. Globalization gave support to the [[world music]] phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. (2002.)

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, David and Keneth Gloag. 2005. Musicology: The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 [[UNESCO]] report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/cscl/IntlFlows_EN.pdf |title=International Flows of Selected Goods and Services |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the [[European Union]]'s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.

Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to [[Westernization]] or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/04/11/why-do-we-need-religion-in-a-globalized-world/|title=Why do we need religion in a globalized world?|date=11 April 2018|work=Aleteia — Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture|access-date=12 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization is a diverse phenomenon which relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries. The Indian experience particularly reveals the [[Cultural pluralism|plurality]] of the impact of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Biswajit (2011).

==Political globalization==
{{Main|Political globalization}}
[[File:67º Período de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|The [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York City]]]]

In general, globalization may ultimately reduce the importance of [[nation state]]s. [[Supranational]] institutions such as the [[European Union]], the [[WTO]], the [[G8]] or the [[International Criminal Court]] replace or extend national functions to facilitate international agreement.&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could ultimately lead to a [[global union]], based on the [[European Union]] model.&lt;ref name="mcclintock1"&gt;John McClintock (2010). "The Uniting of Nations: An Essay on Global Governance (3rd ed. revised and updated)". Publisher: P.I.E. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intergovernmentalism]] is a term in [[political science]] with two meanings. The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by [[Stanley Hoffmann]]; the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Multi-level governance]] is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy.  It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.

Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states. [[Multiple citizenship]], also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or  dual nationality, is a person's [[citizenship]] status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one [[Sovereign state|state]] under the laws of those states.

Increasingly, [[non-governmental organization]]s influence public policy across national boundaries, including [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian aid]] and [[International development|developmental efforts]].&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Accion International]], the Acumen Fund (now [[Acumen Fund|Acumen]]) and the [[Echoing Green]] have combined the [[business model]] with [[philanthropy]], giving rise to business organizations such as the [[Global Philanthropy Group]] and new associations of philanthropists such as the [[Global Philanthropy Forum]].  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Vaccine-Delivery|title=Vaccine Delivery|work=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hudson Institute]] estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at [[US$]]59 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/2012IndexofGlobalPhilanthropyandRemittances.pdf ''The Index of Global Philanthropy and Remittances 2012''.

As a response to globalization, some countries have embraced [[isolationism|isolationist]] policies. For example, the [[North Korea]]n government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.&lt;ref name=nkr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/2008-exodus.htm |title=North Korean Refugees NGO |publisher=Northkoreanrefugees.com |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhcr&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,PRK,4562d8cf2,487ca236c0,0.html |title=UNHCR Freedom in the World 2008 – North Korea |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dimensions==
Scholars also occasionally discuss other, less common dimensions of globalization, such as [[environmental globalization]] (the internationally coordinated practices and regulations, often in the form of international treaties, regarding environmental protection)&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"&gt;{{cite book|first=Karl S. |last=Zimmerer|title=Globalization &amp; New Geographies of Conservation|url={{google books|id=UdLK-UGj7YkC|page=1|plainurl=yes}}|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-98344-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[military globalization]] (growth in global extent and scope of security relationships).&lt;ref name="Krishnan2016"&gt;{{cite book|first=Armin |last=Krishnan|title=War as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting|url={{google books|id=1ymrCwAAQBAJ|page=PA157|plainurl=yes}}|date=3 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00049-5|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: [[economic globalization]], [[cultural globalization]] and [[political globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"/&gt;

===Movement of people===
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Scheduled [[airline]] traffic in 2009]]
An essential aspect of globalization is movement of people, and state-boundary limits on that movement have changed across history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James| first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens | url= https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens | journal= Citizenship Studies | volume=  18 | issue=  2 | pages= 208–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. For example, travel across the [[Atlantic ocean]] used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Boustan, Adain May . "Fertility and Immigration." UCLA. 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable.

[[Tourism]] is travel for pleasure. The developments in technology and transport infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.&lt;ref name="Barom2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]] |journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |date=January 2013 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228162347/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Travel visa|visa]] is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country. Some countries – such as those in the [[Schengen Area]] – have agreements with other countries allowing each other's citizens to travel between them without visas. The [[World Tourism Organization]] announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/travel/visa-requirements-for-tourism-eased-around-the-world-says-un-agency-365446391.html Visa requirements for tourism eased around the world, says UN agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |title=Visa Openness Report 2015 January 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123123959/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immigration]] is the international movement of people into a destination [[country]] of which they are not natives or where they do not possess [[citizenship]] in order to settle or reside there, especially as [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] or [[Naturalization|naturalized]] citizens, or to take-up [[employment]] as a [[migrant worker]] or temporarily as a [[foreign worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/immigration|title=immigration|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigration| title=immigrate|publisher=Merriam-Webster, In.|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCUK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's who: Definitions|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy_research/the_truth_about_asylum/the_facts_about_asylum|first=|last=|publisher=Refugee Council|location=London, England|year=2016|access-date= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[International Labour Organization]], {{as of|2014|lc=y}} there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside their country of origin for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development. For example, [[freedom of movement for workers in the European Union]] means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.

Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in [[international education]].  More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many [[international student]]s now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.&lt;ref name="gribble"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gribble | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Policy options for managing international student migration: the sending country's perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 25–39 | doi=10.1080/13600800701457830}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contributions that [[foreign student]]s make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to [[immigration]] and visa policies and procedures.&lt;ref name="varghese"&gt;Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[transnational marriage]] is a [[marriage]] between two people from different countries. A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to [[citizenship]] and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships.
In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.

===Movement of information===
{{See also|Internet}}
{{Internet users by region}}
Before electronic communications, long-distance communications relied on [[mail]]. Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century. The [[electric telegraph]] was the first method of instant long-distance communication. For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean. The first [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866. The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.

The [[Internet]] has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries. For example, [[Facebook]] is a [[social networking service]] which has more than [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|1.65 billion monthly active users]] {{as of|2016|3|31|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Facebook-Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Info – Facebook Newsroom|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization can be spread by Global journalism which provides massive information and relies on the internet to interact,  "makes it into an everyday routine to investigate how people and their actions, practices, problems, life conditions etc. in different parts of the world are interrelated. possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Berglez |date=2008 |title=WHAT IS GLOBAL JOURNALISM? |journal=Journalism Studies |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=845–858 &lt;!--was originally "5" but that's confusing--&gt; |doi=10.1080/14616700802337727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{See also|List of globalization-related indices}}

One index of globalization is the ''KOF Index of Globalization'', which measures three important dimensions of globalization:  economic, social, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch/ | title=KOF Index of Globalization | publisher=The KOF Swiss Economic Institute | work=ethz.ch | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[A.T.

Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as [[trade]], [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI), [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[portfolio investment]], and [[income]].  However, newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms, including variables related to political, social, cultural, and even environmental aspects of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vujakovic | first1 = Petra | year = 2010 | title = How to Measure Globalization?

==Support and criticism==
{{See also|Criticisms of globalization}}
Reactions to processes contributing to globalization have varied widely with a history as long as extraterritorial contact and trade. [[philosophy|Philosophical]] differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[social movements]].  Proponents of [[economic growth]], [[economic expansion|expansion]] and [[economic development|development]], in general, view globalizing processes as desirable or necessary to the well-being of human [[society]].&lt;ref name=Sen1970&gt;Sen, Amartya K. (1970).  ''Collective choice and social welfare.'' San Francisco, CA: Holden-Day.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonists view one or more globalizing processes as detrimental to social well-being on a global or local scale;&lt;ref name=Sen1970 /&gt; this includes those who social or [[natural environment|natural]] [[sustainability]] of long-term and continuous economic expansion, the social [[structural inequality]] caused by these processes, and the [[Colonialism|colonial]], [[Imperialism|imperialistic]], or [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[ethnocentrism]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[cultural appropriation]] that underlie such processes.

Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures. [[Xenophobia]] is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia|title=Definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia|title=Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]], including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs. They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the [[Gini coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20238991~menuPK:492138~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html|title=Poverty Analysis – Measuring Inequality|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Happy Planet Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happyplanetindex.org/ |title=The Happy Planet Index |publisher=Neweconomics.org |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to a "multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation"&lt;ref name="The Hidden Connections"&gt;{{cite book | last = Capra | first = Fritjof | year = 2002 | title = The Hidden Connections | publisher=Random House | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-385-49471-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they claim are the [[unintended consequences]] of globalization. Others point out that, while the forces of globalization have led to the spread of western-style democracy, this has been accompanied by an increase in inter-ethnic tension and violence as free market economic policies combine with democratic processes of universal suffrage as well as an escalation in militarization to impose democratic principles and as a means to conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorrells, Kathryn. Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion on globalization===

A 2005 study by Peer Fiss and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior. In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"&gt;Fiss, Peer and Hirsch, Pal: "The Discourse of Globalization: Framing and Sensemaking of an Emerging Concept. American Sociological Review, February 2005. vol. 70 no 1: 29–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999. This increase occurred during a period when the total number of articles concerning globalization nearly doubled.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;

A number of international polls have shown that residents of Africa and Asia tend to view globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America. In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably.&lt;ref&gt;"Africans and Asians Tend to View Globalization Favorably. Europeans and Americans are More Skeptical". World Public Opinion.org. 7 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC found that 50% of people believed that economic globalization was proceeding too rapidly, while 35% believed it was proceeding too slowly.&lt;ref name=bbc08&gt;{{cite web| title = Widespread Unease about Economy and Globalization – Global poll| author = BBC World Service| date = 2008| accessdate = 24 March 2015| url = http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173226/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| archivedate = 3 September 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Philip Gordon stated that "a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects." The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Philip. 2004.

Fiss, ''et al.'', surveyed US opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis of 2007]]. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.&lt;ref name="ip08"&gt;Greg Ip: "The Declining Value Of Your College Degree", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, {{as of|1998|lc=y}} there was a perception in Japan that the economy was "Small and Frail". However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as ''[[internationalization]]'' and ''globalization'' to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi. 1998.

Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"/&gt; Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism.

In the book ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government [[Political corruption|corruption]]; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as [[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; [[protectionism]]; and geographic barriers.&lt;ref name="The End of Poverty"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sachs | first = Jeffrey | year = 2005 | title = The End of Poverty | publisher=The Penguin Press | location = New York, New York | isbn = 1-59420-045-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bhagwati | first = Jagdish | title = In Defense of Globalization | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | location = Oxford, New York | url =| isbn =978-0195330939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist.

The flow of migrants to advanced economic countries has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge. An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"/&gt; Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization. Technological innovations (or technological transfer) is conjectured to benefit most the developing and least developing countries (LDCs), as for example in the adoption of [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref name="Saggi2002" /&gt;

There has been a rapid economic growth in Asia after embracing [[market orientation]]-based economic policies that encourage private [[property rights]], free enterprise and competition. In particular, in East Asian developing countries, [[GDP]] per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url= http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2003|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist [[Martin Wolf]] says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]] in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.&lt;ref name="Wolf2004"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|author= Martin Wolf|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0300102529|accessdate= 6 April 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510120230/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|archivedate= 10 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]]. Thus, despite seemingly unequal [[distribution of income]] within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth among post-1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.&lt;ref name="DDollar"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dollar, David|author2=Kraay, Aart|title=Trade, Growth, and Poverty|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|work=Finance and Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic [[interdependence]] promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web |title=Globalisation promotes peace

Globalization allows corporations to [[outsource]] manufacturing and service jobs from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits.&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"/&gt; Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually [[agricultural production]]s. Larger countries often subsidize their [[Agricultural subsidy|farmers]] (e.g., the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.&lt;ref name="Hurst E.

===Global democracy===
{{Main|Democratic globalization}}

'''Democratic globalization''' is a movement towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]] that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO), political cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker [[David Held]]. Advocates of [[democratic globalization]] argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building [[International political economy|global political institutions]]. Dr. [[Francesco Stipo]], Director of the United States Association of the [[Club of Rome]], advocates unifying nations under a [[world government]], suggesting that it "should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations. A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacor.org/archive/index.html |title=USACOR.org |publisher=USACOR.org |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a [[direct election|directly elected]] [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche|first=Douglas|title=The Case for a United Nations  Parliamentary Assembly|url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|publisher=The World Federalist Movement–Institute for Global Policy|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531054746/http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global civics===
{{Main|Global civics|Multiculturalism}}
{{See also|Global citizenship}}

Global civics suggests that [[civics]] can be understood, in a global sense, as a [[social contract]] between [[Global citizenship|global citizens]] in the age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World citizen]] has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional [[geopolitical]] divisions derived from national [[citizenship]]. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in [[Socrates]], whom [[Plutarch]] quoted as saying: "I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcitizens.org.au|title=World Citizens Association Australia|work=World Citizens Association Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and [[nuclear proliferation]].&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary?

Baha'i-inspired author Meyjes, while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness, warns of globalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Language and Universalization: a ‘Linguistic Ecology’ Reading of Bahá’í Writ | first = Gregory Paul | last = Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes) | title = The Journal of Bahá’í Studies | publisher = Association for Bahá’í Studies | series = | volume =Volume IX (1) | year =1999 | location = Ottawa | pages = 51–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cloak for an expeditious economic, social, and cultural Anglo-dominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization. He proposes a process of "[[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalization]]" as an alternative.

[[Cosmopolitanism]] is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single [[community]] based on a shared [[morality]]. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmopolitan|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmopolitan?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect. For instance, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, "Cosmopolitan Patriots," Critical Inquiry 23, no. 3 (Spring, 1997): 617–639.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International cooperation===
'''Military cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– Past examples of international cooperation exist. One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see [[START I]], [[START II]], [[START III]], and [[New START]]) and the establishment of [[NATO]]'s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the [[G8]] Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/brookings-audit/international-cooperation-stepping-stone-world-government |title=International cooperation as a stepping-stone to a world government &amp;#124; Global Policy Journal – Practitioner, Academic, Global Governance, International Law, Economics, Security, Institutions, Comment &amp; Opinion, Media, Events, Journal |publisher=Global Policy Journal |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the [[Montreal Protocol]], in order to stop ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"/&gt;

(2011). Social movements (Rev. ed.). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The diverse subgroups that make up this movement include some of the following: trade unionists, environmentalists, anarchists, land rights and indigenous rights activists, organizations promoting human rights and sustainable development, opponents of privatization, and [[anti-sweatshop movement|anti-sweatshop]] campaigners.&lt;ref name="stwr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stwr.org/the-un-people-politics/the-anti-globalization-movement-defined.htm|title=The Anti-Globalization Movement Defined Share The World's Resources|last=Engler|first=M.|date=30 May 2007|accessdate=14 March 2013}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}l&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy'', [[Christopher Lasch]] analyzes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html |title=The treachery of the lites Elite sense of irresponsibility |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-03-10 |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.
Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The de-nationalisation of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as "world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of  national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have "withdrawn from common life".
Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. 
However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

D.A. Snow et al. contend that the [[anti-globalization movement]] is an example of a [[new social movement]], which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D. A., Soule, S. A., &amp; Kriesi, H. (2004). The Blackwell companion to social movements. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the [[Battle of Seattle (1999)|Battle of Seattle]] in 1999, where there were protests against the World Trade Organization's Third Ministerial Meeting. All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8).&lt;ref name="stwr.org"/&gt; Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.

===Opposition to capital market integration===
{{Main|Anti-capitalist movements}}
[[File:Worldbank protest jakarta.jpg|thumb|World Bank Protester, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]

Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises.  Increasing integration of these [[financial market]]s between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invested Interests: The Politics of National Economic Policies in a World of  Global Finance|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry A.|journal=[[International Organization]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|issn=1531-5088|volume=45|issue=4|year=1991|pages=425–51|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033178|jstor=2706944|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of [[human rights]] issues  are especially disturbed by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South").{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Anti-corporatism and anti-consumerism===
{{Main|Anti-corporatism|Anti-consumerism}}

[[Corporatism|Corporatist]] ideology, which privileges the rights of corporations ([[Legal personality|artificial or juridical persons]]) over those of [[natural person]]s, is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2001/09/01/corporatism-goes-global | title=Corporatism Goes Global | author=Ottaway, Marina | journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations | volume=7 | issue=3 | date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books ([[Naomi Klein]]'s 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'', for example) and films (''e.g. [[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' &amp; ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus]]'') popularizing an [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] [[ideology]] to the public.

A related contemporary ideology, [[consumerism]], which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lived effects of the Contemporary Economy: Globalization, Inequality, and Consumer Society. | author=Storper Michael | journal=Public Culture | year=2000 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=375–409 | doi=10.1215/08992363-12-2-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of [[consumer education]] into school [[curriculum|curricula]]. Social activists hold materialism is connected to [[Big-box store|global retail merchandizing]] and [[supplier convergence]], [[war]], greed, [[anomie]], [[crime]], environmental degradation, and general social [[malaise]] and discontent. One variation on this topic is activism by ''postconsumers'', with the strategic emphasis on moving ''beyond'' addictive consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Collective dissonance and the transition to post-consumerism | author=Cohen,  Maurie J. | journal=Futures |date=July 2013  | volume=52 | pages=42–51 | doi=10.1016/j.futures.2013.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global justice and inequality===

[[File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Differences in national income equality around the world as measured by the national [[Gini coefficient]], 2014]]

The global justice movement is the loose collection of individuals and groups—often referred to as a "[[movement of movements]]"—who advocate [[fair trade]] rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, "A Movement of Movements", New York: Verso, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement is often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are [[anti-globalization]], insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power.&lt;ref&gt;della Porta, D. 2005. "The Social Bases of the Global Justice Movement: Some Theoretical Reflections and Empirical Evidence from the First European Social Forum." Civil Society and Social Movements Programme Paper No. 21.Geneva: UNRISD (United Nations Research Institute for Social Development).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is based in the idea of [[social justice]], desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and [[solidarity]], the values of human rights, and the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Education and Social Justice By J.

Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) include: [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], [[Red Cross]], [[Free The Children]] and [[CARE International]]. They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.

====Social inequality====
{{Main|Social inequality|International inequality}}

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally.  Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name="WEF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak [[trade union|labor unions]]: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever-growing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in high-cost areas. Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline.&lt;ref name="Hurst E. Charles P.41"/&gt; They also cite an increase in the exploitation of [[child labour|child labor]]: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them. Examples include [[quarry]]ing, salvage, and farm work as well as trafficking, bondage, forced labor, prostitution and pornography.&lt;ref name="Edmonds_Pavcni"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pavcnik | first = Nina |date=September 2005 | title = Child Labor in the Global Economy | journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–220 | doi = 10.1257/0895330053147895 | last2 = Pavcnik | first2 = Nina | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often participate in the workforce in [[precarious work]], including [[export-oriented employment]].  Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women's access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]] remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state's role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seguino|first1=Stephanie|last2=Grown|first2=Caren|date=November 2006|title=Gender equity and globalization: macroeconomic policy for developing countries|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1081–104|doi=10.1002/jid.1295|ref=harv|author-link1=Stephanie Seguino|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.4614}} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf Pdf version – via the World Bank.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the intersectionality of gender, race, class, and more remain overlooked when assessing the impact of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|last=Lourdes|first=Benería|others=Berik, Günseli,, Floro, Maria|isbn=9780415537483|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=903247621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study published by the IMF posited that [[neoliberalism]], the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has been "oversold", with the benefits of neoliberal policies being "fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries" and the costs, most significantly higher income inequality within nations, "hurt the level and sustainability of growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foroohar |first=Rana |date=June 3, 2016 |title=Globalization's True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts|url=http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/|work=TIME|location= |access-date=July 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-global governance===
{{Main|Global governance}}

Beginning in the 1930s, opposition arose to the idea of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the [[World Federalist Movement]] (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul. (2006.) ''The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations.'' New York: Harper Collins. {{ISBN|978-0375501654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the [[League of Nations]] and, later, the [[United Nations]].

===Environmentalist opposition===
[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation]] of the [[Madagascar]] Highland Plateau has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western [[river]]s.]]
{{Main|Environmentalism}}
{{See also|Global warming|Climate change|Deforestation}}

[[Environmentalism]] is a broad philosophy, ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ideology.html |title=Ideology and Sustainability |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald Bailey from the February 2002 issue |url=http://reason.com/archives/2002/02/01/debunking-green-myths |title=Debunking Green Myths |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Gibson. Environmentalism: Ideology and Power. Nova Science Pub Inc. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and social movement regarding concerns for environmental [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as [[global warming]], [[climate change]], global [[water supply]] and [[Water crisis|water crises]], inequity in [[energy consumption]] and [[energy conservation]], transnational [[air pollution]] and pollution of the [[world ocean]], [[overpopulation]], world [[habitat]] [[sustainability]], [[deforestation]], [[biodiversity]] and [[species extinction]].

One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Nicholas. (2002). ''Global Ethics and Environment''. Routledge Science. {{ISBN|978-0415197359}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of" environmental [[apartheid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J., and John Boli. 2012. ''The Globalization Reader'', 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0470655634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], the director and founder of Local Futures/[[International Society for Ecology and Culture]], criticizes globalization in many ways. In her book ''[[Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh|Ancient Futures]]'', Norberg-Hodge claims that "centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization." She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norberg-Hodge|first=Helena|title=Ancient futures : learning from Ladakh|year=1992|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0871566435|edition= Sierra Club Books paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related area of concern is the [[pollution haven hypothesis]], which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see [[Race to the bottom]]).&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

== Food security ==
{{Main|Food security}}
The globalization of food production is associated with a more efficient system of food production. This is because crops are grown in countries with optimum growing conditions. This improvement causes an increase in the world's food supply which encourages improved food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5160e.pdf|title=Food Security and International Trade Unpacking disputed narratives|last=Clapp|first=J|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway's limited crop range advocates globalization of food production and availability. The northern-most country in Europe requires trade with other countries to ensure population food demands are met. The degree of self-sufficiency in food production is around 50% in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Flaten and Hisano, 2007. Food Security Policy in a Food Importing Country: The Case of Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MACMILLAM FORUM 020.JPG|thumb|Overinflating a [[Hot water bottle|hot-water bottle]]]]
'''Hot water bottle blowing''' is the deliberate inflation of a [[Hot water bottle|hot-water bottle]] by blowing. Air is breathed into the bottle until it stretches beyond its capacity and consequently explodes. It is a challenging feat of strength which is included in the ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. The challenge is most commonly undertaken by breathing air from the mouth, though it has also been achieved by blowing through the nose. The activity presents a potential hazard for physical injury to eyes and lungs.

==Description==
Blowing up a hot-water bottle is usually performed to impress a crowd. It requires significant [[lung volumes|lung capacity]] as well as chest and abdominal strength. It is regarded as potentially hazardous because of the risk of harm to the eyes and the possibility of the contained air rushing back into the lungs and causing damage or, reportedly, death.&lt;ref name="USAWA" /&gt; Former world record holder Brian Jackson has claimed that he knows of at least five deaths resulting from the practice, although this is unconfirmed.&lt;ref name="HuffPost" /&gt; [[Georgians|Georgian]] athlete Jemal Tkeshelashvili has demonstrated two variations on the traditional method: blowing the bottle up with his nose, and blowing one up while somebody sits on top of it.&lt;ref name="GuinnessN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In Britain, the hot-water bottles used conform to standard [[British Standards|BS]] 1970:2006.&lt;ref name="RHR" /&gt;{{update inline|date=May 2018}}

==Records==
There are three hot-water bottle blowing records officiated by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. The "Fastest hot water bottle burst" by a male is held by Shaun Jones from the United Kingdom. He achieved a time of 6.52 seconds on the set of Italian show ''Lo Show Dei Record'' on 31 March 2011.&lt;ref name="Guinness1" /&gt; Jones also holds the record for the "Fastest time to burst three hot water bottles" setting the time of 28.82 seconds on 17 November 2011.&lt;ref name="Guinness3" /&gt; Jemal Tkeshelashvili holds the record for "Most hot water bottles burst with the nose in one minute". Tkeshelashvili successfully exploded three hot-water bottles during a live television broadcast of ''Das Sommerfest der Abenteuer'' in [[Magdeburg]], Germany, on 2 June 2012.&lt;ref name="GuinnessN" /&gt; Shaun Jones is also included in the Record Holders Republic registry as holding numerous variations of blowing up hot-water bottles, including doing so while standing on his head and while cycling at a minimum speed of {{convert|20|mph}} on a stationary bicycle.&lt;ref name="RHR" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14785">The '''ITF Rankings''' are the current rankings of national teams by the [[International Tennis Federation]] in both men's and women's [[tennis]]. The ITF produces two sets of rankings—the ITF [[Davis Cup]] Nations Ranking for male national teams, and the ITF [[Fed Cup]] Nations Ranking for female national teams. Both sets of rankings measure the success of all nations participating in both competitions.

The ITF Davis Cup Nations Ranking was launched at the end of 2001 and the ITF Fed Cup Nations Ranking was introduced a year later. Both rankings are updated following every World Group round and are used for [[seed (sports)|seeding]] the highest ranked teams in the draws for each group in the competitions' structures.

==Ranking method==

The ITF [[Davis Cup]] and [[Fed Cup]] rankings are based in a rolling four year cumulative system. However, the points total for each nation is calculated following a weighted sum formula, in which recent results are weighted more heavily.&lt;ref name="ITFDavisCupRankingsExplained"&gt;{{cite web|work=daviscup.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|title=Rankings Explained| url = http://www.daviscup.com/en/rankings/rankings-explained.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITFFedCupRankingsExplained"&gt;{{cite web|work=fedcup.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|title=How the Rankings Work| url = http://www.fedcup.com/en/rankings/rankings-explained.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; After each World Group round, the ranking period adjusts, and points earned in the last year period have a weighting factor of 100% in the points total. At the same time, the weighting factor for the points earned until the same round in the previous three years is reduced to 75% (for points earned one to two years ago), 50% (for points earned two to three years ago) and 25% (for points earned three to four years ago).

Ranking points are awarded only to the winning nation of a competition tie at every round. Victories in World Group rounds are worth more points than those in Zone Groups, and ties at the later rounds of the competition are progressively worth more points. Bonus points are also awarded for a nation that defeats a higher-ranked nation, but only if the latter nation is ranked in the top 64 for the Davis Cup, or in the top 75 for the Fed Cup. Unique to the Davis Cup, there is an additional bonus for a nation that wins a tie in the opponent's home ground: a 25% bonus is added to the total of round points and ranking bonus points (if any). At the Fed Cup only, nations that win by walkover are awarded round points but no bonus points, and no points are awarded for consolation events.

The law creates a new [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=BF72E2C1162C7C49D52DE78D65BEF5B4.tpdila07v_2?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000030934655&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000025503132&amp;dateTexte=20160309 chapter] in the Code of Internal Security aimed at regulating the surveillance programs of French [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], in particular those of the [[General Directorate for Internal Security|DGSI]] (domestic intelligence) and the [[Directorate-General for External Security|DGSE]] (foreign intelligence).

==History==
The Intelligence Bill was introduced to the Parliament on 19 March 2015 by French Prime Minister [[Manuel Valls]] and presented as the government's reaction to the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/infosociety/outcry-over-french-intelligence-bill-313779 | title=Outcry over French Intelligence Bill | publisher=EurActiv | date=15 April 2015 | accessdate=3 May 2015 | author=Robert, Aline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite widespread mobilization, the Bill was adopted with 438 votes in favor, 86 against and 42 abstentions
at the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.is/20150506163503/http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/scrutins/detail/%28legislature%29/14/%28num%29/1109&lt;/ref&gt; and 252 for, 67 against and 26 abstentions at the [[Senate (France)|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.is/20150610142506/http://www.senat.fr/scrutin-public/2014/scr2014-200.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was made into law on 24 July 2015.

Although framed by the government as a response to the Paris attacks of January 2015, the passage of the Intelligence Act was actually long in the making. The previous law providing a framework for the surveillance programs of French intelligence agencies was the [[Wiretapping Act of-1991 (France)|Wiretapping Act of 1991]], aimed at regulating telephone wiretaps. Many surveillance programs developed in the 2000s—especially to monitor Internet communications—were rolled out outside of any legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;Tréguer, Félix. "From Deep State Illegality to Law of the Land: The Case of Internet Surveillance in France," April 2016. https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01306332/document.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2008, the French government's White Paper of Defense and National Security stressed that "intelligence activities do not have the benefit of a clear and sufficient legal framework", and said that "legislative adjustments" were necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | title=Livre blanc sur la Défense et la Sécurité nationale | author=French government | date=June 2008 | page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main provisions==
This section summarizes the main provisions of the Intelligence Act.&lt;ref&gt;A rough translation of the Act is available at: https://wiki.laquadrature.net/French_Intelligence_Laws&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope===
Through article L. 811-3, the Act extended the number of objectives that can justify extrajudicial surveillance. These include:
* national independence, territorial integrity and national defense;
* major interests in foreign policy, implementation of European and international obligations of France and prevention of all forms of foreign interference;
* major economic, industrial and scientific interests of France;
* prevention of terrorism;
* prevention of: a) attacks on the republican nature of institutions; b) actions towards continuation or reconstitution of groups disbanded (article L. 212-1 of criminal code); c) collective violence likely to cause serious harm to public peace;
* prevention of organized crime and delinquency;
* prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

These surveillance powers can also be used by law enforcement agencies that are not part of the official "intelligence community" and whose combined staff is well over 45,000.

===Oversight===
The existing oversight commission, the ''Commission nationale de contrôle des interceptions de sécurité'', was replaced by a new oversight body called the "National Oversight Commission for Intelligence-Gathering Techniques" (''Commission nationale de contrôle des techniques de renseignement'', or CNCTR). It is composed of:

* four members of Parliament designated by the Presidents of both chambers of Parliament;
* two administrative judges and two judicial judges designated respectively by the Council of State and the ''Cour de Cassation'';
* one technical expert designated by the telecom National Regulatory Authority (the addition of a commissioner with technical expertise was the main innovation).

The CNCTR has 24 hours to issue its ''ex ante'' non-binding opinion regarding the surveillance authorizations delivered by the Prime Minister before surveillance begins, except in cases of "absolute emergency" where it is simply notified of the surveillance measure within 24 hours upon deliverance (article L. 821-3).

For ''ex post'' oversight, the CNCTR has "permanent, comprehensive and direct access to records, logs, collected intelligence, transcripts and extractions" of collected data. It is able to conduct both planned and in the premises where these documents are centralized (article L. 833-2-2). If an irregularity is found, it can send to the Prime Minister a "recommendation" so that she can put an end to it. One hugely significant exception to the CNCTR's oversight powers are the bulk of data obtained through data-sharing with foreign intelligence agencies (article L. 833-2-3).

===Wiretaps and access to metadata===
Techniques of communications surveillance covered by the Act include telephone or Internet [[wiretaps]] (L. 852-1), access to identifying data and other [[metadata]] (L. 851-1), [[geotagging]] (L. 851-4) and computer network exploitation (L. 853-2), all of which are subject to authorization of a renewable duration of 4 months.

===Black boxes and real-time access to metadata===
The Act authorizes the use of scanning device (nicknamed "black boxes") to be installed on the infracturstures of telecom operators and hosting providers. Article L. 851-3 of the Code of Internal Security provides that, "for the sole purpose of preventing terrorism, automated processing techniques may be imposed on the networks of [telecom operators and hosting providers] in order to detect, according to selectors specified in the authorisation, communications that are likely to reveal a terrorist threat.

Another provision limited to anti-terrorism allows for the real-time collection of metadata (article L. 851-3, for terrorism only and for a 4 months period). Initially, the provision targeted only individuals "identified as a [terrorist] threat". After the [[2016 Nice Attack]], it was extended by a Bill of the state of emergency to cover individuals "likely to be related to a threat" or who simply belong to "the entourage" of individuals "likely related to a threat". According to [[La Quadrature du Net]], this means that the provision can now potentially cover "hundreds or even thousands of persons (...) rather than just the 11 700 individuals" reported to be on the French terrorism [[wikt:watchlist|watchlist]].&lt;ref&gt;La Quadrature du Net, "French State of Emergency: Overbidding Mass Surveillance", 21 July 2016. Available at: https://www.laquadrature.net/en/french-state-of-emergency-overbidding-mass-surveillance.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer Network Exploitation===
The Act authorizes [[computer network exploitation]], or computer hacking, as a method for intelligence gathering. Article L. 853-2 allows for:
* access, collection, retention and transmission of computer data stored in a computer system;
* access, collection, retention and transmission of computer data, as it is displayed on a user's computer screen, as it is entered by keystrokes, or as received and transmitted by audiovisual peripheral devices.

Considering the intrusiveness of computer hacking, the law provides that these techniques are authorized for a duration of 30 days, and only "when intelligence cannot be collected by any other legally authorized mean."

The Act also grants blanket immunity to intelligence officers who carry on computer crimes into computer systems located abroad (article 323-8 of the Criminal Code).

===International surveillance===
The Act also provides chapter on the "surveillance of international communications", particularly relevant for the DGSE's surveillance programs. International communications are defined as "communications emitted from or received abroad" (article L. 854-1 and following). They can be intercepted and exploited in bulk on the French territory with reduced oversight. Safeguards in terms of bulk exploitation and [[data retention]] are lessened for foreigners (though the definition of foreigners is technical, i.e. people using non-French "technical identifiers").

===Data retention periods===
For national surveillance measures, once communications data are collected by intelligence agencies, retention periods are the following:
* Content (''correspondances''): 1 month after collection (for encrypted content, period starts after decryption, within the limit of 6 years after initial collection);
* Metadata: 4 years (compared to a 3-year period before the adoption of the Act).

For international surveillance, retention periods depend on whether one end of the communication uses a "technical identifiers traceable to the national territory" or not, in which case the "national" retention periods are applicable, but they start after the first exploitation and no later than six months after collection (article L. 854-8). If both ends of the communication are foreign, the following periods apply:
* Content: 1 year after first exploitation, within the limit of 4 years after collection (for encrypted content, periods starts after decryption, within the limit of 8 years after collection);
* Metadata: 6 years

The law fails to provide any framework to limit staff access to collected intelligence once it is stored by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.

===Redress mechanism===
The Act reorganizes redress procedures against secret surveillance, establishing the possibility to introduce a legal challenge before the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Council of State]] after having unsuccessfully thought redress before the CNCTR.

==Criticism and legal challenges==
During the Parliamentary debate, the bill faced severe criticism from several organizations including [[Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés|National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL)]], [[Conseil national du numérique|National Digital Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nextinpact.com/news/93509-projet-loi-sur-renseignement-tous-points-noirs-denonces-par-cnil.htm | title=Bill on Intelligence: all black spots denounced by the CNIL | publisher=Next Impact | date=19 March 2015 | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=Rees, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mediapart]],&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/la-redaction-de-mediapart/240415/4-mai-mediapart-organise-les-six-heures-contre-la-surveillance&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Quadrature du Net]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laquadrature.net/en/press-release&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation decrees of the French Intelligence Act are currently undergoing a series of legal challenges by French civil society organizations [[La Quadrature du Net]], [[French Data Network]] and [[Fédération FFDN]] before the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Council of State]].&lt;ref&gt;La Quadrature du Net, 11 May 2016, "Legal Action against the French Surveillance Law".

Of [[Armenia]]n descent, he was born in [[Batumi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] {{clarify|date=August 2014}}. As a child, he lived with his family in England and attended British schools. Later, in the 1930s, he attended a special school for American expats in Moscow where he acquired familiarity with Americans.&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite web|last=Thatcher|first=Gary|title=Comrade Joe Adamov tells it all to you|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1986/0709/oadam.html|date=July 9, 1986|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a graduate of [[Moscow State Pedagogical University]].&lt;ref name=VORobit&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Adamov Passed Away|publisher=[[Voice of Russia]] |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221052622/http://www.vor.ru/English/JAdamov.html|date=December 21, 2005|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An expert [[English language|English-speaker]] who spoke with a neutral American accent, Adamov joined Radio Moscow as an announcer at the foreign language service of Radio Moscow in 1942.&lt;ref name=VORobit /&gt; He lived in [[Moscow]] during most of his career.

[[File:Joe Adamov.jpg|thumb|left|Joe Adamov in a Radio Moscow staff meeting]]
Among English-speaking listeners, he is best known as the presenter of the programme ''Moscow Mailbag'' on Radio Moscow's North American shortwave broadcasts. The program answered questions from listeners on all aspects of Soviet life and the [[USSR]]'s policies. At its height, ''Moscow Mailbag'' listeners sent Adamov thousands of letters yearly.&lt;ref name=CSM /&gt; In his capacity as a Radio Moscow journalist and presenter of ''Moscow Mailbag'', Adamov conducted interviews with many western politicians and journalists, including [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]],  [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Larry King]].

During the [[Cold War]], Adamov's broadcasts, like all other Radio Moscow output, were carefully studied by Western governments, a fact of which the Soviet authorities were well aware. Joe Adamov presented ''Moscow Mailbag'' from 1957 until shortly before his death, when ill-health forced him to relinquish the role permanently. The program remains on the air with different presenters.

Joe Adamov was also the official Soviet translator at the trial of [[Gary Powers]], shot down in a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane in 1960.

The signature poem of Moscow Mailbag was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
You can't do better
than send us that letter
and in it tell Joe
what you think of his show
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adamov's death was reported on Voice of Russia's English-language news bulletins on December 21, 2005, although neither these bulletins nor the obituary on their website gave an exact date of death.&lt;ref name=VORobit /&gt;

The '''''Journal of World History''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] that presents historical analysis from a global point of view, focusing especially on forces that cross the boundaries of [[culture]]s and [[civilization]]s, including large-scale population movements, economic fluctuations, transfers of [[technology]], the spread of [[infectious disease]]s, long-distance trade, and the spread of [[religious faith]]s, ideas, and values.

The journal was established in 1990 by [[Jerry H. Bentley]] at the [[University of Hawaii|University of Hawai{{okina}}i]] to serve as the official journal of the [[World History Association]]. It is published by the [[University of Hawaii Press|University of Hawai{{okina}}i Press]]. Initially produced twice a year, it became a quarterly in 2003.

In 2000, it was included in [[Project MUSE]], which now contains archives going back to vol. 7 (1996). In 2009, it was included in [[JSTOR]], with a [[moving wall]] of 3 years.

The "[[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]]" (FVEY) refers to an alliance comprising [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. These countries are bound by the multilateral [[UKUSA Agreement]] for joint cooperation in [[signals intelligence]], [[Defense (military)#Military intelligence|military intelligence]], and [[Human intelligence (intelligence collection)|human intelligence]]. In recent years, documents of the FVEY have shown that they are intentionally spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive [[Constitutional law|domestic regulations]] on spying.{{refn|&lt;ref name="fiveeyes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=James|title=Canada and the Five Eyes Intelligence Community|url=http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf|publisher=[[Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute]]|date=December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205220700/http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Eyes |url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622 |publisher=[[United States Army Combined Arms Center]] |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MicvdCtb?url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PKI Interoperability with FVEY Partner Nations on the NIPRNet |url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978 |publisher=United States Department of the Navy |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Micdat2m?url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Ball|title=US and UK struck secret deal to allow NSA to 'unmask' Britons' personal data|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=20 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120033754/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data |archivedate=20 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ewen|last=MacAskill|title=Revealed: Australian spy agency offered to share data about ordinary citizens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/revealed-australian-spy-agency-offered-to-share-data-about-ordinary-citizens|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=2 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118092435/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/revealed-australian-spy-agency-offered-to-share-data-about-ordinary-citizens|archivedate=18 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|title=NSA 'offers intelligence to British counterparts to skirt UK law'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=10 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229105310/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett|archivedate=29 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/21/uk-usa-security-britain-idUKBRE95K10620130621 British spy agency taps cables, shares with U.S. NSA – Guardian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125021330/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/21/uk-usa-security-britain-idUKBRE95K10620130621 |date=2014-01-25 }}, ''[[Reuters]]'', 21 June 2013.

'''Olympic Broadcasting Services''' ('''OBS''') is a company which was established by the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 2001 in order to serve as the Host Broadcaster organisation for all [[Olympic Games]], Olympic Winter Games and Youth Olympic Games, maintaining the standards of Olympic broadcasting between one edition and the next one.&lt;ref name=broadcasters&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.olympic.org/broadcasters |title=Broadcasters |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=International Olympic Committee |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Host Broadcaster, OBS is responsible for delivering the pictures and sounds of the Olympic Games to billions of viewers around the world. It produces and transmits unbiased live radio and television coverage of every sport from every venue. This feed is called the International Signal or the World Feed and is distributed as a service to all broadcast organisations who have purchased the television and radio rights to the Games (known as Rights Holding Broadcasters or RHBs).

In collaboration with the Local Organising Committee, OBS supervises the development of the necessary infrastructures (including the International Broadcast Centre or IBC which serves as the primary base of the broadcast operation for OBS and the RHBs during the Games) and facilities at the different Olympic venues to ensure the successful broadcast production of the Games. OBS also offers additional services, equipment and supplies to the RHBs to help them produce their unilateral production.

The [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing]] marked the first time OBS was involved as Host Broadcaster.&lt;ref name=obstv&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.obs.tv/fact_file.php?q=a2 |title=Fact File |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=Olympic Broadcasting Services |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the host broadcaster role was delegated to the local organising committees or to third-party broadcasters, having to rebuild the broadcast operation in each edition.&lt;ref name=broadcasters /&gt;

Its headquarters are in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=obstv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/obs-madrid---olympic-host-broadcaster |title=OBS - OLYMPIC BROADCASTING SERVICES |access-date=August 5, 2016 |last1= |first1= |date= |work= |publisher=Linkedin |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beijing 2008===
{{main|Beijing Olympic Broadcasting}}
Its operations began with the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], where [[Beijing Olympic Broadcasting]], a joint venture between OBS and the [[Beijing Organizing Committee]], acted as the host broadcasting consortium and the state television network, [[China Central Television]] which is one of the host nation broadcasters of the games.

===Vancouver 2010===
For the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], a wholly owned division, Olympic Broadcasting Services Vancouver was set up. The 2010 Olympics marked the first Games where the host broadcasting facilities were provided solely by OBS.

===London 2012===
The 2012 Olympic Games were broadcast by OBS. More than 5,600+ hours of live sports, ceremonies and Olympic News Channel content were distributed to the Rights Holding Broadcasters. OBS employed 1,000+ HD cameras, including 40 High Super Slow Motion cameras and other innovative specialty equipment such as 3D cameras, Super High Vision cameras and the world’s longest cablecam which stretched 2,340m at the Rowing venue from start to finish.

===Sochi 2014===
The Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games represented the largest broadcast operation in history for a Winter Games. OBS deployed more than 450 cameras, including 12 cablecam systems, 31 High Speed Slow Motion (HSSM) cameras and a multicopter/drone used for the first time, to ultimately produce 1300+ hours of television.

In total, 464 television channels broadcast the Sochi Games, almost double the number from Vancouver, and more digital platforms offered coverage than at any previous Winter Games with 155 websites and 75 apps showing events live from Russia.

Thanks to the increased number of channels and digital platforms for Sochi 2014, there were more hours broadcast globally than any previous Winter Games with more than 100,000 hours broadcast around the world, compared with 57,000 for Vancouver 2010.

For the first time in Olympic history, the amount of digital coverage exceeded traditional television broadcasts with 60,000 hours available on digital platforms, compared with 42,000 hours on television. These were the first predominantly digital Olympic Games and OBS helped fuel the significant increase in digital coverage by launching, for the first time in Sochi, the Olympic Video Player (OVP). Available in 95 countries, the OVP provided a fully integrated data, a news channel, live streams and on-demand video.

===Rio 2016===
Rio 2016 represented the most television coverage of any previous Olympic Games, with nearly 350,000 total hours broadcast globally, far exceeding the 200,000 hours that were broadcast for the London 2012 Games. Additionally, coverage was aired across more platforms than ever before, as more than 500 television channels and 250 digital outlets conveyed the Olympic Games around the world.

The number of hours of coverage available on digital platforms nearly doubled that of traditional television, representing more than two and a half times of what was achieved for London 2012 (218,000 hours versus 81,500 hours), marking a milestone in the history of Olympic broadcasting.

Representing the largest host broadcast operation to date, Rio involved more than 7,200 OBS personnel. Further, having developed a production plan to cover all 28 Olympic sports, including new additions Golf and Rugby Sevens, OBS drew on more than 1,000 cameras for the coverage of the Rio Games.

Rio also marked the first time Olympic content was available in Virtual Reality (VR). Overall, OBS produced more than 85 hours of live VR coverage, captured by custom-developed 360-degree camera systems, to a total of 14 RHB organisations, representing 31 territories.

OBS and Japanese Rights Holder NHK continued their collaboration on 4K/8K Super Hi-Vision (SHV) technology and produced approximately 100 hours of live coverage for Rio, featuring 22.2-channel surround sound.

The '''Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]'': Organización de Solidaridad con los Pueblos de Asia, África y América Latina)'', abbreviated as '''OSPAAAL''', is a [[Cuba]]n political movement with the stated purpose of fighting [[globalisation]], [[imperialism]], [[neoliberalism]] and defending [[human rights]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} It publishes the [[magazine]] ''[[Tricontinental]]''. The OSPAAAL was founded in [[Havana]] in January 1966, after the Tricontinental Conference, a meeting of [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] delegates from [[Guinea]], [[Republic of Congo|the Congo]], [[South Africa]], [[Angola]], [[Vietnam]], [[Syria]], [[North Korea]], the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], Cuba, [[Puerto Rico]], [[Chile]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. [[Mehdi Ben Barka]], the Moroccan leader of the Tricontinental Conference, disappeared the year before.

One of the main purposes of the organisation is to promote the causes of [[socialism]] and [[communism]] in the [[Third World]]; for example, OSPAAAL strongly supported [[Hugo Chávez]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} [[Social development]], which the organization says is a human right, is a recurring theme in OSPAAAL publications.

==History and context==
{{rquote|right|We are following the heroic example of Comandante [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]].| Venezuelan delegate at the first Tricontinental Conference in 1966 &lt;ref name="Kellner90"&gt;''Ernesto "Che" Guevara  (World Leaders Past &amp; Present)'', by Douglas Kellner, 1989, Chelsea House Publishers, {{ISBN|1-55546-835-7}}, pg 90&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The OSPAAAL was born out of the Tricontinental Conference in Havana, which [[Mehdi Ben Barka]] was preparing before his October 1965 assassination. The OSPAA (Organization for Solidarity for the People of Africa and Asia) had gathered itself for the first time in [[Cairo]], Egypt in 1957. 500 delegates from 35 countries represented their [[national liberation movements]] and parties rather than states. It was led by [[Ismaël Touré]], the brother of [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]], president of [[Guinea]]. [[Ismaël Touré]] presided the board responsible of the solidarity funds, assisted by two vice-chairmen: Mehdi Ben Barka of Morocco and Chu Tzu-chi of the People's Republic of China. At that time, AAPSO (Africa Asian People's Solidarity Organization) was debating the inclusion of Cuba and the rest of the Caribbean and Latin America to the group, a question posed again in Cairo in June 1961 by the new commission, the Commission on Neocolonialism, which was presided by Ben Barka.

While the [[Casablanca Group]], founded in 1961, gathered "progressive states" (Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, [[Mali]], [[Libya]], and [[Morocco]]), the OSPAAL was an organization of movements, which aimed at creating national [[economic development]] plans for the newly independent states and break national isolation through [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]. In exile, Ben Barka resided there six months in 1964. [[Amílcar Cabral]], [[Malcolm X]], and [[Che Guevara]] lived in the city around that time. [[Henri Curiel]] was there organizing "solidarity networks," which trained [[African National Congress]] activists. (The ANC had been prohibited in 1960, and Curiel would be murdered in 1978). Ben Barka was going to create an anti-colonialist magazine titled ''The African Review'', but he decided to enlarge the union to Latin America.

After the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961, [[Fidel Castro]] moved even closer to the Soviet Union. In February 1962, Cuba was expelled from the [[Organization of American States]] (OEA). On October 3, 1965, Ben Barka declared in a press conference prior to the Havana conference that the "two currents of the [[world revolution]] would be represented there: the current born with the [[October Revolution]] and the national liberation revolutions' currents."

The fourth congress of the OSPAA, in Accra from May 6 to May 9, 1965, finally agreed on including Latin America and to take in account the founding January 1966 conference in Havana. In July, Medhi Ben Barka, who was presiding the preparatory council, assured the support of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and defined the objectives of the new organization, summed up as "total liberation:" aid to national liberation movements (in particular to the [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian movement]]), intensification of [[armed struggle|violent]] and peaceful struggles on all three continents, support to the [[Cuban Revolution]], suppression of foreign military bases, support of the [[nuclear disarmament]] option, and opposition to [[apartheid]] and [[racial segregation]]. In September, Ben Barka went to Havana to prepare the opening up of the conference on January 3, 1966. However, on October 29, 1965, he was disappeared in [[Paris]], allegedly abducted by Moroccan secret agents. The Havana Conference thus took place without him, and the OSPAAAL was officially founded.

==Posters==
From its foundation until the mid-1980s, OSPAAAL produced brightly coloured [[propaganda]] posters promoting their cause, however, financial difficulty and [[ink]] shortages forced the organization to stop producing these posters. However, in 2000, these posters began to be printed again.

These posters, as they intended to be [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]], usually had their message written in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. As opposed to being put up on walls around Cuba, these posters were instead folded up and stapled into copies of ''Tricontinental'', so that they could be distributed internationally. This allowed OSPAAAL to send its message to its  [[Subscription business model|subscribers]] around the world.

All OSPAAAL-Posters from the beginning until 2003 are documented and indexed in the book ''The Tricontinental Solidarity Poster''.&lt;ref name="Frick"&gt;Frick, Richard. ''The Tricontinental Solidarity Poster'' comedia-Verlag: 2003. {{ISBN|3-7212-0145-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One American, [[Jane Norling]], is among the artists who designed posters for OSPAAAL, and is one of eight women who contributed designs for 22 of the approximately 326 OSPAAAL posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/606934896|title=Revolución! : Cuban poster art|last=1953-|first=Cushing, Lincoln,|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=9780811835824|oclc=606934896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29438">{{Global surveillance}}

The '''origins of [[global surveillance]]''' can be traced back to the late 1940s, when the [[UKUSA Agreement]] was jointly enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States, whose close cooperation eventually culminated in the creation of the global surveillance network, code-named "'''[[ECHELON]]'''", in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nabbali|first=Talitha|author2=Perry, Mark|title=Going for the throat|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|date=March 2004|volume=20|issue=2|pages=84–97|doi=10.1016/S0267-3649(04)00018-4|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364904000184|quote=It wasn't until 1971 that the UKUSA allies began ECHELON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal|1970s Watergate affair]] and a subsequent [[congressional inquiry]] led by Sen. [[Frank Church]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/preemption/telecoms.html Pre-Emption - The Nsa And The Telecoms | Spying On The Home Front | FRONTLINE | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it was revealed that the NSA, in collaboration with Britain's GCHQ, had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti-[[Vietnam War]] leaders such as [[Jane Fonda]] and Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Martin |title=No Holiday |url= |location=New York |publisher=Disinformation Company Ltd |isbn=978-1-932857-29-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, a multi-year investigation by the [[European Parliament]] highlighted the NSA's role in [[Industrial espionage|economic espionage]] in a report entitled 'Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information', in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=Peggy Becker |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=October 1999 |title=DEVELOPMENT OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY AND RISK OF ABUSE OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/cms/cache/offonce/home/publications/studies?page=12 |publisher=STOA, European Parliament |page= |docket= |accessdate=November 3, 2013 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for the general public, it was a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents in June 2013 that first revealed the massive extent of the NSA's spying, both foreign and domestic. Most of these were leaked by an ex-contractor, [[Edward Snowden]]. Even so, a number of these older global surveillance programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[XKeyscore]], and [[Tempora]] were referenced in the 2013 release of thousands of documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/07/15/snowden-has-thousands-of-damaging-nsa-documents-says-greenwald/ Snowden has ‘thousands’ of damaging NSA documents, says Greenwald]&lt;/ref&gt; As confirmed by the NSA's director [[Keith B. Alexander]] on September 26, 2013, the NSA collects and stores all phone records of all American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senators: Limit NSA snooping into US phone records|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/senators-limit-nsa-snooping-us-phone-records|work=Associated Press|accessdate=October 15, 2013|quote="Is it the goal of the NSA to collect the phone records of all Americans?" Udall asked at Thursday's hearing.  "Yes, I believe it is in the nation's best interest to put all the phone records into a lockbox that we could search when the nation needs to do it. Yes," Alexander replied.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the data is kept in large storage facilities such as the [[Utah Data Center]], a US$1.5 billion [[megaproject]] referred to by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as a "symbol of the spy agency's surveillance prowess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Siobhan Gorman|title=Meltdowns Hobble NSA Data Center|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304441404579119490744478398|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=October 19, 2013|quote=The Utah facility, one of the Pentagon's biggest U.S. construction projects, has become a symbol of the spy agency's surveillance prowess, which gained broad attention in the wake of leaks from NSA contractor Edward Snowden.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement "tied the two countries into a worldwide network of listening posts run by [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), the U.K.'s biggest spying organisation, and its U.S. equivalent, the National Security Agency."&lt;ref name="Guardian 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|title=Not so secret: deal at the heart of UK-US intelligence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/25/intelligence-deal-uk-us-released|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 25, 2010|accessdate=June 25, 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, an article titled "Somebody's listening" by [[Duncan Campbell (journalist)|Duncan Campbell]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', described the signals intelligence gathering activities of a program code-named "[[ECHELON]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Campbell |first=Duncan |authorlink=Duncan Campbell (journalist) |title=Somebody's Listening |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |date=August 12, 1988 |url=http://duncan.gn.apc.org/echelon-dc.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103071501/http://duncan.gn.apc.org/echelon-dc.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2007 |accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was engaged by English-speaking World War II [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States (collectively known as [[AUSCANNZUKUS]]). Based on the [[UKUSA Agreement]], it was created to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Eastern Bloc]] allies during the [[Cold War]] in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name = EP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A5-2001-0264+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN |title=On the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system), (2001/2098(INI)) |last=Schmid |first=Gerhard |date=July 11, 2001 |format=PDF |page=194 |publisher=European Parliament: Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System |accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though its existence had long been known, the UKUSA agreement only became public in 2010. It enabled the U.S. and the U.K. to exchange "knowledge from operations involving intercepting, decoding and translating foreign communications." The agreement forbade the parties to reveal its existence to any third party.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2010"/&gt;

By the late 1990s the [[ECHELON]] system was capable of intercepting satellite transmissions, [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) communications (including most Internet traffic), and transmissions carried by microwave. A detailed description of ECHELON was provided by New Zealand journalist [[Nicky Hager]] in his 1996 book "Secret Power". While the existence of ECHELON was denied by some member governments, a report by a committee of the [[European Parliament]] in 2001 confirmed the program's use and warned Europeans about its reach and effects.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;Fiddler, Stephen (July 1, 2013).

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Parliament stated in its report that the term "ECHELON" was used in a number of contexts, but that the evidence presented indicated it was a signals intelligence collection system capable of interception and content inspection of telephone calls, fax, e-mail and other data traffic globally. The report to the European Parliament confirmed that this was a "global system for the interception of private and commercial communications."&lt;ref name=EP/&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]], the scope of domestic spying in the United States increased significantly.

'''''Our World''''' was the first live, international, [[satellite television]] production, which was broadcast on 25 June 1967. Creative artists, including [[the Beatles]], opera singer [[Maria Callas]], and painter [[Pablo Picasso]] – representing nineteen nations – were invited to perform or appear in separate segments featuring their respective countries. The two-and-a-half-hour event had the largest television audience ever up to that date: an estimated 400 to 700 million people around the globe watched the broadcast. Today, it is most famous for the segment from the United Kingdom starring the Beatles. They performed their song "[[All You Need Is Love]]" for the first time to close the broadcast.

[[File:INTELSAT I (Early Bird).jpg|thumb|The [[Intelsat I]] nicknamed "Early Bird", one of the satellites used]]
The project was conceived by [[BBC]] producer [[Aubrey Singer]]. It was transferred to the [[European Broadcasting Union]], but the [[master control]] room for the broadcast was still at the BBC in London. The satellites used were [[Intelsat I]] (known as "Early Bird"), Intelsat 2-2 ("Lani Bird"), Intelsat 2–3 ("Canary Bird"), and [[NASA]]'s [[ATS-1]].&lt;ref name="AirSpaceMag 1996"&gt;

It took ten months to bring everything together. One hitch was the sudden pull-out of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries headed by the [[Soviet Union]] in the week leading up to the broadcast. Apparently it was a protest at the Western nations' response to the [[Six-Day War]].&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;

The ground rules included that no politicians or heads of state could participate in the broadcast. In addition, everything had to be "live", so no use of videotape or film was permitted. Ten thousand technicians, producers and interpreters took part in the broadcast. Each country had its own announcers, due to language issues, and interpreters voiced over the original sound when not in a country's native language. Fourteen countries participated in the production, which was transmitted to 24 countries, with an estimated audience of between 400 and 700 million people.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The opening credits were accompanied by the Our World theme sung in 22 different languages by the [[Vienna Boys' Choir]].&lt;ref name="EBU"&gt;{{cite news|last=Flowers |first=Brian |title=The Technical History of Eurovision |work=EBU Technical Review |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |date=4 July 2007 |url=http://tech.ebu.ch/webdav/site/tech/shared/techreview/trev_311-flowers_eurovision.pdf |accessdate=28 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HeLfdxHb?url=http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreview/trev_311-flowers_eurovision.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's [[CBC Television]] had [[Marshall McLuhan]] being interviewed in a Toronto [[Television studio#Production-control room|television control room]].  At 7:17 pm GMT, the show switched to the United States' segment about the [[Glassboro, New Jersey]] conference between American president [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet premier]] [[Alexei Kosygin]]; since ''Our World'' insisted that no politicians be shown, only the house where the conference was being held was televised. [[National Educational Television]]'s (NET) Dick McCutcheon ended up talking about the impact of the new television technology on a global scale.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;

The show switched back to Canada at 7:18 pm GMT.  Segments that were beamed worldwide were from a Ghost Lake, [[Alberta]] [[ranch]], showing a rancher, and his [[Cutting (sport)|cutting horse]], cutting out a herd of [[cattle]]. The last Canadian segment was from [[Kitsilano Beach]], located in [[Vancouver]]'s [[West Point Grey|Point Grey]] district at 7:19 pm GMT.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;

At 7:20 pm GMT, the program shifted continents to Asia, with Tokyo, Japan being the next segment. It was 4:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time and [[NHK]] showed the construction of the [[Tokyo subway]] system.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt;

The equator was crossed for the first time in the program  when it switched to the Australian contributions, which was at 5:22&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Time in Australia|Australian Eastern Standard Time]] (AEST). This was the most technically complicated point in the broadcast, as both the Japanese and Australian satellite ground stations had to reverse their actions: Tokyo had to go from transmit mode to receive mode, while [[Melbourne]] had to switch from receive to transmit mode.&lt;ref name="AirSpaceMag 1996" /&gt; The first segment dealt with [[W-class Melbourne tram|trams]] leaving the [[South Melbourne tram depot]] with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]]'s Brian King explaining that sunrise was many hours away as it was winter there.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt; Two scientific segments, later on in the broadcast, were also included; one, presented from Canberra by the ABC's Eric Hunter showed experiments being carried out by the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) to extend the frequency of cereal crop cycles, while the second dealt with the [[Parkes Observatory]] tracking a deep space object.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rowsthorn |first=Peter |title=Moment in Time Episode 12: First Satellite Broadcast |work=[[Can We Help?]] |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=4 May 2007 |url=http://abc.net.au/tv/canwehelp/txt/s1914605.htm |accessdate=4 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HeLu7Bh9?url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/canwehelp/txt/s1914605.htm |archivedate=25 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |location=Sydney |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Beatles' sequence ==
[[File:All you need is love.jpg|thumb|right|The Beatles performing "All You Need is Love"]]
The broadcast took place at the height of the [[Vietnam War]]. The Beatles were asked to write a song with a positive message.&lt;ref name="Twenty Years"&gt;{{cite document |last=Sheppard |first=John |publisher=[[ITV Granada|Granada TV]]|title=It was 20 Years Ago Today |date=3 June 1987 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093285/ |accessdate=4 June 2007}} Granada TV documentary shows the Beatles' ''Our World'' broadcast segment.&lt;/ref&gt; At 8:54 GMT the Beatles topped the event with their debut performance of "[[All You Need Is Love]]". The Beatles invited many of their friends to the event to create a festive atmosphere and to join in on the song's chorus. Among the friends were members of [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Keith Moon]] and [[Graham Nash]].&lt;ref name="Twenty Years" /&gt; 

Although the program was originally recorded and transmitted in [[black-and-white]], for its use in the 1995 TV special ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', the [[All You Need Is Love#Live broadcast|Beatles' performance]] on the 1967 program was [[Film colorization|colourised]], using colour photographs taken at the event as a reference.&lt;ref name="Beatles color"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesagain.com/breflib/anthvid.html |title=Anthology Home Video |accessdate=27 June 2010 |author=Sella, Tom |year=1996 |publisher=Beatles Reference Library |quote=Laserdisc 7, Side 1, Chapter 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence opens in its original monochromatic format and rapidly morphs into full colour, conveying the brightly coloured [[flower power]] and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]]-style clothing worn by the Beatles and their guests that was popular during what was subsequently dubbed the "[[Summer of Love]]".&lt;ref name="Beatles color" /&gt;

The '''Oxford Brookes Centre for Nutrition and Health''' is the first research centre in the [[United Kingdom]] dedicated to researching [[functional food]]s.&lt;ref name="nextgenerationfood.com"/&gt;

==History==
The Oxford Brookes Centre for Nutrition and Health opened as the Functional Food Centre at [[Oxford Brookes University]] in early 2009 with a £300,000 grant from the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/healthyeating/5082444/Debunking-food-myths-the-launch-of-the-Functional-Food-Centre.html|title=Debunking food myths: the launch of the Functional Food Centre|author=Rose Prince|date=1 April 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes/&gt; It was formerly known as the Nutrition and Food Research Group, which had been in existence since 1984.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.shs.brookes.ac.uk/research/functional-food/about|website=Functional Food Center|publisher=Oxford Brookes University|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founding director, Jeya Henry, is a consultant to the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]] and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations]] on nutrition assessment, food safety and nutrient requirements.&lt;ref name="nextgenerationfood.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nextgenerationfood.com/article/The-best-remedy/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714175414/http://www.nextgenerationfood.com/article/The-best-remedy/|archive-date=14 July 2011 |title=The best remedy|first=Stacey |last=Sheppard|newspaper=Next Generation Food|publisher=GDS Publishing |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Oxford Brookes academic to help set world guidelines on fat consumption |url=https://www.brookes.ac.uk/about-brookes/news/oxford-brookes-academic-to-help-set-world-guidelines-on-fat-consumption/ |location= |publisher=Oxford Brookes University |agency= |date=8 September 2008 |access-date=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre offers research and consultancy services to the food industry, the United Nations and various Government agencies.&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/features/4205987.Tackling_diseases_of_affluence/|title=Tackling diseases of affluence|author=Reg Little|newspaper=The Oxford Times|date=18 March 2009|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of research==
The Oxford Brookes Centre for Nutrition and Health has the goal of providing scientific information about food and health to consumers, government and the food industry.&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes/&gt; It tests popular claims about food, for example that [[genetically modified crops]] will feed the world, that substances such as [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] in [[fish oil]] will make children more intelligent, or that [[antioxidant]]s can reduce cancer by removing [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; It develops new food products  such as low [[glycemic index]] bread, which reduces [[cholesterol]] and [[blood sugar]] levels and help weight loss.&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes/&gt; It researches lesser-known foods such as [[breadfruit]], [[cassava]], [[sorghum]] and [[millet]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; The health issues that are its research priorities are [[diabetes]], [[obesity]] and the impact of food on age-related problems.&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">'''Policy laundering''' is the disguising of the origins of political [[decision making|decisions]], laws, or international [[treaty|treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hosein |first=Ian |date=2004 |title=The Sources of Laws: Policy Dynamics in a Digital and Terrorized World |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01972240490456854 |journal=The Information Society |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=187–199 |doi=10.1080/01972240490456854 |accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is based on the similar [[money laundering]].

== Hiding responsibility for a policy or decision ==

One common method for policy laundering is the use of international treaties which are formulated in [[secrecy]]. Afterwards it is not possible to find out who advocated for which part of the treaty. Each person can claim that it was not them who demanded a certain paragraph but that they had to agree to the overall "[[compromise]]".

Examples that could be considered as "policy laundering" are [[WIPO]]&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1201_on_20121205210134"&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=844544 |title=Catch 1201: A Legislative History and Content Analysis of the DMCA Exemption Proceedings |author1=Herman, Bill D. |author2=Oscar H. Gandy, Jr. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Peter K., The Political Economy of Data Protection, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1046781 Chicago-Kent Law Review, Vol. 83, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Michael |last=Geist |title=Government Should Lift Veil on ACTA Secrecy |url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/3013/135/ |date=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[[Harmonization]] is the process through which a common set of policies are established across jurisdictions to remove irregularities. Regulations can change in any direction, however: regulations may be pushed to the [[lowest common denominator]]; but may equally benefit from the '[[California effect]]', where one regulator pushes for the highest standards, setting models for others to follow. Harmonization requires further interrogation, however. In their review of global business regulation, Braithwaite and Drahos find that some countries (notably the U.S. and the UK) push for certain regulatory standards in international bodies and then bring those regulations home under the requirement of harmonization and the guise of [[multilateralism]]; this is what we refer to as policy laundering.|Ian Hosein, 2004&lt;ref&gt;
Hosein, Ian, 2004, [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p73882_index.html "International Relations Theories and the Regulation of International Dataflows: Policy Laundering and other International Policy Dynamics"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Hiding the real objective of a policy ==

One manifestation of policy laundering is claiming a different underlying objective for a policy than is actually the case. The usual reason for politicians following this approach is that the real objective is unpopular with the public. The usual process is to conflate the issue being addressed with an unrelated matter of great public concern. The intervention pursued is presented as addressing an issue of great public concern rather than the underlying objective.

== Circumventing the regular approval process ==

Yet another manifestation of policy laundering is to implement legal policy which a subset of legislators desire but would normally not be able to obtain approval through regular means.

{{quote|ACTA is legislation laundering on an international level of what would be very difficult to get through most Parliaments. |Stavros Lambrinidis, Member of European Parliament, S and D, Greece&lt;ref&gt;[[Stavros Lambrinidis]], Vice President of European Parliament (2009), S and D, Greece, [http://www.stopacta.info/ "Stop Acta"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An example of policy laundering where law was enacted and enforced despite both state and federal courts declaring the law unconstitutional is the ''[[Missouri v. Holland]]'' case. At that time, Congress attempted to protect [[Bird migration|migratory birds]] by statutory law.&lt;ref&gt;An Act Making Appropriations for the Department of Agriculture for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1914, Act of March 4, 1913, 38 Stat. 828, c. 145, at page 847.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both state and federal courts declared that law [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Shauver'', 214 Fed. 154 (E.D. Ark. 1914), ''United States v. McCullagh'', 221 Fed. 288 (D.Kan. 1915), ''State v. Sawyer'', 94 A. 886 (Maine 1915), and ''State v. McCullagh'', 153 P. 557 (Kan. 557).&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be denied, authorized parties subsequently negotiated and ratified a treaty with Canada to achieve the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds of August 16, 1916, T.S. No. 628, 39 Stat. 1702.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the treaty was in place, Congress then passed the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] to enforce the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Act of July 3, 1918, c. 128, 40 Stat. 755. Codified at 18 U.S.C.§703.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Missouri v. Holland'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] upheld that the new law was constitutional in order to support the treaty.

It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policylaundering.org/PolicyLaunderingIntro.html The Policy Laundering Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACLU's [https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/aclu-announces-international-project-stop-policy-laundering Stop Policy Laundering Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Steinhardt (ACLU) [http://26konferencja.giodo.gov.pl/data/resources/SteinhardtB_paper.pdf "The Problem of Policy Laundering"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{by whom|date=February 2012}} that policy laundering has become common political practice in areas related to [[terrorism]] and the erosion of [[civil liberties]]. In the air-travel industry, an example of policy laundering might be the requirement for passengers to show photographic identification. This was presented as addressing [[airport security|security]] concerns, but from the airline's perspective the measure had the important effect of ending unauthorised resale by passengers of unused tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/now-it-seems-we-need-a-passport-inside-canada/article741627/ |title=Now it seems we need a passport inside Canada |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2018 |via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Population health]], a field which focuses on the improvement of the health outcomes for a group of individuals, has been described as consisting of three components: "health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and policies and interventions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kindig|first=David|last2=Stoddart|first2=Greg|date=2016-10-15|title=What Is Population Health?|pmc=1447747|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=93|issue=3|pages=380–383|issn=0090-0036|pmid=12604476|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.3.380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policies and Interventions define the methods in which [[Health outcomes research|health outcomes]] and patterns of [[health determinant]]s are implemented. Policies which are helpful "improve the conditions under which people live".&lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; Interventions encourage healthy behaviors for individuals or populations through "program elements or strategies designed to produce behavior changes or improve health status".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.mo.gov/data/interventionmica/index_4.html|title=What is an intervention?|website=health.mo.gov|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies and interventions are needed due to the inequalities amongst populations and the inconsistent way care is administered. Policies can include "necessary community and personal social and health services" &lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; as well as taxes on alcohol and soft drinks and implement smoking cessation policies. Interventions can include therapeutic or preventative health care and may also include actions taken by the individual or by someone on behalf of the individual. The application of population health is determined by the policies and interventions which can be implemented within an organization, city, state or country.

== Common methodology ==
Countries, states, provinces and providers across the globe are shifting towards better systems to respond to inconsistent health outcomes, mitigate decreasing margins and replace outdated methods such as [[fee-for-service]] health delivery. Payment model reforms, including the [[Accountable Care Organization]] (ACO), provide roadmaps for healthcare reform and drive many of its constituents towards more effective and innovative means for improving health outcomes. Population health management is a common approach for resolving these challenges but it involves new methods, tools, systems and implementations to correct inefficiencies and improve health outcomes.

Population health tools and computer systems include data exchange, large datasets, and advanced software which are used to supply data scientists and research teams with appropriate information which can then be used by policy makers and change agents. This method helps to set policies around population health as well as intervention strategies which are then used to respond to the needs of a population.

== Policies and Policymakers ==
Policy for population health "sets priorities" &lt;ref name=Milio&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milio|first=N|date=2016-10-10|title=Glossary: healthy public policy*|pmc=1731988|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=55|issue=9|pages=622–623|doi=10.1136/jech.55.9.622|issn=0143-005X|pmid=11511639}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are a "guide to action to change what would otherwise occur".&lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; Policies are based on "social sciences of sociology, economics, demography, public health, anthropology, and epidemiology" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kindig|first=David A|date=2016-10-13|title=Understanding Population Health Terminology|pmc=2690307|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=85|issue=1|pages=139–161|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2007.00479.x|issn=0887-378X|pmid=17319809}}&lt;/ref&gt; and determine how outcomes can be accomplished are implemented at various levels. Such guides determine laws, policies, and ordinances and are defined by policymakers. Examples of policies include "smoking bans, excise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, seat belt laws, water fluoridation, and restaurant menu labeling".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.improvingpopulationhealth.org/blog/policies-and-programs.html&lt;/ref&gt; They may be applied to a commercial establishment such as a restaurant, business workplace or within a city or state level. Policies should be evidence based and require academic studies or research to support the approach. This will assure that the appropriate measures needed for each demographic are promoted to encourage the necessary intervention practices which can be applied to each population or to the nation as a whole.

Policymakers can be classified as both private and public and are defined as someone who is in a position of authority to implement health policies. A public policy maker could be a government official and a private policymaker could be a business owner or administrator. Policymakers are influenced by, and can also be, change agents. Change agents include "legislators in Washington, an attorney general, regulators at the FDA, an advocacy group or other organizations that clearly have influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

== Political strategy ==
The goal for any political strategies surrounding population health is to "improve chances of success for policy adoption and implementation".&lt;ref name=Milio/&gt; Such strategies include the creation of funds to support initiatives and the construction of strategies which limit conflicts of interest in the implementation of public policy.

=== Tobacco Control ===
A political strategy implemented to limit the sale and exposure to tobacco products and restrict the tobacco company's ability to benefit politically from charitable donations is the creation of the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control|World Health Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)]] treaty. The legally binding document is supported by numerous countries, government/nongovernment agencies and provides the necessary power to prevent negative influences on population health policies.

== Interventions ==
Interventions in population health "shift the distribution of health risk by addressing the underlying social, economic and environmental conditions"&lt;ref name=Hawe&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawe|first=Penelope|last2=Potvin|first2=Louise|date=2017-02-01|title=What is population health intervention research?|pmid=19263977|journal=Canadian Journal of Public Health = Revue Canadienne De Santé Publique|volume=100|issue=1|pages=Suppl I8–14|issn=0008-4263}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are implemented through "programs or policies designed and developed in the health sector, but they are more likely to be in sectors elsewhere, such as education, housing or employment".&lt;ref name=Hawe/&gt; They are aimed at reducing such things as [[childhood obesity]], [[cardiovascular disease]], smoking and mental health issues throughout society. The means in which interventions are devised is through extensive research and contributions from medical scientists, researchers, and medical professionals. They are implemented by but are not limited to educators, practicing physicians, business administrators and mental health professionals.

== Approaches and Implementations ==

A typical approach includes assessing the conditions and possible improvements which can be made within the social determinants that have been identified. Each approach is handled at a state or health plan level.

One example was a workplace in China which implemented policies and interventions for their staff to fight depression. By recognizing the importance of mental health, they were able to reduce depression and improve job satisfaction across the company. The company published its research and findings to promote "enterprises taking more responsibility for the provision of mental health services to their employees".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Jing|last2=Buys|first2=Nicholas|last3=Wang|first3=Xinchao|date=2013-05-14|title=Effectiveness of a Workplace-Based Intervention Program to Promote Mental Health among Employees in Privately Owned Enterprises in China|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/pop.2012.0113|journal=Population Health Management|volume=16|issue=6|pages=406–414|doi=10.1089/pop.2012.0113|issn=1942-7891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example was the implementation of a smoking cessation program to the province of Ontario. Studies were performed on weekly visit rates to psychiatric emergency departments before and after the implementation. The result was a "15.5% reduction in patient visits for patients with a primary diagnosis of psychotic disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurdyak|first=Paul|last2=Cairney|first2=John|last3=Sarnocinska-Hart|first3=Anna|last4=Callahan|first4=Russell C.|last5=Strike|first5=Carol|date=2008-11-01|title=The impact of a smoking cessation policy on visits to a psychiatric emergency department|pmid=19087472|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry. Revue Canadienne De Psychiatrie|volume=53|issue=11|pages=779–782|issn=0706-7437|doi=10.1177/070674370805301110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inequalities and Variance of Implementation ==

As is the common understanding of population health, health inequalities, defined as a "generic term used to designate differences, variations, and disparities in the health achievements of individuals and groups",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pmc = 1732240 | title =A Glossary for Health Inequalities | authors= Kawachi, I, S Subramanian, and N Almeida-Filho | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 56 | pages = 647–652
 | year = 2002 | pmid=12177079 | doi=10.1136/jech.56.9.647}}&lt;/ref&gt; must be considered to correctly implement the most effective policies and interventions. Based on a population and its socioeconomic, geographic, ethnicity and other factors, policies and interventions may vary. Policies implemented for one population may be less effective and more costly than it would be for another similar population. For example, US policies tend to be more costly than European and have less impact. Research has shown that in some instances, "Americans had worse outcomes than their international peers"&lt;ref name=Squires&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Squires|first=David|last2=Anderson|first2=Chloe|title=U.S. Health Care from a Global Perspective|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also had "the lowest life expectancy at birth of the countries studied".&lt;ref name=Squires/&gt;

'''Satellite television''' is a service that delivers television programming to viewers by relaying it from a [[communications satellite]] orbiting the Earth directly to the viewer's location.&lt;ref&gt;ITU Radio Regulations, Section IV. Radio Stations and Systems – Article 1.39, definition: ''Broadcasting-satellite service''&lt;/ref&gt;  The signals are received via an outdoor [[parabolic antenna]] commonly referred to as a [[satellite dish]] and a [[low-noise block downconverter]].

A satellite receiver then decodes the desired [[television programme]] for viewing on a [[television set]]. Receivers can be external [[set-top box]]es, or a built-in [[tuner (television)|television tuner]]. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services. It is usually the only television available in many remote geographic areas without [[terrestrial television]] or [[cable television]] service.

Modern systems signals are relayed from a [[direct broadcast satellite|communications satellite]] on the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] frequencies (12–18&amp;nbsp;GHz) requiring only a small dish less than a meter in diameter.&lt;ref name="m101" /&gt;  The first satellite TV systems were an obsolete type now known as [[television receive-only]]. These systems received weaker analog signals transmitted in the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] (4–8&amp;nbsp;GHz) from [[Fixed Service Satellite|FSS]] type satellites, requiring the use of large 2–3-meter dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed "big dish" systems, and were more expensive and less popular.&lt;ref name="fcc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Installing Consumer-Owned Antennas and Satellite Dishes|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/consumerdish.html|publisher=FCC|accessdate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early systems used [[analog signal]]s, but modern ones use [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|digital signals]] which allow transmission of the modern television standard [[high-definition television]], due to the significantly improved [[spectral efficiency]] of digital broadcasting. As of 2018, [[Star One C2]] from Brazil is the only remaining satellite broadcasting in analog signals, as well as one channel ([[C-SPAN]]) on [[AMC-11]] from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sathint.com/search?custom=analog&lt;/ref&gt;

Different receivers are required for the two types. Some transmissions and channels are unencrypted and therefore [[free-to-air]] or [[free-to-view]], while many other channels are transmitted with encryption ([[pay television]]), requiring the viewer to subscribe and pay a monthly fee to receive the programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell|first=Dennis|last2=Cotter|first2=Susan|year=1998|title=Copyright Infringement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRJCwqzE3iwC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=satellite+tv+free+to+air+free+to+view+must+pay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4lkbVObmJsvLggTq8IEY&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=satellite%20tv%20free%20to%20air%20free%20to%20view%20must%20pay&amp;f=false|location=|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=90-247-3002-3|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellites used for broadcasting television are usually in a [[geostationary orbit]] {{convert|37,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the earth's [[equator]].  The advantage of this orbit is that the satellite's orbital period equals the rotation rate of the Earth, so the satellite appears at a fixed position in the sky.  Thus the satellite dish antenna which receives the signal can be aimed permanently at the location of the satellite, and does not have to track a moving satellite.  A few systems instead use a highly elliptical orbit with [[inclination]] of +/−63.4 degrees and orbital period of about twelve hours, known as a [[Molniya orbit]].

Satellite television, like other communications relayed by satellite, starts with a transmitting antenna located at an [[uplink]] facility.{{sfn|Pattan|1993|p=207}} Uplink satellite dishes are very large, as much as 9 to 12 meters (30 to 40 feet) in diameter.{{sfn|Pattan|1993|p=207}} The increased diameter results in more accurate aiming and increased signal strength at the satellite.{{sfn|Pattan|1993|p=207}} The uplink dish is pointed toward a specific satellite and the uplinked signals are transmitted within a specific frequency range, so as to be received by one of the [[transponder]]s tuned to that frequency range aboard that satellite.{{sfn|Pattan|1993|p=330}} The transponder re-transmits the signals back to Earth at a different frequency (a process known as translation, used to avoid interference with the uplink signal), typically in the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] (4–8&amp;nbsp;GHz), [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band]] (12–18&amp;nbsp;GHz), or both.{{sfn|Pattan|1993|p=207}} The leg of the signal path from the satellite to the receiving Earth station is called the downlink.{{sfn|Pattan|1993|p=327}}

A typical satellite has up to 32 K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band or 24 C-band transponders, or more for K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;/C hybrid satellites.{{sfn|Mott, Sheldon|2000|p=253}} Typical transponders each have a bandwidth between 27 and 50&amp;nbsp;MHz.{{sfn|Mott, Sheldon|2000|p=253}} Each geostationary C-band satellite needs to be spaced 2° longitude from the next satellite to avoid interference; for K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; the spacing can be 1°.{{sfn|Mott, Sheldon|2000|p=268}} This means that there is an upper limit of 360/2 = 180 geostationary C-band satellites or 360/1 = 360 geostationary K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band satellites.{{sfn|Mott, Sheldon|2000|p=268}} C-band transmission is susceptible to terrestrial interference while K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band transmission is affected by [[Rain fade|rain]] (as water is an excellent absorber of microwaves at this particular frequency).{{sfn|Mott, Sheldon|2000|p=115}} The latter is even more adversely affected by ice crystals in thunder clouds.{{sfn|Mott, Sheldon|2000|p=115}}

On occasion, [[sun outage]] will occur when the sun lines up directly behind the geostationary satellite to which the receiving antenna is pointed.{{sfn|Tirro|1993|p=279}}
The downlink satellite signal, quite weak after traveling the great distance (see [[inverse-square law]]), is collected with a [[parabolic reflector|parabolic]] receiving dish, which reflects the weak signal to the dish's focal point.{{sfn|Minoli|2009|p=60}} Mounted on brackets at the dish's focal point is a device called a [[feedhorn]] or collector.{{sfn|Minoli|2009|p=27}} The feedhorn is a section of [[waveguide]] with a flared front-end that gathers the signals at or near the focal point and conducts them to a probe or pickup connected to a [[Low-noise block converter|low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB).{{sfn|Minoli|2009|p=194}} The LNB amplifies the signals and [[Downconverter|downconverts]] them to a lower block of [[intermediate frequency|intermediate frequencies]] (IF), usually in the [[L band|L-band]].{{sfn|Minoli|2009|p=194}}

The original C-band satellite television systems used a [[low-noise amplifier]] (LNA) connected to the feedhorn at the focal point of the dish.&lt;ref name="ewww"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|year=1985|title=Europe's Best Kept Secret|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDFWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=low-noise+amplifier+connected+to+the+feedhorn+at+the+focal+point+of+the+dish+c-band&amp;dq=low-noise+amplifier+connected+to+the+feedhorn+at+the+focal+point+of+the+dish+c-band&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XhLZU6aaE-rgsAS41oHICA&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA|journal=Electronics World + Wireless World|publisher=Reed Business Publishing|volume=95|issue=|pages=60–62|doi=|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amplified signal, still at the higher microwave frequencies, had to be fed via very expensive low-loss 50-ohm impedance [[Coaxial cable#Hard line|gas filled hardline]] [[coaxial cable]] with relatively complex [[N connector|N-connectors]] to an indoor receiver or, in other designs, a downconverter (a mixer and a voltage-tuned oscillator with some filter circuitry) for downconversion to an intermediate frequency.&lt;ref name="ewww"/&gt; The channel selection was controlled typically by a voltage tuned oscillator with the tuning voltage being fed via a separate cable to the headend, but this design evolved.&lt;ref name="ewww"/&gt;

Designs for [[microstrip]]-based converters for [[amateur radio]] frequencies were adapted for the 4&amp;nbsp;GHz C-band.&lt;ref name="hrmz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|year=1984|title=Microstrip Impedance Program|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ztQAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=microstrip+amateur+radio+c-band&amp;dq=microstrip+amateur+radio+c-band&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LxTZU7jEJ9PhsAS76ICwBw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA|journal=Ham Radio Magazine|publisher=Communications Technology, Incorporated|volume=17|issue=|pages=84|doi=|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to these designs was concept of block downconversion of a range of frequencies to a lower, more easily handled IF.&lt;ref name="hrmz"/&gt;

The advantages of using an LNB are that cheaper cable can be used to connect the indoor receiver to the satellite television dish and LNB, and that the technology for handling the signal at L-band and UHF was far cheaper than that for handling the signal at C-band frequencies.&lt;ref name="mji"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|year=2000|title=Microwave Journal International|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=sOLXU9rDHeTgsATVz4KgCg&amp;id=X0pKAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=lnb+70+ohm+satellite+75+ohm&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=lnb+70+ohm+satellite+75+ohm|journal=[[Microwave Journal International]]|publisher=[[Horizon House]]|volume=43|issue=10-12|pages=26–28|doi=|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to cheaper technology from the hardline and N-connectors of the early C-band systems to the cheaper and simpler 75-ohm cable and [[F connector|F-connectors]] allowed the early satellite television receivers to use, what were in reality, modified [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] television tuners which selected the satellite television channel for down conversion to a lower [[intermediate frequency]] centered on 70&amp;nbsp;MHz, where it was demodulated.&lt;ref name="mji"/&gt; This shift allowed the satellite television [[Direct To Home|DTH]] industry to change from being a largely hobbyist one where only small numbers of systems costing thousands of US dollars were built, to a far more commercial one of mass production.&lt;ref name="mji"/&gt;

In the United States, service providers use the [[intermediate frequency]] ranges of 950–2150&amp;nbsp;MHz to carry the signal from the LNBF at the dish down to the receiver. This allows for transmission of UHF signals along the same span of coaxial wire at the same time. In some applications ([[DirecTV]] AU9-S and AT-9), ranges of the lower [[B-band]]{{Ambiguous|reason=Exactly which frequencies? B-band is ambiguous|date=July 2016}} and 2250–3000&amp;nbsp;MHz, are used. Newer LNBFs in use by DirecTV, called SWM (Single Wire Multiswitch), are used to implement [[single cable distribution]] and use a wider frequency range of 2–2150&amp;nbsp;MHz.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The satellite receiver or [[set-top box]] demodulates and converts the signals to the desired form (outputs for television, audio, data, etc.).{{sfn|Dodd|2002|p=308}}  Often, the receiver includes the capability to selectively [[scrambler|unscramble]] or [[encryption|decrypt]] the received signal to provide premium services to some subscribers; the receiver is then called an [[integrated receiver/decoder]] or IRD.{{sfn|Dodd|2002|p=72}} Low-loss cable (e.g. [[RG-6]], [[RG-11]], etc.) is used to connect the receiver to the LNBF or LNB.{{sfn|Minoli|2009|p=194}} [[RG-59]] is not recommended for this application as it is not technically designed to carry frequencies above 950&amp;nbsp;MHz, but may work in some circumstances, depending on the quality of the coaxial wire, signal levels, cable length, etc.{{sfn|Minoli|2009|p=194}}

A practical problem relating to home satellite reception is that an LNB can basically only handle a single receiver.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Barry|last2=|first2=|year=1995|title=Leaky dishes drown out terrestrial TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lz4eAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=LNB+can+only+handle+a+single+receiver+problem&amp;dq=LNB+can+only+handle+a+single+receiver+problem&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pjTZU5-RJfjKsQTi6oHgDA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA|journal=[[New Scientist]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|volume=145|issue=|pages=19–22|doi=|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the LNB is translating two different [[circular polarization]]s (right-hand and left-hand) and, in the case of K-band, two different frequency bands (lower and upper) to the same frequency range on the cable.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt; Depending on which frequency and polarization a transponder is using, the satellite receiver has to switch the LNB into one of four different modes in order to receive a specific "channel".&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt; This is handled by the receiver using the [[DiSEqC]] protocol to control the LNB mode.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt; If several satellite receivers are to be attached to a single dish, a so-called [[multiswitch]] will have to be used in conjunction with a special type of LNB.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt; There are also LNBs available with a multiswitch already integrated.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt; This problem becomes more complicated when several receivers are to use several dishes (or several LNBs mounted in a single dish) pointing to different satellites.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt;

A common solution for consumers wanting to access multiple satellites is to deploy a single dish with a single LNB and to rotate the dish using an electric motor. The axis of rotation has to be set up in the north-south direction and, depending on the geographical location of the dish, have a specific vertical tilt. Set up properly the motorized dish when turned will sweep across all possible positions for satellites lined up along the [[geostationary orbit]] directly above the equator. The disk will then be capable of receiving any geostationary satellite that is visible at the specific location, i.e. that is above the horizon. The [[DiSEqC]] protocol has been extended to encompass commands for steering dish rotors.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

There are five major components in a satellite system: the programming source, the broadcast center, the satellite, the [[satellite dish]], and the [[Set-top box|receiver]]. "Direct broadcast" satellites used for transmission of satellite television signals are generally in [[geostationary orbit]] {{convert|37,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the earth's [[equator]].&lt;ref name="sspt"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GJWEro9ea4C&amp;dq=sun+outage+satellite&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Satellite Systems:Principles and Technologies|last=Pattan|first=Bruno|date=31 March 1993|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780442013578|location=Berlin|page=|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason for using this orbit is that the satellite circles the Earth at the same rate as the Earth rotates, so the satellite appears at a fixed point in the sky.  Thus satellite dishes can be aimed permanently at that point, and don't need a tracking system to turn to follow a moving satellite.  A few satellite TV systems use satellites in a [[Molniya orbit]], a highly [[Elliptical orbit|elliptical]] orbit with [[inclination]] of +/-63.4 degrees and orbital period of about twelve hours.

Satellite television, like other communications relayed by satellite, starts with a transmitting antenna located at an [[uplink]] facility.&lt;ref name="sspt" /&gt; Uplink facilities transmit the signal to the satellite over a narrow beam of [[microwave]]s, typically in the [[C band (NATO)|C-band]] frequency range due to its resistance to [[rain fade]].&lt;ref name="sspt" /&gt; Uplink satellite dishes are very large, often as much as 9 to 12 metres (30 to 40 feet) in diameter&lt;ref name="sspt" /&gt; to achieve accurate aiming and increased signal strength at the satellite, to improve reliability.&lt;ref name="sspt" /&gt; The uplink dish is pointed toward a specific satellite and the uplinked signals are transmitted within a specific frequency range, so as to be received by one of the [[transponder]]s tuned to that frequency range aboard that satellite.&lt;ref name="sspt" /&gt; The transponder then converts the signals to [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]], a process known as "translation," and transmits them back to earth to be received by home satellite stations.&lt;ref name="sspt" /&gt;

The downlinked satellite signal, weaker after traveling the great distance (see [[inverse-square law]]), is collected by using a rooftop [[Parabolic antenna|parabolic]] receiving dish ("[[satellite dish]]"), which reflects the weak signal to the dish's focal point.&lt;ref name="sseipv6"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yJi1UQDPp8C&amp;dq=feedhorn+satellite+system&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Satellite Systems Engineering in an IPv6 Environment|last=Minoli|first=Daniel|date=3 February 2009|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=978-1420078688|location=[[Boca Raton, Florida]]|page=|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mounted on brackets at the dish's [[Focus (optics)|focal point]] is a [[feedhorn]]&lt;ref name="sseipv6" /&gt; which passes the signals through a [[waveguide]] to a device called a [[low-noise block converter]] (LNB) or low noise converter (LNC) attached to the horn.&lt;ref name="sseipv6" /&gt; The LNB amplifies the weak signals, filters the block of frequencies in which the satellite television signals are transmitted, and converts the block of frequencies to a lower frequency range in the [[L-band]] range.&lt;ref name="sseipv6" /&gt;  The signal is then passed through a [[coaxial cable]] into the residence to the satellite television receiver, a [[set-top box]] next to the television.

The reason for using the LNB to do the frequency translation at the dish is so that the signal can be carried into the residence using cheap [[coaxial cable]].  To transport the signal into the house at its original K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band [[microwave]] frequency would require an expensive [[waveguide]], a metal pipe to carry the radio waves.&lt;ref name="mji2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|year=2000|title=Microwave Journal International|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=sOLXU9rDHeTgsATVz4KgCg&amp;id=X0pKAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=lnb+70+ohm+satellite+75+ohm&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=lnb+70+ohm+satellite+75+ohm|journal=[[Microwave Journal International]]|publisher=[[Horizon House]]|volume=43|issue=10–12|pages=26–28|doi=|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cable connecting the receiver to the LNB are of the low loss type [[RG-6]], quad shield RG-6, or RG-11.&lt;ref name="egt"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4POZ66FaS0C&amp;pg=PA308&amp;dq=set-top+box+converts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kuXXU-7uIoO_sQSC6YD4Cg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=set-top%20box%20converts&amp;f=false|title=The Essential Guide to Telecommunications|last=Dodd|first=Annabel Z.|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|year=2002|isbn=0130649074|edition=5th|location=[[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey]]|pages=307–10|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RG-59]] is not recommended for this application as it is not technically designed to carry frequencies above 950&amp;nbsp;MHz, but will work in many circumstances, depending on the quality of the coaxial wire.&lt;ref name="egt" /&gt;  The shift to more affordable technology from the 50{{nbsp}}ohm impedance cable and [[N connector|N-connector]]s of the early C-band systems to the cheaper 75{{nbsp}}ohm technology and [[F connector|F-connector]]s allowed the early satellite television receivers to use, what were in reality, modified [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] television tuners which selected the satellite television channel for down conversion to another lower [[intermediate frequency]] centered on 70&amp;nbsp;MHz where it was demodulated.&lt;ref name="mji2" /&gt;

An LNB can only handle a single receiver.&lt;ref name="newscientist2"/&gt; This is due to the fact that the LNB is mapping two different circular polarisations – right hand and left hand – and in the case of the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band two different reception bands – lower and upper – to one and the same frequency band on the cable, and is a practical problem for home satellite reception.&lt;ref name="newscientist2" /&gt; Depending on which frequency a transponder is transmitting at and on what polarisation it is using, the satellite receiver has to switch the LNB into one of four different modes in order to receive a specific desired program on a specific transponder.&lt;ref name="newscientist2" /&gt; The receiver uses the [[DiSEqC]] protocol to control the LNB mode, which handles this.&lt;ref name="newscientist2" /&gt; If several satellite receivers are to be attached to a single dish a so-called [[multiswitch]] must be used in conjunction with a special type of LNB.&lt;ref name="newscientist2" /&gt; There are also LNBs available with a multiswitch already integrated.&lt;ref name="newscientist2" /&gt; This problem becomes more complicated when several receivers use several dishes or several LNBs mounted in a single dish are aimed at different satellites.&lt;ref name="newscientist2" /&gt;

The [[set-top box]] selects the channel desired by the user by filtering that channel from the multiple channels received from the satellite, converts the signal to a lower [[intermediate frequency]], [[Decryption|decrypts]] the [[Encryption|encrypted]] signal,  [[Demodulation|demodulates]] the radio signal and sends the resulting video signal to the television through a cable.&lt;ref name="egt" /&gt;  To decrypt the signal the receiver box must be "activated" by the satellite company.  If the customer fails to pay his monthly bill the box is "deactivated" by a signal from the company, and the system will not work until the company reactivates it.  Some receivers are capable of [[Encryption|decrypting]] the received signal itself. These receivers are called [[integrated receiver/decoder]]s or IRDs.&lt;ref name="egt" /&gt;

Analog television which was distributed via satellite was usually sent scrambled or unscrambled in [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], or [[SECAM]] television broadcast standards. The analog signal is [[frequency modulated]] and is converted from an FM signal to what is referred to as [[baseband]]. This baseband comprises the video signal and the audio subcarrier(s). The audio subcarrier is further demodulated to provide a raw audio signal.

Later signals were digitized television signal or multiplex of signals, typically [[Phase-shift keying|QPSK]]. In general, digital television, including that transmitted via satellites, is based on open standards such as [[MPEG-2|MPEG]] and [[DVB-S]]/[[DVB-S2]] or [[ISDB-S]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The [[conditional access]] encryption/scrambling methods include [[NDS Group|NDS]], [[BISS]], [[Conax]], [[Digicipher]], Irdeto, [[Cryptoworks]], [[DG Crypt]], [[Beta digital]], [[SECA Mediaguard]], [[Logiways]], [[Nagravision]], [[PowerVu]], [[Viaccess]], [[Videocipher]], and [[VideoGuard]]. Many conditional access systems have been compromised.

=== Sun outage ===
An event called [[sun outage]] occurs when the sun lines up directly behind the satellite in the field of view of the receiving satellite dish.&lt;ref name="scsd"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AdwFdgykaMUC&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=sun+outage+satellite&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yNrXU6HVILfMsQTLvoDYCw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sun%20outage%20satellite&amp;f=false|title=Satellite Communication Systems Design|last=Tirró|first=S.|date=30 June 1993|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0306441479|location=[[Berlin]]|pages=279–80|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens for about a 10-minute period daily around midday, twice every year for a two-week period in the spring and fall around the [[equinox]].  During this period, the sun is within the [[main lobe]] of the dish's reception pattern, so the strong microwave [[Radio noise|noise]] emitted by the sun on the same frequencies used by the satellite's transponders drowns out reception.&lt;ref name="scsd" /&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]] has approximately 160 digital channels (including the regional variations of [[BBC]] channels, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] channels, [[Channel 4]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]) that are broadcast without encryption from the [[Astra 28.2°E]] satellite constellation, and receivable on any [[DVB-S]] receiver (a [[DVB-S2]] receiver is required for certain high definition television services). Most of these channels are included within the [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky]] [[EPG]], and an increasing number within the [[Freesat]] EPG.

[[India]]'s national broadcaster, [[Doordarshan]], promotes a free-to-air DBS package as "[[DD Free Dish]]", which is provided as in-fill for the country's terrestrial transmission network. It is broadcast from [[GSAT-15]] at 93.5°E and contains about 80 FTA channels.

While originally launched as [[Backhaul (TV industry)|backhaul]] for their [[digital terrestrial television]] service, a large number of French channels are free-to-air on satellites at 5°W, and have recently been announced as being official in-fill for the DTT network.

In North America (United States, [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]]) there are over 80 FTA digital channels available on [[Galaxy 19]] (with the majority being ethnic or religious in nature). Other FTA satellites include [[AMC-4]], [[AMC-6]], [[Galaxy 18]], and [[Satmex]] 5. A company called [[GloryStar]] promotes FTA religious broadcasters on [[Galaxy 19]].

===Television receive-only===
{{main article|Television receive-only}}
[[File:Satellite dish 1 C-Band.jpg|190px|thumbnail|left|A C-band satellite dish used by TVRO systems.]]
The term [[Television receive-only]], or TVRO, arose during the early days of satellite television reception to differentiate it from commercial satellite television uplink and downlink operations (transmit and receive). This was the primary method of satellite television transmissions before the satellite television industry shifted, with the launch of higher powered DBS satellites in the early 1990s which transmitted their signals on the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band frequencies.&lt;ref name=fcc/&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;James, Meg.

Los Angeles Times, July 26, 2007. Retrieved on May 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite television channels at that time were intended to be used by [[cable television]] networks rather than received by home viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 1986|title=Satellite Communications Training from NRI!|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=113OPTBSLVkC&amp;dq=tvro&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|journal=Popular Science|volume=228|location=|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early satellite television receiver systems were largely constructed by hobbyists and engineers. These early TVRO systems operated mainly on the C-band frequencies and the dishes required were large; typically over 3 meters (10&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter.{{sfn|Prentiss|1989|p=274}} Consequently, TVRO is often referred to as "big dish" or "Big Ugly Dish" (BUD) satellite television.

TVRO systems were designed to receive analog and digital [[Communications satellite|satellite]] feeds of both television or audio from both C-band and K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band [[transponder]]s on [[Fixed Service Satellite|FSS]]-type satellites.{{sfn|Prentiss|1989|p=246}}{{sfn|Prentiss|1989|p=1}} The higher frequency K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band systems tend to resemble DBS systems and can use a smaller dish antenna because of the higher power transmissions and greater antenna gain. TVRO systems tend to use larger rather than smaller satellite dish antennas, since it is more likely that the owner of a TVRO system would have a C-band-only setup rather than a K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band-only setup. Additional receiver boxes allow for different types of digital satellite signal reception, such as DVB/MPEG-2 and [[4DTV]].

The narrow beam width of a normal parabolic satellite antenna means it can only receive signals from a single satellite at a time.{{sfn|Prentiss|1989|p=293}} [[Simulsat]] or the Vertex-RSI TORUS, is a quasi-parabolic satellite earthstation antenna that is capable of receiving satellite transmissions from 35 or more C- and K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band satellites simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=1 November 2009|title=Sensing SATCOM Success Is New Simulsat From ATCi|url=http://www.satnews.com/story.php?number=1617607397|newspaper=Satnews|location=|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of the satellite TV industry, 1976–1980===
The satellite television industry developed first in the US from the [[cable television]] industry as communication satellites were being used to distribute television programming to remote [[cable television headend]]s. [[HBO|Home Box Office]] (HBO), [[Turner Broadcasting System]] (TBS), and [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN, later [[Freeform (TV channel)|The Family Channel]]) were among the first to use satellite television to deliver programming. [[Taylor Howard]] of [[San Andreas, California|San Andreas]], [[California]] became the first person to receive C-band satellite signals with his home-built system in 1976.&lt;ref name="tayhoward"&gt;{{cite news|last=Feder|first=Barnaby J.|date=15 November 2002|title=Taylor Howard, 70, Pioneer In Satellite TV for the Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/15/business/taylor-howard-70-pioneer-in-satellite-tv-for-the-home.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|location=|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[PBS]], a non-profit public broadcasting service, began to distribute its television programming by satellite in 1978.&lt;ref name="pbs78"&gt;Public Service Broadcasting in the Age of Globalization, Editors: Indrajit Banerjee, Kalinga Seneviratne. {{ISBN|9789814136013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1979, Soviet engineers developed the Moskva (or [[Moscow]]) system of broadcasting and delivering of TV signals via satellites. They launched the [[Gorizont]] communication satellites later that same year. These satellites used [[geostationary orbit]]s.&lt;ref name="gorizont"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gorizont.htm|title=Gorizont|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=2008-06-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617211454/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gorizont.htm|archivedate=2008-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were equipped with powerful on-board transponders, so the size of receiving parabolic antennas of downlink stations was reduced to 4 and 2.5 metres.&lt;ref name="gorizont"/&gt; On October 18, 1979, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) began allowing people to have home satellite earth stations without a federal government license.&lt;ref name="dms"&gt;[http://www.dmsiusa.com/glory-days.html The "Glory Days" of Satellite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303133328/http://dmsiusa.com/glory-days.html |date=2014-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The front cover of the 1979 [[Neiman-Marcus]] Christmas catalogue featured the first home satellite TV stations on sale for $36,500.&lt;ref name="uspopcult"&gt;{{cite book|last=Browne|first=Ray|year=2001|title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;pg=PA706&amp;lpg=PA706&amp;dq=neiman+marcus+satellite+dish+1977&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oq7ha9CzGR&amp;sig=XvUPHAnEEqAcMHs-8LjuwMF2hEU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UkyzU-PxFLHNsQTr4oLIBg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=neiman%20marcus%20satellite%20dish%201979&amp;f=false|location=[[Madison, Wisconsin]]|publisher=Popular Press|page=706|isbn=9780879728212|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dishes were nearly {{convert|20|ft|m}} in diameter&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite news|last=Giarrusso|first=Michael|date=28 July 1996|title=Tiny Satellite Dishes Sprout in Rural Areas|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-28/news/mn-28792_1_small-dishes|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Los Angeles]]|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were remote controlled.&lt;ref name="denverpost"&gt;{{cite news|last=Keating|first=Stephen|year=1999|title=Stealing Free TV, Part 2|url=http://extras.denverpost.com/business/cutt1101.htm|newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]|location=[[Denver, CO]]|publisher=The Denver Post|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price went down by half soon after that, but there were only eight more channels.&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;{{cite news|title=Whatta dish : Home satellite reception a TV turn-on|last=Stein|first=Joe|work=[[San Diego Union-Tribune|Evening Tribune]]|date=1989-01-24|page=C-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society for Private and Commercial Earth Stations (SPACE), an organisation which represented consumers and satellite TV system owners, was established in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=21 December 1980|title=Earth Station Is Very Popular Dish|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19801221&amp;id=v_UhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XaIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3196,441027|newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]]|location=[[Kansas City, Missouri]]|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TVRO/C-band satellite era, 1980–1986===
{{further|Television receive-only}}
By 1980, satellite television was well established in the [[Satellite television in the United States|USA]] and Europe. On 26 April 1982, the first satellite channel in the UK, Satellite Television Ltd. (later [[Sky1]]), was launched.&lt;ref name=bbcable&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2eedi1l&amp;s=6 |title=Broadband Cable 10th Anniversary |publisher=TinyPic |date= |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its signals were transmitted from the [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s [[Orbital Test Satellite]]s.&lt;ref name=bbcable/&gt; Between 1981 and 1985, TVRO systems' sales rates increased as prices fell. Advances in receiver technology and the use of [[gallium arsenide]] [[FET]] technology enabled the use of smaller dishes. Five hundred thousand systems, some costing as little as $2000, were sold in the US in 1984.&lt;ref name=Stecklow/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbca"/&gt; Dishes pointing to one satellite were even cheaper.&lt;ref name="wichita"&gt;{{cite news|title=Research Needed in Buying Dish: High Cost Is Important Consideration for Consumer|last=Stecklow|first=Steve|work=[[Wichita Eagle]]|agency=Knight-Ridder News Service|date=1984-10-25|page=6C}}&lt;/ref&gt; People in areas without local broadcast stations or cable television service could obtain good-quality reception with no monthly fees.&lt;ref name=Stecklow&gt;{{cite news|title=America's Favorite Dish|last=Stecklow|first=Steve|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|agency=[[Knight-Ridder News Service]]|date=1984-07-07|page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Akron/&gt; The large dishes were a subject of much consternation, as many people considered them [[eyesore]]s, and in the US most condominiums, neighborhoods, and other homeowner associations tightly restricted their use, except in areas where such restrictions were illegal.&lt;ref name="fcc"/&gt; These restrictions were altered in 1986 when the Federal Communications Commission ruled all of them illegal.&lt;ref name="baltsun"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Andree|date=10 October 1993|title=Old satellite dish restrictions under fire New laws urged for smaller models|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-10-10/business/1993283244_1_community-association-satellite-dish-associations-institute|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|location=[[Baltimore, MD]]|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A municipality could require a property owner to relocate the dish if it violated other zoning restrictions, such as a setback requirement, but could not outlaw their use.&lt;ref name="baltsun"/&gt; The necessity of these restrictions would slowly decline as the dishes got smaller.&lt;ref name="baltsun"/&gt;

Originally, all channels were broadcast [[in the clear]] (ITC) because the equipment necessary to receive the programming was too expensive for consumers. With the growing number of TVRO systems, the program providers and broadcasters had to [[television encryption|scramble]] their signal and develop subscription systems.

In October 1984, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984]], which gave those using TVRO systems the right to receive signals for free unless they were scrambled, and required those who did scramble to make their signals available for a reasonable fee.&lt;ref name=Akron/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-05-22/entertainment/8702080056_1_satellite-dish-satellite-tv-week-dish-owners|title=Satellite TV Skies Brighten As War With Programmers Ends|last=Takiff|first=Jonathan|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|agency=[[Knight-Ridder Newspapers]]|date=1987-05-22|accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since cable channels could prevent reception by big dishes, other companies had an incentive to offer competition.&lt;ref name=Turned&gt;{{cite news|title=Direct-Broadcast TV Is Still Not Turned On|last=Wolf|first=Ron|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=1985-01-20|page=C01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1986, [[HBO]] began using the now-obsolete [[VideoCipher]] II system to [[television encryption|encrypt their channels]].&lt;ref name="deseret"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nye|first=Doug|date=14 January 1990|title=SATELLITE DISHES SURVIVE GREAT SCRAMBLE OF 1980S|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/81378/SATELLITE-DISHES-SURVIVE-GREAT-SCRAMBLE-OF-1980S.html?pg=all|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|location=[[Salt Lake City]]|publisher=Deseret News|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other channels used less secure [[television encryption]] systems. The scrambling of HBO was met with much protest from owners of big-dish systems, most of which had no other option at the time for receiving such channels, claiming that clear signals from cable channels would be difficult to receive.&lt;ref name="philly"/&gt; Eventually HBO allowed dish owners to subscribe directly to their service for $12.95 per month, a price equal to or higher than what cable subscribers were paying, and required a [[descrambler]] to be purchased for $395.&lt;ref name="philly"/&gt; This led to the [[broadcast signal intrusion|attack]] on HBO's transponder [[Galaxy 1]] by [[Captain Midnight (HBO)|John R.

Videocipher II used analog scrambling on its video signal and [[Data Encryption Standard]]–based encryption on its audio signal. VideoCipher II was defeated, and there was a [[black market]] for descrambler devices which were initially sold as "test" devices.&lt;ref name="prodpiracy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paradise|first=Paul R.|date=1 January 1999|title=Trademark Counterfeiting, Product Piracy, and the Billion Dollar Threat to the U.S. Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ny0vvUpBzCYC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=black+market+for+illegal+satellite+signal+descramblers#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20market%20for%20illegal%20satellite%20signal%20descramblers&amp;f=false|location=[[Westport, Connecticut]]|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|page=147|isbn=1567202500|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The necessity for better satellite television programming than TVRO arose in the 1980s. Satellite television services, first in Europe, began transmitting K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band signals in the late 1980s. On 11 December 1988 [[Luxembourg]] launched [[Astra 1A]], the first satellite to provide medium power satellite coverage to Western Europe.&lt;ref name="n2yo2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=19688|title=ASTRA 1A Satellite details 1988-109B NORAD 19688|date=9 July 2014|publisher=N2YO|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first medium-powered satellites, transmitting signals in K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band and allowing reception with small(90&amp;nbsp;cm) dishes for the first time ever.&lt;ref name="n2yo2" /&gt; The launch of Astra beat the winner of the UK's state Direct Broadcast Satellite licence, [[British Satellite Broadcasting]], to the market, and accelerated its demise.&lt;ref name="n2yo2" /&gt;

=== 1990s to present===
By 1987, nine channels were scrambled, but 99 others were available free-to-air.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; While HBO initially charged a monthly fee of $19.95, soon it became possible to unscramble all channels for $200 a year.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; Dish sales went down from 600,000 in 1985 to 350,000 in 1986, but pay television services were seeing dishes as something positive since some people would never have cable service, and the industry was starting to recover as a result.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; Scrambling also led to the development of [[pay-per-view]] events.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; On November 1, 1988, [[NBC]] began scrambling its C-band signal but left its [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] signal unencrypted in order for affiliates to not lose viewers who could not see their advertising.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; Most of the two million satellite dish users in the United States still used C-band.&lt;ref name=sfc/&gt; [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[CBS]] were considering scrambling, though CBS was reluctant due to the number of people unable to receive local [[network affiliate]]s.&lt;ref name=sfc&gt;{{cite news|title=Scrambled NBC Bad News for Satellite Pirates|work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|agency=United Press International|date=1988-11-03|page=E3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piracy on satellite television networks in the US led to the introduction of the [[Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992]]. This legislation enabled anyone caught engaging in signal theft to be fined up to $50,000 and to be sentenced to a maximum of two years in prison.&lt;ref name="cableact"&gt;{{cite act|title=Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992|number=1460|language=English|date=8 October 1992|article=STATUTE-106-Pg1460.pdf|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-106/pdf/STATUTE-106-Pg1460.pdf|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A repeat offender can be fined up to $100,000 and be imprisoned for up to five years.&lt;ref name="cableact"/&gt;

Satellite television had also developed in [[Satellite television by region#Europe|Europe]] but it initially used low power communication satellites and it required dish sizes of over 1.7 metres. On 11 December 1988 [[Luxembourg]] launched [[Astra 1A]], the first satellite to provide medium power satellite coverage to Western Europe.&lt;ref name="n2yo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=19688|title=ASTRA 1A Satellite details 1988-109B NORAD 19688|publisher=N2YO|date=9 July 2014|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first medium-powered satellites, transmitting signals in K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band and allowing reception with small dishes (90&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name="n2yo"/&gt; The launch of Astra beat the winner of the UK's state Direct Broadcast Satellite licence holder, [[British Satellite Broadcasting]], to the market.

In the US in the early 1990s, four large cable companies launched [[PrimeStar]], a direct broadcasting company using medium power satellites. The relatively strong transmissions allowed the use of smaller (90&amp;nbsp;cm) dishes. Its popularity declined with the 1994 launch of the [[Hughes Communications|Hughes]] [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] satellite television systems.

On March 4, 1996 EchoStar introduced Digital Sky Highway (Dish Network) using the EchoStar 1 satellite.&lt;ref name="ctu10e"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=August E.|date=|title=Communication Technology Update|edition=10th|url=|location=|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|page=87|isbn=978-0-240-81475-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; EchoStar launched a second satellite in September 1996 to increase the number of channels available on Dish Network to 170.&lt;ref name="ctu10e"/&gt; These systems provided better pictures and stereo sound on 150–200 video and audio channels, and allowed small dishes to be used. This greatly reduced the popularity of TVRO systems. In the mid-1990s, channels began moving their broadcasts to [[digital television]] transmission using the [[DigiCipher]] [[conditional access]] system.&lt;ref name="insead"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell-Jones |first1=Robin |last2=Berbner |first2=Jochen |last3=Chai |first3=Jianfeng |last4=Farstad |first4=Thomas |last5=Pham |first5=Minh |date=June 2001 |title=High Technology Strategy and Entrepreneurship |url=http://faculty.insead.edu/adner/projects/Set%20Top%20Boxes.pdf |journal=INSEAD journal |location=[[Fontainebleau]] |publisher=INSEAD |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724233622/http://faculty.insead.edu/adner/projects/Set%20Top%20Boxes.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to encryption, the widespread availability, in the US, of [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] services such as PrimeStar and DirecTV had been reducing the popularity of TVRO systems since the early 1990s.  Signals from DBS satellites (operating in the more recent K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band) are higher in both frequency and power (due to improvements in the [[solar panel]]s and [[energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of modern satellites) and therefore require much smaller dishes than C-band, and the [[digital modulation]] methods now used require less [[signal strength]] at the receiver than analog modulation methods.&lt;ref name="nctfe"&gt;Mirabito, M., and Morgenstern, B.

Burlington: Focal Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Each satellite also can carry up to 32 transponders in the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band, but only 24 in the C band, and several [[digital subchannel]]s can be [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]]ed (MCPC) or carried separately ([[SCPC]]) on a single transponder.&lt;ref name=artcn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khaplil|first1=Vidya R.|last2=Bhalachandra|first2=Anjali R.|date=April 2008|title=Advances in Recent Trends in Communication and Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QchLipDixBUC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=32+transponders+ku+band+24+c+band+multiplexed+satellite#v=onepage&amp;q=32%20transponders%20ku%20band%2024%20c%20band%20multiplexed%20satellite&amp;f=false |location=[[New Delhi]]|publisher=[[Allied Publishers]]|page=119|isbn=1466651709|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in [[noise reduction]] due to improved microwave technology and [[semiconductor]] materials have also had an effect.&lt;ref name=artcn/&gt; However, one consequence of the higher frequencies used for DBS services is [[rain fade]] where viewers lose signal during a heavy downpour. C-band satellite television signals are less prone to rain fade.&lt;ref name="dishcable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dish-cable.com/rain_fade.htm|title=Rain fade: satellite TV signal and adverse weather|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|year=2010|website=Dish-cable.com|publisher=Dish-cable.com|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a return to the older (but proven) technologies of satellite communication, the current DBS-based satellite providers in the USA (Dish Network and DirecTV) are now utilizing additional capacity on the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band transponders of existing FSS-class satellites, in addition to the capacity on their own existing fleets of DBS satellites in orbit.  This was done in order to provide more channel capacity for their systems, as required by the increasing number of High-Definition and simulcast local station channels.  The reception of the channels carried on the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band FSS satellite's respective transponders has been achieved by both DirecTV &amp; Dish Network issuing to their subscribers dishes twice as big in diameter (36") than the previous 18" (&amp; 20" for the Dish Network "Dish500") dishes the services used initially, equipped with 2 circular-polarized LNBFs (for reception of 2 native DBS satellites of the provider, 1 per LNBF), and 1 standard linear-polarized LNB for reception of channels from an FSS-type satellite.  These newer DBS/FSS-hybrid dishes, marketed by DirecTV and Dish Network as the "SlimLine" and "[[SuperDish]]" models respectively, are now the current standard for both providers, with their original 18"/20" single or dual LNBF dishes either now obsolete, or only used for program packages, separate channels, or services only broadcast over the providers' DBS satellites.

On 29 November 1999 US President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act]] (SHVIA).&lt;ref name="shvia"&gt;{{cite act|title=Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act|number=00-96|date=29 November 1999|article=|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/shva/shviafac.html|accessdate=30 July 2014|language=[[English language]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act allowed Americans to receive local broadcast signals via direct broadcast satellite systems for the first time.&lt;ref name="shvia" /&gt;

[[Satellite Television for the Asian Region]] (STAR), a service based in [[Mumbai]] and [[Hong Kong]] which now provides satellite TV coverage to [[Satellite television by region#Asia|Asia]] and [[Satellite television by region#Australia|Australia]], introduced satellite TV to the Asian region in the early 1990s. It began broadcasting signals using the [[AsiaSat 1]] satellite on 1 January 1991.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

'''Targeting''', a commonly used technique in [[international health]] and [[public health]], develops a specialized health intervention approach for a specific group of people.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M. W. &amp; Skinner, C. S. (2000). Tailoring: what's in a name? Health Education Research, 15(1), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M. W. &amp; Wray, R. J. (2003). Tailored and targeted health communication: Strategies for enhancing information relevance. American Journal of Health Behavior, 27 (suppl 3), S227-S232.&lt;/ref&gt; This group of people may be identified by various factors, including geography, race/ethnicity, age, health issues, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K. &amp; Kreuter, M .W. (2006). Advancing tailored Health communication: A persuasion and message effects perspective. Journal of Communication, 56, s184-s201.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account characteristics the group members share in common, only one version of program materials is used in a targeted health intervention and the intervention materials show features that the targeted population subgroup members prefer.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M. W., Lukwago, S. N., Bucholtz, D. C., Clark, E. M., &amp; Sanders-Thompson, V. (2002). Achieving cultural appropriateness in health promotion programs: Targeted and tailored approaches. Health Education and Behavior, 30(2), 133-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of targeting was adapted from [[marketing]]. Target marketing tries to define a subgroup of people with shared characteristics (such as liking of certain product features) as the right group of consumers for a particular product or service. Adopting the same principle, targeted health interventions identify a group of people who are particular vulnerable to certain health risks, intervene to address their health risks and in turn, improve their health. 
From early to mid-1980s, most health information was mass-produced for undifferentiated audience in the form of brochures, pamphlets, and booklets.&lt;ref&gt;. Rimer, B. K. &amp; Kreuter, M .W. (2006). Advancing tailored Health communication: A persuasion and message effects perspective. Journal of Communication, 56, s184-s201.&lt;/ref&gt; As people are increasingly aware of different characteristics within mass audiences, behavioral scientists began to develop different versions of materials for diverse population subgroups in order for health campaigns to be cost effective while still reaching large number of audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K., &amp; Glassman, B. (1998). Tailoring communications for primary care settings.Methods of Information in Medicine, 37(2), 171–177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M., &amp; Flora, J. (1991). Health lifestyles: Audience segmentation analysis for public health interventions. Health Education Quarterly, 18, 221–233.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have suggested that compared to generic interventions which do not take into consideration the audience characteristics, targeting strategy can be more effective for health interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M., Strecher,V., Glassman, B. (1999). One size does not fit all: The case for tailoring print materials. Annual Behavioral Medicine, 21, 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audience factors==
Targeting as an intervention strategy is now widely used in the health fields and has been found to help promote behavioral change.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M., Strecher,V., Glassman, B. (1999). One size does not fit all: The case for tailoring print materials. Annual Behavioral Medicine, 21, 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The level of audience specificity in targeting can vary significantly, ranging from one single broad factor (e.g. interventions targeting women), to combined factors. For example, Gomez, Tan, Keegan, and Clarke (2007) identified South Asians in the U.S. who were less than age 50 and were unemployed or non-citizens as potential population subgroup for targeted mammogram utilization intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, S. L., Tan, S., Keegan, T. HM., &amp; Clarke, C. A. (2007). Disparities in mammographic screening for Asian women in California: A cross-sectional analysis to identify meaningful groups for targeted intervention. BMC Cancer, 7, 201-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Targeted health interventions have adopted different audience factors, including age (e.g. older smokers&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K., Orleans, C. T., Fleischer, L., Cristinzio, S., Resch, N., Telepchak, J., et al. (1994). Does tailoring matter? The impact of a tailored guide on ratings and short-term smoking-related outcomes for older smokers. Health Education Research, Theory and Practice, 9(1), 69–84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, G. D., Noll, E. l., Orleans, C. T., Rimer, B. K., Amfoh, K. &amp; Bonney, G. (1996). Reaching mid-life and older smokers: tailored interventions for routine medical care. Preventive medicine, 25, 346-354.&lt;/ref&gt;), race/ethnicity (e.g. African-Americans&lt;ref&gt;James, S.A., Jamjoum, L., Raghunathan, T.E., Strogatz, D.S., Furth, E.D., &amp; Khazanie, P.G. (1998). Physical activity and NIDDM in African-Americans. The Pitt County Study. Diabetes Care, 21(4), 555–562.&lt;/ref&gt;), socioeconomic status (e.g. low-income women&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, T. R., Rothman, A. J., Salovey, P., Apanovitch, A. M., Pizarro, J., McCarthy, D., &amp;Zullo, J. (2001). The effects of message framing and ethnic targeting on mammography use among low-income women. Health Psychology, 20(4), 256-266.&lt;/ref&gt;), professions (e.g. health providers&lt;ref&gt;Mandelblatt, J. S. &amp; Yabroff, K. R. (1999). Effectiveness of interventions designed to increase mammography use: A meta-analysis of provider-targeted strategies. Cancer epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention, 8, 759-767.&lt;/ref&gt;), health status (e.g. pregnant women and women with children,&lt;ref&gt;Keintz, M. K., Fleisher, L., &amp; Rimer, B. K. (1994). Reaching mothers of preschool-agedchildren with a targeted quit smoking intervention. Journal of Community Health, 19(1),25–40.&lt;/ref&gt; sensation-seeking adolescents&lt;ref&gt;Palmgreen, P., Donohew, L., Lorch, E. P., Hoyle, R. H., Stephenson, M. T. (2001). Television campaigns and adolescent marijuana use: Tests of sensation seeking targeting. American Journal of Public Health, 91(2), 292-296.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==In international health==
Targeting has been widely used in international health interventions and was found to be effective in promoting behavioral change.

Ahmed, Petzold, Kabir, and Tomson (2006) identified the problem in Bangladesh that there was not enough usage of formal health services among the ultra poor population.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, S. M., Petzold, M., Kabir, Z. N., &amp; Tomson, G. (2006). Targeted intervention for the ultra poor in rural Bangladesh: Does it make any difference in their health-seeking behaviour? Social Science &amp; Medicine, 63(11), 2899-2911.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to promote greater use of these health services, Ahmed and colleagues carried out a health intervention in Bangladesh targeting ultra poor households in rural areas in order to change their health-seeking behavior. The intervention provided ultra poor households with money for household activities (e.g. raising livestock, vegetables farming) to increase their income. In addition, it provided 18 months of supports, such as skill training (e.g. vegetable cultivation) and counseling information on health services, to make sure that the targeted people were able to make full use of the money and had the resources to use the health services if they chose to. This targeted intervention was found to be effective that it decreased the amount of self-care and increased the use of professional health care among the targeted population.

In another intervention, Lowndes, Alary, Labbe, et al. (2007) targeted male clients of female sex workers in Benin, West Africa, in order to reduce the male clients' [[risky sexual behavior]] and HIV/STI rates.&lt;ref&gt;Lowndes, C. M., Alary, M., Labbe, A-C., Gnintoungbe, C., Belleau, M., Mukenge, L., Meda, H., Ndour, M., Anagonou, S., &amp; Gbaguidi, A. (2007). Interventions among male clients of female sex workers in Benin, West Africa: An essential component of targeted HIV preventive interventions. Sexually Transmitted Infection, 83, 577-581.&lt;/ref&gt; During this peer-education intervention, trained health educators approached male clients at prostitution venues at night, discussed with them HIV and STI transmission risks, educated them about proper condom use, and distributed condoms. Although HIV prevalence remained unchanged, the intervention effectively affected knowledge and there was an increase in the condom use rate among the targeted population.

==Ethical considerations==
Despite its effectiveness in promoting behavioral change, targeting strategy should be used with caution and with careful considerations of ethics. Kass (2001) suggested that interventions targeting already vulnerable segments of the population may face certain ethical challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Kass, N. E. (2001). An ethics framework for public health. American Journal of Public Health, 91(11), 1776-1782.&lt;/ref&gt; Potential burden and harm in these health programs may include risks to privacy and confidentiality, risks to liberty and self-determination, and risks to justice. Subgroups who are targeted in interventions take most of the burden from the process (for example, their privacy may be intruded) while the benefits resulted from the health interventions are for the general public (e.g. improvements in mortality). Kass posed the question whether the unequal distribution of burden and benefits is ethical.
Moreover, the evidence of intervention effectiveness may not be strong enough at times. Thus it may not be known for sure whether the benefits the targeted audience may gain from the intervention will outweigh the harms they will be put in. Hence, health experts face another ethical dilemma.

Kass further pointed out that targeting may create stigma that some segments of the population are more vulnerable to certain diseases, which might result in social harms, such as psychological distress and discrimination. For example, although the HIV interventions targeting male clients of female sex workers in Benin&lt;ref&gt;Lowndes, C. M., Alary, M., Labbe, A-C., Gnintoungbe, C., Belleau, M., Mukenge, L., Meda, H., Ndour, M., Anagonou, S., &amp; Gbaguidi, A. (2007). Interventions among male clients of female sex workers in Benin, West Africa: An essential component of targeted HIV preventive interventions. Sexually Transmitted Infection, 83, 577-581.&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to HIV prevention, one possible stigma that it may create is that male clients of female sex workers are high risk population of HIV infection. This stigma may create anxiety and panic among the targeted population. On the other hand, if a subgroup were never targeted in interventions, they may not believe that they are at the risk of diseases. People who were not targeted in HIV interventions, e.g. people with regular sex partners, may perceive themselves as not at the risk of HIV infection and hence continue engaging in risky sexual behaviors.

Given the above discussed ethical dilemma that targeted health interventions may face, Kass suggested that, if health programs and health resources are going to be unequally allocated (e.g. targeting ethnic minority groups), they should be done with caution and be based on strong intervention effectiveness evidences.

==Targeting or tailoring? Competing definitions==
While Kreuter and Skinner's (2000) definition of targeting "the development of a single intervention approach for a defined population subgroup that takes into account characteristics shared by the subgroups' members" is now widely accepted in international health, targeting was defined in a few different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Kreuter, M. W. &amp; Skinner, C. S. (2000). Tailoring: what's in a name? Health Education Research, 15(1), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to understand the concept of tailoring in order to capture the idea of targeting, as interventions using targeting strategy were mislabeled as tailoring in some health interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K., Orleans, C. T., Fleischer, L., Cristinzio, S., Resch, N., Telepchak, J., et al. (1994). Does tailoring matter? The impact of a tailored guide on ratings and short-term smoking-	related outcomes for older smokers. Health Education Research, Theory and Practice, 9(1), 69–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Pasick (1997)defined tailoring as "the adaptation of interventions to best fit the relevant needs and characteristics of a specified target population".&lt;ref&gt;Pasick, R. J. (1997). Socioeconomic and culture factors in the development and use of theory. In K. Glanz, F. M. Lewis, &amp; B. K. Rimer (Eds.), Health Behavior and Health Education: Theory, Research and Practice (pp.425-440). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Eakin and colleagues described tailoring as "a process of producing a video whose content and characters are adapted for or designed to appeal to a particular target population". Both statements would now be considered as a more appropriate definition of "targeting" according to Kreuter and Skinner (2000). The distinction between targeting and tailoring is that targeting is to design information for a defined population subgroup while tailoring is to develop interventions for one specific person based on the individual characteristics.

Another competing definition of targeting was developed by Rimal and Adkin (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Rimal, R. N. &amp; Adkin, A. D. (2003). Using computers to narrowcast health messages: The role of audience segmentation, targeting and tailoring in health promotion. In A. M. Dorsey, K. I. Miller, R. Parrott, &amp; T. L. Thompson (Eds.), Handbook of Health Communication (pp. 497-513). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that both targeting and tailoring should follow the [[audience segmentation]] process, which is to divide audience into highly homogeneous clusters. They distinguish targeting and tailoring by suggesting that targeting is the selection of communication channel for the health campaign while tailoring is about message design.

Despite the wide acceptance of the Kreuter and Skinner (2000) definition, Rimer (2000 pointed out that, although some "tailored" intervention would now be appropriately labeled as "targeted" intervention, these published projects are out there and the article titles remain as "tailored", which might create confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Rimer, B. K. (2000). Response to Kreuter and Skinner. Health Education Research, 15(4), 503.&lt;/ref&gt; Rimer suggested that precision of language is important in order to avoid confusion. For people who are trying to understand targeting and tailoring, it is important to keep in mind the inconsistent labeling of targeting and tailoring in earlier published articles and to make critical judgments when reading.

The '''General Crisis''' is the term used by some historians to describe the period of widespread conflict and instability that occurred from the early 17th century to the early 18th century in [[History of Europe|Europe]] and in more recent historiography in the world at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://sgtbkhalsadu.ac.in/colleges/tutorial/112718122009232906.113.5.pdf | title = Tutorial | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | publisher = Sgt Bkhalsadu | place = [[India|IN]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is much debated by historians and there is no consensus.

==What was the "General Crisis"?==
The term was coined by [[Eric Hobsbawm]] in his pair of 1954 articles entitled "The Crisis of the Seventeenth Century" published in ''Past and Present''. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{Explain|date=July 2018}}

As a historiographic concept, the place of the general crisis was cemented by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], in a 1959 article entitled "The General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century" published in the same journal. Hobsbawm discussed an economic crisis in Europe; Trevor-Roper saw a wider crisis, "a crisis in the relations between society and the State".{{Sfn | Aston | 1965 | p = 67}}  Trevor-Roper argued that the middle years of the 17th century in Western Europe saw a widespread break-down in politics, economics and society caused by a complex series of demographic, religious, economic and political problems. In this "general crisis", various events such as the [[English Civil War]], the [[Fronde]] in [[Kingdom of France|France]], the climax of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and revolts against the [[List of Spanish monarchs|Spanish Crown]] in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Naples]] and [[Catalonia]] were all manifestations of the same problem. The most important cause of the "general crisis",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Robinson | first = Kristen | contribution = Trevor-Roper, Hugh | title = The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing | pages = 1204–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in Trevor-Roper’s opinion, was the conflict between "Court" and "Country"; that is between the increasingly powerful centralizing, bureaucratic, sovereign princely states represented by the court, and the traditional, regional, land-based aristocracy and gentry representing the country. In addition, the intellectual and religious changes introduced by the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] were important secondary causes of the "general crisis".

There were various controversies regarding the "general crisis" thesis between historians.  Some simply denied the existence of any such crisis. For instance, Hobsbawm saw the problems of 17th-century Europe as being  social and economic in origin – an emphasis than Trevor-Roper would not concede.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{Explain|date=July 2018}}

Subsequent historians interested in the General Crisis include [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]], who has authored a book on the subject.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{Explain|date=July 2018}}

Many historians have argued the 17th century was an era of crisis.{{Sfn | Parker | Smith | 1997}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}{{Sfn | Aston | 1965}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  Many other historians have rejected the idea.{{who |date=June 2015}} Today there are historians who promote the crisis model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JB | last = Shank | title = Crisis: A Useful Category of Post-Social Scientific Historical Analysis? | journal = American Historical Review | year = 2008 | volume = 113 | number = 4 | pages = 1090–99 | doi=10.1086/ahr.113.4.1090}}.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing it provides an invaluable insight into the warfare, politics, economics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jan | last = de Vries | title = The Economic Crisis of the Seventeenth Century after Fifty Years | journal = Journal of Interdisciplinary History | year = 2009 | volume = 40 | number = 2 | pages = 151–94 | jstor = 40263652 | doi=10.1162/jinh.2009.40.2.151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and even art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Burke | title = The Crisis in the Arts of the Seventeenth Century: A Crisis of Representation? | journal = Journal of Interdisciplinary History | year = 2009 | volume = 40 | number = 2 | pages = 239–61 | jstor = 40263655 | doi=10.1162/jinh.2009.40.2.239}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–48) focused attention on the massive horrors that wars could bring to entire populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter H | last = Wilson | title = The Thirty Years War: Europe’s Tragedy | year = 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  The 1640s in particular saw more state breakdowns around the world than any previous or subsequent period.{{Sfn | Parker | Smith | 1997}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}{{Sfn | Aston | 1965}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the largest state in Europe, temporarily disappeared. In addition, there were secessions and upheavals in several parts of the [[Spanish Empire]], the world’s first global empire.  In Britain the entire [[House of Stuart|Stuart monarchy]] ([[Kingdom of England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland]], [[Kingdom of Ireland]], and [[British America]]) rebelled.  Political insurgency and a spate of popular revolts seldom equaled shook the foundations of most states in Europe and Asia.  More wars took place around the world in the mid-17th century than in almost any other period of recorded history.  The crises spread far beyond Europe—for example [[Ming China]], the most populous state in the world, collapsed.{{Sfn | Parker | 2008 | pp = 1053–79}}

China’s Ming dynasty and Japan’s [[Tokugawa shogunate]] had radically different economic, social, and political systems. However, they experienced a series of crises during the mid-17th century that were at once interrelated and strikingly similar to those occurring in other parts of the world at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = William S | last = Atwell | title = Some Observations on the ‘Seventeenth-Century Crisis’ in China and Japan | journal = Journal of Asian Studies | year = 1986 | volume = 45 | number = 2 | pages = 223–44 | doi=10.2307/2055842}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Frederic Wakeman]] argues that the crisis which destroyed the Ming dynasty was partly a result of the climatic change as well as China’s already significant involvement in the developing world economy.  Bureaucratic dishonesty worsened the problem.  Moreover, the [[Qing dynasty]]’s success in dealing with the crisis made it more difficult for it to consider alternative responses when confronted with severe challenges from the West in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Frederic E | last = Wakeman | title = China and the Seventeenth-Century Crisis | journal = Late Imperial China | year = 1986 | volume = 7 | number = 1 | pages = 1–26 | doi=10.1353/late.1986.0006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples which have been given for general crisis and state breakdown during this period include:
* The [[Thirty Years War]] in Germany (1618–48)
* The Economic Crisis in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (1619–23)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.jstor.org/pss/2123055 | title = JStor}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (1639–51), [[The Protectorate]] (1653–59), and the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688) in Britain and Ireland
* The collapse of the [[Ming Dynasty]] and rise of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in China (1644–62)
* The [[Fronde]] in France (1643–68)
* Revolts against the [[Spain|Spanish crown]] in [[Naples]], [[Portugal]], and [[Catalonia]]
* The climax of the [[Dutch Revolt]] and related conflicts (ends in 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]])
* Numerous internal revolts in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (especially 1622)
* The disintegration of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]]
* The beginning of [[Sakoku]] in Japan and the [[Shimabara Uprising]] (1638)
* The [[Char Bouba War]] in [[Mauritania]] (1644–74)
* The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–14)
* Several wars of succession in the [[Mughal Empire]] (1600-1605 between [[Akbar]] and [[Salim Nuruddin Jahangir|Salim]]; 1605; [[Shahjahan]]'s revolt)

==Inflation==
Precious metals from newly discovered deposits in [[United States|America]], especially silver from [[Potosí]] in modern [[Bolivia]] and from [[Mexico]], were shipped by [[Spain]] to [[China]] as well as to Europe.  Silver was less prevalent in China than in Europe and consequently more valuable.  The continuous flow of silver from the New World caused a continuous flow of wealth from China to Spain.  The silver imports also caused general price inflation throughout Europe.  Rapid population growth until the mid-decades of the seventeenth century also initially contributed to inflation in some areas.{{Citation needed |date=June 2015}}

== Demographic decline ==
For those who extend the General Crisis outside Europe, one symptom is dramatic population decline. For example, with the collapse of the [[Ming Dynasty]] the population of China fell by approximately 50 million between 1600 and 1644, a decrease of over 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Germany's population was reduced by approximately 15% to 30% in the [[Thirty Years War]].&lt;ref name="TYW-1618-48-TWC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#30YrW |title=The Thirty Years War (1618–48) | work =Twentieth Century Atlas|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] also lost about a third of its population. Many theories have been proposed as to why population dropped so rapidly during this period.  Renowned economist Robert Malthus proposed the theory of population limitation as a result of carrying capacity. In his theory, food supplies simply did not grow as fast as population. As such, the subsistence gap between food and population created a check on the population.  In applying this theory to the demographic crisis of this period, much focus has been placed on the growth and expansion of the "new" monarchies of late medieval Europe.  These newly centralized and bureaucratized monarchies with their greater demands for war placed greater demands on the populaces of their realms. The previously mentioned climatic change also helped to exacerbate these new problems of war.{{Citation needed |date=June 2015}}

== Climate change ==
The General Crisis overlaps fairly neatly with the [[Little Ice Age]] which some authorities locate in the 17th century. Of particular interest is the overlap with the [[Maunder Minimum]].  Across the Northern Hemisphere, the mid-17th century experienced almost unprecedented death rates. Geoffrey Parker has suggested that environmental factors may have been in part to blame, especially the global cooling trend of this period.{{Sfn | Parker | Smith | 2008}}

'''Transnational gangs''' can be described as [[gangs]] that are located in multiple countries. When these gangs commit crimes in one country, their plans for the crime can sometimes be put together in another country. These gangs or&amp;nbsp;[[Mara (gang)|mara]]&amp;nbsp;are able to move around efficiently from one place to another. Transnational gangs are not a normal&amp;nbsp;[[street gang]]&amp;nbsp;because they are much larger in size and located in more than one country; they are considered to be able to pose a significant threat for the safety of the countries they are located in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/afri/aspj/apjinternational/apj-s/2008/2tri08/sullivaneng.htm|title=Transnational Gangs|website=www.au.af.mil|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tropical diseases''' are [[Infectious disease|disease]]s that are prevalent in or unique to [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrar|first1=Jeremy|last2=Hotez|first2=Peter J|last3=Junghanss|first3=Thomas|last4=Kang|first4=Gagandeep|last5=Lalloo|first5=David|last6=White|first6=Nicholas|title=Manson's tropical diseases.|date=2013|publisher=Saunders [Imprint]|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780702051012|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diseases are less prevalent in [[temperate climate]]s, due in part to the occurrence of a cold [[season]], which controls the insect population by forcing hibernation. However, many were present in northern Europe and northern America in the 17th and 18th centuries before modern understanding of disease causation. The initial impetus for [[tropical medicine]] was to protect the health of colonialists, notably in India under the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farley|first1=John|title=Bilharzia : a history of imperial tropical medicine.|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0521530601|edition=1. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insects such as mosquitoes and flies are by far the most common disease carrier, or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. These insects may carry a parasite, bacterium or virus that is infectious to humans and animals. Most often disease is transmitted by an insect "bite", which causes transmission of the infectious agent through subcutaneous blood exchange. Vaccines are not available for most of the diseases listed here, and many do not have cures.

Human exploration of [[tropical rainforest]]s, [[deforestation]], rising [[immigration]] and increased international air travel and other [[tourism]] to tropical regions has led to an increased incidence of such diseases.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127962|title=Deforestation Boosts Malaria Rates, Study Finds|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103133648/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127962|archivedate=3 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1751188.stm UK 'faces tropical disease threat'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615012659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1751188.stm |date=2006-06-15 }}, BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health programmes ==
In 1975 the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) was established to focus on [[neglected tropical diseases|neglected infectious diseases]] which disproportionately affect poor and marginalized populations in developing regions of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. It was established at the [[World Health Organization]], which is the executing agency, and is co-sponsored by the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]], [[United Nations Development Programme]], the [[World Bank]] and the [[World Health Organization]].

TDR's vision is to foster an effective global research effort on infectious [[diseases of poverty]] in which disease endemic countries play a pivotal role. It has a dual mission of developing new tools and strategies against these diseases, and to develop the research and leadership capacity in the countries where the diseases occur. The TDR secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland, but the work is conducted throughout the world through many partners and funded grants.

Some examples of work include helping to develop new treatments for diseases, such as ivermectin for onchocerciasis (river blindness); showing how packaging can improve use of artemesinin-combination treatment (ACT) for malaria; demonstrating the effectiveness of bednets to prevent mosquito bites and malaria; and documenting how community-based and community-led programmes increases distribution of multiple treatments.

* [[Chagas disease]]
*: (also called ''American trypanosomiasis'') is a [[parasitic disease]] which occurs in the [[Americas]], particularly in [[South America]]. Its [[pathogen]]ic agent is a [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]]n named ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', which is [[Vector (epidemiology)|transmitted]] mostly by [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]] '''[[assassin bug]]s''', however other methods of transmission are possible, such as ingestion of food contaminated with [[parasite]]s, [[blood transfusion]] and [[fetus|fetal]] transmission. Between 16 and 18 million people are currently infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm|title=Chagas Disease After Organ Transplantation --- United States, 2001|author=|date=|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104013805/https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm|archivedate=4 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dengue]]
* [[Helminths]]
* [[African trypanosomiasis]]
*: or '''sleeping sickness''', is a [[parasitic]] [[disease]], caused by protozoa called trypansomes. The two responsible for African trypanosomiasis are Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.These parasites are transmitted by the '''[[tsetse fly]]'''
* [[Leishmaniasis]]
*: caused by [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]s of the genus Leishmania, and transmitted by the bite of certain species of '''[[sand fly]]'''.
* [[Leprosy]]&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
*: (or '''Hansen's disease''') is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[infectious disease]] caused by [[Mycobacterium leprae]]. Leprosy is primarily a [[granuloma]]tous disease of the [[peripheral nerves]] and [[mucosa]] of the [[upper respiratory tract]]; skin lesions are the primary external symptom.&lt;ref name= Sherris&gt;Kenneth J. Ryan and C. George Ray, Sherris Medical Microbiology Fourth Edition McGraw Hill 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Left untreated, leprosy can be progressive, causing permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes. Contrary to popular conception, leprosy does not cause body parts to simply fall off, and it differs from [[tzaraath]], the malady described in the Hebrew scriptures and previously translated into English as ''leprosy''.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 13:59, Artscroll Tanakh and Metsudah Chumash translations, 1996 and 1994, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Filariasis|Lymphatic filariasis]]
*: is a [[parasite|parasitic]] disease caused by thread-like parasitic filarial worms called [[nematode]]s, all transmitted by '''[[mosquito]]es'''. [[Loa loa]] is another filarial parasite transmitted by the [[deer fly]]. 120 million people are infected worldwide. It is carried by over half the population in the most severe endemic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Supali, T. |author2=Ismid, I.S. |author3=Wibowo, H. |author4=Djuardi, Y. |author5=Majawati, E. |author6=Ginanjar, P. |author7=Fischer, P.  | title=Estimation of the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis by a pool screen PCR assay using blood spots collected on filter paper | journal=Tran R Soc Trop Med Hyg |date=Aug 2006 | volume=100 | issue=8 | pages=753&amp;ndash;9 | doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.10.005 | pmid=16442578  |issn=0035-9203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most noticeable symptom is [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]]: a thickening of the skin and underlying tissues. Elephantiasis is caused by chronic infection by filarial worms in the lymph nodes. This clogs the lymph nodes and slows the draining of lymph fluid from a portion of the body.
* [[Malaria]]
*: Caused by a [[Protozoan]] [[parasite]]s transmitted by female ''[[Anopheles]]'' [[mosquito]]es, as they are the blood-feeders. The disease is caused by species of the genus Plasmodium.

*: also known as ''schisto'' or '''snail fever''', is a [[parasitic disease]] caused by several species of '''[[flatworm]]''' in areas with freshwater '''[[snail]]s''', which may carry the parasite. The most common form of transmission is by wading or swimming in lakes, ponds and other bodies of water containing the [[snail]]s and the parasite. More than 200 million people worldwide are infected by schistosomiasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs115/en/index.html|title=Schistosomiasis|author=|date=|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205040015/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs115/en/index.html|archivedate=5 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tropical diseases are very rare, but may occur in sudden [[epidemic]]s, such as the [[Ebola]] hemorrhagic fever, [[Lassa fever]] and the [[Marburg virus]]. There are hundreds of different tropical diseases which are less known or rarer, but that, nonetheless, have importance for [[public health]].

==Relation of climate to tropical diseases==
The so-called "exotic" diseases in the tropics have long been noted both by travelers, explorers, etc., as well as by physicians. One obvious reason is that the hot climate present during all the year and the larger volume of [[rain]]s directly affect the formation of breeding grounds, the larger number and variety of [[natural reservoir]]s and animal diseases that can be transmitted to humans ([[zoonosis]]), the largest number of possible [[insect]] [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of diseases. It is possible also that higher temperatures may favor the replication of pathogenic agents both inside and outside biological organisms. Socio-economic factors may be also in operation, since most of the poorest nations of the world are in the tropics. Tropical countries like [[Brazil]], which have improved their socio-economic situation and invested in [[hygiene]], [[public health]] and the combat of transmissible diseases have achieved dramatic results in relation to the elimination or decrease of many [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] tropical diseases in their territory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

[[Climate change]], [[global warming]] caused by the [[greenhouse effect]], and the resulting increase in global [[temperature]]s, are possibly causing tropical diseases and vectors to spread to higher altitudes in mountainous regions, and to higher latitudes that were previously spared, such as the [[Southern United States]], the Mediterranean area, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/06/italy.climatechange Climate change brings malaria back to Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305222344/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/06/italy.climatechange |date=2016-03-05 }} ''The Guardian'' 6 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4827362.stm Climate link to African malaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616173736/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4827362.stm |date=2006-06-16 }} 20 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Monteverde cloud forest of Costa Rica, global warming enabled Chytridiomycosis, a tropical disease, to flourish and thus force into decline amphibian populations of the Monteverde Harlequin frog.&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, J. Alan et al. "Widespread Amphibian Extinctions from Epidemic Deisease Driven by Global Warming." Nature 439.12 (2006) 161-67&lt;/ref&gt; Here, global warming raised the heights of orographic cloud formation, and thus produced cloud cover that would facilitate optimum growth conditions for the implicated pathogen, B. dendrobatidis.

Some of the strategies for controlling tropical diseases include: 
* Draining wetlands to reduce populations of [[insect]]s and other [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s, or introducing natural predators of the vectors.
* The application of [[insecticide]]s and/or [[insect repellent]]s) to strategic surfaces such as clothing, skin, buildings, insect habitats, and [[bed net]]s.
* The use of a [[mosquito net]] over a bed (also known as a "bed net") to reduce nighttime transmission, since certain species of tropical [[mosquito]]es feed mainly at night.
* Use of water [[Water well|well]]s, and/or [[water filtration]], [[water filter]]s, or [[water treatment]] with water tablets to produce drinking water free of parasites.
* [[Sanitation]] to prevent transmission through human waste.
* In situations where vectors (such as mosquitoes) have become more numerous as a result of human activity, a careful investigation can provide clues: for example, open dumps can contain stagnant water that encourage disease vectors to breed. Eliminating these dumps can address the problem.  An education campaign can yield significant benefits at low cost.
* Development and use of [[vaccine]]s to promote disease [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].
* Pharmacologic pre-exposure prophylaxis (to prevent disease before exposure to the environment and/or vector).
* Pharmacologic post-exposure prophylaxis (to prevent disease after exposure to the environment and/or vector).
* Pharmacologic treatment (to treat disease after infection or infestation).
* Assisting with economic development in endemic regions. For example, by providing [[microloan]]s to enable investments in more efficient and productive agriculture. This in turn can help [[subsistence farming]] to become more profitable, and these profits can be used by local populations for disease prevention and treatment, with the added benefit of reducing the poverty rate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

'''Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope''' was a worldwide benefit held for the [[tsunami]] victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. It was broadcast on [[NBC]] and its affiliated networks of [[USA Networks|USA Network]],  [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]], [[PAX Network|PAX]], [[MSNBC]], [[CNBC]], [[Sci-Fi (United States)|Sci-Fi]], [[Trio (TV network)|Trio]], [[Telemundo]] and other [[NBC Universal]] stations and was heard on any [[Clear Channel]] radio station. The benefit was led by the actor [[George Clooney]] on January 15, 2005, and was similar to ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' (set up after the [[September 11th, 2001 attacks]]).  Digital Media innovator [[Jay Samit]] enabled viewers to purchase digital downloads of the performances as a new way to raise money for the cause; including live recordings by [[Elton John]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Roger Waters]].  Taking a cue from [[Bob Geldof]] (the man who had organized the [[Live Aid]] concerts for African famine relief), it consisted of famous Hollywood entertainers and former American presidents [[George H.W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]].  It was two hours long with stories and entertainment from a huge array of Hollywood popstars notables that include [[Brad Pitt]], [[Donald Trump]], and much more.  It was estimated to raise at least five million dollars by the end of the broadcast.

==Ranking method==
The WTA rankings are based on a rolling 52-week, cumulative system. A player's ranking is determined by her results at a maximum of 16 tournaments for singles and 11 for doubles  and points are awarded based on how far a player advances in a tournament. The basis for calculating a player's ranking are those tournaments that yield the highest ranking points during the rolling 52-week period with the condition that they must include points from the 4 Grand Slams, the 4 Premier Mandatory tournaments and the WTA Finals. In addition, for Top 20 players, their best two results at Premier 5 tournaments will also count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTA – All About Rankings|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/all-about-rankings#|publisher=WTA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 2016, the WTA also distributed ranking points, for singles players only, who competed at the [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nanjing.itftennis.com/olympics/players/ranking-points.aspx|accessdate=16 September 2014|title=Ranking Points|publisher=itftennis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has since been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/sports/tennis/points-and-prize-money-mean-more-to-olympic-tennis-holdouts.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The points distribution for tournaments in 2017 is shown below. [[2013 WTA Tour#Points distribution|Points earned in 2013]] were a little different in some cases and retained their value until they expired after 52 weeks.

[[File:International Association for World Englishes.jpg|thumb|380px|alt=International Association for World Englishes|International Association for World Englishes]]

'''World Englishes''' is a term for emerging localized or [[Indigenous language|indigenized]] varieties of English, especially varieties that have developed in territories influenced by the United Kingdom or the United States. The study of World Englishes consists of identifying varieties of English used in diverse sociolinguistic contexts globally and analyzing how sociolinguistic histories, multicultural backgrounds and contexts of function influence the use of English in different regions of the world.

The issue of World Englishes was first raised in 1978 to examine concepts of regional Englishes globally. Pragmatic factors such as appropriateness, comprehensibility and interpretability justified the use of English as an international and intra-national language. In 1988, at a [[TESOL Inc.|Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)]] conference in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], the International Committee of the Study of World Englishes (ICWE) was formed. In 1992, the ICWE formally launched the International Association for World Englishes (IAWE) at a conference of "World Englishes Today", at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois]], USA.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;International Association of World Englishes [http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214100854/http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php# |date=2010-12-14 }}, Retrieved on 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now an academic journal devoted to the study of this topic, titled ''World Englishes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1467971x|title=World Englishes - Wiley Online Library|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are approximately 75 territories where English is spoken either as a [[first language]] (L1) or as an unofficial or institutionalized [[second language]] (L2) in fields such as government, law and education. It is difficult to establish the total number of Englishes in the world, as new varieties of English are constantly being developed and discovered.&lt;ref name="Crystal"&gt;Crystal, D. (2007). ''English as a Global Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==World English vs. World Englishes vs. Global Englishes==
The notions of [[International English|World English]] and World Englishes are far from similar, although the terms are often mistakenly {{Citation needed|reason=How does one know this isn't just some arbitrary distinction just on Wikipedia?|date=December 2014}} used interchangeably. ''World English'' refers to the English language as a [[lingua franca]] used in business, trade, diplomacy and other spheres of global activity, while ''World Englishes'' refers to the different varieties of English and [[English-based creole languages|English-based creoles]] developed in different regions of the world. Alternatively, the term ''Global Englishes'' has been used by scholars in the field to emphasise the more recent spread of English due to [[globalization]], which has resulted in increased usage of [[English as a lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, N. &amp; Rose, H. (2015). ''Introducing Global Englishes.'' Arbingdon, UK: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradowski|first=Michał B.|title=Barbara Seidlhofer: Understanding English as a Lingua Franca: A Complete Introduction to the Theoretical Nature and Practical Implications of English used as a Lingua Franca (Review article)|url=https://www.academia.edu/3318842|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

===History of English===
{{Main|History of the English language}}

'''English''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic invaders]] into [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Initially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms of England. Eventually, one of these dialects, [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|Late West Saxon]], came to dominate.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;Baugh, A. C. and Cable. T. (1993). ''A History of the English Language''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two further waves of invasion: the first by speakers of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian branch]] of the Germanic language family, who conquered and colonized parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second by the [[Norman conquest of England|Normans in the 11th century]], who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed a Norman variety called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. For two centuries after the Norman Conquest, [[French language|French]] became the language of everyday life among the upper classes in England. Although the language of the masses remained English, the [[bilingual]] character of England in this period was thus formed.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Middle English]] period, France and England experienced a process of separation. This period of conflicting interests and feelings of resentment was later termed the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By the beginning of the 14th century, English had regained universal use and become the principal tongue of all England, but not without having undergone significant change.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], patriotic feelings regarding English brought about the recognition of English as the national language of England. The language was advocated as acceptable for learned and literary use. With the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the language in this period matured to a standard and differed significantly from the [[Middle English]] period, becoming recognizably "[[Early Modern English|modern]]".&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, R. (2002). "How much shifting actually occurred in the historical English vowel shift?", Minkova, Donka; Stockwell, Robert. ''Studies in the History of the English Language: A Millennial Perspective''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Modern English|18th century]], three main forces were driving the direction of the English language: (1) to reduce the language to rule and effect a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine the language by removing supposed defects and introducing certain improvements; and (3) to fix English permanently in the desired form. This desire for system and regularity in the language contrasted with the individualism and spirit of independence characterized by the previous age.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

By the 19th century, the expansion of the [[British Empire]], as well as global trade, had led to the spread of English around the world. The rising importance of some of England's larger colonies and former colonies, such as the rapidly developing United States, enhanced the value of the English varieties spoken in these regions, encouraging the belief, among the local populations, that their distinct varieties of English should be granted equal standing with the standard of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

===Global spread of English===
;The First dispersal: English is transported to the 'new world'
The first [[diaspora]] involved relatively large-scale [[Human migration|migrations]] of mother-tongue English speakers from [[England]], Scotland and Ireland predominantly to [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], Australia, [[South Africa]] and New Zealand. Over time, their own English dialects developed into modern American, Canadian, West Indian, South African, Australian, and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] Englishes. In contrast to the [[British English|English of Great Britain]], the varieties spoken in modern North America and Caribbean, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand have been modified in response to the changed and changing sociolinguistic contexts of the migrants, for example being in contact with indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Khoisan]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] or [[Māori people|Maori]] populations in the colonies.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins"&gt;[[Jenkins, Jennifer]]. (2003). ''World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students.'' London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Second dispersal: English is transported to Asia and Africa
The second [[diaspora]] was the result of the colonization of Asia and Africa, which led to the development of '[[New Englishes]]', the second-language varieties of English. In [[colonial Africa]], the history of English is distinct between West and East Africa. English in [[West Africa]] began with trade. particularly the [[slave trade]]. English soon gained official status in what are today [[Gambia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and some of the [[pidgin]] and [[creole language|creoles]] which developed from English contact, including [[Krio language|Krio]] (Sierra Leone) and [[Cameroon Pidgin]], have large numbers of speakers now.

As for [[East Africa]], extensive British settlements were established in what are now [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], where English became a crucial language of the government, education and the law. From the early 1960s, the six countries achieved independence in succession; but English remained the official language and had large numbers of second language speakers in Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi (along with [[Chewa language|Chewa]]).

English was formally introduced to the sub-continent of [[South Asia]] (India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]) during the second half of the eighteenth century. In India, English was given status through the implementation of Macaulay 'Minute' of 1835, which proposed the introduction of an English educational system in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Pritchett |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html |title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the process of '[[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]]' led to the development of a distinctive national character of English in the Indian sub-continent.

British influence in [[South-East Asia]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] began in the late eighteenth century, involving primarily the territories now known as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Hong Kong]]. [[Papua New Guinea]], also a [[British protectorate]], exemplified the English-based [[pidgin]] - [[Tok Pisin]].

The Americans came late in [[South-East Asia]] but their influence spread like wildfire as their reforms on education in the [[Philippines]] progressed in their less than half a century colonization of the islands. English has been taught since the American period and is one of the official languages of the Philippines. Ever since English became the official language, a localized variety gradually emerged - [[Philippine English]]. Lately, linguist Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wilkinson_Daniel_Wong_Gonzales?ev=hdr_xprf&amp;_sg=mCNszti2YtJXBcgvTb_FFtSXL3-s4zdYcFDgMf1MYf5IPlslU5e-unjgtlDoLAPc|title=Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales {{!}} Master of Arts, English Language and Linguistics {{!}} National University of Singapore, Singapore {{!}} NUS {{!}} Department of English Language &amp; Literature {{!}} ResearchGate|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that this variety has in itself more varieties, suggesting that we move towards [[Philippine Englishes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307896694|title=a to A��o Social Salesiana em rede... {{!}} Browse publications|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; paradigm to progress further in Schneider's dynamic model after gathering evidences of such happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Villanueva|first=Rey John Castro|title=The Features of Philippine English across Regions|date=2016|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=2750&amp;shelfbrowse_itemnumber=6284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, English is also learnt in other countries in neighbouring areas, most notably in [[Taiwan]], Japan and [[Korea]], with the latter two having begun to consider the possibility of making English their official second language.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

==Classification of Englishes==
The spread of English around the world is often discussed in terms of three distinct groups of users, where English is used respectively as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Jennifer|title=World englishes : a resource book for studens|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-25806-7|pages=14–15|edition=1. edition, 3. reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# a [[native language]] (ENL); the [[primary language]] of the majority population of a country, such as in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.
# a [[second language]] (ESL); an additional language for ''intra''national as well as ''inter''national communication in communities that are [[multilingual]], such as in India, [[Nigeria]], and [[Singapore]]. Most of these Englishes developed as a result of imperial expansion that brought the language to various parts of the world.
# a [[foreign language]] (EFL); used almost exclusively for international communication, such as in Japan.

===Kachru's Three Circles of English===
[[File:Kachru's three circles of English.jpg|thumb|alt=Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English|Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English''.]] The most influential model of the spread of English is [[Braj Kachru]]'s model of World Englishes. In this model the diffusion of English is captured in terms of three Concentric Circles of the language: The Inner Circle, the Outer Circle, and the Expanding Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). ''The Other Tongue: English across cultures''. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Inner Circle''''' refers to English as it originally took shape and was spread across the world in the first [[diaspora]]. In this transplantation of English, speakers from England carried the language to Australia, New Zealand and North America. The Inner Circle thus represents the traditional historical and sociolinguistic bases of English in regions where it is now used as a primary language: the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, anglophone Canada and [[South Africa]], and some of the [[Caribbean]] territories. English is the [[native language]] or [[mother tongue]] of most people in these countries. The total number of English speakers in the inner circle is as high as 380 million, of whom some 120 million are outside the United States.

The '''''Outer Circle''''' of English was produced by the second [[diaspora]] of English, which spread the language through imperial expansion by [[Great Britain]] in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In these regions, English is not the native tongue, but serves as a useful [[lingua franca]] between [[ethnic]] and language groups. Higher education, the [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]], national commerce and so on may all be carried out predominantly in English. This circle includes [[India]], [[Nigeria]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], non-Anglophone [[South Africa]], the [[Philippines]] (colonized by the US) and others. The total number of English speakers in the outer circle is estimated to range from 150 million to 300 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, Y. (2006). ''World Englishes in Asian Contexts''. (Larry E. Smith Eds.) Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]], while in the Outer Circle, may be drifting into the Inner Circle as English becomes more often used as a home language (see [[Languages of Singapore]]), much as Ireland did earlier. Countries where most people speak an [[English-based creole]] and retain standard English for official purposes, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], are also in the Outer Circle.

Finally, the '''''Expanding Circle''''' encompasses countries where English plays no historical or governmental role, but where it is nevertheless widely used as a medium of international communication. This includes much of the rest of the world's population not categorized above, including territories such as China, Russia, Japan, non-Anglophone [[Europe]] (especially the [[Netherlands]] and [[Nordic countries]]), [[South Korea]], [[Egypt]] and [[Indonesia]]. The total in this expanding circle is the most difficult to estimate, especially because English may be employed for specific, limited purposes, usually in a business context. The estimates of these users range from 100 million to one billion.

The inner circle (UK, US etc.) is 'norm-providing'; that means that English language [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] are developed in these countries. The outer circle (mainly [[Commonwealth countries|New Commonwealth countries]]) is 'norm-developing'. The expanding circle (which includes much of the rest of the world) is 'norm-dependent', because it relies on the standards set by [[native speakers]] in the inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). World Englishes: approaches, issues and resources. ''Language Teaching'', 25: 1-14. Cambridge UP''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schneider's Dynamic Model of Postcolonial Englishes===
{{Main|Schneider's Dynamic Model}}
Edgar Werner Schneider tries to avoid a purely geographical and historical approach evident in the 'circles' models and incorporates [[sociolinguistic|sociolinguistic concepts]] pertaining to acts of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name="y2"&gt;Le Page, R. B. and Tabouret-Keller, A. (1985). ''Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
He outlines five characteristic stages in the spread of English:

'''''Phase 1 - Foundation''''': This is the initial stage of the introduction of English to a new territory over an extended period of time. Two linguistic processes are operative at this stage: (a) [[language contact]] between English and [[indigenous language]]s; (b) contact between different [[dialects of English]] of the settlers which eventually results in a new stable [[dialect]] (see [[Koiné language|koiné]]). At this stage, [[bilingualism]] is marginal. A few members of the local populace may play an important role as interpreters, translators and guides. Borrowings are limited to lexical items; with local place names and terms for local fauna and flora being adopted by the English.&lt;ref name="y5"&gt;Schneider, E. W. (2007). ''Postcolonial English: Varieties around the world''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 2 - Exonormative stabilization''''': At this stage, the settler communities tend to stabilize politically under British rule. English increases in prominence and though the [[colloquial]] English is a colonial [[Koiné language|koiné]], the speakers look to England for their formal norms. Local vocabulary continues to be adopted. Bilingualism increases amongst the [[indigenous population]] through education and increased contacts with English settlers. Knowledge of English becomes an asset, and a new indigenous [[elite]] develops.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 3 - Nativisation''''': According to Schneider, this is the stage at which a transition occurs as the English settler population starts to accept a new [[identity (social science)|identity]] based on present and local realities, rather than sole allegiance to their 'mother country'. By this time, the indigenous strand has also stabilized an [[Second language|L2]] system that is a synthesis of substrate effects, interlanguage processes and features adopted from the settlers' [[Koiné language|koiné]] English. [[Neologisms]] stabilize as English is made to adapt to local sociopolitical and cultural practices.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 4 - Endonormative stabilization''''': This stage is characterized by the gradual acceptance of local [[Norms (sociology)|norms]], supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events have made it clear that the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound in a sense of [[nation]]hood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new [[identity (social science)|identity]]. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] (and not always for localized grammar). [[Literary genre|Literary creativity]] in local English begins to flourish.&lt;ref name="y1"&gt;Mesthrie, Rajend and Bhatt, Rakesh M. (2008). ''World Englishes: The Study of New Linguistic Varieties''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 5 - Differentiation''''': At this stage there is a change in the dynamics of [[identity (social science)|identity]] as the young nation sees itself as less defined by its differences from the [[British Empire|former colonial power]] as a composite of subgroups defined on regional, social and ethnic lines. Coupled with the simple effects of time in effecting [[language change]] (with the aid of [[social differentiation]]) the new English [[Koiné language|koiné]] starts to show greater differentiation.&lt;ref name="y1" /&gt;

===Other models of classification===
====Strevens's world map of English====
The oldest map of the spread of English is Strevens's world map of English.  His world map, even predating that of Kachru's three circles, showed that since American English became a separate variety from British English, all subsequent Englishes have had affinities with either one or the other.&lt;ref name="y3"&gt;Strevens, P. (1980). ''Teaching English as an International Language''. Oxford: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====McArthur's circle of World English====
McArthur's "wheel model" has an idealized central variety called "World Standard English," which is best represented by "written international English." The next circle is made of regional standards or standards that are emerging. Finally, the outer layer consists of localized varieties which may have similarities with the regional standards or emerging standards.

Although the model is neat, it raises several problems. Firstly, the three different types of English&amp;nbsp;— ENL, [[ESL]] and [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]], are conflated in the second circle. Secondly, the multitude of Englishes in Europe are also missing in this layer. Finally, the outside layer includes [[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and [[Second language|L2]] Englishes. Most scholars would argue that [[Pidgin English|English pidgins]] and [[English creoles|creoles]] do not belong to one family: rather they have overlapping multiple memberships.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, A. (1987). "The English Languages?" ''English Today'': 11:9-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Görlach's circle model of English====
Manfred Görlach's and McArthur's models are reasonably similar. Both exclude English varieties in Europe. As Görlach does not include [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]]s at all, his model is more consistent, though less comprehensive. Outside the circle are mixed varieties ([[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and mixed languages involving English), which are better categorized as having partial membership.&lt;ref&gt;Görlach, M. (1990).''Studies in the History of the English Language''. Heidelberg: Carl Winter.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modiano's model of English====
In Modiano's model of English, the center consists of users of English as an International Language, with a core set of features which are comprehensible to the majority of native and competent [[non-native speakers]] of English. The second circle consists of features which may become internationally common or may fall into obscurity. Finally, the outer area consists of five groups ([[American English]], [[British English]], other major varieties, local varieties, foreign varieties) each with features peculiar to their own speech community and which are unlikely to be understood by most members of the other four groups.&lt;ref&gt;Modiano, M. (1999). "Standard English(es) and educational practices for the world's lingua franca". ''English Today'': 15/4: 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations and varieties==
 {{main|List of dialects of the English language}}

The World Englishes paradigm is not static, and neither are rapidly changing realities of language use worldwide. The use of English in the Outer and Expanding Circle societies (refer to '''Kachru's Three Circles of English''') continues its rapid spread, while at the same time new patterns of [[language contact]] and variety differentiation emerge. The different varieties range from English in the Inner circle societies such as the United States, Canada, [[South Africa]], Australia and New Zealand, to the Outer circle post-colonial societies of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].
The World Englishes initiative, in recognizing and describing the New Englishes of the [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]], [[African English|Africa]] and [[Asia]], has been partly motivated by a consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by a consideration of the wider [[cultural]] and [[political]] contexts of [[language acquisition]] and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. B., Kachru, Y. and Nelson, C. (2009). ''The Handbook of World Englishes''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[language]]'' and ''[[dialect]]'' are not easily defined concepts. It is often suggested that languages are [[Autonomous language|autonomous]], while dialects are [[Heteronomous language|heteronomous]]. It is also said that dialects, in contrast with languages, are mutually intelligible, though this is not always the case. Dialects are characteristically spoken, do not have a codified form and are used only in certain domains.&lt;ref name ="Melchers"&gt;Melchers, G. and Shaw, P. (2003) World Englishes. ''The English Language Series''. Department of English, Stockholm University, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to avoid the difficult dialect-language distinction, linguists tend to prefer a more neutral term, ''variety'', which covers both concepts and is not clouded by popular usage. This term is generally used when discussing World Englishes.

==The future of World Englishes==
Two scenarios have been advanced about English's future status as the major [[world language]]: it  will ultimately fragment into a large number of [[mutually unintelligible]] varieties (in effect, [[languages]]), or it will converge so that differences across groups of speakers are largely eliminated.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

===English as the language of 'others'===
If English is, numerically speaking, the language of 'others', then the center of gravity of the language is almost certain to shift in the direction of the 'others'. In the words of [[Henry Widdowson|Widdowson]], there is likely to be a paradigm shift from one of language distribution to one of language spread:&lt;ref&gt;Widdowson, H. G. (1997). "EIL, ESL, EFL: Global Issues and Local Interests". ''World Englishes'', 16: 135–146.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When we talk about the spread of English, then, it is not that the conventionally coded forms and meanings are transmitted into different environments and different surroundings, and taken up and used by different groups of people. It is not a matter of the actual language being distributed but of the virtual language being spread and in the process being variously actualized. The distribution of the actual language implies adoption and conformity. The spread of virtual language implies adaptation and nonconformity. The two processes are quite different.}}

In this new paradigm, English spreads and adapts according to the linguistic and cultural preferences of its users in the Outer and Expanding circles (refer to Kachru's Three Circles of English). However, if English is genuinely to become the language of 'others', then the 'others' have to be accorded&amp;nbsp;– or perhaps more likely, accord themselves&amp;nbsp;– at least the same English language rights as those claimed by mother-tongue speakers.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, M.B. 2008, Apr. Winds of change in the English language&amp;nbsp;– Air of peril for native speakers? Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language) 2(1), 92–119. http://www.novitasroyal.org/paradowski.pdf However, it remains to be seen whether such a [[paradigm shift]] will take place.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A different world language===
The other potential shift in the linguistic center of gravity is that English could lose its [[International English|international role]] altogether, or come to share it with a number of equals. Although this would not happen mainly as a result of native-speaker resistance to the spread of non-native speaker Englishes and the consequent abandoning of English by large numbers of non-native speakers, the latter could play a part.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

As evidence that English may eventually give way to another language (or languages) as the world's [[lingua franca]], [[David Crystal]] cites [[Internet]] data:&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (2001) Language and the Internet. Cambridge UP.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When the internet started it was of course 100 percent English because of where it came from, but since the 1980s that status has started to fall away. By 1995, it was down to about 80 per cent present of English on the internet, and the current figures for 2001 are that it is hovering somewhere between 60 percent and 70 percent, with a significant drop likely over the next four or five years.}}
On the other hand, there are at least 1500 languages present on the internet now and that figure is likely to increase.  Nevertheless, Crystal predicts that English will retain its dominant presence.

'''World Environment Day''' ('''WED''') is celebrated on the 5th of June every year, and is the [[United Nations|United Nation's]] principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the [[environmental protection|protection of our environment]]. First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging [[environmental issue]]s from [[marine pollution]], human [[overpopulation]], and [[global warming]], to [[sustainable consumption]] and wildlife crime. WED has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.

==History==
World Environment Day [WED] was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/environmentday/background.shtml|title=World Environment Day - 5 June|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the first day of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]], resulting from discussions on the integration of human interactions and the environment. Two years later, in 1974 the first WED was held with the theme "Only One Earth". Even though WED celebration have been held annually since 1974, in 1987 the idea for rotating the center of these activities through selecting different host countries began.

Originally based in England, at the [[Hereford Cattle Society]], the Council was established in 1951 as a response to the increasingly widespread international export and breeding of Hereford cattle, and the need to maintain a global authority connecting Hereford cattle to the original English herd book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herefordcattle.org/about-us/history/ Hereford Cattle Society: History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herefords.com/ World Hereford Council Constitution], Constitution and Rules.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Headquarters of the Council are based in the country of residence of the Secretary General (Uruguay, as of 2015), and move with each new election.&lt;ref&gt;Sociedad Criadores de Hereford del Uruguay. [http://www.hereforduruguay2016.org/ World Hereford Council] 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Hereford Council aims to advance the mutual interests of pedigree Hereford breeders on a worldwide scale, to act as an international breed authority, and to act as mediator in any disagreements or conflicts that may occur between any of the member countries. Structurally, the Council is led by a Secretary General, voted in by the twenty member countries (each nominating two representatives).

The '''World Map 1:2,500,000''' ({{lang-ru|Карта Мира 1:2,500,000}}) is an internationally standardized and edited [[map series]]. The term ''Карта Мира'' or in transcription ''Karta Mira'' is now commonly used to describe this series, even outside the [[Soviet Union]] or [[Russia]].  The ''Karta Mira'' consists of a total of 224 (#1-17 &amp; 28-234) main sheets and 38 overlap sheets (although at least 10 were dropped). They depict the entire earth (land and water surfaces) according to a uniform scale, coloring and drawing system. The ''Karta Mira 1956-1975'' was produced by cartographers from [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[German Democratic Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and the Soviet Union.

The production of a 1:2,500,000 scale map of the world had been discussed since the late 1940s, partly because many cartographers were dissatisfied with the work on the [[International Map of the World]] (or ''Millionth Map'', after its scale of 1:1,000,000).  Due to the destruction of the ''Central Bureau of the Map of the World'' in London during [[World War II]], the Millionth Map had suffered a serious setback, and it was uncertain whether that series could ever be completed.

The initiative for the production of the Karta Mira was taken by cartographers from Hungary ([[Alexander Radó]], Peter Halasz, E. Foldi, Istvan Joo), the Soviet Union (Grigory A. Ginzburg (Григорий А. Гинзбург), Ilya Andreyevich Kutuzov (Илья Андреевич Кутузов)) and the GDR (Erfried Haack, Horst Nischan, Manfred Pateisat).

Production of the 262 sheets was divided between the Geodetic Services of the participating countries.  Thus, the sheets to be produced in the GDR were printed by VEB Hermann Haack Geographisch-Kartographische Anstalt Gotha and VEB Kombinat Geodäsie und Kartographie in [[Leipzig]] and [[Potsdam]]. The sheets to be produced in the Soviet Union were created by the Department of Geodesy and Cartography (Главное Управление геодезии и картографии) in [[Moscow]]. Proofs of several of the sheets involved in the series were presented by East German cartographers at an international conference in [[Erfurt]] in December 1963.

The first four sheets were published in 1964, and the final sheets of the first edition in 1976.  Sheet were published in several versions: a full version, a version without contours (for social science thematic mapping) and a version without placenames and infrastructure (for scientific thematic mapping).
 
The title of each sheet was given in Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, but all placenames on the map itself were given only in the Latin alphabet.

Publication of a second edition began in 1989, but appears to have been abandoned with the collapse of the Communist regimes in the Eastern Bloc shortly thereafter.

==Population by region==
Six of the [[Earth]]'s seven [[continents]] are permanently inhabited on a large scale. [[Asia]] is the most populous continent, with its 4.54 billion inhabitants accounting for 60% of the world population. The world's two most populated countries, [[China]] and [[India]], together constitute about 36% of the world's population. [[Africa]] is the second most populated continent, with around 1.28 billion people, or 16% of the world's population. [[Europe]]'s 742 million people make up 10% of the world's population as of 2018, while the [[Latin American]] and [[Caribbean]] regions are home to around 651 million (9%). [[Northern America]], primarily consisting of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], has a population of around 363 million (5%), and [[Oceania]], the least populated region, has about 41 million inhabitants (0.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Analytical-Figures/htm/fig_2.htm|title=World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision Population Database |publisher=United Nations |date=April 15, 2011 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is not permanently inhabited by any fixed population, [[Antarctica]] has a small, fluctuating international population based mainly in polar [[Research stations in Antarctica|science stations]].

==History==
{{See also|World population estimates|History of the world}}
Estimates of world population by their nature are an aspect of [[modernity]], possible only since the [[Age of Discovery]]. Early estimates for the population of the world&lt;ref&gt;the [[English compound|compound]] "world population" becomes common from c. the 1930s, adapted from early 20th-century "world's population"; pre-20th century authors use "population of the world".&lt;/ref&gt; date to the 17th century: [[William Petty]] in 1682 estimated world population at  320 million (modern estimates ranging close to twice this number); by the late 18th century, estimates ranged close to one billion (consistent with modern estimates).&lt;ref&gt;"The population of the world, which Sir W. P. in 1682, stated at only 320 millions, has been estimated by some writers at about 730 millions, by others, at upwards of 900 millions; Mr. Wallace, of Edinburgh, conjectured it might amount to 1000 millions, and this number has since generally been adopted who have noticed the subject;" ''The Monthly Magazine'' 4 (July&amp;ndash;December 1797), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0S0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 167].&lt;/ref&gt; More refined estimates, broken down by continents, were published in the first half of the 19th century, at 600 to 1000 million in the early 1800s and at 800 to 1000 million in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;600 million: Simon Gray, ''The Happiness of States'' (1818), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ue5eAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA356  p. 356].
800 million:  Gordon Hall, Samuel Newell, ''The Conversion of the World'' (1818), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzA3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA10  p. 10].
800 to 1000 million: John Redman Coxe, ''Considerations Respecting the Recognition of Friends in Another World'' (1845), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gl9IAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 21] (footnote with references).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult for estimates to be better than rough approximations, as even modern population estimates are fraught with uncertainties on the order of 3% to 5%.&lt;ref&gt;"Even recent demographic data is accurate only from 3 to 5%, although in demography traditionally more digits are indicated than those having a meaning. This is partially due to the ethical difficulty in rounding off numbers that supposedly represent real people, officially counted during a census." Sergei P Kapitza, 'The phenomenological theory of world population growth', ''Physics-Uspekhi'' 39(1) 57-71 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Population size fluctuates at differing rates in differing regions. Nonetheless, population growth is the long-standing trend on all inhabited continents, as well as in most individual states. During the 20th century, the global population saw its greatest increase in known history, rising from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to over 6 billion in 2000. A number of factors contributed to this increase, including the lessening of the [[mortality rate]] in many countries by improved sanitation and [[History of medicine#Modern medicine|medical advances]], and a massive increase in agricultural productivity attributed to the [[Green Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6496585.stm |title=The limits of a Green Revolution? |publisher=BBC News|date=March 29, 2007 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/19525.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422210924/http://www.energybulletin.net/19525.html |archivedate=April 22, 2008 |title=The Real Green Revolution |publisher=Energybulletin.net |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf|title=World Population to 2300|format=PDF|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|date=2004|accessdate= June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the United Nations estimated that the world's population was growing at an annual rate of 1.14% (equivalent to around 75 million people),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldpop.html |title=International Programs |publisher=USCB |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; down from a peak of 88 million per year in 1989. By 2000, there were approximately ten times as many people on Earth as there had been in 1700. Globally, the population [[population growth|growth rate]] has been steadily declining from its peak of 2.19% in 1963, but growth remains high in Latin America, the Middle East, and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Nielsen|date=2006|title=The Little Green Handbook|publisher=Picador|place=New York|isbn= 0-312-42581-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fertility rate world map 2.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Map of countries by fertility rate (2018), according to [[CIA World Factbook]]
]]

During the 2010s, Japan and some countries in [[Europe]] began to encounter [[negative population growth]] (i.e. a [[Net (economics)|net]] decrease in population over time), due to [[sub-replacement fertility]] rates.&lt;ref name=BigDecline&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/9999591/Japans-population-suffers-biggest-fall-in-history.html|title=Japan's population suffers biggest fall in history|work=Daily Telegraph|date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2013|location=London|first=Danielle|last=Demetriou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the United Nations stated that the rate of population growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global [[demographic transition]]. If this trend continues, the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050, concurrent with a world population plateau of 9.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2006/WPP2006_Highlights_rev.pdf |title=2006 report highlights|format=PDF |publisher=United Nations|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is only one of many estimates published by the UN; in 2009, UN population projections for 2050 ranged between around 8 billion and 10.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |title=UN population estimates and projections, database query, August 2009 |publisher=United Nations |date=March 11, 2009 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative scenario is given by the statistician Jorgen Randers, who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility. Randers' "most likely scenario" reveals a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 8.1 billion people, followed by decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Randers, Jorgen|date=2012|title=2052: A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years|publisher=Vermont: Chelsea Green Publishing|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Raftery, a [[University of Washington]] professor of statistics and of sociology, states that "there’s a 70 percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century. Population, which had sort of fallen off the world’s agenda, remains a very important issue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/09/18/world-population-to-keep-growing-this-century-hit-11-billion-by-2100/ World population to keep growing this century, hit 11 billion by 2100].

Using the above figures, the change in population from 2010 to 2015 was:

*World: +420 million
*Africa: +142 million
*Asia: +223 million
*Europe: +3 million
*Latin America and Caribbean: +35 million
*Northern America: +14 million
*Oceania: +2.9 million

===Projections===
{{Main|World population estimates|Projections of population growth}}
Long-term global population growth is difficult to predict. The United Nations and the US Census Bureau both give different estimates – according to the UN, the world population reached seven billion in late 2011,&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_highlights.pdf |title=World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision |publisher=[[Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat]]|format=PDF|date=June 2009|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the USCB asserted that this occurred in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/popwnote.html | publisher = US Census Bureau | title = Notes on the World POPClock and World Vital Events|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN has issued multiple projections of future world population, based on different assumptions. From 2000 to 2005, the UN consistently revised these projections downward, until the 2006 revision, issued on March 14, 2007, revised the 2050 mid-range estimate upwards by 273 million.

Average global [[birth rate]]s are declining fast, but vary greatly between developed countries (where birth rates are often at or below replacement levels) and developing countries (where birth rates typically remain high). Different ethnicities also display varying birth rates. [[Death rate]]s can change rapidly due to [[Infectious disease#Mortality from infectious diseases|disease epidemics]], [[List of wars|wars]] and other mass catastrophes, or [[Life extension|advances in medicine]].

2012 United projections show a continued increase in population in the near future with a steady decline in population growth rate; the global population is expected to reach between 8.3&amp;nbsp;and 10.9&amp;nbsp;billion by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/wpp/unpp/panel_population.htm |title=World Population Prospects, the 2012 Revision – "Low variant" and "High variant" values|publisher=UN|date=2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45165|title= World population projected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050 – UN report|publisher=UN News Centre|date=June 14, 2013|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2003 [[United Nations Population Division|UN Population Division]] population projections for the year 2150 range between 3.2 and 24.8 billion.&lt;ref name=LongRangeProjections2003KeyFindings&gt;{{Cite book |date=2003 |chapter=Key Findings |title=Long-Range Population Projections |work=Proceedings of the United Nations Technical Working Group on Long-Range Population Projections |place=New York |publisher=United Nations: Department of Economic and Social Affairs |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange/longrangeKeyFind.pdf |accessdate=July 3, 2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of many independent mathematical models supports the lower estimate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130404072923.htm |title=A model predicts that the world's populations will stop growing in 2050 |publisher=ScienceDaily.com |date=April 4, 2013 |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 2014 estimate forecasts between 9.3 and 12.6 billion in 2100, and continued growth thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/18/world-population-new-study-11bn-2100|title=World population to hit 12bn in 2100 – with 70% chance of continuous rise|author=Carrington, Damien|first=|date=September 18, 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1257469| pmid = 25301627| title = World population stabilization unlikely this century| journal = Science| volume = 346| issue = 6206| pages = 234–7| publisher  = AAAS| date = September 14, 2014| url  = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/09/17/science.1257469| issn  =  1095-9203| last1 = Gerland | first1 = P.| last2 = Raftery | first2 = A.

==Mathematical approximations==
In 1975, [[Sebastian von Hoerner]] proposed a formula for population growth which represented [[hyperbolic growth]] with an infinite population in 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sebastien von Hoerner|title=Population Explosion and Interstellar Expansion|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|issue=28|date=1975|pages=691–712}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development. This feedback can be described as follows: technological advance → increase in the [[carrying capacity]] of land for people → demographic growth → more people → more potential inventors → acceleration of technological advance → accelerating growth of the carrying capacity → faster population growth → accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors → faster technological advance → hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=37484&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics'']. [[Andrey Korotayev]] ''et al.'' For a rigorous mathematical analysis of this issue, see [https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0496 "A Compact Mathematical Model of the World System Economic and Demographic Growth, 1 CE – 1973 CE"].&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the [[demographic transition]].

According to the Russian demographer [[Sergey Kapitsa]],&lt;ref name=Kapitza&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sergei P. |last=Kapitsa |url=http://srs.dl.ac.uk/SPEAKERS/KAPITZA/Uspekhi_96.html |title=The phenomenological theory of world population growth |journal=Physics-Uspekhi |volume=39 |number=1 |pages=57–71 |date=1996 |accessdate=2013-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511041230/http://srs.dl.ac.uk/SPEAKERS/KAPITZA/Uspekhi_96.html |archivedate=May 11, 2009 |doi=10.1070/pu1996v039n01abeh000127|bibcode=1996PhyU...39...57K }}&lt;/ref&gt; the world population grew between 67,000 BC and 1965 according to the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt; N = \frac{C}{\tau} \arccot \frac{T_0-T}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''N'' is current population
* ''T'' is the current year
* ''C'' = (1.86±0.01)·10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 2007±1
* &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; = 42±1

===Years for world population to double===
According to linear interpolation and extrapolation of [[world population estimates|UNDESA population estimates]], the world population has doubled, or will double, in the years listed in the tables below (with two different starting points). During the [[2nd millennium]], each doubling took roughly half as long as the previous doubling, fitting the hyperbolic growth model mentioned above. However, after 2024, it is unlikely that there will be another doubling of the global population in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6635/full/387803a0.html |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Lutz |first2=Warren |last2=Sanderson |first3=Sergei |last3=Scherbov |title=Doubling of world population unlikely |journal=Nature |volume=387 |pages=803–805 |date=1997-06-19 |accessdate=2012-10-23 |issue=6635 |doi=10.1038/42935 |pmid=9194559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predictions of scarcity===
[[File:Los Angeles Aerial view 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Greater Los Angeles Area|Greater Los Angeles]] lies on a coastal mediterranean [[savannah]] with a small [[Drainage basin|watershed]] that is able to support at most one million people on [[water scarcity|its own water]]; as of 2015, the area has a population of over 18 million. Researchers predict that similar cases of resource scarcity will grow more common as the world population increases.&lt;ref name=BeddWarn/&gt;]]
In his 1798 work ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', the British scholar [[Thomas Malthus]] incorrectly predicted that continued population growth would exhaust the global food supply by the mid-19th century. Malthus wrote the essay to refute what he considered the unattainable [[utopian]] ideas of [[William Godwin]] and [[Marquis de Condorcet]], as presented in ''[[Political Justice]]'' and ''[[The Future Progress of the Human Mind]]''. In 1968, [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] reprised Malthus' argument in ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', predicting that mass global [[famine]] would occur in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/23/paul-ehrlich-global-collapse-warning|title=Paul Ehrlich, a prophet of global population doom who is gloomier than ever|work=The Guardian|date=October 23, 2011|accessdate=July 22, 2013|location=London|first=Juliette|last=Jowit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predictions of Ehrlich and other [[Neo-malthusianism|neo-Malthusians]] were vigorously challenged by a number of economists, notably [[Julian Lincoln Simon]], and advances in agriculture, collectively known as the [[Green Revolution]], forestalled any potential global famine in the late 20th century. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the world, grain production increased by over 250%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kindall, Henery W |author2=Pimentel, David |last-author-amp=yes|title=Constraints on the Expansion of the Global Food Supply |journal=Ambio |volume=23 |issue=3 |date=May 1994 |url= http://dieoff.org/page36.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world population has grown by over four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution, but food production has so far kept pace with population growth. Most scholars believe that, without the Revolution, there would be greater levels of famine and malnutrition than the UN presently documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6496585.stm|title=The limits of a Green Revolution?|publisher=BBC News|date=March 29, 2007|accessdate= February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neo-Malthusians point out that [[fossil fuel]]s provided the energy for the Green Revolution, in the form of natural gas-derived [[fertilizers]], oil-derived [[pesticides]], and [[hydrocarbon]]-fueled [[irrigation]], and that many crops have become so genetically uniform that a crop failure in any one country could potentially have global repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/eigenbr.htm|title=Host Plant Resistance and Conservation of Genetic Diversity|work=Radcliffe's IPM World Textbook|publisher=University of Minnesota|date= March 2013|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a meta-analysis of 70 quantitative studies estimating a [[carrying capacity|sustainable limit to the world population]] generated a meta-estimate of 7.7 billion people.&lt;ref name="van den BerghRietveld2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van den Bergh|first1=Jeroen C.

A number of scientists have argued that the current global population expansion and accompanying increase in [[resource consumption]] threatens the world's [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/gfn_sub.php?content=overshoot | title=Ecological Debt Day | accessdate=February 18, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217234021/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/gfn_sub.php?content=overshoot | archivedate=December 17, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}

&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[InterAcademy Panel]] [[IAP statement on population growth|Statement on Population Growth]], which was ratified by 58 member [[national academy|national academies]] in 1994, states that "unprecedented" population growth aggravates many environmental problems, including rising levels of [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]], [[global warming]], and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interacademies.net/?id=3547 |title=IAP (login required) |publisher=InterAcademies.net |accessdate=February 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210203604/http://www.interacademies.net/?id=3547 |archivedate=February 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some analysts claim that overpopulation's most serious impact is its effect on the environment.&lt;ref name=TIMEenvir&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2097720_2097782_2097814,00.html |title=Overpopulation's Real Victim Will Be the Environment|work=TIME|date=October 26, 2011|accessdate= February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The situation has continued to worsen, as at the time of the 1994 IAP statement, the world population stood at 5.5 billion and lower-bound scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050, a number that current estimates state will be reached in the late 2020s.

===Population control===

Human population control is the practice of intervening to alter the rate of population growth. Historically, human population control has been implemented by limiting a region's [[birth rate]], by voluntary contraception or by government mandate. It has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty, [[carrying capacity|environmental concerns]], and [[religion|religious reasons]]. The use of [[abortion]] in some population control strategies has caused controversy,&lt;ref&gt;Some population control programs, such as China's [[one-child policy]], entail the use of forced late-term abortions, sparking domestic anger and international condemnation: {{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/15/world/la-fg-china-abortions-20120616 |title=China one-child policy leads to forced abortions, mothers' deaths|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 15, 2012|accessdate= August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with religious organizations such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]] explicitly opposing any intervention in the human reproductive process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20081208_xlii-world-day-peace_en.html |title=Fighting poverty to build peace|publisher= [[Holy See|Vatican]]|date=January 1, 2009|accessdate= October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Nebraska]] publication ''Green Illusions'' argues that population control to alleviate environmental pressures need not be coercive. It states that "Women who are educated, economically engaged, and in control of their own bodies can enjoy the freedom of bearing children at their own pace, which happens to be a rate that is appropriate for the aggregate ecological endowment of our planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehmer|first=Ozzie|title=Green lllusions|date=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska|location=Lincoln and London|page=188|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Fatal Misconception'' by Matthew Connelly similarly points to the importance of supporting the rights of women in bringing population levels down over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CwImmRvyyiEC|title=Fatal Misconception: The Struggle to Control World Population|author=Connelly, Matthew|date=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press via [[Google Books]]|isbn=9780674029835}}&lt;/ref&gt;
