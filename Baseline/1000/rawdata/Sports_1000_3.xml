{{Black Power sidebar}}
During their medal ceremony in the [[Estadio Olímpico Universitario|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Mexico City]] on October 16, 1968, [[African Americans|African-American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] each [[Raised fist|raised a black-gloved fist]] during the playing of the US national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]". While on the podium, Smith and Carlos, who had won gold and bronze medals respectively in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metres|200-meter]] running event of the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], turned to face the US flag and then kept their hands raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist [[Peter Norman]] all wore human-rights badges on their jackets.

In his autobiography, ''Silent Gesture'', Smith stated that the gesture was not a "[[Black Power]]" salute but rather a "human rights salute". The demonstration is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |last=Lewis |first=Richard |date=8 October 2006 |title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's [[Peter Norman]] finished second with a time of 20.06&amp;nbsp;seconds, and the US's John Carlos won third place with a time of 20.10&amp;nbsp;seconds. After the race was completed, the three went to the podium for their medals to be presented by [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter]]. The two US athletes received their medals shoeless, but wearing black socks, to represent black poverty.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3535000/3535348.stm |publisher=BBC |title=1968: Black athletes make silent protest |accessdate=9 November 2008 |date=17 October 1968 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mq5SLffC?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3535000/3535348.stm |archivedate=17 January 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith wore a black scarf around his neck to represent black pride, Carlos had his tracksuit top unzipped to show solidarity with all [[blue-collar worker]]s in the US and wore a necklace of beads which he described "were for those individuals that were lynched, or killed and that no-one said a prayer for, that were hung and [[Tarred and feathered|tarred]]."

The famous picture of the event was taken by photographer [[John Dominis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://life.time.com/culture/black-power-salute-tommie-smith-and-john-carlos-at-the-1968-olympics/#1 | publisher=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] | title=Hope and Defiance: The Black Power Salute That Rocked the 1968 Olympics | accessdate=13 November 2013 | date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both US athletes intended to bring black gloves to the event, but Carlos forgot his, leaving them in the Olympic Village. It was Peter Norman who suggested Carlos wear Smith's left-handed glove. For this reason, Carlos raised his left hand as opposed to his right, differing from the traditional Black Power salute.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7674157.stm |publisher=BBC | title=The other man on the podium | accessdate=9 November 2008 | date=17 October 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081020092915/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7674157.stm| archivedate=20 October 2008| deadurl= no | first=Caroline | last=Frost}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'' played, Smith and Carlos delivered the salute with heads bowed, a gesture which became front-page news around the world.

But if I did something bad, then they would say I am a Negro. We are black and we are proud of being black. Black America will understand what we did tonight."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

Tommie Smith stated in later years that "We were concerned about the lack of black assistant coaches. About how [[Muhammad Ali]] got stripped of his title. About the lack of access to good housing and our kids not being able to attend the top colleges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/columnists/erika-smith/2015/03/18/smith-tried-make-moment-movement/24983931/|title=Smith: 'They tried to make it a moment, but it was a movement'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Olympic Committee response ==
[[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) president [[Avery Brundage]] deemed it to be a domestic political statement unfit for the apolitical, international forum the Olympic Games were intended to be. In response to their actions, he ordered Smith and Carlos suspended from the US team and banned from the Olympic Village. When the US Olympic Committee refused, Brundage threatened to ban the entire US track team. This threat led to the expulsion of the two athletes from the Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/September-October-08/On-this-Day--US-Athletes-Give-Black-Power-Salute-on-Olympic-Podium.html On This Day: Tommie Smith and John Carlos Give Black Power Salute on Olympic Podium]. Findingdulcinea.com. Retrieved on 13 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesman for the IOC said Smith and Carlos's actions were "a deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental principles of the Olympic spirit."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Brundage, who was president of the United States Olympic Committee in 1936, had made no objections against [[Nazi salute]]s during the [[1936 Berlin Olympics|Berlin Olympics]]. He argued that the Nazi salute, being a national salute at the time, was acceptable in a competition of nations, while the athletes' salute was not of a nation and therefore unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;"The Olympic Story", editor James E. Churchill, Jr., published 1983 by Grolier Enterprises Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brundage had been accused of being one of the United States' most prominent Nazi sympathisers even after the outbreak of the Second World War,&lt;ref&gt;Documentary "Hitler's Pawn: The Margeret Lambert Story", produced by HBO and Black Canyon Productions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/31/sport/germany-berlin-jewish-olympics-maccabi/index.html|title=Adolf Hitler and the man 'who beat Jesse Owens' - CNN|first=James Masters,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his removal as president of the IOC had been one of the three stated objectives of the Olympic Project for Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XGA7LZuDbbgC Silent Gesture – Autobiography of Tommie Smith]'' (excerpt via [[Google Books]]) – Smith, Tommie &amp; Steele, David, [[Temple University Press]], 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-59213-639-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the official IOC website stated that "Over and above winning medals, the black American athletes made names for themselves by an act of racial protest."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/mexico-1968-summer-olympics Mexico 1968] (official [[International Olympic Committee]] website. Retrieved 30 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Smith and Carlos were largely ostracized by the US sporting establishment and they were subject to criticism. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on October 25, 1968, wrote: "[[Citius, Altius, Fortius (Olympic motto)|'Faster, Higher, Stronger']] is the motto of the Olympic Games. 'Angrier, nastier, uglier' better describes the scene in Mexico City last week."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/vault/issue/1968-10-25/page/78/|title=The TIME Vault: October 25, 1968|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time1968&gt;{{cite news |title=The Olympics: Black Complaint|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900397,00.html|accessdate=12 August 2012|newspaper=Time|date=25 October 1968|quote="Faster, Higher, Stronger" is the motto of the Olympic Games.

There, in the same stadium from which 6,200 pigeons swooped skyward to signify the opening of the "Peace Olympics," Sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos, two disaffected black athletes from the US put on a public display of petulance that sparked one of the most unpleasant controversies in Olympic history and turned the high drama of the games into theater of the absurd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back home, both Smith and Carlos were subject to abuse and they and their families received death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tommiesmith.com/ | publisher=Tommie Smith | title=Tommie Smith 1968 Olympic Gold Medalist | accessdate=9 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081019235408/http://www.tommiesmith.com/| archivedate= 19 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith continued in athletics, playing in the [[National Football League|NFL]] with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography.com/people/tommie-smith-9487382 Tommie Smith]. biography.com&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming an assistant professor of physical education at [[Oberlin College]]. In 1995, he helped coach the US team at the World Indoor Championships at [[Barcelona]]. In 1999 he was awarded the California Black Sportsman of the Millennium Award. He is now a public speaker.

Carlos' career followed a similar path. He tied the [[100&amp;nbsp;yard dash]] world record the following year. Carlos also tried professional football, was a 15th round selection in the [[1970 NFL Draft]], but a knee injury curtailed his tryout with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].&lt;ref name="DidingerLyons2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ray Didinger|author2=Robert S.

In 1985, he became a track and field coach at [[Palm Springs High School]]. As of 2012, Carlos works as a counselor at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dobuzinskis|first=Alex|title=Former Olympians: No regrets over 1968 protest|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/21/oly-athl-usa-protest-adv-idUSL2E8IC65M20120721|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=13 December 2012|date=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman, who was sympathetic to his competitors' protest, was criticized by conservatives in the Australian media. [[Julius Patching]], the Australian Chef de Mission, was amused and semi-jokingly told Norman off in private with the words, "They're screaming out for your blood, so consider yourself severely reprimanded.

However Australian officials say he was not picked because he came third in the Australian trials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Norman not shunned by AOC|url=http://corporate.olympics.com.au/news/peter-norman-not-shunned-by-aoc|publisher=Australian Olympic Committee|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part due to a knee injury which severely affected his performance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Ron|title=Peter may have lost team place|url=http://aoc-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/corporate/live/files/dmfile/Peter%20Norman%20-%20Ron%20Carter%20article%20-%20The%20Age%201972.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2016|agency=The Age|date=27 March 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was only cautioned after the 1968 incident, and he had been profiled "one of our finest Olympians". Norman also represented Australia at the [[Athletics at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games|1970 Commonwealth Games]].

When Norman died in 2006, Smith and Carlos were [[pallbearers]] at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin|last=Flanagan|authorlink=Martin Flanagan (journalist)|title=Olympic protest heroes praise Norman's courage|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/olympic-protest-heroes-praise-normans-courage/2006/10/09/1160246069969.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=6 October 2006|accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Australia formally apologized to Norman, with one MP telling Parliament that Norman's gesture "was a moment of heroism and humility that advanced international awareness for racial inequality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewleigh.com/3389|title=Parliament Apologises to Peter Norman|author=|date=|website=andrewleigh.com|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentary films ==
The 2008 [[Sydney Film Festival]] featured a documentary about the protest entitled ''[[Salute (2008 film)|Salute]]''. The film was written, directed and produced by [[Matt Norman (director)|Matt Norman]], a nephew of Peter Norman.&lt;ref name="SydneyFilmFestival_2008_ProgramRevealed_MattNorman_Salute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneyfilmfestival.org/content.asp?id=21&amp;nid=116&amp;p=20|title=2008 Program Revealed!|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=17 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125152931/http://www.sydneyfilmfestival.org/content.asp?id=21&amp;nid=116&amp;p=20 |archivedate=25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2008, [[BBC Four]] broadcast a documentary, ''Black Power Salute'', by Geoff Small, about the protest. In an article, Small noted that the athletes of the British team attending the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]] in Beijing had been asked to sign gagging clauses which would have restricted their right to make political statements but that they had refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/09/olympicgames2008.humanrights |work=The Guardian |location=UK | last=Small | first=Geoff | date=9 July 2008 | title=Remembering the Black Power protest | accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tributes ==
In a 2011 speech to the [[University of Guelph]], Akaash Maharaj, a member of the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]] and head of Canada's [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic equestrian team]], said, "In that moment, Tommie Smith, Peter Norman, and John Carlos became the living embodiments of Olympic idealism. Ever since, they have been inspirations to generations of athletes like myself, who can only aspire to their example of putting principle before personal interest. It was their misfortune to be far greater human beings than the leaders of the IOC of the day."&lt;ref&gt;Speech to the Ontario Equine Center at the University of Guelph, Akaash Maharaj, 27 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] in Washington, DC also features a statue to honor the athletes' tribute.

=== San Jose ===
In 2005, [[San Jose State University]] honored former students Smith and Carlos with a 22-foot high statue of their protest titled ''Victory Salute'', created by artist [[Rigo 23]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Owen|last=Slot|title=America finally honours rebels as clenched fist becomes salute|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article580095.ece|work=The Sunday Times |location=London |date=19 October 2005|accessdate=9 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A student, Erik Grotz, initiated the project; "One of my professors was talking about unsung heroes and he mentioned Tommie Smith and John Carlos. He said these men had done a courageous thing to advance civil rights, and, yet, they had never been honored by their own school." The statues are located in a central part of the campus at {{coord |37.335495 |-121.882556 |display=inline |name=Olympic Black Power Statue}}, next to Robert D. Clark Hall and Tower Hall.

Those who come to view the statue are allowed to participate by standing on the monument. Peter Norman is not included in the monument so viewers can be in his place; there is a plaque in the empty spot inviting those to "Take a Stand." Norman requested that his space was left empty so visitors could stand in his place and feel what he felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 2: John Carlos, 1968 U.S. Olympic Medalist, On the Response to His Iconic Black Power Salute|url=http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2011/10/12/part_2_john_carlos_1968_olympic_us_medalist_on_the_response_to_his_iconic_black_power_salute|publisher=Democracy Now!|accessdate=8 October 2015|date=12 October 2011|quote=I would like to have a blank spot there and have a commemorative plaque stating that I was in that spot.

The bronze figures are shoeless but there are two shoes included at the base of the monument. The right shoe, a bronze, blue Puma, is next to Carlos; while the left shoe is placed behind Smith. The signature of the artist is on the back of Smith's shoe, and the year 2005 is on Carlos's shoe.

The faces of the statues are realistic and emotional. "The statue is made of fiberglass stretched over steel supports with an exoskeleton of ceramic tiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/OLYMPIC-PROTEST-Smith-and-Carlos-Statue-2601229.php|title=SF GATE - Olympic Protest|last=Crumpacker|first=John|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rigo 23 used 3D scanning technology and computer-assisted virtual imaging to take full-body scans of the men. Their track pants and jackets are a mosaic of dark blue ceramic tiles while the stripes of the track suits are detailed in red and white.

In January 2007, [[History San Jose]] opened a new exhibit called ''Speed City: From Civil Rights to Black Power'', covering the San Jose State athletic program "from which many student athletes became globally recognized figures as the Civil Rights and Black Power movements reshaped American society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://historysanjose.org/exhibits_collections/current_upcoming_exhibits/speedcity.html| publisher=History San José| title=Speed City: From Civil Rights to Black Power| date=28 July 2005| accessdate=9 November 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206061853/http://www.historysanjose.org/exhibits_collections/current_upcoming_exhibits/speedcity.html| archivedate=December 6, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sydney mural ===
In Australia, an airbrush mural of the trio on podium was painted in 2000 in the inner-city suburb of [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] in Sydney. Silvio Offria, who allowed the mural to be painted on his house in Leamington Lane by an artist known only as "Donald," said that Norman, a short time before he died in 2006, came to see the mural. "He came and had his photo taken; he was very happy," he said.&lt;ref name=Newtown_10&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/last-stand-for-newtowns-three-proud-people-20100726-10smr.html "Last stand for Newtown's 'three proud people'"] by Josephine Tovey, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 27 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The monochrome tribute, captioned "&lt;small&gt;THREE PROUD PEOPLE MEXICO 68&lt;/small&gt;," was under threat of demolition in 2010 to make way for a rail tunnel&lt;ref name=Newtown_10/&gt; but is now listed as an item of heritage significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meetings.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/council/about-council/meetings/documents/meetings/2012/CSPC/120308/120308_CSPC_ITEM06_ATTACHMENTJ.PDF Heritage Assessment of the Three Proud People mural 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002041030/http://meetings.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/council/about-council/meetings/documents/meetings/2012/CSPC/120308/120308_CSPC_ITEM06_ATTACHMENTJ.PDF |date=October 2, 2013 }}.

=== West Oakland mural ===
In the historically [[African-American neighborhood]] of [[West Oakland, California]] there was a large mural depicting Smith and Carlos on the corner of 12th Street and Mandela Parkway.

Above the life-sized depictions read "Born with insight, raised with a fist" ([[Rage Against the Machine]] lyrics); previously it read "It only takes a pair of gloves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oaklandwiki.org/It_Only_Takes_a_Pair_of_Gloves_Mural It Only Takes a Pair of Gloves Mural]. oaklandwiki.org&lt;/ref&gt; In early February 2015, the mural was razed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bayareaintifada.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/west-oakland-mural-bulldozed/ West Oakland Mural Bulldozed | bayareaintifada]. Bayareaintifada.wordpress.com (3 February 2015). Retrieved on 2015-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The private lot was once a gas station, and the mural was on the outside wall of an abandoned building or shed. The owner wanted to pay respect to the men and the moment but also wanted a mural to prevent tagging. The State was monitoring water contamination levels at this site; the testing became within normal levels "so the state ordered the removal of the tanks, testing equipment, and demolition of the shed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bayareaintifada.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/west-oakland-mural-bulldozed/|title=West Oakland Mural Bulldozed|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
The song "Mr. John Carlos" by the Swedish group [[Nationalteatern]] on their 1974 album ''Livet är en fest'' is about the event and its aftermath.

[[Rage Against the Machine]] used a cropped photo of the salute on the cover art for the "[[Testify (Rage Against the Machine song)|Testify]]" single (2000).  The image has both men wearing shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://go.distance.ncsu.edu/gd203/?p=17750|title=Tropes in Media – The Clinched Fist  -  GD 203|website=go.distance.ncsu.edu}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover art for the single "[[HiiiPoWeR]]" (2011) by American rapper [[Kendrick Lamar]] features a cropped photo of the salute.

The song "Hoarse" (2013) by American rapper [[Earl Sweatshirt]] features the lines "pinnacle of titillating crispate, fists clenched, emulating '68 Olympics".

The music video for "[[The Story of O.J.]]" (2017) by American rapper [[Jay-Z]] features a depiction of the protest.

The song "Shivers" by [[Peter Perrett]], best known as the frontman of The Only Ones, features the lines "The torch of liberty, Tommie Smith's black glove".

The music video for "[[The Space Program]]" (2017) by American Hip-Hop group [[A Tribe Called Quest]] features Pharrell Williams imitating the salute.

'''Age-related mobility disability''' is a self-reported inability to walk due to impairments, limited mobility, [[dexterity]] or [[Endurance|stamina]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ward, Rachel E. et al. “Sensory and Motor Peripheral Nerve Function and Incident Mobility Disability.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 62.12 (2014): 2273–2279. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found mostly in older adults with decreased strength in lower extremities.&lt;ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"&gt;Guralnik, Jack M., et al. "Lower extremity function and subsequent disability consistency across studies, predictive models, and value of gait speed alone compared with the Short Physical Performance Battery." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 55.4 (2000): M221-M231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

According to the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]], the population of older adults is expected to increase in the United States by 2030 due to the aging population of the [[baby boomer]] generation; this will increase the population of mobility [[disabled]] individuals in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Feasley, Jill C., ed. Health outcomes for older people: Questions for the coming decade. National Academies, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the importance of being able to predict disability due to inability to walk at an early stage, which will eventually decrease health care costs. Aging cause a decrease in physical strength and in lower extremities which ultimately leads to decrease in functional mobility,&lt;ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"/&gt;  in turn leading to disability which is shown to be common in women due to differences in distribution of resources and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Zunzunegui, M. V., et al. "The mobility gap between older men and women: the embodiment of gender." Archives of gerontology and geriatrics 61.2 (2015): 140-148.&lt;/ref&gt; The early detection of mobility disabilities will help clinicians and patients in determining the early management of the conditions which could be associated with the future disability. Mobility disabilites are not restricted to older and [[hospitalized]] individuals; such disabilities have been reported in young and non-hospitalized individuals as well due to decreased functional mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Iezzoni, Lisa I et al. “Mobility Difficulties Are Not Only a Problem of Old Age.” Journal of General Internal Medicine 16.4 (2001): 235–243. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in the rate of disability causes loss of functional independence &lt;ref&gt;Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik.

"Mobility difficulties and physical activity as predictors of mortality and loss of independence in the community‐living older population." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 48.5 (2000): 493-498.&lt;/ref&gt; and increases the risk of future [[chronic diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuben, David B., et al.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 49.11 (2001): 1539-1543.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- As we have come across the importance of early detection of disability due to inability to walk, the question arises, in which conditions a person has decreased functional mobility or is disabled.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} --&gt;

==Definition==

There are many definitions that contribute in providing the meaning of mobility disability, it is stated as the “self-reports of a lot of difficulties or inability to walk a quarter section|quarter of a mile” &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; without sitting and within time limit of fifteen minutes &lt;ref&gt;Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik. "Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254., Vestergaard, Sonja et al. “Stopping to Rest during a 400-Meter Walk and Incident Mobility Disability in Older Persons with Functional Limitations.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 57.2 (2009): 260–265. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Marsh, Anthony P. et al. “Muscle Strength and BMI as Predictors of Major Mobility Disability in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Pilot (LIFE-P).” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 66A.12 (2011): 1376–1383. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to walk within this time frame results in the use of [[mobility aid]] devices such as [[mobility scooter]], [[wheelchair]], [[crutches]] or a [[walker (mobility)|walker]] which will eventually help in the community [[ambulation]]. Another term that is coined to define mobility disabilities based on performance is “performance based mobility disability”.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Noreen et al. “Performance-Based Measures of Physical Function as Mortality Predictors: Incremental Value beyond Self-Reports.” Demographic research 30.7 (2014): 227–252. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the inability to increase your walking speed more than 0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;Tinetti, Mary E., et al. "Shared risk factors for falls, incontinence, and functional dependence: unifying the approach to geriatric syndromes." Jama 273.17 (1995): 1348-1353., Rantanen, Taina, et al. "Coimpairments: strength and balance as predictors of severe walking disability." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 54.4 (1999): M172-M176., Melzer, David et al. “The Apolipoprotein E e4 Polymorphism Is Strongly Associated With Poor Mobility Performance Test Results But Not Self-Reported Limitation in Older People.” The Journals of Gerontology. Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 60.10 (2005): 1319–1323. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; If an individual is unable to walk at &gt;0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s, he or she is considered severely disabled and would require a [[mobility device]] to walk in community.

==Risk factors==

There are number of factors that could be associated with [[mobility disability]], but according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], “[[stroke]] is found to be the leading cause of [[mobility disability]], in turn reducing functional mobility in more than half of the [[stroke]] survivors above 65 years of age”.&lt;ref&gt;Mozaffarian, Dariush, et al. "Executive summary: Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2016 update: A report from the American Heart Association." Circulation 133.4 (2016): 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==

There are several measurement scales designed to detect mobility disabilities. The measures that can detect mobility disabilities are classified into two categories, [[self-reported]] measures and performance measures. There is a need to differentiate between these measures based on their ability to detect mobility disabilities, such as differences in their reliability and [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Self-reported measures are commonly used to detect mobility disabilities,&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Walter H., et al. "Self‐Reported Causes of Physical Disability in Older People: The Cardiovascular Health Study." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 42.10 (1994): 1035-1044., Odding, E et al. “Association of Locomotor Complaints and Disability in the Rotterdam Study.” Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 54.9 (1995): 721–725. Print., Leveille, Suzanne G, Linda Fried, and Jack M Guralnik. “Disabling Symptoms: What Do Older Women Report?” Journal of General Internal Medicine 17.10 (2002): 766–773. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Keenan, Anne‐maree, et al. "Impact of multiple joint problems on daily living tasks in people in the community over age fifty‐five." Arthritis Care &amp; Research 55.5 (2006): 757-764., Mottram, Sara, et al. "Patterns of pain and mobility limitation in older people: cross-sectional findings from a population survey of 18,497 adults aged 50 years and over." Quality of Life Research 17.4 (2008): 529-539.&lt;/ref&gt; but recently developed performance measures have been shown to be effective in predicting future mobility disabilities in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-reported measures===

Several [[qualitative research]] studies use [[survey (human research)]], [[questionnaires]] and [[self-reported]] scales to detect a decrease in functional mobility or to predict future [[mobility disability]] in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Pruitt, Leslie A. et al. “Use of Accelerometry to Measure Physical Activity in Older Adults at Risk for Mobility Disability.” Journal of aging and physical activity 16.4 (2008): 416–434. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages of these [[qualitative research]] scales are easier [[data acquisition]] and can be performed on the larger population. Although there is difference in [[perception]] of condition between subjects (gender difference), type of [[chronic conditions]] and age-related changes such as memory and reasoning, all of which can affect the information and scores of the individual, still [[self-reported]] measures have been used extensively in behavioral and [[correlation]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;Baranowski, Tom. "Validity and reliability of self-report measures of physical activity: an information-processing perspective." Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport 59.4 (1988): 314-327.&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly used [[self-reported]] measures to detect [[mobility disability]] are [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale], [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&amp;variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel index]], [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale]. 
Based on reliability and validity of these scales, [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale] has proven to have excellent [[test-retest reliability]] and [[construct validity]], however, if it can predict future mobility disability in older adults is yet to be found. In contrast, [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&amp;variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel Index]] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale] proved important to predict future [[mobility disability]] based on the activities involved in these [[questionnaire]] scales.

===Performance-based measures===

Mobility disabilities due to age-related [[musculoskeletal]] pain or increase in [[chronic condition|chronic]] conditions are easier to detect by performance measures.  Some commonly used performance measures to detect mobility disabilities are the 400-meter walking test, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.1790010108/pdf 5-minute walk test ], [[walking speed]],  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test]. 
Among these measures, [http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400-meter walk test] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] has been proven to be strong predictors of [[mobility disability]] in older adults. In addition to prediction, there is moderate to excellent [[correlation]] between these two tests.&lt;ref&gt;Vasunilashorn, Sarinnapha et al. “Use of the Short Physical Performance Battery Score to Predict Loss of Ability to Walk 400 Meters: Analysis From the InCHIANTI Study.” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 64A.2 (2009): 223–229. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Based on reliability and validity of measurement scales to predict [[mobility disability]], [[self-reported]] measures such as [[Barthel index]], and [[performance]] measures such as [http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400 m walk test] and  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] are strongly associated with prediction of mobility disability in older adults.

[[Image:Baseball pitch release.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A U.S. Naval Academy pitcher wearing stirrups]]

'''Stirrups''' were [[Baseball uniform|uniform]] socks commonly worn by [[baseball]] players up until the mid-1990s, when major-league players began wearing their pants down to the ankles, setting a trend soon picked up by players in minor and amateur leagues. Until then, stirrup socks had been an integral part of the traditional [[baseball uniform]], giving them a distinctive look. A high sock was needed because baseball players wore [[Knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]] ("knickers"), worn by many boys in the late 19th century and into the 20th century. The stirrup socks served to display team colors, stripes or team logos. For example, for several years the [[Minnesota Twins]] wore navy-blue stirrups with "TC" on the side, for "Twin Cities", and in 1987 an "m" was placed on side. The [[Houston Astros]] wore navy blue stirrup socks with an orange star on the side. The stirrup sock colors were also the basis of team names, including the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], [[Boston Red Sox]], and [[Chicago White Sox]].  For these reasons, traditionalists lament the recent "sockless" look in baseball uniforms.

Stirrup socks are worn on top of long socks called "sanitaries," usually white in color.&lt;ref name=BaseballAndSocks&gt;'''''At''''' [http://articles.philly.com/2011-08-29/sports/29941646_1_pants-socks-cuffs Baseball and socks appeal]. Vitez, Michael (August 29, 2011). Philly.com. ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. Retrieved 2011-09-02. "This led to the invention of the two-in-one, a white sock with a colored stripe down the side, an innovation that all but ensured the demise of the stirrup."&lt;/ref&gt; This is because early color dyes in the outer stirrup sock were thought to pose health issues,&lt;ref name=BaseballAndSocks/&gt; as well as the fact that the inner, less expensive white sock could be changed more frequently. The stirrup sock lacked a foot, instead having a loop ("stirrup") which fits within the arch of the foot. Over the years, the stirrup loop tended to get longer, exposing more of the white undersock, thus creating a look unique to baseball.

However, by the 1980s many players were pulling the loop so high that only the white undersock and the loop itself showed - the rest of the game sock being hidden by their pants. Eventually, this reached a point where some players only wore vertical lines for stirrups. For many years teams had enforced rules so that uniforms were worn "uniformly", including team socks. For example, [[Leo Durocher]], longtime manager of the [[Chicago Cubs]], had a measuring stick in the clubhouse. Players were required to match the length of their stirrup loops to this stick at about 4&amp;nbsp;inches, exposing only a small part of the white sanitary. Increasingly lax regulation of uniform codes by [[Major League Baseball]] eventually contributed to players ignoring the traditional look.

The [[Official Baseball Rules]] are silent on stirrups, but the fact that some players on a team wear them while others do not seems to be in violation of Rule 1.11(a)(1) which states that “all players on a team shall wear uniforms identical in color, trim and style,”  as well as Rule 1.11(a)(3) that states “no player whose uniform does not conform to that of his teammates shall be permitted to participate in a game.”&lt;ref&gt;Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony, McFarland Books, 2014. See [http://www.baseballexplained.com www.baseballexplained.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813034018/http://www.baseballexplained.com/ |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The freedom to wear high stirrups or not is remarkable considering how nowadays uniformity is otherwise enforced by MLB. For example, during a 2007 game against the [[Yankees]], with the Yankees threatening to score, [[Red Sox]] manager [[Terry Francona]] was suddenly called away from the game and questioned by a league executive as to whether he was wearing the required uniform jersey beneath his blue pullover. He wasn’t pleased.&lt;ref&gt;Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony, McFarland Books, 2014. See [http://www.baseballexplained.com www.baseballexplained.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813034018/http://www.baseballexplained.com/ |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although some teams — particularly college teams — continue to wear traditional baseball stirrup socks, another option has been to replace the stirrup/undersock with a "2 in 1" combination sock&lt;ref name=BaseballAndSocks/&gt; that mimics the real thing, or simply to wear a single solid knee-high sock with knickers. The trend back to knickers and high socks is particularly evident among youth and high-school teams. A few pro players, such as [[Taijuan Walker]] of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], [[Derek Holland]] of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Melvin Upton, Jr.]] of the [[San Diego Padres]], [[Bryce Harper]] &amp; [[Casey Janssen]] of the [[Washington Nationals]], [[Daniel Descalso]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[Josh Outman]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]] and [[Steve Cishek]] &amp; [[Juan Pierre]] of the [[Miami Marlins]], [[Chris Archer]] of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], [[J.R. Graham]] of the [[Minnesota Twins]], [[Chris Taylor (baseball) | Chris Taylor]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], and [[Francisco Lindor]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]] have been spotted wearing genuine stirrups recently to much fanfare. Several players on the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] will either wear stirrups over white sanitary socks, or over red socks, as the Phillies stirrups sport their Liberty Bell logo.  The minor-league [[Springfield Cardinals]] wear a 2-in-1 version of the traditional [[St. Louis Cardinals]]' game sock that looks very much like the real thing.

Other sports also use, or have used, stirrup socks, but traditionally wore a white sweat sock over, instead of under, the colored stirrup game sock (e.g. basketball, football, hockey). For many years [[Official (American football)|American football officials]] commonly wore black baseball-style stirrups as part of their uniform, although this was done away with in the 2010s as full-length pants replaced the traditional knickers.  There are still some sock companies manufacturing stirrup socks for baseball and other sports, including Twin City Knitting Company in [[Conover, North Carolina]].

[[File:Boomerang.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A typical wooden returning boomerang]]
A '''boomerang''' is a thrown tool, typically constructed as a flat [[airfoil]], that is designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight. A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower. It is well known as a weapon used by [[Indigenous Australians]] for hunting.

Boomerangs have been historically used for [[Hunting in Australia|hunting]], as well as sport, and entertainment. They are commonly thought of as an [[Australia]]n icon,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Boomerang: Behind an Australian Icon|last = Jones|first = Philip|publisher = Wakefield Press|year = 1996|isbn = 9781862543829|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and come in various shapes and sizes.

== Description ==
[[File:Boomerang (PSF).jpg|thumb|A boomerang returns to the point from where it was sent]]
A boomerang is traditionally a long wooden device, although historically boomerang-like devices have also been made from bones.  Modern boomerangs used for [[sport]] are often made from thin aircraft plywood, plastics such as [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[polypropylene]], [[phenolic paper]], or even high-tech materials such as [[Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre-reinforced plastics]]. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function. Many people think of a boomerang as the Australian type, although today there are many types of more easily usable boomerangs, such as the cross-stick, the pinwheel, the tumble-stick, the Boomabird and many other less common types.

An important distinction should be made between returning boomerangs and non-returning boomerangs. Returning boomerangs fly and are examples of the earliest heavier-than-air human-made flight. A returning boomerang has two or more [[airfoil]] wings arranged so that the spinning creates unbalanced [[aerodynamic]] forces that curve its path so that it travels in an [[Ellipse|elliptical]] path and returns to its point of origin when thrown correctly. While a [[throwing stick]] can also be shaped overall like a returning boomerang, it is designed to travel as straight as possible so that it can be aimed and thrown with great force to bring down the game. Its surfaces therefore are symmetrical and not uneven like the aerofoils which give the returning boomerang its characteristic curved flight.

The most recognisable type of the boomerang is the L-shaped returning boomerang; while non-returning boomerangs, throwing sticks (or shaunies) were used as weapons, returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation. Returning boomerangs were also used to decoy birds of prey, thrown above the long grass to frighten [[game (food)|game]] birds into flight and into waiting nets. Modern returning boomerangs can be of [[#Modern use|various shapes or sizes]].

Historical evidence also points to the use of non-returning boomerangs by the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of [[California]] and [[Arizona]], and inhabitants of southern [[India]] for killing birds and rabbits.&lt;ref name="Brittanica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = Boomerang |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/73646/boomerang |accessdate= 25 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some boomerangs were not thrown at all, but were used in [[hand to hand combat]] by [[Indigenous Australians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Tom |url= http://www.howstuffworks.com/boomerang.htm/printable |title= Battle Boomerangs |publisher= Howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian examples, however, have been recovered, and experiments have shown that they functioned as returning boomerangs.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, Pitt. "On the Egyptian Boomerang and its Affinities". ''The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. 1883. '''12''': 454–463.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boomerangs can be variously used as hunting weapons, [[Percussion instrument|percussive musical instruments]], battle [[Club (weapon)|clubs]], fire-starters, [[decoy]]s for hunting [[waterfowl]], and as recreational play toys. The smallest boomerang may be less than {{convert|10|cm|in|0}} from tip to tip, and the largest over {{cvt|180|cm|ft|1}} in length.&lt;ref name="Largest"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flight-toys.com/boomerang/boomnews/worldslargestboom.html |author=Ted Bailey |title= Worlds Largest Boomerang |publisher= www.flight-toys.com |accessdate= 17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tribe|Tribal]] boomerangs may be inscribed and/or painted with designs meaningful to their makers. Most boomerangs seen today are of the tourist or competition sort, and are almost invariably of the returning type.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the term is mostly certain, but many researchers have different theories on how the word entered into the English vocabulary. One source asserts that the term entered the language in 1827, adapted from an extinct Aboriginal language of [[New South Wales]], Australia, but mentions a variant, ''wo-mur-rang'', which it dates to 1798.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=boomerang&amp;searchmode=none Boomerang], [http://www.etymonline.com/ Online Etymology Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt; The boomerang was first encountered by western people at [[Farm Cove, New South Wales|Farm Cove]] ([[Port Jackson]]), Australia, in December 1804, when a weapon was witnessed during a tribal [[Skirmisher|skirmish]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626558 |title=SYDNEY |publisher= NLA Australian Newspapers |date= |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... the ''white'' spectators were justly astonished at the dexterity and incredible force with which a bent, edged waddy resembling slightly a Turkish [[scimitar|scimytar]], was thrown by ''Bungary'', a native distinguished by his remarkable courtesy.

Depictions of boomerangs being thrown at animals, such as kangaroos, appear in some of the oldest rock art in the world, the [[Indigenous Australian art|Indigenous Australian rock art]] of the Kimberly region, which is potentially up to 50,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-02/indigenous-rock-art-could-be-among-oldest-in-world/6906476 |title= Kimberley rock art could be among oldest in the world |website= ABC News AU |language=en-AU |accessdate= 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stencils and paintings of boomerangs also appear in the rock art of [[Western New Guinea|West Papua]], including on [[Bird's Head Peninsula]] and [[Kaimana]], likely dating to the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], when lower sea levels led to cultural continuity between Papua and [[Arnhem Land]] in Northern Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001355/135558e.pdf |title= Rock Art in West Papua |last=Arifin |first=Karina |publisher=UNESCO Publishing |year=2004 |isbn= |location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving [[Australian Aborigines|Australian Aboriginal]] boomerangs come from a cache found in a peat bog in the Wyrie Swamp of [[South Australia]] and date to [[8th millennium BC|10,000 BC]].

No one knows for sure how the returning boomerang was invented, but some modern boomerang makers speculate that it developed from the flattened throwing stick, still used by the [[Australian Aborigines]] and other indigenous peoples around the world, including the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] in North America. A hunting boomerang is delicately balanced and much harder to make than a returning one. The curving flight characteristic of returning boomerangs was probably first noticed by early hunters trying to "tune" their throwing sticks to fly straight.&lt;ref name="Boomer" /&gt;

Today, boomerangs are mostly used for recreation. There are different types of throwing contests: accuracy of return; Aussie round; trick catch; [[maximum time aloft]]; fast catch; and endurance (see below). The modern sport boomerang (often referred to as a 'boom' or 'rang') is made of Finnish birch [[plywood]], [[hardwood]], plastic or [[composite material]]s and comes in many different shapes and colours. Most sport boomerangs typically weigh less than {{convert|100|g|oz}}, with MTA boomerangs (boomerangs used for the maximum-time-aloft event) often under {{convert|25|g|oz|1}}.

Boomerangs have also been suggested as an alternative to [[clay pigeons]] in shotgun sports, where the flight of the boomerang better mimics the flight of a bird offering a more challenging target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwv2BhJEjDo |title= Aussie Boomerang Shootin' |date= 15 October 2012 |work= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern boomerang is often [[computer-aided design]]ed with precision airfoils. The number of "wings" is often more than 2 as more lift is provided by 3 or 4 wings than by 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boomerangs.com/aerodynamics.html Boomerang Aerodynamics], [http://www.boomerangs.com/ boomerangs.com].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saulius Pakalnis, [http://www.researchsupporttechnologies.com/boomerang_site/boomerang1.htm Aerodynamics of Boomerang], 21 April 2006, [http://www.researchsupporttechnologies.com/ researchsupporttechnologies.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, German astronaut [[Ulf Merbold]] performed an experiment aboard [[Spacelab]] that established that boomerangs function in [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]] as they do on Earth. French Astronaut [[Jean-François Clervoy]] aboard Mir repeated this in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flight-toys.com/boomerang/boomnews/spacebooms.html |title=Boomerangs in Space |publisher= Flight-toys.com |date= 18 March 2008 |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Japanese astronaut [[Takao Doi]] again repeated the experiment on board the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23411383-952,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324172123/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0%2C23739%2C23411383-952%2C00.html |archivedate= 24 March 2008 |title= Boomerang works in space, says astronaut |publisher= News.com.au |date= 21 March 2008 |accessdate=3 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.universetoday.com/2008/03/24/does-a-boomerang-work-in-space/ |title= Does a Boomerang Work in Space? |publisher= Universetoday.com |date= 2008-03-24 |accessdate= 3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hunting ==
It is thought by some that the shape and elliptical flight path of the returning boomerang makes it useful for hunting birds and small animals, or that noise generated by the movement of the boomerang through the air, or, by a skilled thrower, lightly clipping leaves of a tree whose branches house birds, would help scare the birds towards the thrower. It is further supposed by some that this was used to frighten flocks or groups of birds into nets that were usually strung up between trees or thrown by hidden hunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lloyd |first1= John |last2= Mitchinson |first2= John |title= The Book of General Ignorance |year=2006 |publisher= Mackays of Chatham |isbn= 978-0-571-23368-7 |page= 244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In southeastern [[Australia]], it is claimed that boomerangs were made to hover over a flock of ducks; mistaking it for a hawk, the ducks would dive away, toward hunters armed with nets or clubs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite these notions and similar claims by a few European writers, there is no independently contemporaneous record of any aboriginal peoples using a returning boomerang as a weapon.{{cn|date=October 2018}}}

Traditionally, most boomerangs used by aboriginal groups in Australia were 'non-returning'. These weapons, sometimes called "throwsticks" or "kylies", were used for hunting a variety of prey, from [[kangaroo]]s to parrots; at a range of about {{convert|100|m}}, a 2-kg (4.4 lb) non-returning boomerang could inflict mortal injury to a large animal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A throwstick thrown nearly horizontally may fly in a nearly straight path and could fell a kangaroo on impact to the legs or knees, while the long-necked emu could be killed by a blow to the neck.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  Hooked non-returning boomerangs, known as "beaked kylies", used in northern Central Australia, have been claimed to kill multiple birds when thrown into a dense flock. It should be noted that throwsticks are used as multi-purpose tools by today's aboriginal peoples, and besides throwing could be wielded as clubs, used for digging, used to start friction fires, and are sonorous when two are struck together.

== Design ==
[[File:Boomerangs - melbourne show 2005.jpg |thumb|left|Boomerangs for sale at the 2005 Melbourne Show]]

A returning boomerang is a rotating wing. Although it is not a requirement that the boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang starts spinning, and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, a boomerang flies in a curve rather than a straight line. When thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point.

Returning boomerangs consist of two or more arms, or wings, connected at an angle. Each wing is shaped as an [[airfoil]].

As the wing rotates and the boomerang moves through the air, this creates airflow over the wings and this creates lift on both "wings". However, during one-half of each blade's rotation, it sees a higher airspeed, because the rotation tip-speed and the forward speed add, and when it is in the other half of the rotation, the tip speed subtracts from the forward speed. Thus if thrown nearly upright each blade generates more lift at the top than the bottom.&lt;ref name=hyper&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/brng.html |title= Boomerang |work=gsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it might be expected that this would cause the boomerang to tilt around the axis of travel, because the boomerang has significant angular momentum, gyroscopic effect causes the plane of rotation to tilt about an axis that is 90 degrees to the direction of flight, and this is what curves the flight in such a way that it will tend to return.&lt;ref name=hyper/&gt;

Thus [[gyroscopic precession]] is what makes the boomerang return to the thrower when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang fly straight up into the air when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long-distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a [[Flying disc|Frisbee]], but rather thrown with the long axis of the wings rotating in an almost-vertical plane.

Fast Catch boomerangs usually have three or more symmetrical wings (seen from above), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped similar to a question mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.baggressive.com/copper/thumbnails.php?album=6 |title= 'baggressive.com' |publisher= Baggressive.com |date= 19 April 2005 |accessdate= 3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs mostly have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings help to set up an 'auto-rotation' effect to maximise the boomerang's hover-time in descending from the highest point in its flight.

Some boomerangs have [[turbulator]]s—bumps or pits on the top surface that act to increase the lift as boundary layer transition activators (to keep attached turbulent flow instead of laminar separation).

=== Modern construction ===
&lt;!-- Much of this section is written as if it is a how-to article, and may also be a possible cut-and-paste move that was slightly edited. This section should be edited to conform to a proper encyclopedic style. --&gt;
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}

The pattern is placed on the plywood so that the wood grain runs across from the tip of one end of the boomerang to the tip of the other end. Try to get the grain of the outer ply running at 45 degrees to the length of the arms.  If there is any warp in the wood, make sure that this produces dihedral on the upper side of the boomerang, i.e., if the airfoil is uppermost and the boomerang is on a flat surface, then the wingtips are raised slightly above the surface.  (Any anhedral and the boomerang won't fly.) The pattern is traced on to the boomerang with a pencil. The boomerang shape is cut out of the plywood. This basic cut out is called the blank. An outline is drawn on the top of the blank to show the areas to be shaped for the leading and trailing edges of the wings. The profiles of the wings are shaped. The top of the leading edge of each wing is decreased at a 45° angle, while the rear of the wing is angled down to leave 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm thick trailing edge. The bottom face of the leading edge is trimmed back slightly. The tips of the wings are shaped down to the same thickness as the trailing edge. The various layers of the plywood serve as an outline that helps the worker achieve equal slopes. A shallow section may also be cut out from the bottom surface of each wing. For example, this might consist of a 5-cm long strip near the wing tip and behind the leading edge. Using progressively finer sandpaper, the surface of the boomerang is smoothed carefully.  Check the boomerang for a slight amount of dihedral (2–3&amp;nbsp;mm) on both wings at this point.  If there isn't any, introduce some by heating the boomerang either over a heat source or a brief spell in the microwave oven (about 30 seconds on high) – if the boomerang is just about uncomfortably hot to handle, you've got it just about right.  Bend up the tips of the wings and place the boomerang on a flat surface with a coin under each tip and a weight (bag of sugar?) on the elbow of the boomerang.  Allow it to cool for twenty minutes or more.  After spraying the surface with sanding sealer, the surface is smoothed with fine steel wool. The boomerang is then painted again.

=== Tuning the flight ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
The boomerang is then thrown several times to check if it works. The extreme subtleties of the [[aerodynamic]] forces on the light wooden boomerang make it surprisingly difficult to predict how the finished boomerang will perform. Two apparently identical boomerangs may radically differ in their flight patterns. For example, they may climb uncontrollably, they may fall repeatedly into the ground, they may exhibit long narrow pattern non-returning flight, or display other erratic behaviour. The only sure way to know is to flight-test them. There are several methods to correct problems, for example the wing profiles might be adjusted by additional sanding. Plywood boomerangs may be heated for a short time in a [[microwave oven]] which softens the glue between the layers and then can be carefully intentionally warped. [[Angle of attack]] of the leading arm and the dingle arm can be adjusted, as can the overall [[dihedral angle]] of the wings all with some effect. There are many other esoteric tuning techniques as well. Tuning boomerangs is more of a slowly learned art than a science. The quality of the boomerang is also checked throughout this process. A tuned boomerang should be stored carefully on a flat surface away from too much humidity, direct sunlight, or heat. These conditions can subtly affect the shape of the boomerang and ruin its flight characteristics, and the boomerang will then need to be re-tuned.

The hunting boomerang is more delicately balanced and is therefore much harder to make than a returning one. When thrown, this type of boomerang needs to develop no unbalanced aerodynamic forces that would affect its flight path, so that it will fly true to the target.

=== Art renaissance ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Beginning in the later part of the twentieth century, there has been a bloom in the independent creation of unusually designed art boomerangs. These often have little or no resemblance to the traditional historical ones and on first sight some of these objects often do not look like boomerangs at all. The use of modern thin plywoods and synthetic plastics have greatly contributed to their success. As long as there are somewhere in the object several airfoil contoured surfaces, whether wing shaped or not, these boomerangs can be thrown and will return. Designs are amazingly diverse and can range from animal inspired forms, humorous themes, complex calligraphic and symbolic shapes, to the purely abstract. Painted surfaces are similarly richly diverse.

== Throwing technique ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
A right-handed boomerang is thrown with a counter-clockwise spin causing a counter-clockwise flight (as seen from above). Conversely, a left-handed boomerang is constructed as a mirror image with the aerofoils' leading edges on the left side of the wings, as seen from above, causing it to produce lift when circling clockwise. Although appearing symmetrical from a plan view, the leading edges are on opposite edges of the wings (leading and trailing) so as to present the leading edges of the aerofoil to the wind when spinning.
[[File:Boomerang School.JPG|thumb|right|A boomerang school, William Street, Kings Cross, Sydney]]

Most sport boomerangs are in the range of about {{convert|70|to|110|g|oz}}. The range on most is between {{cvt|20|and|40|m|yd|0}}. Boomerangs are generally thrown in treeless, large open spaces that are twice as large as the range of the boomerang. A right- or left-handed boomerang can be thrown with either hand, but the flight direction will depend upon the boomerang, not the thrower. Throwing a boomerang with the wrong hand requires a throwing motion that many throwers may find awkward.

The correct launch orientation makes the boomerang's flight begin by flying into the wind, then having its flight take it through the "eye of the wind" and finally returning downwind using the wind's speed to help complete its flight back to the thrower. It is the spin that makes the boomerang return and the strength of throw and spin must be varied according to the speed of the wind – the stronger the wind, the less power is required to provide lift enough to make the return journey. In other words, the stronger the wind, the softer the boomerang is thrown. A light wind of three to five miles per hour is considered ideal. If the wind is strong enough to fly a kite, then it is usually too strong for boomerangs.

A properly thrown boomerang should curve around to the left, climb gently, level out in mid-flight, arc around and descend slowly, and then finish by popping up slightly, hovering, then stalling near the thrower. Ideally, this momentary hovering or stalling will allow the catcher the opportunity to clamp their hands shut horizontally on the boomerang from above and below, sandwiching the centre between their hands.

== Competitions and records ==

In international competition, a ''world cup'' is held every second year. {{as of|2017}}, teams from Germany and the United States dominated international competition. The individual World Champion title was won in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2012 and 2016 by Swiss thrower [[Manuel Schütz]]. In 1992, 1998, 2006 and 2008 [[Fridolin Frost]] from Germany won the title.

The team competitions of 2012 and 2014 were won by Boomergang (an international team). World champions were Germany in 2012 and Japan in 2014 for the first time. Boomergang was formed by individuals from several countries, including the Colombian [[Alejandro Palacio]]. In 2016 USA became team world champion.

=== Competition disciplines ===

Modern boomerang tournaments usually involve some or all of the events listed below&lt;ref name="German Wikipedia"&gt;Based on original text from German wiki.[[:de:Bumerang]]{{Better source|date=November 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all disciplines the boomerang must travel at least {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} from the thrower. Throwing takes place individually. The thrower stands at the centre of concentric rings marked on an open field.

Events include:

* ''Aussie Round'': considered by many to be the ultimate test of boomeranging skills. The boomerang should ideally cross the {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on}} circle and come right back to the centre. Each thrower has five attempts. Points are awarded for distance, accuracy and the catch.
* ''Accuracy'': points are awarded according to how close the boomerang lands to the centre of the rings. The thrower must not touch the boomerang after it has been thrown. Each thrower has five attempts. In major competitions there are two accuracy disciplines: Accuracy 100 and Accuracy 50.
* ''Endurance'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved in 5 minutes.
* ''Fast Catch'': the time taken to throw and catch the boomerang five times. The winner has the fastest timed catches.
* ''Trick Catch/Doubling'': points are awarded for trick catches behind the back, between the feet, and so on. In Doubling the thrower has to throw two boomerangs at the same time and catch them in sequence in a special way.
* ''Consecutive Catch'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved before the boomerang is dropped. The event is not timed.
* ''MTA 100'' (''Maximal Time Aloft'', {{convert|100|m|ft|0}}): points are awarded for the length of time spent by the boomerang in the air. The field is normally a circle measuring 100&amp;nbsp;m. An alternative to this discipline, without the 100&amp;nbsp;m restriction is called ''MTA unlimited''.
* ''Long Distance'': the boomerang is thrown from the middle point of a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}} baseline. The furthest distance travelled by the boomerang away from the baseline is measured. On returning, the boomerang must cross the baseline again but does not have to be caught. A special section is dedicated to LD below.
* ''Juggling'': as with Consecutive Catch, only with two boomerangs. At any given time one boomerang must be in the air.

=== Guinness World Record - Smallest Returning Boomerang ===

''Non-discipline record'': Smallest Returning Boomerang: Sadir Kattan of Australia in 1997 with {{convert|1.9|in|mm}} long and {{convert|1.8|in|mm}} wide. This tiny boomerang flew the required {{convert|22|yd|m}}, before returning to the accuracy circles on 22 March 1997 at the Australian National Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boomerang.org.au/wp/photos/boomerangs/boomerangs-sadir-kattan-and-worlds-smallest-boomerang/ |title=World's smallest boomerang |publisher=www.boomerang.org.au |date=12 April 2008 |accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guinness World Record - Longest Throw of Any Object by a Human ===

A boomerang was used to set a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] with a throw of 1,401.5 feet (427.2 metres) by David Schummy on [[Portal:Current events/2005 March 15|15 March 2005]] at [[Murrarie Recreation Ground]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|LQ5dW5pHPYk|Longest Boomerang Throw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broke the record set by Erin Hemmings who threw an [[Aerobie]] 1,333 feet (406.3 metres) on 14 July 2003 at [[Fort Funston]], San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First quarter Mile Throw in History at Fort Funston |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2003_July_16/ai_105504992/ |agency=[[Business Wire]] |date=16 July 2003 |accessdate=28 May 2009 |work=Business Wire }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Long-distance versions ==
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
{{original research|section|date=October 2009}}
}}
Long-distance boomerang throwers aim to have the boomerang go the furthest possible distance while returning close to the throwing point. In competition the boomerang must intersect an imaginary surface defined as an [[infinity|infinite]] [[Vertical angles|vertical]] [[extrusion|extrude]] of a {{convert|40|m|yd|adj=on}} large line centred on the thrower. Outside of competitions, the definition is not so strict, and the thrower is happy whenever he/she does not have to travel {{convert|50|m|yd}} after the throw, to recover the boomerang.

=== General properties ===
Long-distance boomerangs are optimised to have minimal drag while still having enough lift to fly and return. For this reason, they have a very narrow throwing window, which discourages many beginners from continuing with this discipline. For the same reason, the quality of manufactured long-distance boomerangs is often non-deterministic.

Today's long-distance boomerangs have almost all an ''S'' or ''? – question mark'' shape and have a [[bevel]]ed edge on both sides (the bevel on the bottom side is sometimes called an undercut). This is to minimise drag and lower the lift. Lift must be low because the boomerang is thrown with an almost total layover (flat). Long-distance boomerangs are most frequently made of composite material, mainly fibre glass [[epoxy]] composites.

=== Flight path ===
The projection of the flight path of long-distance boomerang on the ground resembles a [[Drop (liquid)|water drop]]. For older types of long-distance boomerangs (all types of so-called big hooks), the first and last third of the flight path are very low, while the middle third is a fast climb followed by a fast descent. Nowadays, boomerangs are made in a way that their whole flight path is almost planar with a constant climb during the first half of the trajectory and then a rather constant descent during the second half.

From theoretical point of view, distance boomerangs are interesting also for the following reason: for achieving a different behaviour during different flight phases, the ratio of the rotation frequency to the forward velocity has a U-shaped function, i.e., its [[derivative]] crosses 0. Practically, it means that the boomerang being at the furthest point has a very low forward velocity. The [[kinetic energy]] of the forward component is then stored in the [[potential energy]]. This is not true for other types of boomerangs, where the loss of kinetic energy is non-reversible (the MTAs also store kinetic energy in potential energy during the first half of the flight, but then the potential energy is lost directly by the drag).

== Related terms ==
In [[Noongar language]], ''kylie'' is a flat curved piece of wood similar in appearance to a boomerang that is thrown when hunting for birds and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Language {{!}} Kaartdijin Noongar |url= https://www.noongarculture.org.au/language/ |website= www.noongarculture.org.au |publisher= SWLASC |accessdate= 6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Kylie" is one of the Aboriginal words for the hunting stick used in warfare and for hunting animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bumerang-sport.de/story/history.htm|title=Whence comes, and what is a boomerang|website=www.bumerang-sport.de|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of following curved flight paths, kylies fly in straight lines from the throwers. They are typically much larger than boomerangs, and can travel very long distances; due to their size and hook shapes, they can cripple or kill an animal or human opponent. The word is perhaps an English corruption of a word meaning "boomerang" taken from one of the Western Desert languages, for example, the [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] word "karli".

{{Commonwealth Games sidebar}}
The '''Commonwealth Games Federation''' ('''CGF''') is the international organisation responsible for the direction and control of the [[Commonwealth Games]] and [[Commonwealth Youth Games]], and is the foremost authority in matters relating to the games. The headquarters of CGF are located in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecgf.com/about/role.asp|title=Commonwealth Games Federation – The Role of The CGF|website=''thecgf.com''|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Due to the success of the first [[1930 British Empire Games]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Canada, a meeting of representatives from Great Britain, its [[British dominion|dominions]], [[Crown colony|colonies and territories]] decided that the games, similar to the [[Olympic Games]] should be held every four years, and that an authoritative organisation should be formed. Following the [[1932 Summer Olympics]], it was decided to form the ''"British Empire Games Federation"'' who would be responsible for the organising of the games. The name of the federation was changed in 1952 to the ''"British Empire and Commonwealth Games Federation"'', and again in [[Jamaica]] in 1966 to the ''"British Commonwealth Games Federation"'', until eventually being changed again in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]] in 1974 to the ''"Commonwealth Games Federation"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecgf.com/games/story.asp|title=Commonwealth Games Federation – The Story of The Commonwealth Games|website=''thecgf.com''|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The federation is governed by the General Assembly and Executive Board:

===General Assembly===
The General Assembly is the ultimate governance and authority in the CGF with powers to vote on decisions, including on which cities and Commonwealth Games Association's will host the [[Commonwealth Games]]. It consists of 3 or more representatives of a 'Commonwealth Games Association' (CGA) of each member countries and territories, the Vice-Patron, Life Vice-Presidents and the members of the Executive Board.

Sessions of the General Assembly are chaired by the CGF President, with each CGA and the President having one vote. However the Vice-Patron, Life Vice-Presidents, the Executive Board, representatives of an Organising Committee (OC) of a Commonwealth Games and observers invited by the President may deliberate but do not have voting powers at the General Assembly.

===Executive Board===
The Executive Board are representative of the Commonwealth Games Associations (CGA) which form the General Assembly, and have authority to act on behalf of the federation concerning the games. The board consists of the ''[[ex officio]]'' Vice-Patron (currently, [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|HRH The Earl of Wessex]]), the President, six officers of CGF and six Vice-Presidents representing, and being responsible for the CGA's in the 6 regions of the CGF (Africa, Americas, Asia, [[Caribbean]], Europe and Oceania).

Members of the Executive Board are either elected or appointed, generally holding office from their date of appointment to the conclusion of the General Assembly held in the year following the next [[Commonwealth Games]], some being re-elected or re-appointed. The Vice-Patron is elected at the General Assembly and usually remains in office for life.&lt;ref name=People/&gt;

==Honours==
[[Image:Commonwealth Games Federation Logo.svg|thumb|Flag of the Commonwealth Games Federation and the games movement]]
As well as awarding medals to athletes, the federation may award membership of the [[Order of Merit]] for distinguished services rendered to the Commonwealth Games movement, including the games themselves, to the federation and to a Commonwealth Games Association. The honour is awarded on the recommendation of the Executive Board at the General Assembly.

On recommendation of the Executive Board, at General Assembly the federation may also elect Life Vice-Presidents, providing there are no more than six Life Vice-Presidents at a time as an award for services to the CGF. Former Chairmen and presidents automatically become a Life Vice-President.

==Bidding Procedures and Hosting==
''see: [[Bids for the 2014 Commonwealth Games]], [[Bids for the 2018 Commonwealth Games]]''

The General Assembly of the CGF are responsible for deciding who will host the [[Commonwealth Games]], 8 years prior to the games in question once all bids have been submitted. The selection process is made in accordance with the Candidate City Manual, as drafted by the Executive Board and made available to candidates 18 months before a decision is made. The federation then entrusts the organisation of the games to the organising committee, CGA, and government of the winning host nation or territory, including the security and finance, but is still monitored by the federation.

==Leadership==
The '''President of the Commonwealth Games Federation''' is responsible for chairing the Executive Board and the General Assembly. A candidate is elected to the position by the General Assembly the year following the [[Commonwealth Games]]. Other duties include inviting the [[Head of the Commonwealth]] for the opening and closing declaration of the games and overseeing the preparations for upcoming events.

Previously before the [[1998 Commonwealth Games|XVI Commonwealth Games]] in 1998, the President was a ceremonial role, taking on the duties of the now Vice-Patron. The chairman was elected by the General Assembly as head of the Commonwealth Games Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecgf.com/games/cgf_heads.asp|title=Commonwealth Games Federation – Heads|website=''thecgf.com''|dead-url=|access-date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cue sports techniques''' (usually more specific, e.g., '''billiards techniques''', '''snooker techniques''') are a vital important aspect of game play in the various [[cue sports]] such as [[carom billiards]], [[pocket billiards|pool]], [[snooker]] and other games. Such techniques are used on each shot in an attempt to achieve an immediate aim such as scoring or playing a safety, while at the same time exercising control over the positioning of the {{Cuegloss|Cue ball|cue ball}} and often the {{cuegloss|object ball}}s for the next shot or {{cuegloss|inning}}.

In carom games, an advanced player's aim on most shots is to leave the cue ball and the object balls in position so that the next shot is of a less difficult variety to make the requisite {{Cuegloss|Carom|carom}}, and so that the next shot is in position to be manipulated in turn for yet another shot; ''ad infinitum''.

Similarly, in many pocket billiards games, an advanced player's aim is to manipulate the cue ball so that it is in position to {{cuegloss|pocket}} ({{cuegloss|pot}}) a chosen next object ball and so that that next shot can also be manipulated for the ''next'' shot, and so on.  Whereas in the carom games, manipulation of the object ball's position is crucial as well on every shot, in some pool games this is not as large a factor because on a successful shot the object ball is pocketed. However, many shots in [[one-pocket]], for example, have this same added object ball control factor for most shots.

If a player is not attempting to score or pocket, depending on the game, then the goal is usually to exercise control over the cue ball to leave some type of {{cuegloss|safety}} to make it more difficult for the opponent to score or pocket.

In order to control the cue ball on a shot, a player must master a wide variety of techniques, and have a well-founded conceptual grasp of the mechanics involved. As stated by [[George Fels]], "pool's poet laureate":&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mere pocketing of a ball isn't that hard; in fact, it's relatively simple. What drives many, many players to distraction is the unpredictability of the cueball's path of travel&amp;nbsp;... the game of billiards requires you to drive a ball someplace; pool, in any form, mostly asks you to stop a ball someplace. In either case, you'll fare much better when you understand the how and why of a ball's getting from one place to another.&lt;ref name="Atlas"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Stance==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Snooker stance.jpg|thumb|left|The traditional snooker stance, with the rear foot at a right-angle to the line of the shot]] --&gt;
There is no single universally accepted stance, with a wide variation between players who compete at professional cuesports. However, there are a number of common characteristics: generally the back leg is braced while the front leg is slightly bent with the player leaning into the shot; the player's weight is evenly distributed, and the body remains still for the duration of the shot. Many of the modern players face the line of the shot, while a more traditional stance would see the player twist their body so their back foot is at a right-angle to the shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Callan |first=Frank |title=The Stance |work=fcsnooker |publisher=The Frank Callan Suite |location=Preston, Lancashire |url=http://www.fcsnooker.co.uk/basics/the_stance/stance.htm |accessdate=16 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617153709/http://www.fcsnooker.co.uk/basics/the_stance/stance.htm |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sidespin ({{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}})==
The term {{cuegloss|english|{{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}}}} (called "side" in the UK, and sometimes simply called "left" or "right", and sometimes "reverse english" for side that closes the cue ball angle after contacting a rail, and "natural running english" for side that widens the cue ball angle after contacting a rail) normally refers to sidespin put on a cue ball by hitting it to the left or right of center. English is used for position by altering the {{cuegloss|angle of reflection}} of the cue ball after it contacts a rail. Both left and  right {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}} change the direction an object ball takes upon impact with the cue ball (the "{{cuegloss|throw}}" effect). Unfortunately, the use of {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}} can cause the cue ball to veer off its aiming line (an effect called [[#Deflection (squirt)|deflection or "squirt"]]).

An above-center hit on the cue ball is more precisely referred to as "{{cuegloss|follow}}" ("top" in the UK), while a below-center hit is  "draw" or "back spin".  Any time the cue ball is not struck directly in the center, some sidespin will be imparted either left or right on the cue ball. This unintentional sidespin is a common source of missed shots. Cue ball spin is not always the shooter's doing; some spin is naturally imparted to the cue ball from contact with the cloth surface on the bed of the table, and by the table's cushions.

==Follow==
Follow, sometimes called top spin or simply "top," is spin in the direction of travel of the cue ball, so that it is spinning faster than it would from its natural roll. If the cue ball has top spin on it, it will resume rolling forward after making contact dead-on with the object ball and "follow" the object ball rather than stopping abruptly.

Top spin is imparted to a ball by hitting it above the midpoint of its vertical plane as it faces the shooter. Top spin is spin in the direction a ball naturally "wants" to take in reaction to friction from contact with the pool cloth. Because of this, a ball sliding on the cloth will rapidly pick up follow. Likewise, a ball struck so that it is spinning backwards (with ''draw'' &amp;mdash; see below) immediately starts losing that spin, and if it travels far enough, will reach a sliding point (no spin), soon graduating to natural follow.

Follow applied to a non-dead-on shot will cause the angle of departure of the cue ball from the object ball to widen shortly after impact; the thicker the hit on the object ball, the more this effect will be noticeable (on very thin cut shots it practically does not exist).  Similarly, top spin will cause a widening of the cue ball's rebound angle after impact with a rail cushion.

Follow also increases the rate of cue ball travel, both before and after object-ball impact, and actually imparts a small amount of draw to the object ball.

===Force-follow===
Force-Follow is an extreme variation of follow.  On a straight-on shot, the cue ball will hesitate for a split-second, then charge forward through anything in its path.  It may also refuse a normal rebound from the rail by striking the same rail a second time.  This shot is useful both in trick-shots, and positional play.

==Draw==
Draw, sometimes called back-spin or "bottom," is backward spin applied to the cue ball by hitting it below the midpoint of its vertical plane as it faces the shooter. If the cue ball is hit with draw, and if that spin remains on the cue ball at the moment of impact with an object ball, the cue ball will reverse direction on a dead-on or center-to-center hit, and "draw" backwards. Draw is referred to in the United Kingdom as "screw" or "back-spin".

Draw applied to a non-dead-on shot will cause the angle of departure of the cue ball from the object ball to narrow shortly after impact. Similarly, it will cause a narrowing of the cue ball's rebound angle after impact with a rail cushion.

Draw can also be used to slow the rate of cue ball travel as a result of increased friction between the cloth and the cue ball.  This is often called "drag draw".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billiards.about.com/od/controlthecueball/ss/01_03_04drag_2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090517230806/http://billiards.about.com/od/controlthecueball/ss/01_03_04drag_2.htm |archivedate=2009-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=March 2012|reason=About.com is a user-edited site and cannot be cited as a reliable source. This should be properly sourced and added to [[Glossary of cue sports]].}}

A cue ball with back spin can impart a small amount of follow to the object ball.  This is often useful in close combination shots to make the first ball struck follow instead of stun after second ball contact.

==Slide==
"{{cuegloss|Slide}}" refers to a cue ball that is sliding across the cloth with no follow or draw spin. To illustrate this principle, if a ball was marked with a single red dot on it which faced the ceiling at the time the cue ball was struck, an observer would see the cue ball traveling with that red dot remaining fixed at the top of the ball, because the bottom of the ball is sliding over the cloth.

In order to initially achieve a sliding cue ball, a middle-ball hit is employed. The more speed with which the cue ball is hit in this manner, the longer the cue ball will slide before picking up natural forward roll from cloth friction. However, because of this tendency of the cue ball to acquire follow from friction, in order to deliver a sliding cue ball to an object ball at a distance, the cue ball must be precisely hit with the necessary degree of draw so that by the time it reaches the object ball, the draw has dissipated and the cue ball is sliding at the moment of impact.

===Stop and stun shots===
&lt;!-- linked from STUN --&gt;
When a sliding cue ball contacts an object ball dead-on (a center-to-center hit), the cue ball and object ball are of the same mass, and neither follow nor draw is on the cue ball at the moment of impact, the cue ball will transfer all of its momentum to the object ball and come to a complete stop; this is a {{Cuegloss|Stop shot|stop shot}}. If the sliding cue ball in the preceding scenario has sidespin on it when it contacts an object ball dead on, it will come to a complete stop but spin in place at that position until the sidespin dissipates.  If the cue ball and object ball contact is not dead-on but still very full, the result will often be a {{Cuegloss|Stun shot|"stun" shot}}, where the cue ball departs the object ball in the expected direction but travels only a short distance.  The stun effect can often be enhanced with a minimal amount of draw, to reduce cue ball speed before impact with the object ball.

If a cue ball is sliding at the time it contacts an object ball at an angle (i.e. on a {{cuegloss|cut|cut shot}} &amp;mdash; ''not'' a center-to-center impact), the cue ball will travel in a line tangential to the point of impact between both balls &amp;mdash; the {{cuegloss|tangent line}}. Because Billiard balls are somewhat [[Elastic collision|elastic]], the resulting tangent line is slightly less than 90 degrees from perpendicular to a line formed by the contact point between the balls.

If the cue ball hits an object ball at an angle and has follow on it, the cue ball will first travel on the tangent line and then [[Parabolic arc|parabolically arc]] forward from the tangent line in the direction of cue ball travel. By the same token, when such impact is made and the cue ball has draw on it, the cue ball will first travel on the tangent line and then parabolically arc backward from the tangent line in the opposite direction of cue ball travel. Whether follow or draw is on the cue ball, the faster the cue ball is traveling at the moment of impact, the farther it will travel on the tangent line before arcing forward or backward.

==Throw==
"{{cuegloss|Throw}}" refers to an object ball's motion away from the impact line due to relative sideways sliding motion between the cue ball and object ball caused by sidespin or a cut angle.

When a ball with {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}} (sidespin) on it hits an object ball with a degree of fullness, the object ball will be "thrown" in the opposite direction of the side of the cue ball the {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}} was applied. Thus, a cue ball with left hand {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}} on it will "throw" a hit object ball to the right. 
[[Image:Gears animation.gif|frame|right|Intermeshing gears in motion]]
This effect is sometimes overarchingly referred to as "the gear system;" so-called because the interaction of the cogwork gears of a clock &amp;mdash; each circular gear is interlocked with an abutting circular gear and each spins in the opposite direction of its neighbor in a series. {{sic|hide=y|Eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}} on the cue ball can cause a very similar effect. If the cue ball with left hand {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}} in the preceding scenario contacts an object ball relatively full and that object ball is frozen to another, the first object ball is thrown to the right and the second to the left, exactly as the name implies.

Throw is also imparted to a ball by collision from a cue ball with no {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}} on it through friction. This is sometimes called "{{Cuegloss|Collision-induced throw|collision-induced throw}}". The direction of the object ball's throw  depends  on  the cue ball's path immediately before impact.  Collision-induced throw "pushes" the object ball in the same direction as the cue ball was traveling before impact. Thus, a cue ball traveling from the left will cause an impacted object ball to be thrown slightly to the left of the OB's natural impact line.

Both varieties of throw are highly influenced by speed. Generally, the less momentum the cue ball possesses at the time of impact, the more that throw will affect the object ball's resultant path of travel.

{{anchor|Semi-massé}}
==Semi-{{lang|fr|massé|nocat=y}} ("curve" or "swerve") shot==
A cue ball can be made to curve in its path of travel with a {{cuegloss|semi-massé|semi-{{lang|fr|massé|nocat=y}}}} shot. This is usually employed for the purpose of avoiding an interfering ball or balls.

In order to achieve a curve, a player's cue stick must be elevated and the cue ball struck with {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}}. A curve to the left is accomplished by hitting the cue ball with an elevated cue and left-hand {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}}. A curve to the right is accomplished by hitting the cue ball with an elevated cue and right-hand {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}}. The higher the elevation of the cue, the more severe the degree of curve. The greater force with which a cue ball is hit the farther it will travel in the direction it was hit before beginning to curve.

Such shots are typically referred to as "curve shots" by North Americans and "swerve shots" by the British (not be confused with the ''[[#Swerve effect|swerve effect]]'', below).

Much steeper curves and even reversal of cue ball direction can be achieved with a [[#Massé shot|{{lang|fr|massé|nocat=y}}]] (below).

=={{lang|fr|Massé|nocat=y}} shot==
[[File:Massé illustration-Modern Billiards.png|thumb|120px|Illustration of a player performing a {{lang|fr|massé|nocat=y}} shot.]]
"{{cuegloss|massé|{{lang|fr|Massé|nocat=y}}}}" refers to imparting a high degree of spin along the vertical axis and often on the horizontal axis as well, so that the cue ball reverses direction, sharply curves, or both a few moments after being struck without the necessity of ever contacting another ball or rail.

A {{lang|fr|massé}} is performed by hitting the cue ball with the butt of the cue stick elevated; usually by 60 degrees or more. While controlling the aim, speed and curve of the cue ball takes a great deal of practice to master, there is a science to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  After the initial contact, the cue ball will travel straight along the path defined by the horizontal alignment of the cue until the cue ball slows enough for the imparted vertical spin to take over.  The cue ball will then curve onto a line defined by an angle described by the cue ball's initial resting point on the table and point on the table where the cue tip was aimed.  The time before vertical spin overcomes horizontal movement is determined by the force with which the cue ball is struck.  {{lang|fr|Massés}} are quite difficult for non-experts, and are not allowed in some venues, as the table's {{cuegloss|cloth}} can be easily damaged by unskilled players.

==Swerve effect ==
Whenever a pool ball is struck with any degree of {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}}, and with a cue that is not perfectly level, a curve results. In the two immediately preceding sections, ''intentional'' curves of lesser and greater degrees were described. However, because in most billiards shots, the cue is slightly elevated, if {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}} is employed, an ''unintentional'' (and imperceptible to the naked eye) curve results. This is known as "{{cuegloss|swerve}}" or "the swerve effect". The farther away an intended target is from the cue ball's original shooting position, the more swerve of the cue ball will affect where the cue ball arrives. For this reason, use of {{sic|hide=y|en|glish|reason=Not capitalized in this context}} (and unintentional {{sic|hide=y|en|glish|reason=Not capitalized in this context}}) are complicating factors in billiards and swerve must be compensated for. The ''swerve effect'' should not be confused with a "swerve shot", previously defined as Commonwealth terminology for a curve shot.

==Deflection (squirt)==
"{{cuegloss|Deflection}}" can be described as displacement of the cue ball from the aimed direction in the opposite direction of the side {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}} was applied. Like the swerve effect, deflection is an unwanted complicating factor in pool, present whenever {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}} is employed.

The physics of deflection has been studied extensively. Basically, when {{sic|hide=y|en|glish|reason=Not capitalized in this context}} is used, the cue ball will always begin its travel in a direction not exactly as aimed; it will "squirt" off of the line parallel with the cue's direction. Deflection increases the faster the cue stick is traveling at impact and the more {{sic|hide=y|eng|lish|reason=Not capitalized in this context.}} has been applied.

In more detail, deflection occurs when the cue tip strikes the cue ball right or left of the vertical axis.  When the cue tip strikes the cue ball off the vertical axis, the cue ball will deviate from, what would seem to be the obvious path once the cue tip strikes the cue ball.  The reason this occurs and how much the ball deviates from what seems like the obvious path is depended on many factors that the player must be aware of to properly adjust his line of aim while using side spin &lt;ref&gt;http://billiards.colostate.edu/physics/Shepard_squirt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.  The most impactful of factors is the cue stick, more specifically, the front end weight of the cue stick.  What is actually causing the squirt to occur is the off-center hit on a spherical object from a linear source of energy.  as the energy of the cue stick is imparted onto the cue ball from the tip of the cue stick, it is actually making contact with an angled surface when struck off-center.  The more off-center the hit, the more angle the cue tip encounters.  As a result, when the tip strikes the cue ball, it imparts forward energy and a degree of energy directed left or right&lt;ref&gt;http://billiards.colostate.edu/physics/Shepard_squirt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.  The left or right energy serves to push the cueball off the line just a little bit while most of the energy is distributed forward.  A cue stick with less front end mass will naturally serve to minimize the left or right energy imparted on the cue ball thus reducing the amount of squirt realized on the shot.  To really dig into the physics behind why squirt takes place, students from the University of Colorado's physics department wrote an excellent paper explained the math behind what is taking place ([http://billiards.colostate.edu/physics/Shepard_squirt.pdf Physics Behind Squirt]).

Deflection can be decreased by the type of cue used, and at the high levels, players will often select a personal playing cue based on the amount of squirt the cue imparts (the less the better).

Because swerve and deflection (for very different reasons) each cause the cue ball to take a different path than aimed, but each does so in the opposite direction of the other, under the right conditions swerve and deflection can cancel each other out.

==Jump shot==
A "{{cuegloss|jump shot}}" describes any shot where the cue ball is intentionally driven into the air in a legal manner. It is not permissible in some games (e.g. snooker, blackball, and Russian pyramid) and may be frowned upon or even forbidden in some venues as attempts at it by unskilled players may cause damage to a table's cloth. A legal jump shot requires that the cue ball to be struck above center, driving it down into the table, so that the ball will leave the table surface on a rebound. All authoritative rule sources deem it illegal to "scoop" under the cue ball with the tip of the cue to fling it into the air (technically because it is illegal to contact the cue ball with the ferrule of the cue, and because the cue ball is struck twice, both of which are classic fouls).

Unintentional small jumps are ubiquitous to billiards. In most billiards shots, a player's cue is slightly elevated. Whenever a ball is struck with an elevated cue, a jump, no matter how slight, occurs. An oft-used way to illustrate this principle is to lay a coin on the table approximately an inch in front of the cue ball. When shot very softly, the player will audibly hear the coin being struck and see the cue ball's reaction to that collision. When the same shot is performed with any degree of speed no sound or collision is evident, and it is clear that the coin is being jumped.

[[File:Curtain call.jpg|thumb|319px|[[Turandot]] directed by [[Roberto De Simone]]. January 2012, [[Teatro Comunale Bologna]]]]
A '''curtain call''' (often known as a '''walkdown''' or a '''final [[Bowing|bow]]''') occurs at the end of a performance when individuals return to the stage to be recognized by the audience for their performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060108193717/http://www.biography.ms/Acting_terms.html Theater Terminology] ''Biography.ms''.

URL Accessed July 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[musical theatre]], the performers typically recognize the orchestra and its conductor at the end of the curtain call. [[Luciano Pavarotti]] holds the record for receiving 165 curtain calls, more than any other artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mervinblock.com/60-minutes-story-about-singer-hits-false-note|title='60 Minutes' Story About Singer Hits False Note|last=Block|first=Mervin|date=October 15, 2004|publisher=Poynter Online|accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in film and television==
In film and television, the term "curtain call" is used to describe a sequence at the end of the film and before the closing credits, in which brief clips, stills, or outtakes featuring each main character are shown in sequence with the actor's name captioned. This sequence results in a similar individual recognition of each actor by the audience as would occur in a stage curtain call. This is not common, but when seen is more common in films that are light-hearted and have many characters, or perhaps a long list of cameo appearances.

On occasion, long-running television series, particularly those filmed in front of a live audience, have featured a theater-style curtain call at the conclusion of their runs, with the cast breaking character and often showing the audience and crew. The final episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', entitled "[[The Last Show (Mary Tyler Moore Show episode)|The Last Show]]" was a famous example of this. Since then, this term has been, more or less, associated with the [[series finale]] of a particular show.

==Sports curtain calls==
Athletes who also perform well may return to the field of play after a big play or at the conclusion of the game for recognition. Professional [[baseball]] players usually take their cap or helmet by the brim and hold it in the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060720/NEWS99/307200001 Detroit Free Press] ''Freep.com''. URL Accessed July 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to baseball historian Peter Morris, in May 1881 Detroit fans cheered a home run by Charlie Bennett until he bowed to them.

On October 3, 1951, after [[Bobby Thomson]] hit [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|the pennant-winning home run]] for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] in the ninth inning of the third game of the National League playoff, jubilant Giants fans swarmed the playing field of the [[Polo Grounds]], running after the triumphant Giant players, who raced towards the clubhouse which was located in center field. Author [[Joshua Prager (writer)|Joshua Prager]], in his definitive volume of Thomson's homer ''The Echoing Green'', wrote, "(T)housands of fans hungry for a curtain call stood now outside a green clubhouse chanting 'We want Thomson!' We want Thomson!'" Several minutes later (about 15 minutes after the actual home run), "word reached Thomson that he was wanted outside, that only a curtain call might dissipate the stubborn throng ... And so out Thomson went, wading through the packed clubhouse to its top outdoor step." ''[[New York Times]]'' sportswriter [[John Drebinger]] called the crowd's response "the most frenzied 'curtain calls' ever afforded a ballplayer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Echoing Green|last=Prager|first= Joshua|year=2006|publisher=[[Random House|Vintage Books]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=978-0-375-71307-1|pages=235–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Portal|Sports}}

The '''D'Oliveira affair''' was a prolonged political and sporting controversy relating to the scheduled 1968–69 tour of South Africa by the [[England cricket team]], who were officially representing the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC).{{refn|group=note|name=MCC}} The point of contention was whether or not the England selectors would include [[Basil D'Oliveira]], a mixed-race South African player who had represented England in [[Test cricket]] since 1966, having moved there six years earlier. With South Africa under [[apartheid]], the potential inclusion by England of a non-white South African in their tour party became a political issue.

A [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] of Indian and Portuguese ancestry, D'Oliveira left South Africa primarily because the era's [[apartheid legislation]] seriously restricted his career prospects on racial grounds and barred him from the all-white Test team. He qualified for [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club]] through residency in 1964 and first played for England two years later. The consequences of D'Oliveira's possible inclusion in the 1968–69 MCC tour of South Africa were discussed by English and South African cricketing bodies as early as 1966. Manoeuvring by cricketing and political figures in both countries did little to bring the matter to a head. The MCC's priority was to maintain traditional links with South Africa and have the series go ahead without incident. South Africa's Prime Minister [[B.&amp;nbsp;J. Vorster]] sought to appease international opinion by publicly indicating that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be acceptable, but secretly did all he could to prevent it.

D'Oliveira was omitted from the England team for part of 1968 amid a slump in his batting form, but he marked his return in late August with a score of 158 runs in England's final Test match of the year, against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] at [[The Oval]]. Days later, the MCC selectors omitted D'Oliveira from the team to tour South Africa; they insisted that this was based entirely on cricketing merit, but many in Britain voiced apprehension and there was a public outcry. After [[Tom Cartwright]]'s withdrawal because of injury on 16 September, the MCC chose D'Oliveira as a replacement, prompting accusations from Vorster and other South African politicians that the selection was politically motivated. Attempts to find a compromise followed, but these led nowhere. The MCC announced the tour's cancellation on 24 September.

[[Sporting boycott of South Africa during the Apartheid era|Sporting boycotts]] of South Africa were already under way by 1968, but the D'Oliveira controversy was the first to have a serious effect on South African cricket. The [[South African Cricket Board of Control]] announced its intention to remove racial barriers in South African cricket in 1969, and formally integrated the sport in 1976. Meanwhile, the boycott movement escalated sharply, leading to South Africa's near-complete isolation from international cricket from 1971, though the country continued to play international rugby into the 1980s, twice allowing mixed-race [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand rugby teams]] into the country during the 1970s. D'Oliveira played for England until 1972, and for Worcestershire until 1979. South Africa returned to international cricket in 1991, soon after apartheid began to be dismantled.

==Background==

===South Africa===

The English text reads: "For Use By White Persons. These public premises and the amenities thereof have been reserved for the exclusive use of white persons. By Order Provincial Secretary".]]
From the time that European settlers first arrived in South Africa in 1652, the country was divided on racial lines, in common with similar settlements. In contrast to other European colonies, racial distinction and segregation intensified during the early 20th century, and the various ethnic groups became more sharply defined and divided.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Following its general election victory [[South African general election, 1948|in 1948]], the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], led by [[Daniel François Malan|Daniel Malan]], formalised this racism under a government policy called [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "You've got to be Carefully Taught", Location 741&lt;/ref&gt; Under apartheid, different races were kept apart in all aspects of life.&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "You've got to be Carefully Taught", Location 800.&lt;/ref&gt; This system was thoroughly enforced during the 1950s; any resistance from non-white races was put down and [[apartheid legislation|laws]], supposedly to prevent the rise of communism, were passed to prevent political agitation.&lt;ref name="O14-15"/&gt;

From a cricketing viewpoint, the apartheid policy made little difference.&lt;ref name="O14-15" /&gt; Although cricket was played widely among the different racial groups in South Africa, the [[South Africa national cricket team|Test team]], which represented the country in international matches, had always been all white.{{refn|group=note|Controversy exists regarding the ancestry of [[Charlie Llewellyn|C.

Different races were forbidden from competing against each other.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 114–19.&lt;/ref&gt; South African cricket teams did not compete against [[India national cricket team|India]], [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] or the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], but teams from [[England cricket team|England]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] continued to visit the country. English cricketers particularly enjoyed tours to South Africa owing to the hospitality they received and the quality of living. The political writer and historian [[Peter Oborne]] commented: "Relations between the cricket establishments of the two countries were exceptionally warm. Only few visitors noticed, and even fewer cared, that there was something wrong."&lt;ref name="O14-15"&gt;Oborne, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1948–49|tour of South Africa during 1948–49]],{{refn|group=note|name=MCC|At the time official English touring teams played under the name, colours and badge of the MCC and were only styled "England" during Test matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lords.org/history/mcc-heritage/mcc-history/ |title=MCC History |publisher=MCC |accessdate=15 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607222859/http://www.lords.org/history/mcc-heritage/mcc-history/ |archivedate=7 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Peebles | first = I.

This prompted him to visit several [[Township (South Africa)|townships]] where he found black people living in very poor conditions.

Arlott later condemned apartheid, during a 1950 BBC broadcast,&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "You've got to be Carefully Taught", Location 829.&lt;/ref&gt; and refused to commentate during future tours to the country. His example was followed by the England batsman and clergyman [[David Sheppard]], who declined to tour South Africa, refused to play the team in 1960, and spoke out publicly against the policies of the South African government despite efforts by the MCC to silence him.&lt;ref name="O16" /&gt; Otherwise, there was little protest in England against South African cricket during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="W54"&gt;Williams, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain and the England cricket team===
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-1-11.jpg|thumb|UK Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] ''(left)'' visits Nigeria in 1960. British attitudes towards race and apartheid were shifting greatly at this time.|alt=A white man in a business suit shakes hands with a black man in white robes.]]
From the mid-1950s, the [[United Nations]] began to express concern over apartheid, and there was a growing general awareness in Britain of its effects. In 1960 the [[UK Prime Minister]], [[Harold Macmillan]], criticised apartheid in his "[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]" speech to the South African parliament.{{refn|Macmillan stressed the rising black nationalist ambitions across Africa, made clear Britain's intent to grant independence to its remaining colonies and urged the South African government to work towards eventually creating a society "in which individual merit, and individual merit
alone, is the criterion for a man's advancement". The speech and its theme had been widely anticipated in South Africa, but the frank tone of Macmillan's delivery surprised many. The parliamentarians received the speech coldly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1960: Macmillan speaks of 'wind of change' in Africa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/3/newsid_2714000/2714525.stm|location=London|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"|name="woc"}} However, the British government was cautious; the large number of British passport holders and businesses based in South Africa made them reluctant to force the issue and provoke a confrontation. Additionally, there was support for the policy among some right-wing politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "Waiting for Godot", Location 3472.&lt;/ref&gt; When the MCC team [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1956–57|toured South Africa in 1956–57]], the players observed and were shocked by what they considered to be injustices against the black population. As many players and officials had family and friends in the country, they were disinclined to take a stand, but several condemned the situation in print at the time or later.&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "The Tribe that Lost its Head", Location 4285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall attitudes in Britain towards South African cricket began to change in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="W54" /&gt; At the time, race was becoming a more emotive matter in Britain and [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since Irish independence|immigration from Asia and the Caribbean]] became an issue in general elections.&lt;ref name="Williams53" /&gt; Racial tensions had risen throughout the 1950s, and race riots had occurred. Tim Quelch, in his review of English cricket in the 1950s, suggests that "[England's] record on race relations had hardly been exemplary".&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "The Tribe that Lost its Head", Location 4342.&lt;/ref&gt; But Jack Williams, in his book ''Cricket and Race'', suggests that cricket was a force for racial harmony in England given the influx of African-Caribbean and Asian overseas players and the mingling of white and African-Caribbean supporters during several Test series between England and the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]].&lt;ref name="Williams53"&gt;Williams, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Against this background, when [[South African cricket team in England in 1960|the South African team toured England in 1960]], there were some protests against apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Duffus | first1 = Louis | last2=Owen-Smith | first2=Michael | last3=Odendaal |first3=Andre| editor1-last=Swanton | editor1-first=E.

===International sport===

Within South Africa, there was growing realisation among opponents of apartheid that sport could play a role in pressuring the government.&lt;ref name="W54" /&gt; During the 1950s, South Africa competed freely in international competition; the governing bodies of the major international sports recognised only the official, all-white South African institutions. By the end of the decade, this began to change. Several non-white sporting organisations within South Africa united and began to influence international opinion. The resulting pressure brought about the suspension of the all-white [[South African Football Association|Football Association of South Africa]] from [[FIFA]]—for two years from 1961, then after a brief reinstatement, again from 1964—which prevented [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] from participating in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]].&lt;ref name=O119/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of Race and International Sport: the Case of South Africa|last=Lapchick|first=Richard E.|date=April 1975|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-8371-7691-8|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa was also excluded from international fencing in 1964. However, because neither fencing nor football was closely followed in white South Africa, the impact was limited. [[Apartheid-era South Africa and the Olympics|Suspension from the Olympics]] had a greater effect;&lt;ref name=W64&gt;Williams, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; another campaign from within South Africa and the consequent change in international opinion resulted in South Africa being barred from the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]] and those that followed.&lt;ref name=O119&gt;Oborne, pp. 119–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, before a tour by the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand rugby team]], the South African government asked New Zealand to field an all-white team (thereby excluding [[Māori people|Māori]] players); the [[New Zealand Rugby Union|New Zealand Rugby Football Union]] refused and cancelled the tour.&lt;ref name=O134/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 5, Location 976.&lt;/ref&gt; As rugby was very popular among white South Africans, this caused concern in that community.&lt;ref name="W64"&gt;Williams, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The England cricket team was in New Zealand at the time, and Billy Griffith, by then the secretary of the MCC, when questioned said that the MCC would also cancel in similar circumstances.&lt;ref name=O134&gt;Oborne, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these events in other world sports, South Africa continued to play international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;Quelch, "The Tribe that Lost its Head", Location 4330.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to put pressure on the [[International Cricket Council|International Cricket Conference]] (ICC) failed, and even when South Africa withdrew from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961 (theoretically forfeiting the national team's Test status), their traditional opponents continued to play official Tests against them despite opposition from India, Pakistan and the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basil D'Oliveira===

[[Basil D'Oliveira]] was born in [[Cape Town]] in 1931 and, coming from a mixed Indian-Portuguese background, formed part of the [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/sports/cricket/basil-doliveira-a-symbol-for-cricket-and-for-equality-dies-at-80.html?_r=0|title=Basil D'Oliveira, a Symbol for Cricket and for Equality, Dies at 80|first=Douglas|last=Martin|location=New York|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 November 2011|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated skill in cricket from an early age, but as the apartheid system classified him as non-white, he was barred from playing [[first-class cricket]] in South Africa or representing the national team.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/568146.html | title = Basil D'Oliveira (Obituary)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 2012 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate = 23 June 2013 | isbn=978-1-4081-5634-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He represented and captained a "non-white" South African team which played unofficial international matches.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; He was left distraught by the cancellation in 1959, at the behest of South African anti-apartheid campaigners, of a proposed visit by a West Indies team which was to compete against non-white sides. Realising that he had achieved all he could as a non-white sportsman in South Africa, he wrote to John Arlott in England to ask for help finding employment as a cricketer.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=O5564/&gt;

Arlott enlisted the help of [[John Kay (cricket journalist)|John Kay]], a cricket journalist with expertise in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire leagues]], to find a job for D'Oliveira as a club professional. No teams were initially interested, but when [[Middleton Cricket Club|Middleton]]'s professional withdrew at the last minute, the club employed D'Oliveira for the 1960 season.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=O5564&gt;Oborne, pp. 55–64.&lt;/ref&gt; After a poor start, he prospered for Middleton. He established a wider reputation by playing televised matches for a team called the "Cavaliers", and took part in overseas tours with some leading cricketers. Several English [[county cricket club]]s expressed an interest in him, and he eventually joined [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]. Qualifying for the county team through residency,{{refn|group=note|At the time, cricketers had to have lived in a county for a year to qualify to play for that team.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;}} he made his debut in 1964 and scored a [[century (cricket)|century]] on his first appearance. By the 1966 season, he had progressed to the point that he was picked for England Test team. D'Oliveira was immediately successful for England; by the following year he was well-established in the team.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

==Build-up==

===Anticipation===

From early in his England career, D'Oliveira and his supporters saw the MCC tour of South Africa in 1968–69 as potentially being a key moment in his career.&lt;ref name=O134/&gt; Guy Fraser-Sampson suggests: "Nobody could be in any doubt that the possibility of D'Oliveira being chosen as a member of the England touring party would raise massive political complications".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 5, Location 973.&lt;/ref&gt; When D'Oliveira visited South Africa to work as a  coach in 1966, the subject was raised continually. People speculated whether D'Oliveira would be selected and, if so, whether the South African government would allow him to play. Some of his supporters worried that his acceptance of a place on a tour to South Africa might be interpreted as approval of the political situation there, but D'Oliveira was determined to play, aware of what it would mean to the non-white people of South Africa.&lt;ref name="O126-28"&gt;Oborne, pp. 126–28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Griffith flew to South Africa to discuss the forthcoming tour and to seek a solution to any potential problems—the MCC wanted the tour to go ahead without any political trouble. Little came of the meetings; Oborne suggests that both sides simply "agreed to hope that the whole issue went away".&lt;ref name="O134–35"&gt;Oborne, pp. 134–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a successful season for England in 1967, D'Oliveira was chosen to tour the West Indies in 1967–68;&lt;ref name="O126-28"/&gt; this raised awareness in England and South Africa that he was a realistic contender to tour South Africa a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his opportunities to excel were few in the West Indies; circumstances were against him in several matches, and he had a statistically poor tour. Any mitigating circumstances were offset by problems off the field. D'Oliveira took full advantage of the social opportunities available on a tour of the West Indies and frequently disappeared to parties and other events, often not reappearing until after breakfast. Rumours to this effect reached the press and the MCC tour manager spoke to D'Oliveira about his responsibilities on tour. D'Oliveira said that his behaviour and poor form were partly a result of the pressure placed on him. He was frequently questioned about the South African tour and about race—some groups in the West Indies accused him of "selling out" by playing for England's "white" team.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 129–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa's position===

The position of the South African government towards mixed-race teams was well established by 1967. It was stated explicitly after the visit of Griffith when, in February 1967, the Interior Minister [[P.&amp;nbsp;K. Le Roux]] said in a speech: "We will not allow mixed teams to play against our white teams here. That is our policy. It is well known here and overseas."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; These comments caused a public row in Britain, and some commentators wanted the tour to be called off; the MCC informed the British government that players would be selected on ability alone and that any attempts from within South Africa to interfere would cause the tour to be cancelled. [[Denis Howell, Baron Howell|Denis Howell]], the [[Minister for Sport and the Olympics|Minister for Sport]], informed the House of Commons of the MCC position and stated that the government expected that the MCC would cancel the tour if any player were to be rejected. Privately, the MCC committee were unhappy to have been forced into so unequivocal a position.&lt;ref name="O135-38"&gt;Oborne, pp. 135–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B. J. Vorster]], the [[Prime Minister of South Africa]], was embarrassed by Le Roux's public comments and forced him to deny having made them. However, the British government's intervention cemented in Vorster's mind the idea that it and the MCC were closely connected.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1298.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1967 he gave a speech in which he said that while sport between white and non-white teams could not take place in South Africa, the government would be prepared to send mixed teams to play abroad and to accommodate mixed teams from South Africa's "traditional" opponents. This change of direction was aimed at entering a team in the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], to avoid a repeat of the cancelled New Zealand rugby tour and with D'Oliveira's selection in mind.&lt;ref name="O135-38"/&gt; The MCC decided later in 1967 to clarify that Vorster's government would impose no limitations on the players chosen for the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1968, Griffith wrote on behalf of the MCC to the [[Cricket South Africa|South African Cricket Association]] (SACA) with the implication that the tour would be cancelled if a free selection was not guaranteed.&lt;ref name="O135-38"/&gt;

According to Oborne, Vorster was a pragmatic politician who wanted to maintain apartheid and to make it appear acceptable to the outside world. To this end, attempting to broaden South Africa's international connections, he accepted black foreign diplomats in the country and began to plan a policy to allow mixed-race sport to prevent South Africa's international isolation. However, such policies were unpopular with his domestic supporters and he was careful not to go too far.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 142–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne writes: "Vorster knew that there was a limit to how far he could go without imperilling his own position. That limit was Basil D'Oliveira."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Oborne, Vorster never intended to allow D'Oliveira to play with the MCC team; his supporters would not have accepted a non-white South African benefiting from this change of policy and demonstrating his ability at a high level. Vorster therefore worked to give the impression overseas that D'Oliveira would be welcome, while at the same time doing his utmost to stop him from playing. He courted the British ambassador, Sir John Nicholls, and told him that a tour party including D'Oliveira would be acceptable. Nicholls passed this on to the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 145–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Vorster meanwhile monitored D'Oliveira's progress closely; from his debut in 1966, South Africa kept a security file on him.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===MCC manoeuvres===

[[File:Alec Douglas-Home (c1963).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] met Vorster in March 1968, and told the MCC afterwards that South Africa would probably let D'Oliveira play.|alt=A photograph of Sir Alec Douglas-Home]]
In March 1968, having received no response from the SACA to Griffith's letter, the MCC asked [[Alec Douglas-Home]] to intervene. Douglas-Home, a former British Prime Minister and then the [[Shadow Foreign Secretary|Opposition spokesman for foreign affairs]], had just finished his term as MCC president and was visiting [[Rhodesia]] and South Africa; he agreed to raise the question of D'Oliveira during a meeting with Vorster that was part of his itinerary.&lt;ref name=O138&gt;Oborne, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas-Home believed that the best way to deal with apartheid was through dialogue and that contact between the countries should be increased, not reduced&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;—as he described it, "precept and example must be better than ostracism".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Williams, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; When he met Vorster, Douglas-Home was reluctant to press him for an unequivocal answer, but discussed D'Oliveira. He also sounded out other figures in South Africa and returned to England to tell the MCC,&lt;ref name=O138/&gt; in the words of the cricket writer [[E.&amp;nbsp;W. Swanton]], that "if D'Oliveira were to be chosen the odds were 5/4 on his being allowed in".&lt;ref name=S289&gt;Swanton, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of Fraser-Sampson: "While Douglas-Home's motives remain obscure, it is clear that he muddied the waters dreadfully. By allowing the MCC to believe they could continue happily fudging the issue, and by misleading them as to Vorster's true intentions, he delivered the worst of both worlds."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1346.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Douglas-Home's advice, the MCC let the matter drift throughout the 1968 season.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 138–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Conscious of D'Oliveira's poor form in the West Indies and continued lack of success during early 1968, the MCC committee kept in mind that it was far from certain that he would even make the team to tour South Africa.&lt;ref name=S289/&gt;

Meanwhile, with the knowledge of Vorster and the South African government, the SACA carefully devised its answer to the MCC letter. The reply, which avoided directly answering the MCC question, was hand-delivered to the MCC secretary [[Gubby Allen|George "Gubby" Allen]] in March 1968 by the former South African Test captain [[Jack Cheetham]], a close associate of several MCC officials. By this point, the MCC had accepted Douglas-Home's advice and no longer wanted a reply to their letter—Oborne records that when Cheetham "cheerily produced his laboriously produced document, a panic-stricken Gubby Allen waved it away."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was never presented to the full MCC Committee, and Cheetham returned to South Africa with news that a reply was not required—preparations for the tour could proceed as normal. This allowed Vorster to conceal his intentions regarding D'Oliveira for a further six months.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Allen later justified his actions by suggesting that he was concerned that the SACA letter would be leaked to the press if it went any further. Oborne believes that Allen wished to hide from the full committee the MCC hierarchy's change of mind over the approach to take with the South Africans; he suggests that Allen and Griffith were effectively acting as a secret MCC subcommittee from this point.&lt;ref name="O149-50"/&gt;

===South African plan===

Vorster and the SACA followed D'Oliveira's form closely throughout the tour of West Indies and into the 1968 season. D'Oliveira's lack of success prompted press speculation that he might lose his England place for entirely non-political reasons, but Vorster was convinced that the MCC were committed to selecting him under any circumstances.&lt;ref name="O149-50"&gt;Oborne, pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore conceived a two-pronged plan to prevent D'Oliveira's selection for the 1968–69 tour. He and the SACA would attempt to bribe D'Oliveira to make himself unavailable, while simultaneously persuading the English selectors—or more specifically the MCC, who Vorster believed would determine selection policy—not to choose him.&lt;ref name="O149-50"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1306.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the plan depended on the MCC realising that picking D'Oliveira would mean no tour, but in making such attempts the South Africans risked public discovery, which would cause the tour to be cancelled anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1309.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bribery was planned from an early stage, but had to be postponed when D'Oliveira did not return to South Africa before the 1968 season.&lt;ref name="O151-3"/&gt; The second part of the plan was put into operation in March 1968. Vorster resolved to send a secret message to the MCC through [[Charles Lyttelton, 10th Viscount Cobham|Lord Cobham]], a member and former president of the MCC with close links to D'Oliveira's county side Worcestershire.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="O151-3"/&gt; Cobham was visiting South Africa at Griffith's request to meet [[Arthur Coy]], an official of the SACA. Cobham told Coy that he wanted the tour to go ahead, but agreed with him that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be "disastrous". Cobham seems to have promised Coy that he would attempt to dissuade D'Oliveira from touring, but never actually did so. Cobham then met Vorster, who told him that if D'Oliveira were chosen, the tour would be cancelled.&lt;ref name=S289/&gt;&lt;ref name="O151-3"&gt;Oborne, pp. 151–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to England, Cobham kept this information from the full MCC committee, knowing that they would be forced to cancel the tour if they became aware of it. Instead, he wrote a letter to a committee member, whose identity has never been made public. The letter's recipient passed it on to Griffith, who in turn showed it to Allen and [[Arthur Gilligan]], at that time the MCC president. These three men chose to hide the information from the full committee,&lt;ref name=S289/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt; and nobody informed Denis Howell.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; Allen later defended these actions, setting out his reasoning in his biography, which was written by his close friend Swanton&lt;ref name="O154-55"/&gt;—Allen argued that the advice given by Douglas-Home, an international diplomat, took precedence over Cobham's information and had already been accepted by the MCC. He further suggested that, as the four England selectors had to choose the team "without any other consideration", and two of them sat on the MCC committee, it would have been unfair to burden them with Cobham's information.&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne dismisses Allen's reasoning as "disastrously muddled",&lt;ref name="O154-55"/&gt; pointing out that Cobham's advice was far more up-to-date than Douglas-Home's, and that there would have been no burden of conscience for the team selectors as the new information would have caused the tour to be cancelled.&lt;ref name="O154-55"&gt;Oborne, pp. 154–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not to press the issue. Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.&lt;ref name="O154-55"/&gt;

===D'Oliveira in 1968===

D'Oliveira was aware of the political discussions surrounding him during 1968, and the pressure on him was intensified by the scrutiny of his supporters and opponents in England and South Africa. Conscious of his failure in the West Indies, he made a concerted effort to improve his batting. He scored runs consistently and was chosen for England's first Test of 1968, against Australia in early June. He was very successful, scoring 87 [[not out]] and taking two wickets.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 139–41.&lt;/ref&gt; After England lost, however, D'Oliveira was blamed in some sections of the press.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' noted that he failed as a bowler, and his innings was difficult to evaluate as England had effectively lost the match by that stage.&lt;ref name=Lords&gt;{{cite web|title=England v Australia (First Test)| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150224.html| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1969 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, most observers expected him to retain his place, including the watching South Africans.&lt;ref name=O15558&gt;Oborne, pp. 155–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the second Test, played at Lord's, a series of events took place that Fraser-Sampson later described as "so bizarre as to be totally unbelievable, and yet [they] happened".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1320.&lt;/ref&gt; The evening before play began, Griffith suggested to D'Oliveira that, to save the 1968–69 series, he should withdraw himself from consideration for the tour, and announce that he wished in future to play for South Africa rather than England. D'Oliveira angrily declined. The next day, E.&amp;nbsp;W. Swanton—a journalist technically unconnected with the MCC, but a close friend of Allen and a member of the "Establishment"—approached the player with a similar proposition, which D'Oliveira again dismissed.&lt;ref name=O15558/&gt; Both Griffith and Swanton were opposed to apartheid—Swanton had refused to report on the 1964–65 MCC tour of South Africa because of his objections to the system, and he supported D'Oliveira from a cricketing standpoint.&lt;ref name=O158/&gt; This plan probably originated from one of the several South Africans present at Lord's with an interest in the D'Oliveira question, including Coy and the private cricket tour organiser Wilfred Isaacs; according to Fraser-Sampson, there is evidence to suggest that it first came from the SACA.&lt;ref name=O158/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1328.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne writes that Griffith and Swanton were probably well-intentioned, and posits that they might have been caught up in a South African scheme in their search for a solution to the D'Oliveira problem.&lt;ref name=O158&gt;Oborne, pp. 158–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser-Sampson suggests that they and other MCC figures may have felt forced into this course of action by the vigour of the South Africans' protests that they would not tolerate a team including D'Oliveira.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1330.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of the second Test, D'Oliveira was told by [[Colin Cowdrey]], the England captain, that he had been left out of the team and was instead [[Glossary of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]].&lt;ref name=O160/&gt; In his place, England chose a fast bowler to strengthen their bowling attack.&lt;ref name="Wisden version"&gt;{{cite web|last=Melford|first=Michael|title=The D'Oliveira case| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152399.html| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1969 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the game was taking place, [[Doug Insole]], the chairman of the England selectors, introduced D'Oliveira to Isaacs, who offered him warm hospitality if he toured South Africa during the English winter. Deeply upset with his omission, D'Oliveira returned to play for Worcestershire once his twelfth man duties ended. Oborne suggests that, from a cricketing viewpoint, the decision to drop D'Oliveira looks odd, and that it may have been connected to the South African presence at Lord's.&lt;ref name=O160&gt;Oborne, pp. 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement for D'Oliveira, [[Barry Knight (cricketer)|Barry Knight]], performed well in the second Test; D'Oliveira, by contrast, lost all batting form. From mid-June until August, bothered by the pressure over South Africa, he struggled to score, managing just 205 runs at an average of 12.81. He maintained his form as a bowler, but critics believed his chance had gone. In July, as part of a standard procedure, the MCC wrote to 30 leading players to ask if they were available to tour South Africa; D'Oliveira was not contacted.&lt;ref name="Wisden version"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 162–63.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fraser-Sampson, the idea that D'Oliveira was not then one of England's best 30 players was absurd; he writes that the selectors must therefore have been aware that Vorster would not accept his selection and they had consequently decided not to choose him.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1387.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his slump in form, D'Oliveira was contacted by Tienie Oosthuizen, a director at the tobacco company [[Carreras Tobacco Company|Carreras]], which was, alongside [[Rothmans International|Rothmans]], part of the South African [[Rembrandt Group|Rembrandt Tobacco Corporation]]. Rembrandt had set up a group known as the South African Sports Foundation (SASF) to promote amateur sport. Oosthuizen told D'Oliveira that he represented Rothmans, who had sponsored matches featuring D'Oliveira while he was waiting to qualify for Worcestershire. He offered D'Oliveira work as a coach for the SASF on an annual salary of £4,000—a vast sum for a professional cricketer at the time—on the condition that he took up this role immediately at the end of the 1968 season, and thereby made himself unavailable for the MCC tour before selection took place.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 162–65.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira tentatively declined, but Oosthuizen persisted, first offering to find out if he would be included in the MCC team,&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; then telling him that his presence in that side would embarrass Vorster. D'Oliveira was aware that accepting the offer could cause many to lose respect for him as he would be abandoning the opportunity to play against South Africa, but nevertheless considered it over the following weeks. Oosthuizen repeatedly pressured him to accept. Shortly before the final Test of 1968, he offered personally to match the money that D'Oliveira told him he had been offered to make himself available for the MCC team. D'Oliveira stalled, and involved his agent, Reg Hayter. After further conversations with Oosthuizen, D'Oliveira decided to try to postpone a decision until after the team to tour South Africa was announced—Hayter had established from a source close to the selectors that D'Oliveira had a good chance of being picked.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 172–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a later press investigation, Oosthuizen claimed to have acted independently. [[Anton Rupert]], the head of Rembrandt, endorsed this version, asserting that Oosthuizen had acted in his capacity as an employee of the SASF. Rupert said this was an autonomous organisation,&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 166–68.&lt;/ref&gt; but according to Oborne the SASF constitution made it totally dependent on Rembrandt. Oborne writes that Oosthuizen's offers were rooted in the plans made by Vorster and Coy to bribe D'Oliveira indirectly by offering him work that would prevent him from playing for the MCC.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 150–51, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne surmises that the position and salary offered to D'Oliveira did not come from the SASF, but were actually part of a scheme involving Vorster and Rupert to remove the controversial player from the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also concludes that the offer was effectively a bribe to stop D'Oliveira playing.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August, D'Oliveira returned to form with an innings of 89 against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the fifth and final England–Australia Test match, played between 22 and 27 August, Cowdrey batted at [[the Oval]], where the match was to be played, and deduced that medium-paced bowlers would be very effective given the condition of the cricket pitch. Consequently, when the England team was chosen, he asked for a medium-paced bowler to be placed in reserve in case conditions warranted their selection. The two first-choice selections, Knight and [[Tom Cartwright]], were unavailable, so D'Oliveira was called up by Cowdrey as a reserve on account of his bowling. On the day before the game, one of the England batsmen, [[Roger Prideaux]], withdrew from the team, saying he had an infection.{{refn|group=note|Prideaux later admitted that he could have played, but was concerned that if he had failed in that game, it might have cost him his place on the winter tour of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The team was duly re-arranged and the new version included D'Oliveira as a batsman. He heard no more from Oosthuizen, who was transferred from the London office soon after.&lt;ref name=O179&gt;Oborne, pp. 179–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The intervention of Oosthuizen became public knowledge when it was reported in the press in April 1969.&lt;ref name="Williams 58"&gt;Williams, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Height of controversy==

===Oval Test match===

[[File:The Oval test match - geograph.org.uk - 915211.jpg|thumb|[[The Oval]], pictured in 2008]]
Feeling much more confident, D'Oliveira expected to be successful in the Oval Test match. Before the game, an unnamed MCC official circulated a story that D'Oliveira had been offered thousands of pounds to keep himself available for the South Africa tour. This was a similar story to that which D'Oliveira had told Oosthuizen; it had probably travelled back to the MCC via South Africa, but was not true. When the game began, Australia held a 1–0 lead after four Tests; England needed a win to level the series. England made a reasonable start on the first day, but a late wicket brought D'Oliveira in to bat with the game delicately poised. Oborne observes that D'Oliveira was under huge pressure, both for simple cricketing reasons and because the world was watching to see if he would be successful.&lt;ref name="O180-83"&gt;Oborne, pp. 180–83.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' reported: "In the last hour D'Oliveira began his fine effort. He hooked the short ball superbly".&lt;ref name=Oval&gt;{{cite web|last=Preston|first=Norman|title=England v Australia (Fifth Test)| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150228.html| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1969 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the first day, he had scored 23 runs.&lt;ref name="O180-83"/&gt;

Early on the second day, D'Oliveira batted with less certainty. He was dropped by the opposition wicket-keeper with his score on 31, but he was encouraged by the umpire [[Charlie Elliott]] and his batting partner [[John Edrich]].&lt;ref name="O183-84"&gt;Oborne, pp. 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt; As his score reached fifty, Elliott whispered, "Well played—my God you're going to cause some problems."&lt;ref name="O183-84"/&gt; D'Oliveira went on to score 158 runs before he was out, although he was dropped a few more times after passing three figures.&lt;ref name=Oval/&gt; He received a prolonged ovation from the crowd when he was out, and congratulations from [[John Gleeson (cricketer)|John Gleeson]], one of the opposing Australians.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 6, Location 1168.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne assesses the innings as one of the best ever: despite the relatively weak attack and easy batting conditions, Oborne believes that no other cricketer had faced so much pressure and so many outside forces conspiring against him.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 184–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the game, D'Oliveira also contributed with the ball. After rain had reduced the amount of playing time and caused further delays through the subsequent clean-up, England faced a race against time to win the match. D'Oliveira took a crucial wicket with his 12th ball to break a long partnership and open the way for [[Derek Underwood]] to bowl England to victory in the game and a share in the series.&lt;ref name=Oval/&gt;

Off the field, manoeuvres started immediately. Vorster followed the innings closely, with Oosthuizen in attendance. On the second day of the match, [[Geoffrey Howard (British Army officer)|Geoffrey Howard]], the secretary of [[Surrey County Cricket Club]] (who played at the Oval), received a call from Oosthuizen, who informed Howard that he had been trying without success to contact Billy Griffith. He told Howard to pass along to Griffith the message that if "today's centurion is picked, the tour will be off".&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 185–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Insole asked D'Oliveira if he was available to tour South Africa, and Cowdrey questioned him about how he would handle the inevitably tense situations. Cowdrey also said that he wanted him in the team. D'Oliveira was left in little doubt that he would be selected to tour South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 186–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection meeting===

}}

The selectors, after a six-hour meeting, chose the team to tour South Africa on 27 August 1968.{{refn|group=note|The meeting began at 8&amp;nbsp;pm on that date, but did not finish until 2&amp;nbsp;am on 28 August.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The official records of the meeting are incomplete and of those present, no one left an account of what happened. Oborne believes that at least ten men were present—the four selectors, Insole, [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], [[Don Kenyon]] and [[Alec Bedser]]; the England captain Colin Cowdrey; Gubby Allen, Billy Griffith, Arthur Gilligan and [[Donald Carr]] for the MCC; and possibly [[Maurice Allom]], another MCC member. Oborne suggests that one of those present might have been acting for the South African government, as Vorster was well-informed about what happened at the meeting and followed events closely.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 189–95.&lt;/ref&gt; He also observes that, of those present, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan knew from the Cobham letter what would happen if D'Oliveira were selected; he argues that they may have passed the information on to other selectors. Coy, who had been at the Lord's Test, may also have made the South African position clear at the meeting. According to Oborne, "Everyone in the room, with the possible exception of the Worcestershire skipper Don Kenyon, would have been aware that the selection of D'Oliveira could at best cause difficulties and at worst cause the tour to be cancelled."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser-Sampson goes further, suggesting that Insole, and possibly also May, knew the whole story from an early stage.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1396.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a cricketing viewpoint, most critics agreed that D'Oliveira should probably have been selected based on his score at the Oval, his past record, and the usefulness of his bowling. The selectors left him out, however, deciding that his bowling was not strong enough to classify him as an all-rounder. Oborne points out that, judged in cricketing terms, this was "not an outrage".&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira had several rivals as a batsman, and of the places available, one went to [[Ken Barrington]], who had a good Test record, and the other to [[Keith Fletcher]], who was much younger than D'Oliveira. Oborne judges both of these decisions fair.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody at the selection meeting supported including D'Oliveira. Some of those present said later that, despite his prior assurances to D'Oliveira, Cowdrey opposed his selection at the meeting, which influenced others there.&lt;ref name=O200/&gt; Fraser-Sampson suggests that Cowdrey, who later tried to justify his role in events, may have inwardly supported D'Oliveira's inclusion, but spoken against it out of a lack of confidence and decisiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1414.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible, argues Fraser-Sampson, that if May had been aware of the true state of affairs, he may have confided in Cowdrey, a close friend; this would have left Cowdrey, who was very keen to lead a team to South Africa, in a difficult and conflicted position. Fraser-Sampson concludes: "Far from being the villain of the piece, Cowdrey may simply have been an honourable man pushed beyond the limits of his character and overwhelmed by events."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 7, Location 1437.&lt;/ref&gt;

As is customary at such selection meetings, there was no vote. Insole recalled that there was no hostility towards D'Oliveira at the meeting, and pointed out that although he was not chosen in the main team, he was made a reserve.&lt;ref name=O200&gt;Oborne, pp. 200–01.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams, while acknowledging that there were several worthy batsmen as candidates for places in the team, asserts that even if those at the meeting had only discussed the players' respective cricketing abilities, "every selector must have known that by not selecting D'Oliveira they would improve the prospects of the tour going ahead."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The full MCC Committee met to formally approve the selected team on the afternoon of 28 August.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody voiced opposition.&lt;ref name=O212/&gt;

D'Oliveira, who learned of his omission over the radio in the Worcestershire dressing room having just scored 128 runs against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]], was deeply upset and faced intense press attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Moment of Heartbreak |work=[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]] |location=Johannesburg |url=http://heritage.thetimes.co.za/memorials/WC/BasilDOliveira/Article.aspx?id=570449 |pages=1, 3 |date=29 August 1968 |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206215115/http://heritage.thetimes.co.za/memorials/WC/BasilDOliveira/Article.aspx?id=570449 |archivedate=6 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=O204205&gt;Oborne, pp. 204–05.&lt;/ref&gt; Insole and Griffith defended the decision to omit D'Oliveira to the press, saying that there had been no pressure from South Africa and that the chosen team simply included better players than D'Oliveira.&lt;ref name=O212&gt;Oborne, pp. 212–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Oborne writes that Insole considered the events surrounding the selection meeting as among the worst of his life, but that "he and the other selectors were victims of the decision, reached on the advice of Alec Douglas-Home early in 1968, not to press for an answer to the MCC demand there should be 'no preconditions' for the tour. Once that decision had been made, everything else followed: the bribery attempt, the secret pressure and the nobbling of the MCC. Had the matter been dealt with&amp;nbsp;... Insole would never have been subject to the innuendo and accusations of racism and betrayal that have haunted him ever since."&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction===

While the general public were baffled that a man who just scored a century against Australia could be left out of the team, the English cricketing press were divided on the decision.&lt;ref name="Williams 58"/&gt; Some journalists supported the MCC on cricketing grounds, including the cricket correspondents of ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.{{refn|group=note|[[John Woodcock (cricket writer)|John Woodcock]], the ''Times'' correspondent, supported the selectors at the time, but later changed his mind, saying he had misjudged the situation surrounding D'Oliveira.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1505.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 217–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, prominently the former England captain [[Ted Dexter]], the former Test player [[Trevor Bailey]] and E.&amp;nbsp;W. Swanton, all of whom generally sided with the cricket establishment, contended that D'Oliveira deserved to be in the team on merit.&lt;ref name=O213/&gt; Swanton said he had received no letters which actually agreed with the omission.&lt;ref name=W59/&gt; Other commentators, such as the Worcestershire club secretary and the former West Indies Test player [[Learie Constantine]], openly stated that D'Oliveira was omitted either because of his race or because the MCC supported apartheid.&lt;ref name=O213&gt;Oborne, pp. 213–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politicians also expressed concern.&lt;ref name=O213/&gt; John Arlott, while asserting that D'Oliveira deserved to be included, suggested that to demonstrate opposition to apartheid, the MCC should perhaps have selected him even if this were not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 216–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The general press took a wider view, with several newspaper columns reporting that the decision appeared to have been made to avoid offending the South African government.&lt;ref name=W59&gt;Williams, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Williams, the public positions held by much of the MCC committee towards South Africa led to suspicions that D'Oliveira may have been left out simply to save the tour.&lt;ref name=W59/&gt;

More recent commentators suggest that the MCC members were not directly motivated by support of apartheid. Oborne argues that the MCC establishment, without favouring apartheid, wished to maintain traditional links with white South Africa.&lt;ref name=O212/&gt; Williams suggests that the committee were politically naive, and that they ignored the political dimensions of D'Oliveira's non-selection. Williams writes that the committee seemed unaware that its decision made it appear to support apartheid.&lt;ref name=W64/&gt; Fraser-Sampson believes that those involved "acted for what they thought were the best of motives, namely what they saw as the good of the game."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1572.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the right-wing links of some individuals—Gilligan had been a member of the [[British Fascists]] during the 1920s,&lt;ref name=O194&gt;Oborne, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bedser later became a member of [[the Freedom Association]], which Fraser-Sampson classifies as "far-right"&lt;ref name=racism/&gt;—neither Oborne nor Fraser-Sampson suggests that the two men were racist, or that any of the selectors' actions regarding D'Oliveira were tainted by prejudice or support for apartheid.&lt;ref name=O194/&gt;&lt;ref name=racism/&gt; Fraser-Sampson does comment, however, that some individuals were "apologists" for Vorster, and that many of them firmly believed in the separation of politics and sport.&lt;ref name=racism&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1574.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all MCC members supported the selectors. Around 70 members met, including the clergyman and former England captain David Sheppard, and called for the tour to be abandoned. Sheppard's intervention shook Cowdrey, a religious man.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Within weeks, several MCC members had resigned in protest at the decision, and the MCC had received nearly 1,000 letters about it, mainly complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Cowdrey defends South African tour| newspaper = The Times  | location = London  | page =  1 | date = 9 September 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, whites received the news happily—one nationalist rally broke into cheers upon hearing the news&lt;ref name=O204205/&gt;—while the black community viewed the omission as a betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] sent telegrams to the Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], asking him to intervene, and to Gilligan, asking for the tour to be cancelled on the grounds that by playing in South Africa the England team would be "condoning apartheid".&lt;ref name=W59/&gt; D'Oliveira received many letters of support from the public. He also received sympathetic letters from Cowdrey, Insole, Griffith and Cobham. He responded with a burst of good form, and was not drawn into publicly criticising the MCC, even offering the team his support.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 219–20.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed a contract to cover the tour for the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper, which drew criticism from other newspapers and shook Vorster.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 221–22.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, non-whites were not allowed into South African press boxes other than "in a menial capacity"—Vorster suggested that D'Oliveira may not even be allowed on the tour as a journalist.&lt;ref name=W61/&gt;

One of the MCC team, Tom Cartwright, had been struggling with an injury. He had considered withdrawing from the tour on moral grounds, owing to his reservations about involvement with the apartheid government.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1534.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different versions of what actually happened. According to Cowdrey, Cartwright played without discomfort on 14 September, passed a fitness test the following day, and suddenly withdrew after an overnight reaction to his exertions, prompting the selectors to take only ten minutes to choose D'Oliveira as a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1545.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser-Sampson records that Cartwright actually had two fitness tests, owing to pre-existing concerns over his health; the selectors tried to persuade him not to pull out, with Cowdrey particularly insistent, but Cartwright was adamant.&lt;ref name=Cartwright&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1542.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September, he withdrew from the MCC team, citing his injury.&lt;ref name=O223/&gt; D'Oliveira was duly called up,&lt;ref name=Cartwright/&gt; a decision announced the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having been rejected as a bowler at the earlier meeting, he was now replacing a bowler in the team; the selectors stated that D'Oliveira's bowling might prove useful. Oborne's assessment of the decision is that "they had had enough and were bowing to public opinion."&lt;ref name=O223/&gt; Williams comments that the belated addition of D'Oliveira in the wake of outcry at his exclusion confirmed in the minds of many that politics had been involved in the team selection. Denis Howell felt the need to state publicly that the decision was the MCC's alone, and that there had been no pressure from the UK government.&lt;ref name=W61&gt;Williams, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira was pleased but suspected that the tour would no longer go ahead.&lt;ref name=O223&gt;Oborne, pp. 222–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, Vorster heard that D'Oliveira had been added to the team shortly before addressing the Orange Free State National Party congress at [[Bloemfontein]] on 17 September.&lt;ref name=O223/&gt;&lt;ref name=cricinfotimeline/&gt; He immediately announced that the English team would not be allowed into South Africa if it included D'Oliveira. He told the gathering that while "we are and always have been prepared to play host to the MCC&amp;nbsp;... [we] are not prepared to receive a team thrust upon us by people whose interests are not the game, but to gain certain political objectives which they do not even attempt to hide".&lt;ref name=murray89&gt;{{cite book|title=Caught Behind: Race And Politics In Springbok Cricket |last1=Murray|first1=Bruce |last2=Merrett|first2=Christopher |publisher=Wits University Press |location=Johannesburg |year=2004|isbn=978-1-86914-059-5 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; To loud applause, he went on to describe the revised MCC team as "not the team of the MCC but the team of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, the team of SANROC [the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee] and the team of [[Ambrose Reeves|Bishop Reeves]] [a critic of apartheid]."&lt;ref name=murray89/&gt; Vorster expressed similar sentiments elsewhere, accusing the MCC of making a purely political decision.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt; He insisted that he "had taken a decision for South Africa".&lt;ref name=cricinfotimeline&gt;{{cite web|title=The D'Oliveira Affair|last=Williamson |first=Martin |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/356092.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date=13 September 2008|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South African press was mostly critical of Vorster, warning that his stand might lead to the country's exclusion from international sport,&lt;ref name=cricinfotimeline/&gt; but Professor Bruce Murray comments that the MCC's initial exclusion of D'Oliveira, only to then include him instead of a bowler, had given Vorster some ammunition to claim that the MCC selection was politically charged. Including D'Oliveira from the start would, by contrast, have forced Vorster to reveal that his plan to allow mixed teams was false.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Oborne, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, Griffith responded that the tour would be cancelled were D'Oliveira not allowed to play, and that he was in the team on merit having missed selection first time around by "a bee's whisker".&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 225–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Cowdrey, meanwhile, proposed flying to South Africa himself to safeguard the tour but the South African minister [[Ben Schoeman]] said that D'Oliveira had been chosen because of politics and that South Africa would make no deal to let him play.&lt;ref name=O226&gt;Oborne, pp. 226–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Coy and Cheetham flew secretly to London to try to find a compromise.&lt;ref name=O226/&gt; They held a four-hour meeting with the MCC committee on 24 September, directly after which the committee announced that "the side selected to represent MCC in South Africa is not acceptable for reasons beyond the control of the SACA. The MCC committee therefore decided unanimously that the tour will not take place."&lt;ref name=W61/&gt; Williams argues that the delay in cancelling the tour suggests that some in the MCC might still have hoped to find common ground with the South Africans.&lt;ref name="W61-2"&gt;Williams, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Oliveira briefly considered withdrawing from the team to save the series, but decided not to.&lt;ref name="W61-2"/&gt;

Sheppard and other MCC rebels called a Special General Meeting of the MCC;&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt; they wanted the MCC to state publicly that the team selection had been mishandled and that no further cricket should take place with South Africa until cricket there had been made non-racial. Before the meeting took place, the General Committee met the rebels and initially claimed that it would have been inappropriate to ask South Africa about D'Oliveira before the tour—although they had done so. The committee then admitted writing a letter but said that they had never received a reply. The Special General Meeting took place in December 1968, but the rebels were outvoted by the other members; Sheppard was criticised by members at the meeting, and his former friend Peter May refused to talk to him afterwards.&lt;ref name=O226/&gt; Those opposing Sheppard suggested that he opposed apartheid whereas the committee wanted to advance cricket. It was also suggested that the MCC should not act as the conscience of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=W62&gt;Williams, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams suggests that the vote indicated that a high proportion of the MCC favoured maintaining cricketing links with South Africa despite knowing that South African cricket operated racial segregation.&lt;ref name=W62/&gt;

==Aftermath==

Coming just after New Zealand abandoned their 1967 rugby tour over South Africa's refusal to accommodate a mixed team, the cancellation of the 1968–69 MCC series over D'Oliveira marked the second such incident in two years.&lt;ref name=W64/&gt; According to Oborne, the affair forced upon South African cricket a realisation that it had to change. In 1969, the [[South African Cricket Board of Control]] (SACBOC) announced that future teams would be racially integrated and selected purely on merit; efforts duly began to allow all races to compete against each other and share facilities. This led to some disagreement among non-white sports organisations between those who supported these incremental changes and those who wanted immediate disbanding of the old system. D'Oliveira, a member of the first group, was partly drawn into this conflict. He also faced criticism from those in South Africa and England who believed that, to oppose apartheid, he should have declared himself unavailable to tour in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 229–34.&lt;/ref&gt; With the tour to South Africa cancelled, the MCC hastily arranged for its team to play a Test series in Pakistan instead. D'Oliveira played and was very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 236–37.&lt;/ref&gt; He remained an England regular for four more years and played for Worcestershire until 1979.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1969, many of the events from the previous year became public knowledge, including the deceptions of Allen, Griffith and Gilligan. The MCC committee met and granted retrospective approval to the actions of the four men. Griffith's offer to resign was declined.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1591.&lt;/ref&gt; The press outcry of 1968 was not repeated; Fraser-Sampson speculates that the MCC may have applied pressure to journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1619.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith and Allen later received [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]] from the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Sampson, Chapter 8, Location 1631.&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy continued to flare in Britain and other countries regarding sporting links with South Africa. The [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa rugby team]]'s [[1969–70 South Africa rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland|1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland]] was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack the South African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people tried to stop the South Africans from reaching the match venue by lying down in the middle of the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remembering bitter Springboks tour that paved a way for change |last=Inverdale |first=John |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/2346183/Remembering-bitter-Springboks-tour-that-paved-a-way-for-change.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=20 September 2006|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A last-gasp winner and a hijacked bus|last=Williamson|first=Martin|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/southafrica/rugby/story/165323.html|work=[[ESPNscrum]]|publisher=[[ESPN, Inc.]]|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the South Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;Oborne, pp. 234–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swanton, pp. 292–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the South Africa rugby team's [[1971 South Africa rugby union tour of Australia|1971 tour]] led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a [[state of emergency]] in [[Queensland]], all of which prompted the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Cricket Board]] to cancel the tour by the South Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.{{refn|group=note|Both of these cancelled tours were replaced by pseudo-Test series pitting the host nation against "[[Rest of the World cricket team in England in 1970|Rest of the World]]" teams featuring leading cricketers from around the world, including several South Africans.&lt;ref name=peoplepower/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The best of the best? |last=Ryder-Whish |first=Matthew |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketer/content/story/220595.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date=July 2000 |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=peoplepower&gt;{{cite web |title=When people power sunk South Africa |last=Williamson |first=Martin |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/220550.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |date=1 October 2005 |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa was thereafter almost totally isolated from international cricket, but not from rugby. The [[Australian Rugby Union]] severed ties with South Africa after the turbulent 1971 series, but its counterparts in New Zealand, France and the [[Home Nations]] retained links into the 1980s. With Māori and [[Samoans|Samoan]] players officially designated "[[honorary white]]s" by the South African government, mixed-race New Zealand rugby teams toured South Africa in [[1970 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|1970]] and [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|1976]].&lt;ref name=nauright&gt;{{cite book |title=Sport, Cultures, and Identities in South Africa |last=Nauright|first=John |year=1997 |publisher=Leicester University Press |location=Leicester |isbn=978-0-7185-0072-6 |pages=143–147, 151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SACBOC formally integrated South African cricket in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of an African Game: Black Cricketers and the Unmasking of one of Cricket's Greatest Myths, South Africa, 1850–2003 |last=Odendaal |first=André |year=2003 |location=Cape Town |publisher=David Philip Publishers |isbn=978-0-86486-638-7 |pages=223–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; but enduring overseas opposition to South Africa's internal governance meant that the country did not play official international cricket again until 1991, after the start of the process to dismantle apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rewind to 1970: When politics killed a tour |last=Williamson |first=Martin

[[File:HS First XI 1907.JPG|thumb|[[Hale School]] First XI (plus schoolmaster) in 1907]]

The '''first XI''', '''first 11''' or '''starting XI''' are the 11 primary players in an organisation's leading team, particularly a [[cricket]] team or [[association football]] team. A player who is considered part of the starting XI is often the most proficient in his/her particular position - for example, a football club's leading goal scorer will almost always be selected due to his ability and the contribution he/she makes to the team.

'First eleven' is a reference to the fact that they are the first eleven players selected to play for the team - many sports state that clubs must have squads of no fewer than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; number of players, and this number is often higher than 11. For example, in the [[Premier League]], each club has to designate a squad of 25.

A '''fronton''' ({{lang-es|frontón}}; {{lang-eu|frontoi}} or {{lang|eu|pilotaleku}}; {{lang-fr|fronton}}) is a two-walled or single-walled court used as a playing area for [[Basque pelota]].

==History==
[[File:Ossès Eglise Fronton.jpg|90px|right|thumb|fronton at Ossès Church]]
The front wall of the first frontons in villages was usually the wall of a church. Because the games being played close by, several priests would play pelota along with the villagers and got to be well-known players and often served as referees in provincial or town competitions&lt;ref&gt;[http://manista.blogs.com/bitacora/pelotaris_de_leyenda/ Priests at pelota]&lt;/ref&gt; but were out of the picture when it turned into a commercialized sport. Because of the increasing popularity of the game, many churches put up signs forbidding pelota games on their porches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fepelota.es/images/stories/historia_de_la_pelota.pdf History of pelota&lt;/ref&gt;
The games were also played in town halls, but when the game turned into a highly popular entertainment in the region, towns started to build special frontons in open-air or closed courts.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Frontón pelota.PNG|300px|right|thumb|Basque pelota fronton diagram '''1:''' Side wall; '''2:''' Front wall; '''3:'''Ground; '''4:''' Perspective view (lower and upper zones in blue)]]

A fronton is made up of a rectangular floor and three vertical walls, named ''frontis''; the front wall is the main one, where the hits are directed according to the rules. That wall has a line at a determined height named ''Bajo Chapa'' (Lower Zone).
Perpendicular to the front wall is attached another longer wall, with marks for the distance to the main wall. The number of marks depends on the type of fronton used.
Perpendicular to the side wall is the back wall. The height of the three walls must be the same for professional courts.
Often, in common rural open-air courts, the place where the back wall should be is delimited by a line on the floor. A free wall sideline is delimited to make watching the game easier for an audience or other players. In every kind of fronton, the sidelines are 4.5 m apart.

===Very short court===
This kind of court is 30 m long and is used professionally only for [[frontenis]] and paleta-rubber variants.

===Short court===
This 36 m court is used professionally for hand-pelota, paleta-leather and short bat variants.

===Long court===
This 54 m court is used professionally for long bat, remonte and basket variants.

===Trinquet===
This 28.5 m court has a somewhat different shape than the others: with an inclined roof all along the left wall. It allows the variants of handball, paleta-rubber, paleta-leather and xare. It is used almost exclusively in the Northern Basque Country, but also in some places of León and Castilla.

=== Place libre ===
This 100 m open-air court is used for playing Grand Chistera in France and has no side walls, the limit for play is at 80 m from the fronton. This court is not recognised by the [[International Federation of Basque Pelota]] and cannot be used for international competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ffpb.net/files/standard/public/p66_da0afdff566ef1c2792c2e3a8e8879f44_Reglement_sportif_FFPB.pdf|title=Rules for Pelote Basque FFPB|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ffpb.net|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fronton marks==
[[File:Fronton.JPG|300px|right|thumb|Typical distribution of the marks in a fronton]]
The marks on the fronton must create a notable contrast with the color of the field. To make the difference visible, the marks are often painted.

===Sideline===
The sideline line is 15&amp;nbsp;cm wide and parallel to the side wall. This line marks the limit between the playing ground and the exterior.

===Lower and upper zones===
The lower zone line is 15&amp;nbsp;cm wide and the height depends on the size of the fronton (see chart). The upper zone is frequently marked at 10 m high on the wall and the line is also 15&amp;nbsp;cm wide.

===''Cuadros'' (squares)===
The squares are the lines painted on the side wall and the ground, used to mark the places of service, ''falta'', and ''pasa''. From square to square the distance is 4 m (long fronton) or 3 m (Very short and short frontons).

===''Falta'' (fail) and ''Pasa'' (pass)===
The ''falta'' line is located in the fourth square, while ''pasa'' is located in the seventh square; both lines are 15&amp;nbsp;cm wide.
In the Olympic version, the ''falta'' is in the third square and the ''pasa'' on the fifth square.

===Service line===
The service line is often located in the fifth square, usually in raquet, cesta punta, and paleta-rubber, or in the fourth square, usually in hand categories.

The '''Gatorade shower''', also known as the '''Gatorade dunk''' or the '''Gatorade bath''', is an sports tradition that involves players surreptitiously dumping a cooler full of liquid (most commonly [[Gatorade]] mixed with [[ice cube|ice]]) over the head of their coach (or occasionally a high-profile assistant coach, star player, or team owner in professional leagues) following a meaningful win, such as the [[Super Bowl]], [[World Series]] or other major sporting event.  This includes all levels of play including [[Little League World Series]], high school, college (NCAA) and professional teams (e.g. NBA Finals or Stanley Cup).

==Start of tradition==
The tradition began with the [[New York Giants]] football team in the mid-1980s. According to several sources, including [[Jim Burt (football player)|Jim Burt]] of the [[New York Giants|Giants]], it began on October 28, 1984, when the Giants beat the Washington Redskins 37–13, and Burt performed the action on [[Bill Parcells]] after being angry over the coach's treatment of him that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Borden |first=Sam |date=21 January 2012 |title=A Splashy Tradition, Gatorade-Style |work= |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/21/sports/football/a-splashy-football-tradition-gatorade-style.html?hp |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkqrPxxi0F4 1984 Giants dunk on YouTube], accessed November 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Burt insisted that [[Harry Carson]] dumped the Gatorade on Parcells, because Carson was a favorite and wouldn't get in trouble.&lt;ref name=rovell /&gt; Former [[Chicago Bears]] defensive tackle [[Dan Hampton]] claims he invented the shower, also in 1984, when the Bears dunked [[Mike Ditka]] upon clinching the NFC Central &amp;ndash; but that took place a month later in November.&lt;ref name=rovell /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=NFLFilms 1984 Chicago Bears Season Highlights|medium=Television production|publisher=[[NFL Films]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2tEyu1YuTo#t=18m20s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon gained national attention in the [[1986 New York Giants season|1986 Giants season]]. Parcells was doused after 17 victories that season, culminating with [[Super Bowl XXI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2011/09/did-the-new-york-giants-originate-the-gatorade-shower.html | title=Did the New York Giants originate the Gatorade shower? | date=September 14, 2011 | publisher=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=rovell/051014 | title=How the dunk was born | first=Darren | last=Rovell | publisher=ESPN | accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
[[Boston Celtics]] coach [[Doc Rivers]] was reported to be the first [[NBA]] coach to receive a Gatorade shower when his team won the [[2008 NBA Finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stein|first=Marc|title=Three Party triumph: KG leads, Allen scorches and Pierce takes MVP|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2008/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;page=Game6-080618|publisher=ESPN.com|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Pierce]] dumped a cooler of red Gatorade over Rivers as the Celtics closed out Game 6 to clinch their first NBA title in 22 years. Then-[[Los Angeles Lakers]] coach [[Phil Jackson]] is the only NBA head coach to receive a Gatorade shower twice, as the Lakers won back-to-back NBA Finals in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]] (at [[Amway Arena]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]) and [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]].  [[Dallas Mavericks]] coach [[Rick Carlisle]] likewise received the honors when Mavericks celebrated their [[2011 NBA Finals|first NBA championship]] in 2011.  [[Miami Heat]] head coach [[Erik Spoelstra]] received the same treatment from [[Udonis Haslem]] when the Heat won the [[2012 NBA Finals]] at the [[American Airlines Arena]] in 2012.

[[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]], coach of the Long Beach State football team and a former Hall of Fame NFL head coach, was doused with ice water from a Gatorade bucket as his team celebrated its victory over the University of Nevada on November 17, 1990.  Allen became ill shortly afterward and died of ventricular fibrillation six weeks later.

[[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky Wildcats]] coach [[Guy Morriss]] is one of few coaches ever to receive a Gatorade shower and lose a game. This occurred on November 9, 2002, during the [[Bluegrass Miracle]], when [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] defeated [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]].  Coach Morriss was showered immediately before [[Marcus Randall]] threw a [[Hail Mary pass]] to [[Devery Henderson]] to win on the final play of the game. On November 24, 2018, LSU coach [[Ed Orgeron]] received a gatorade shower after an apparent LSU game ending interception. Texas A&amp;M eventually beat LSU 74-72 in 7 overtimes.

Many [[baseball]] players give a teammate who has just hit a [[walk-off home run]], or a pitcher who has thrown a no-hitter, a Gatorade shower while they are giving a post-game interview on the field. [[Salvador Pérez]] of the [[Kansas City Royals]] is known for giving a Gatorade shower to teammates after every home win and notable away wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=DeAnn|last2=Fanning|first2=Brad|title=Royals catcher Salvy Perez's post-game celebrations make big splash|url=http://www.kctv5.com/story/29568919/royals-catcher-salvy-perezs-post-game-celebrations-make-big-splash|website=kctv5.com|publisher=KCTV|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rittman|first1=Emily|last2=Pimentel|first2=Donovan|title=Perez's Gatorade baths are keeping one dry cleaner busy|url=http://www.kctv5.com/story/30226435/perezs-gatorade-baths-are-keeping-one-dry-cleaner-busy|website=kctv5.com|publisher=KCTV|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torres|first1=Maria|title=Four years of the Salvy Splash: How one Gatorade bath became part of Royals fan lore|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/mlb/kansas-city-royals/article175289156.html|work=The Kansas City Star|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other times, baseball players receive a [[cream pie]] to the face in lieu of a Gatorade shower.

The [[Australia]]n [[National Rugby League|NRL]] rugby league club [[Melbourne Storm]]'s players have given their coach, [[Craig Bellamy (rugby league)|Craig Bellamy]], a Gatorade shower every time they have won the premiership under him, including in [[2007 NRL grand final|2007]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batemansbaypost.com.au/news/local/sport/rugby-league/crosss-night-of-triumph/683365.aspx|title=Cross’s night of triumph|first=JOSH|last=GIDNEY|date=3 October 2007|website=batemansbaypost.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2009 NRL grand final|2009]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/bellamy-i-have-got-my-satisfaction/story-e6frfgbo-1225783050202|title=Bellamy - I have got my satisfaction|website=heraldsun.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2012 NRL grand final|2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/10/01/wiz-bellamy-nrls-master-coach/|title=WIZ: Bellamy NRL’s master coach|date=1 October 2012|website=theroar.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Australian Football League|AFL]], players are customarily given a shower if they win in their first game with their club.

In [[cricket]] the [[Australian cricket team]] players gave their coach [[Darren Lehmann]] a Gatorade shower on two occasions, during post celebrations after his team won the [[2013-14 Ashes series]] and during a post match interview after the [[2015 Cricket World Cup Final]].

In 2016, the coach of Brazilian team [[SE Palmeiras]] received a Gatorade Shower during his first interview after receiving the 2016 [[Brasileirão]] title, also was the first time known that someone received a Gatorade shower in first division of Brazilian soccer &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/esporteinterativo/videos/10156075590913504|title=Esporte Interativo|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ,the team did again after 2018 title.

==Variations==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
Many teams do not use Gatorade but instead use water or another substitute; for example, the [[Florida State Seminoles]] use [[Powerade]], due to their sponsorship agreement with Powerade manufacturer [[The Coca-Cola Company]] and Gatorade's affiliation with rival [[University of Florida]]. After [[Michigan State University]]'s win over Penn State in 2010, Spartan players dumped a Gatorade bucket filled with green and white confetti on head coach [[Mark Dantonio]]. This was done because of the cold temperature and Dantonio's heart condition.

The tradition has become a mainstay of the Super Bowl; so much so that numerous gambling websites have established various '[[Proposition bet|prop bets]]' on situations during the game.

As the tradition has evolved, not all showers are reserved for championship games.  Gatorade showers have occurred after key victories that were not championship games, after the defeat of a rival, after the snapping of a losing streak, or after the snapping of an opponent's winning streak.

Generally, it happens during an interview. Sometimes, the "victim" is the journalist. Another variation is shaving cream on the face, with a towel.

==Tradition documented==
In 2005, [[ESPN]] sports business writer Darren Rovell published a book entitled ''First in Thirst: How Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat into a Cultural Phenomenon'', in which he documented, among other things, the story behind the Gatorade dunking phenomenon.&lt;ref name=rovell&gt;{{cite book|last=Rovell|first=Darren|title=First in thirst: how Gatorade turned the science of sweat into a cultural phenomenon|year=2006|publisher=AMACOM Books|pages=77–91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNJIXCE7cSkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hand sack''' is any sack or similar object, typically made of [[cloth]] and filled with sand or a similar material, that is tossed on the back of the hand in a variety of games.

==Origin==
Hand sack originates from the lighter game, a game often played on college campuses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Lighter game founded in the greater Burlington Vermont area in the early 90's which spread to the music festival scene and on to college campuses nationwide.

A '''HangBoard''' is a device used in the snow sport of hangboarding.

HangBoard development began in 2001, invented by Canadian [[Don Arney]]. Others involved in the development process were Canadian designer Peter Brooke and American designer Charles Buchwald, and Canadian snowboard and mountain biking champion Everest MacDonald.

A HangBoard bolts to a standard [[snowboard]] in place of bindings, and the pilot — wearing a harness — hangs from a T-shaped bar. Arms push against handlebars in the front, and feet clamp into rudders at the back.  Most control occurs by weight shifting, but pilots can also achieve directional control by using the foot rudders.  Applied simultaneously, the rudders function as brakes.  The HangBoard frame is made of aircraft aluminum, weighs less than 11&amp;nbsp;kg without the snowboard, and measures {{convert|160|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|32|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} high when folded up, and {{convert|47|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide.

HangBoard pilots ride the [[ski lift]]s and descend the mountains like skiers and snowboarders. When loading onto a ski lift, the chair catches the upper part of the HangBoard, which then rests on the seat beside the pilot. A tether ensures the board cannot escape the lift.
When departing the lift, the pilot holds onto the HangBoard's upper frame.

An '''illegal sport''' is any [[sport]] that is illegal in one or more jurisdictions due to the violent or dangerous nature of the sport. Well-known illegal sports, such as cockfighting and dogfighting, are barred on the basis of animal abuse.

Illegal sports are controversial due to the dangerous aspects attributed to them and the pain they can inflict on humans or animals. They also are controversial due to the perceived nature of some of them — notably dogfighting — as being savage sports.

==Cockfighting==
[[Cockfighting]] is a gambling and spectator sport where roosters fight, frequently to the death, in rings, while players place bets on which rooster will win. Often, sharp implements are attached to the legs of the birds, inflicting massive injuries and pain.&lt;ref name="idausa"&gt;[http://www.idausa.org/facts/fighting.html Animal Fighting]. Idausa.org. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The birds used for cockfighting sometimes are given stimulant drugs to enhance their fighting ability and make them more aggressive.&lt;ref name="idausa" /&gt;

According to the [[Humane Society of the United States]], cockfighting is illegal (at least a misdemeanor) in all fifty US states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/cockfighting/ Cockfighting : The Humane Society of the United States]. Humanesociety.org. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; It is classified as a felony in 39 states. Notable states that have less severe laws are Alabama, Hawaii, Idaho, and Mississippi (misdemeanor punishment for cockfighting; no punishment for possessing cock or being a spectator); South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, and Kentucky (misdemeanor punishment for cockfighting, no punishment for possessing cocks, misdemeanor punishment for being a spectator).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/animal_fighting/cockfighting_statelaws.pdf Cockfighting: State Laws], The Humane Society of the United States, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Frank Keating of Oklahoma said when outlawing [[cockfight]]ing in his state that "Cockfighting is cruel, it promotes illegal gambling and it is simply embarrassing to Oklahoma to be seen as one of only a tiny handful of locations outside of the third world where this activity is legal." Since there is no reliable data on the status of cockfighting in the third world, it is assumed that cockfighting is largely legal, unpopular, or laws against it are unenforced amongst these nations.&lt;ref name="idausa" /&gt;

==Dogfighting==
[[Dog fighting]] is a practice, illegal in many jurisdictions, where two dogs, often a [[molosser]] breed, are put into an area to fight and sometimes kill each other. Dog fighting has been reported as far back as AD 43 when the Romans invaded Britain. Both sides employed fighting dogs, and out of their wartime use grew a sport, which achieved great popularity, particular in Britain and later the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12104472 Illegal Dogfighting Rings Thrive in U.S. Cities]. NPR. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogfighting can involve high stakes, and carries with it the same sociological dangers of other gambling, and particularly illegal gambling, activities.

The [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] focuses heavily on the issue on dog fighting. There are various levels of dog fighting. There is “street” level, which means that the dogfights are informal because strict rules and regulations are absent from the matches. Another level is “hobbyists”, which are fights that are formally organized. They are mainly scheduled for income and speculators. The final level of dog fighting is “professional.” At the professional level, owners usually have more that fifty fighting dogs and carefully examine the specific breed, lineage, and winning history of each dog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspca.org/fight-animal-cruelty/dog-fighting/dog-fighting-faq.aspx Dog Fighting FAQ]. ASPCA. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dog fighting is illegal in every U.S. state and in many countries around the world (Britain, where it was quite popular, banned it as far back as the 1830s), although enforcement in other countries is frequently lax or nonexistent. Dog fighting is a felony in all states except Idaho and Wyoming, where it's a misdemeanor. It is a felony to possess dogs for fighting except in the states of New York, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/d/dog-fighting/ Dog Fighting Law &amp; Legal Definition].

==Street Racing==
[[Street racing]] is the frequently illegal racing of motor vehicles on public roads and highways. These high-speed races, usually with untrained drivers, can result in fatal crashes that have the capacity to inflict damage on innocent people not participating in the race. In 2006, California state highway patrol issued 697 citations for "speed contests". There is no official statistic kept on street racing deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2008-01-22/us/street.racing_1_illegal-street-teen-bicyclist-racers/2?_s=PM:US Addicted to the rush of the race – Page 2 – CNN].

==BASE jumping==
BASE jumping is a form of skydiving from buildings. The sport is illegal in almost all cities, because the jumper risks seriously injuring himself and pedestrians or motorists when he lands. In many cases, BASE jumpers illegally access the high points from which they're jumping by breaking and entering or trespassing. Two BASE jumpers were arrested in St. Petersburg, Russia after jumping off of the Cathedral of the Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul in November 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">A '''leisure centre''' in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Australia]] (also called aquatic centres) and [[Canada]] is a  purpose built building or site, usually owned and operated by the [[city]], [[borough council]] or municipal district [[Non-metropolitan district|council]], where people go to keep fit or relax through using the facilities.

== Typical facilities ==
Facilities may include a [[swimming pool]] (many with water slide), large sports hall, [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts, [[cafeteria]], licensed bar, fitness suite, [[aerobics]] studios, outdoor grass and/or artificial pitches for [[football (soccer)]], [[hockey]] etc., a [[sunroom#Solarium|solarium]], [[sauna]] and/or [[steam room]].

Leisure centres Canada are staffed by leisure centre attendants employed by the local council.  They carry out a range of tasks to help and supervise people using leisure centre facilities and act as swimming pool life guards, gym instructors and coaches offering advice, motivation and expertise to users. Many of its functions may overlap with that of a [[community centre]].

Leisure centres are also popular in Australia, where they are mostly privately operated but Government funded. In that country they are often also called Recreation Centres, or most commonly Aquatic Centres due to the swimming facilities being the most popular facility that is available. 

In some areas of the UK and Canada (such as [[Calgary]]) these services are now operated by private companies on contract to the local authority.

Most towns in the UK are now introducing leisure facilities for the local community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18275">{{ For|the 2002 film|The Slaughter Rule}}
A '''mercy rule''',  '''slaughter rule''', '''knockout rule''', or '''skunk rule''' ends a two-competitor [[sports competition]] earlier than the scheduled endpoint if one competitor has a very large and presumably insurmountable [[Score (sport)|scoring]] lead over the other. It is called the ''mercy'' rule because it spares further humiliation for the loser. It is common in [[youth sports]] in [[North America]], where [[running up the score]] is considered unsporting. It is especially common in  [[baseball]] and [[softball]] in which there is no [[game clock]] and a dominant team could in theory continue an [[inning]] endlessly.

The rules vary widely, depending on the level of competition, but nearly all [[youth sports]] leagues and [[high school sports]] associations and many [[college sports]] associations in the United States have mercy rules for sports including baseball, softball, American football and association football.

However, mercy rules usually do not take effect until a prescribed point in the game (like the second half of an association football game). Thus, one team, particularly if it is decidedly better than a weaker opponent, can still "run up the score" before the rule takes effect. For instance, in [[American football]], one team could be ahead by 70 points with three minutes left in the first half; in baseball, the better team could have a 20-run lead in the second inning, but the game would still continue.

==Baseball and softball==
International competitions are sanctioned by the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]] (WBSC), formed by the 2013 merger of the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF) and [[International Softball Federation]] (ISF).

In international baseball competition and the [[World Baseball Classic]] (WBC), games are ended when one team is ahead by 10 runs, once at least seven completed innings are played by the trailing team. In women's competition, the same applies after five innings of a seven-inning game.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Baseball Federation]] (2008). [http://s29178.gridserver.com/pdf/International_Rules_ENG.pdf IBAF Official Competitions Technical/Organisational Norms - Valid only for 2008]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Rule C7.8, "Run difference Rule". Accessed on 2008-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2006 World Baseball Classic|inaugural WBC]] in 2006 followed the IBAF mercy rule, with an additional rule stopping a game after five innings when a team is ahead by at least 15 runs.&lt;ref&gt;World Baseball Classic, Inc. [http://ww2.worldbaseballclassic.com/2006/about/index.jsp?sid=wbc 2006 World Baseball Classic: FAQ]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Accessed on 2008-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The mercy rules applied to the round-robin (now double-elimination) matches only, not to the semi-finals or final.

In a six-inning game such as [[Little League Baseball|Little League Baseball and Softball]], rules call for the game to end if the winning team is ahead by 15 runs after three innings played or 10 runs after four innings played by the trailing team.

Softball rules are different for fast/modified fast pitch and slow pitch. In WBSC-sanctioned competitions, the run ahead rule (the WBSC terminology) is, for fast or modified fast pitch, 20 runs after three innings, 15 after four, or 7 after 5. In slow pitch, the margin is 20 runs after four innings or 15 after five.&lt;ref name=ISF&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[International Softball Federation]] |author=International Softball Federation Playing Rules Committee |url=http://www.internationalsoftball.com/english/rules_standards/Rulebook_2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Official Rules of Softball (Revised 2005) Rule 5, Sec. 5, "Run Ahead Rule" |accessdate=2008-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218104659/http://www.internationalsoftball.com/english/rules_standards/Rulebook_2002.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NCAA has also adopted the rule.

In regular season or conference tournament [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] college baseball, the IBAF rule may be implemented. Most NCAA conferences limit the rule to the final day of a series, for travel reasons, or primarily during conference tournaments where four to five games are played in a day, in order to allow the next game to start. The rule is not allowed in NCAA tournament play (regionals, super regionals and College World Series), in which all games must be at least nine innings.

In NCAA softball, the rule is invoked if one team is ahead by at least eight runs after five innings and, unlike with college baseball, applies in the NCAA tournament as well with the exception of the championship series. In American high school softball, most states use a mercy rule of 20 runs ahead in three innings or 10 in five innings. (In either case, if the home team is ahead by the requisite number of runs, the game will end after the top half of the inning.)

Most state high school associations (where games are seven innings) use the IBAF Women's rule after five innings have been played by the trailing team; some associations further the rule by ending a game after either three or four innings if the lead is at least 15 runs. For softball, the rule is 12 after three innings and 10 after five. However, since the home team has the last at-bat, the rules usually allow visiting teams to score an unlimited number of runs in the top half of an inning. That can be prevented by invoking the rule only after the home team has completed its half of the inning.

Due to the untimed nature of innings, some leagues either impose caps on the number of runs that can be scored in one inning (usually in the 4-8 range) or limit the number of plate appearances in an inning (typically, such a limit will consist of one rotation of the batting order).  Such rules ensure that games will complete in a reasonable length of time, but it can also mean that a lead of a certain size becomes insurmountable by the cap, which can be prevented by not invoking the rule in such circumstances.

== American football ==

===Middle and high school football===
At the middle- or high-school level, 34 states use a mercy rule that may involve a "continuous clock" (the clock continues to operate on most plays when the clock would normally stop, such as an incomplete pass) once a team has a certain lead (for example, 35 points) during the second half. That greatly decreases the amount of time taken for a game to complete, which reduces the leading team's chances to score more and the time that the trailing team must spend in facing an insurmountable deficit. In most states, the clock stops only for scores, timeouts (officials', injury, or charged), or the end of the quarter. Plays that would normally stop the clock, such as penalties, incomplete passes, going out of bounds, or change of possession, would not stop the clock. The rule varies by state; for example, the clock does not stop upon a score in Colorado, [[Kansas State High School Activities Association|Kansas]] (regular-season games only), or [[Missouri State High School Activities Association|Missouri]] (fourth quarter only). 

In most states, once the point differential is reduced to below the mercy rule-invoking amount, normal timing procedures resume until either the end of the game or the mercy rule-invoking point differential is re-established; in Colorado and Kansas, the clock continues to run even if the differential falls below the threshold. Most states that have mercy rules waive this rule for a championship game.

In some states, coaches and game officials may choose to end a game at their own discretion at any time during the second half if the continuous clock rule is in effect; that usually happens if a lopsided margin continues to increase or if threatening weather is imminent. Sometimes the coach of the team that is losing agrees to shorten the length of a quarter in addition to the continuous clock rule. Although it is rare, some states or high school conferences have rules in which the team with a very large lead may not run a certain play for the rest of the game, such as a deep pass or outside run.

In some states (where [[Eight-man football|8-man]] and [[Six-man football|6-man football]] is widely used), the rules call for a game to end when one team is ahead by a certain score (like 45 or 50 points) at halftime or any time thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfhs.org/core/contentmanager/uploads/2007MERCYRULE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921023325/http://www.nfhs.org/core/contentmanager/uploads/2007MERCYRULE.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other states with 6- or 8-man football, continuous clock rules are used, and the rule may be modified; for instance, in Iowa, the rule goes into effect if the 35-point differential is reached at any time after the first quarter.

In a variant on the mercy rule used in [[Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference|Connecticut high school football]] from 2006 to 2016, the team's coach was issued a one-game suspension (i.e., for the team's next game) if at any point the team had a 50-point lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/20160627/ciac-eliminates-50-point-rule-in-high-school-football|title=CIAC eliminates 50-point rule in high school football|last=Poole|first=Owen|work=The Bulletin|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it was replaced with a running clock rule.

===College football===
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s mercy rule provides,  "Any time during the game, the playing time of any remaining period or periods and the intermission between halves may be shortened by mutual agreement of the opposing head coaches and the referee." (NCAA Football Rule 3-2-2-a)&lt;ref&gt;http://amarefs.org/FR16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; NCAA Football Approved Ruling 3-2-2-I cites an example: "At halftime the score is 56–0. The coaches and the referee agree that the third and fourth quarters should be shortened to 12 minutes each. The coaches also request that the second half be played with a 'running clock' i.e., that the game clock not be stopped." The NCAA Football Rules Committee determined, "The remaining quarters may be shortened to 12 minutes each. However, the 'running clock' is not allowed; normal clock rules apply for the entire game." &lt;ref&gt;http://amarefs.org/FR16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent example of an NCAA football game shortened by invoking this rule occurred September 1, 2018 during a game Georgia played against Austin Peay in Athens Georgia.  With the score 45-0 in the 3rd quarter and a high heat index, the Austin Peay Coach Will Healy suggested to Georgia head coach Kirby Smart that they play a 10 minute fourth quarter instead of the typical 15 minute fourth quarter.  The coaches and referee agreed and the game was shortened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ajc.com/sports/georgia-opens-season-with-rout-austin-peay/oRmlUq5gQFE8rwmdsGHQ2K/|title=Georgia opens its season with a rout of Austin Peay|work=ajc|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

September 24, 2016 the [[2016 Missouri Tigers football team|Missouri Tigers]] led [[2016 Delaware State Hornets football team|Delaware State]] 58–0 at halftime. The coaches agreed to shorten the third and fourth quarters from 15 minutes to 10 minutes each, shortening the total game time from 60 minutes to 50 minutes. Missouri added three touchdowns in the abbreviated second half to make the final score 79–0, setting team records for the most points scored in a game (79), the greatest margin of victory (79), and the largest number of touchdowns scored (11). (Missouri would have scored 80 points, but it had missed an extra point early in the game).

Also in 2016, the game between [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] and [[2016 South Carolina State Bulldogs football team|South Carolina State]] had both the third and fourth quarters shortened from 15 minutes to 12 as a result of  Clemson leading the game at half 45-0.  The final score of the game was 59-0. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-college-football-shortening-games-spt-20160918-story.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in 2016, the game between [[2016 Texas State Bobcats football team|Texas State]] and [[2016 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]] saw the fourth quarter shortened to 10 minutes when severe thunderstorms were approaching [[Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium]]. Arkansas led 42–3 at the end of the third quarter, and the final period was scoreless.  A similar scenario took place in 2017 in the game between [[2017 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] and [[2017 Kansas Jayhawks football team|Kansas]], where the coaches agreed to a running clock for the final 12:49 of the game due to severe thunderstorms approaching [[Amon G. Carter Stadium]].

In a 2013 game, [[2013 Old Dominion Monarchs football team|Old Dominion University]] (ODU) was losing to the [[2013 North Carolina Tar Heels football team|University of North Carolina]] (UNC) 80–20 when ODU coach [[Bobby Wilder]] asked for the fourth quarter to be shortened by five minutes, which UNC coach [[Larry Fedora]] agreed to. Fedora also directed his quarterback to take a knee on fourth and goal with 1:53 remaining to not run up the score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tarheels score 80 in 3 quarters|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1862918-old-dominion-vs-north-carolina-shortened-as-tar-heels-score-80-in-3-quarters/|work=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 game, [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas Jayhawks]] coach [[Glen Mason]] asked if a running clock could be used after his team trailed 49–0 at halftime to the [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn Tigers]]. Auburn coach [[Pat Dye]] and the officials agreed, and Auburn ended up a 56–7 winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1004441/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Look, Toto! | date=1992-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the NCAA Football Rules Committee's subsequent ruling (A.R. 3-2-2-I) that a "running clock" is not permitted, a continuous clock was used September 5, 2013, beginning in the fourth quarter when the [[2013 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] had a 63–0 lead against the [[2013 Elon Phoenix football team|Elon Phoenix]]. That was at the request of Elon coach [[Jason Swepson]] and agreed upon by Georgia Tech coach [[Paul Johnson (American football coach)|Paul Johnson]]. Georgia Tech won the game 70–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sugiura|first=Ken|title=Johnson on Duke, Elon, no-huddle|url=http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/georgia-tech/2013/sep/04/johnson-duke-elon-no-huddle/|work=The Atlanta Journal Constitution|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the Mississippi Association of Community and Junior Colleges, a running clock is allowed if the team is ahead by 38 points or more. This rule was instituted in 2013.

==Amateur boxing==
If a boxer trails by more than 20 points, the referee stops the fight and the boxer that is leading automatically wins; bouts which end this way may be noted as "RSC" (referee stopped contest) with notations for an outclassed opponent (RSCO), outscored opponent (RSCOS), injury (RSCI) or head injury (RSCH).

While a boxer who loses on the mercy rule is scored RSCO and would be similar to a technical [[knockout]] in [[professional boxing]], it is not scored a loss by knockout, and the 28-day suspension for losing on a knockout does not apply.

==Association football (soccer)==
[[International Blind Sports Federation]] rules require that any time during a game in which one team has scored ten (10) more goals than the other team that game is deemed completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibsa.es/eng/deportes/goalball/IBSA%20Goalball%20Rules%202006-2010.txt International Blind Sports Federation: Goalball Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712075230/http://www.ibsa.es/eng/deportes/goalball/IBSA%20Goalball%20Rules%202006-2010.txt |date=2007-07-12 }} Section 17.7&lt;/ref&gt; In US high school soccer, most states use a mercy rule that ends the game if one team is ahead by 10 or more goals at any point from halftime onward. Youth soccer leagues use variations on the rule.

==Basketball==
In high school basketball, many states have a "continuous clock" rule, similar to American football, which takes effect in the second half after a lead grows to a prescribed point (in Iowa, 35 points or more; in Kansas, 30 points or more but only in the fourth quarter). The clock stops only for charged, officials' or injury time-outs; or at the end of the third quarter. The clock would not stop when would normally stop, such as for fouls, free throws, out-of-bounds plays or substitutions.

The rules vary when normal timing procedures take effect after a lead is diminished (such as because of the trailing team's rally); for instance, in Iowa, normal timing procedures are enforced if the lead is lowered to 25 points but re-instituted once the lead grows back to 35 or more points. By comparison, in Kansas, if the running clock is triggered, it will not stop except for a timeout or an injury even if the differential is reduced to under 30 points. As with other sports, some states offer provisions to allow a team to end the game early by mutual decision of the coaches (for instance, if a large lead continues to grow and the talent disparity is obvious).

==Collegiate wrestling==
In American [[collegiate wrestling]] and high school wrestling, a wrestler wins by [[technical fall]], and the match ends, if he builds a 15-point lead. If a wrestler gains a 15-point lead by having his opponent in a near-fall, the referee will allow the offensive wrestler the opportunity to win by fall without liability to be reversed and pinned. The bout ends when a fall is awarded or the near-fall ends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32797">A '''national sport''' is considered to be an intrinsic part of the culture of a [[nation]]. Some sports are ''[[de facto]]'' (not established by law) national sports, as [[baseball]] is in the [[United States]] and [[Gaelic games]] are in the [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], while others  are  ''[[de jure]]'' (established by law) national sports, as [[lacrosse]] and [[ice hockey]] are in [[Canada]]. These sports do not have to be necessarily the most played or most followed, which would be either [[association football]] or [[cricket]] in all but a few countries are widely considered to be important to the significant for its culture.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2016}}
'''No goal''' is a call made by [[referee]]s in various [[Goal (sport)|goal]]-scoring sports ([[soccer|football]], [[hockey]], [[lacrosse]], etc.) to indicate that a goal has not been scored. It is commonly used to disallow an apparent goal, such as when the ball or puck has entered the net but should not count as a score due to some foul or infraction.

Because the decision often depends on a subjective assessment by the referee, and especially if the score might be critical, such calls can be hotly contested. For fans of one of the teams involved, it may thus refer to a goal that was actually disallowed, or one that in their opinion should have been disallowed, but was not. As a result, in recent years most professional sports leagues have implicated protocol allowing for such calls to be subject to video review or to be reviewed because of a [[coach's challenge]].

== National Hockey League (NHL) ==
In the [[NHL]] a goal may be called a no goal for the following reasons: 
# When the puck has been directed, batted or thrown into the net by an attacking player other than with a stick.
# (ii)  When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion.
# (iii)  When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official.
# (iv)  When a goal has been scored and an ineligible player is on the ice.
# (v)  When an attacking player has interfered with a goalkeeper in his goal crease.
# (vi)  When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor. See 38.4(vi).
# (vii)  When video review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed.
# (viii)  When a Linesman reports a double-minor penalty for high-sticking, a major penalty or a match penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending team, the goal must be disallowed and the appropriate penalty assessed.
# (ix)  When a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save. See also 69.6.
# (x)  When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal.
# (xi)  During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending team cannot score unless the non-offending team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending player or any physical action by an offending player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending team.
# (xii)  When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if he had not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing his whistle.
# (xiii) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2014-2015-rulebook.pdf|title=NHL Rulebook Rule 78.5|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Lacrosse League (NLL) ==
According to the [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]] rulebook (Rule 55: No Goal) a goal may be disallowed under the following conditions:

# (55.1) When the ball passes through the plane of the net after the game clock’s horn or shot clock has sounded to indicate the end of a quarter or overtime period or expiration of the shot clock.
# (55.2) A crease violation will result in a no goal. Crease violation is rule 69.
# (55.3) When the ball passes through the plane of the goal when the attacking team has too many players on the floor including those in the penalty box at the time of the play.
# (55.4) When the ball passes through the plane of the goal after one of the officials has sounded his whistle for any reason, including the sounding of an inadvertent whistle.
# (55.5) When the player makes contact with the goalie. See Contact While Shooting on Net Rule 69.
# (55.6)  When the ball passes through the plane of the goal from a stick that is found to be illegal by a stick check.
# (55.7)  When the ball is kicked in a kicking motion directly or indirectly into the opponent’s goal.
# (55.8)  When the ball is directed into the net off the free hand of an opponent.
# (55.9)  When a ball is lodged, or not, in the throat of the pocket and the ball and stick is inadvertently or deliberately tossed into the goal.
# (55.10) In the event that a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net by his teammate on his own accord and the ball crosses the goal line after making the stop, the goal will be allowed. In the event that a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net by an opponent and the ball crosses the goal line after making the stop, the goal will be disallowed. The plays are subject to any appropriate penalties.
# (55.11) If the ball is loose in the crease an opposing  player may not direct the ball into the goal. If the ball is loose in the crease, an opposing player must have possession prior to any scoring attempt. A no goal shall be called if the ball is loose in the crease, directed by an opposing player and having the ball make contact with the goalie or a defender prior to the ball going into the net.
# (55.12) If a goal is scored when an ineligible player is on the floor, the goal will be disallowed. The ineligible player will be removed from the game and the club shall not be able to substitute another player on its roster. An ineligible player is a player who had been previously ejected from the game, and subject to league discipline.
# (55.13) If a goal is scored when the attackers’ stick head is behind the goal line extended when releasing the ball during the act of shooting, the goal will be disallowed.
# (55.14) If a player takes a shot and the head of his stick comes off and the ball enters the goal, the goal would be disallowed and the ball awarded to the goalie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/nllassets/2016+NLL+Rulebook.pdf|title=NLL Rulebook Rule 55|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
In [[Singapore]], pupils from primary school through junior colleges are required to have two hours of PE every week, except during examination periods. Pupils may play games like [[soccer|football]], [[badminton]], [[captain ball]], and [[basketball]] during most sessions. Unorthodox sports such as [[fencing]], and [[skateboarding]] are occasionally played. In more prestigious secondary schools and in junior colleges, sports such as [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[marksmanship|shooting]], and [[squash (sport)|squash]] are played. (This paragraph needs to be cited. Where is this information from?)  

An Biennial compulsory fitness exam, NAPFA, is conducted in every school to assess pupils' physical fitness in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/napfa-fitness-test-education-tool|title=Napfa: From fitness test to education tool|work=AsiaOne|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a series of fitness tests (pull-ups/inclined pull-ups for girls, standing broad jump, sit-ups, sit-and-reach and 1.6&amp;nbsp;km for primary [10- to 12-year-olds]/2.4&amp;nbsp;km for secondary and junior college levels [13- to 18-year-olds]). Students are graded by gold, silver, or bronze, or as fail. NAPFA for pre-enlistees serves as an indicator for an additional two months in the country's compulsory national service if they attain bronze or fail.

In [[Malaysia]], pupils from primary schools to secondary schools are expected to do two periods or one hour of PE throughout the year except a week before [[Test (assessment)|examinations]]. In most [[secondary schools]], games like badminton, [[sepak takraw]], [[association football|football]], [[netball]], basketball and tennis are available. Pupils may bring their own sports equipment to the school with the authorization of the teacher. (Again, citation needed for this paragraph. Where is this information from?) 

In the [[Philippines]], PE is mandatory for all years, unless the school gives the option for a student to do the [[Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme]] instead for fifth and sixth year. Some schools have integrated martial arts training into their physical education curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visayandailystar.com/2008/September/27/sportnews1.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930151303/http://www.visayandailystar.com/2008/September/27/sportnews1.htm |date=September 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garimot.com/articles/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523121915/http://www.garimot.com/articles/index.html |date=May 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imafp.com/Chapters/IMAFP_commissions/IMAFP_mindanao.htm |title=Regional Commissions and Chapters International Modern Arnis Federation Philippines Mindanao Commission |publisher=Imafp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindanaotimes.com.ph/story.php?id=22801 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115150606/http://www.mindanaotimes.com.ph/story.php?id=22801 |date=January 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/sim/sim/view/20081214-177923/Life-Lessons-from-Karate |title=Sunday Inquirer Magazine: Life Lessons from Karate |publisher=Showbizandstyle.inquirer.net |date=2008-12-14 |accessdate=2010-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304154557/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/sim/sim/view/20081214-177923/Life-Lessons-from-Karate |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SMATrinitasORBenteng.JPG|thumb|Indonesian high school students playing the traditional game "Benteng"]]
In [[Indonesia]], students ranging from [[kindergarten]] to [[high school]] have PE integrated with their curriculum. Kindergarten through grade 3 students have [[gymnastics]]. Starting from Grade 4, students are introduced to traditional martial arts [[Pencak Silat]] and some team games such as badminton, football, futsal, rounders, and basketball. Starting from [[junior high school]], games such as basketball, volleyball, cricket, tennis, badminton, kho kho, and kabaddi are played. Drills and physical training are taught.

In Bhutan, the inclusion of Health and Physical Education in the school curriculum was formally endorsed during the 7th CAPSD Board Meeting in 1997. A series of pilot tests were conducted in primary schools from 1998 to 1999. Since the pilot tests were very successful, HPE was introduced as a formal teaching subject in all the primary schools from the year 2000.

In 2007, a set of revised curriculum books, consisting of a curriculum framework and eight activity books, were developed for use from 2009 academic session.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], physical education was first made an important part of the curriculum in government primary and secondary schools in 1981. The policy was outlined in a Ministerial Statement to the Victorian Legislative Assembly by the Minister for Educational Services, [[Norman Lacy]] MP on 17 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/MinisterialStatementOnNewDirectionsInPhysicalEducation#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Ministerial Statement on New Directions in Physical Education |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the goal of physical education is to "develop physically literate individuals who have the knowledge, skills and confidence to enjoy a lifetime of healthful physical activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shape America Home Page|url = http://www.shapeamerica.org|website = www.shapeamerica.org|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero Hour is a before-school physical education class first implemented by [[Naperville Central High School]]. In the state of [[Illinois]] this program is known as Learning Readiness P.E. (LRPE). It was based on research indicating that [[student]]s who are physically fit are more [[academics|academically]] alert and experience growth in [[brain cell]]s or enhancement in [[brain]] development. NCHS pairs a PE class that incorporates [[cardiovascular exercise]], [[core strength]] training, cross lateral movements, and [[literacy]] and [[math]] strategies with literacy and math classes that utilize movement to enhance [[learning]] and improve achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Enhancing P.E. in Illinois, http://iphionline.org/pdf/P.E._Case_Study_Naperville.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In British Columbia, Canada, the government has stated in the grade one curriculum that students must participate in physical activity daily five times a week. The teacher is also responsible for planning Daily Physical Activity (DPA), which is thirty minutes of mild to moderate physical activity a day, not including curriculum physical education classes. The curriculum requires students in grade one to be knowledgeable about healthy living. For example, they must be able to describe benefits of regular exercise, identify healthy choices that require them to be more physically active, and describe the importance of choosing healthy food.&lt;ref&gt;BC curriculum package&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=June 2018}} &lt;!-- Not a strong source for this information. See actual curriculum documents for more reliable information regarding what students are learning.  --&gt;

Ontario, Canada has a similar procedure in place. On October 6, 2005 the Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) implemented a Daily Physical Activity policy in elementary schools, grades 1–8. It requires that all students in grades 1 to 8, including those with special needs, be provided with opportunities to participate in a minimum of twenty minutes of sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity each school day during instructional time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teachers/dpa1-3.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212025619/http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teachers/dpa1-3.pdf |date=December 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many factors that contribute to the ease of implementing and sustaining a quality program, including the involvement of the administration, parents, and community. However, it ultimately comes down to the willingness of the physical education teacher(s) to do their best no matter the situation &lt;ref&gt;The Importance of Physical Education https://www.supportrealteachers.org/the-importance-of-quality-physical-education.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwiJncBRC1ARIsAOvG-a5DFCcyvtwvTO6TWrGWTlSx7w1mmTqLbz4jFcQRk2MNf73vNIItQS8aAvUSEALw_wcB&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Portugal]], pupils from primary school can optionally join PE as an extra-curricular activity. From middle school to secondary school, pupils must participate in PE classes for two hours per week.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[Scotland]] has is a government supported requirement of a minimum of two hours of quality PE in primary and two periods (50 minutes each) in secondary S1 to S4. Recent funding has ensured most local authorities have employed PE lead officers to support the requirement. In fifth and sixth year, PE is voluntary in that personalisation and choice must be considered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In [[England]], pupils are expected to do two hours of PE a week in year 7, 8 and 9 and at least one in year 10 and 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National curriculum in England: physical education programmes of study|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-physical-education-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-physical-education-programmes-of-study|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=24 November 2016}} [[File:UKOpenGovernmentLicence.svg|50px]] This content is available under the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/  Open Government Licence v3.0]. © Crown copyright.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sweden]] it differs from municipality to municipality but generally, year 0 to 2 has 55 minutes PE a week. Year 3 to 6 has 110 minutes a week and year 7-9 has 220 minutes. In upper secondary school, all national programs have an obligatory course, Idrott och hälsa 1, containing 100 points of PE, which corresponds to 90-100 hours of PE during the course. (One point should be one hour, but due to holidays this isn't true.) The schools can spend these hours as they like during the three years students attend. Most schools put this course during the first year and offer the follow-up course, Idrott och hälsa 2, which also contains 100 points.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}


In Ireland, you are expected to do 2 Classes worth of P.E.(80 Minutes)This also includes Shower and Changing Times, so averagely 60-65 minutes outside.

==Trends==
{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Corta-Mato Escolar 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Young [[Portugal|Portuguese]] children participating in a school race]]
Physical education [[fad|trends]] have developed recently{{when|date=March 2014}} to incorporate a greater variety of activities besides typical [[sports]]. Introducing students to activities like [[bowling]], [[walking]]/[[hiking]], or [[frisbee]] at an early age can help them develop good activity habits that will continue into adulthood. 

Some [[teacher]]s have begun to incorporate stress-reduction techniques such as [[yoga]], deep breathing and [[tai chi]]. Tai chi, an ancient martial arts form focused on slow meditative movements, is a relaxation activity with many benefits. Studies have shown that it enhances muscular strength and endurance, as well as cardiovascular endurance. It also provides psychological benefits such as improving general mental health, concentration, awareness and positive mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tai Chi for Mental Health {{!}} Psych Central News|url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2010/05/24/tai-chi-for-mental-health/14015.html|website=Psych Central News|date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be taught to any age student with little or no equipment, making it ideal for mixed ability and age classes. Tai chi can easily be incorporated into a holistic learning body and mind unit.&lt;ref&gt;Lu C. (2007 {{full citation needed|date=February 2017}})&lt;/ref&gt; 

Teaching non-traditional sports may also provide motivation for students to increase their activity, and can help them learn about different cultures. For example, while learning about [[lacrosse]] in the Southwestern United States, students might also learn about the Native American cultures of the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada, where the sport originated. Teaching non-traditional (or non-native) sports provides an opportunity to integrate academic concepts from other subjects as well, which may now be required of many PE teachers.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

PE is very important to students' health and overall well-being. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] stated that over the past three years{{when|date=June 2018}} obesity in children (ages 2–5) and adolescents (ages 12–19) has doubled because of diet and lack of activity. Since the 1970s the number of children who are obese has tripled.&lt;ref&gt;The Importance of Physical Education. (n.d.). Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://www.veanea.org/home/1000.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Jf;fhjk;sfdbkdfl'b.jpg|thumbnail]]

SHAPE America's National Standards &amp; Grade-Level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education define what a student should know and be able to do as result of an effective physical education program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shapeamerica.org/standards/pe/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend is the incorporation of [[health]] and [[nutrition]] into the physical education curriculum. The [[Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004]] required that all school districts with a federally-funded school meal program develop wellness policies that address nutrition and physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Pangrazi, Robert (2007) "Dynamic Physical Education for Elementary School Children" 15th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching students sports and movement skills, PE teachers are now incorporating short health and nutrition lessons into the curriculum. This is more prevalent at the elementary school level, where students do not have a specific Health class. Recently most elementary schools have specific health classes for students as well as physical education class. Due to the recent outbreaks of diseases such as swine flu, school districts are making it mandatory for students to learn about practicing good hygiene along with other health topics.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Today many states require Physical Education teachers to be certified to teach Health courses.  Many colleges and universities offer both Physical Education and Health as one certification. This push towards health education is beginning at the intermediate level, including lessons on bullying, self-esteem and stress and anger management.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Research has shown that there is a positive correlation between brain development and exercising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=REYNOLDS|first=GRETCHEN|title=Phys Ed: Can Exercise Make Kids Smarter?|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/phys-ed-can-exercise-make-kids-smarter/|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporating local indigenous knowledge into physical education can lead to many meaningful experiences and a way of learning about other cultures. For example, by incorporating traditional knowledge from varying indigenous groups from across Canada, students can be exposed to many concepts such as holistic learning and the medicine wheel. A unit could be focused on connecting to a place or feeling while outdoors, participating in traditional games, or outdoor environmental education. These types of lesson can easily be integrated into other parts of the curriculum and give Aboriginal students a chance to incorporate their culture in the local school community.&lt;ref&gt;Lowen, G {{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have been done in how physical education can help improve academic achievement. In a 2007 article, researchers found a profound gain in English Arts [[standardized testing]] test scores among students who had 56 hours of physical education in a year, compared to those who had 28 hours of physical education a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tremarche|first1=Pamela V.|last2=Robinson|first2=Ellyn M.|last3=Graham|first3=Louise B.|title=Physical Education and Its Effect on Elementary Testing Results|journal=Physical Educator|date=2007|volume=64|issue=2 |pages=58–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], the physical education curriculum is designed to allow school pupils a full range of modern opportunities, including sports. [[Martial arts]] classes, like [[wrestling]] in the United States, and [[Pencak Silat]] in France, [[Indonesia]], and [[Malaysia]], teach children [[self-defense]] and to feel good about themselves. The physical education curriculum is designed to allow students to experience at least a minimum exposure to the following categories of activities: [[aquatic sports|aquatics]], conditioning activities, [[gymnastics]], individual/dual sports, [[team sports]], rhythms, and [[dance]].

In these areas, a planned sequence of learning experiences is designed to support a progression of student development. This allows kids through 6th grade to be introduced to sports, fitness, and teamwork in order to be better prepared for the middle and high school age. In 1975, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted to require school physical education classes include [[coeducation|both genders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=483834 |title=Physical Education – Jul 18, 1975 – NBC – TV news: Vanderbilt Television News Archive |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=1975-07-18 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some high school and some middle school PE classes are single-sex. &lt;!-- This makes no sense as written. Can someone clarify?) Requiring individuals to participate in physical education activities, such as [[dodge ball]], [[flag football]], and other competitive sports remains a controversial subject because of the social impact these have cases physical education programs have been cut.--&gt;&lt;!-- A lot of research shows the benefits of physical education however there can also be a lot of negative experiences students deal with regarding physical education.  --&gt;&lt;!-- A section detailing possible negative experiences students may face during physical education would be beneficial  --&gt;

==Technology use in physical education==

New technology in education is playing a big role in classes. One of the most affordable and effective tools is a simple video recorder.  With this, students can see the mistakes they're making in things such as a throwing motion or swinging form.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Wang, L., Myers, D., &amp; Yanes, M. (2010). Creating student-centered learning experience through the assistance of high-end technology in physical education. Journal of Instructional Psychology, 37(4), 352–356.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that students find this more effective than having someone try to explain what they are doing wrong, and then trying to correct it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Educators may use technologies such as [[pedometer]]s and [[heart rate monitor]]s to make step and heart rate goals for students.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, M., Karp, G., Goc, H., &amp; Perlman, D. (2008). Physical educators' usage. Physical Educator, 65(2), 82–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Other technologies that can be used in a Physical Education setting include [[video projector]]s, [[GPS]] and games and gaming systems such as [[Kinect]], [[Wii]] Fit and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''. Projectors can show students proper form or how to play certain games. [[GPS]] systems can be used to get students active in an outdoor setting, and active exergames{{clarify|date=October 2014}} can be used by teachers to show students a good way to stay fit in and out of the classroom setting.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, G. (2011, November 21). Interview by M Massey [Personal Interview].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of technology that is commonly used in Physical Education is the pedometer. This does not necessarily track how far a person is going, but lets them know the number of steps they are taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/using-pedometers-to-assess-physical-activity-participation-levels |title=Using pedometers to assess physical activity participation levels |publisher=Humankinetics.com |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pecentral.org/lessonideas/pedometer/pedometerlessonndex.html |title=PEC: Pedometer Lesson Activities |publisher=Pecentral.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In team [[sport]]s, a '''man of the match'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/man_of_the_match|title=man of the match - definition of man of the match in English - Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025173131/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/man_of_the_match|archivedate=25 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; award is often given to the outstanding player in a particular match. This can be a player from either team, although the player is generally chosen from the winning team.

Some sports have unique traditions regarding these awards, and they are especially sought-after in championship or [[all-star game|all-star]] games. In Australia, the term "[[best and fairest]]" is normally used, both for individual games and season-long awards. In some competitions, particularly in North America, the terms "[[most valuable player]]" (MVP) or "most outstanding player" (MOP) are used. In [[ice hockey]] in North America, three players of the game, called the "[[three stars (ice hockey)|three stars]]", are recognised.

In sports where playoffs are decided by series rather than individual games, such as professional basketball and baseball, MVP awards are commonly given for the series, and in ice hockey's [[National Hockey League|NHL]], for performance in the entire playoffs.

==Association football==
In football, the "man of the match" award typically goes to a player on the winning side. Players who score a [[hat-trick]], or [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] who keep a [[Shutout#Association football|clean sheet]] under pressure often get the award. Hat-trick scorers usually receive the match ball whether or not they are officially named man of the match. 

The man of the match is often chosen by a television commentator or a sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/sport.comment4|title=Football: The problem with man of the match awards|first=Si|last=Hawkins|date=27 February 2008|website=the Guardian|accessdate=6 May ghg2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301170032/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/sport.comment4|archivedate=1 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all competitions have an official man of the match award, so sometimes accolades are given by websites or newspapers instead. In the [[Premier League]], for example, a player receives a small black and gold trophy for their man of the match performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/83956|title=How the Premier League's monthly awards work|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204082122/https://www.premierleague.com/news/83956|archivedate=4 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3742900/Premier-League-s-new-man-match-award-yellow-brick-poking-fun-new-design.html|title=Premier League's new man-of-the-match award is a gold coloured brick|author=|date=|website=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019220257/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3742900/Premier-League-s-new-man-match-award-yellow-brick-poking-fun-new-design.html|archivedate=19 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian rules football==
In [[Australian rules football]], the player of the game is often referred to as having been the "best on ground" (or "BOG"). Media outlets provide immediate, unofficial recognition that is largely honorary, often on a 5–4–3–2–1 or 3–2–1 voting basis.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Players may receive a [[Tissot]] watch as an award for their "best on ground" performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richmondfc.com.au/video/2016-08-06/round-20-rance-wins-the-tissot|title=Round 20: Rance wins the Tissot - richmondfc.com.au|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019220230/http://www.richmondfc.com.au/video/2016-08-06/round-20-rance-wins-the-tissot|archivedate=19 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] recognises the player of the game as being the player awarded the maximum three votes by umpires in the [[Brownlow Medal]] count at season's end. Exceptions are made during the season for certain reserved games such as the [[Western Derby]], [[The ANZAC Day clash]], [[QClash]], and [[Showdown (AFL)|Showdown]], where medallions are officially rewarded in presentations following the conclusion of the match. On the day of the [[AFL Grand Final]], a player will be awarded the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as being the best on ground voted by an independent panel of [[Australian rules football]] experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/stats/awards/norm-smith-medal|title=Norm Smith Medal - AFL.com.au|website=afl.com.au|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135158/http://www.afl.com.au/stats/awards/norm-smith-medal|archivedate=16 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==
{{main article|Player of the Match awards (cricket)}}
In cricket, the man of the match award became a regular feature in Test matches in the mid 1980s.&lt;ref name="test motm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283704.html |title=Records / Test matches / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) /Most player-of-the-match awards |work=ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |accessdate=2 January 2014 |date= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303223723/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283704.html |archivedate=3 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The man of the match title is usually awarded to the player whose contribution is seen as the most critical in winning the game. 

In one match held on 3 April 1996, the whole team from [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] was awarded the Men of the Match award. It was the first instance when a whole team was awarded it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4th ODI: West Indies v New Zealand at Georgetown, Apr 3, 1996 &amp;#124; Cricket Scorecard &amp;#124; ESPN Cricinfo|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64524.html|website=ESPN Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=24 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404011441/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64524.html|archivedate=4 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a test match played between 15,16,17,18 January 1999 between South Africa vs West Indies, the whole South African team was awarded man of the match &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63823.html|title=5th Test, West Indies tour of South Africa at Centurion, Jan 15-18 1999 - Match Summary - ESPNCricinfo|website=ESPNcricinfo|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106053428/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63823.html|archivedate=6 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Test matches, [[Jacques Kallis]] holds the record for the highest number of awards won, with 23 in 166 matches played.&lt;ref name = "test motm"/&gt; In ODIs, [[Sachin Tendulkar]] holds the record for the highest number of man of the match titles, with 62 awards in 463 matches played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html |title=Records / One-Day Internationals / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) /Most player-of-the-match awards |work=ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |accessdate=2 January 2014 |date= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304055509/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html |archivedate=4 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tendulkar is followed by [[Sanath Jayasuriya]], who, along with [[Ricky Ponting]], also holds the record for the most Man of the Match titles as captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records / One-Day Internationals / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) / Most player-of-the-match awards|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902085726/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html|archivedate=2 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the shortest form of the game, [[T20 International]]s, this record is held by [[Shahid Afridi]], who has won 11 awards in 99 matches.

==Gaelic games==

In the Gaelic games of [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic football]], the "man of the match" ({{Lang-ga|Laoch na hImeartha}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/man+of+the+match|title=man of the match - Translation to Irish Gaelic with audio pronunciation of translations for man of the match by New English-Irish Dictionary|website=www.focloir.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817205811/http://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/man+of+the+match|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "hero of the game") is commonly awarded after important games. An unusual example was the [[2008 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final]], where the award was given to [[Brian Cody]], the [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] manager, rather than to a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=100900|title=Bookie pays out on man of the match bets - Hoganstand.com|website=www.hoganstand.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817204048/http://www.hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=100900|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the women's sports of [[camogie]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]], the term "player of the match" ({{Lang-ga|Laoch na hImeartha}}, "hero of the game") is used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clarechampion.ie/fiona-scoops-player-of-the-match-award/|title=Fiona scoops player of the match award – The Clare Champion|website=clarechampion.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817223801/http://clarechampion.ie/fiona-scoops-player-of-the-match-award/|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickpost.ie/2017/02/14/ul-repeat-ashbourne-supremacy-ucc/ereena-fryday-receives-her-player-of-the-match-award-from-catherine-neary-1222017/|title=Ereena Fryday receives her player of the match award from Catherine Neary 12/2/2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817204538/http://www.limerickpost.ie/2017/02/14/ul-repeat-ashbourne-supremacy-ucc/ereena-fryday-receives-her-player-of-the-match-award-from-catherine-neary-1222017/|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/shine-hails-impact-of-teen-star-odonoghue-36028640.html|title=Shine hails impact of teen star O'Donoghue - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2017/0812/896955-dublin-overcome-plucky-waterford-to-reach-final-four/|title=Dublin overcome plucky Waterford to reach final four|first=Jackie|last=Cahill|date=12 August 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817204024/https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2017/0812/896955-dublin-overcome-plucky-waterford-to-reach-final-four/|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Ice hockey==
{{main article|Three stars (ice hockey)}}
In North American [[ice hockey]], the three players who perform best in the game, often either those who accumulate the most points or outstanding goaltenders, are usually designated the '''Three stars''' of the game: the top-performing player is the ''first star'', and so on. This tradition originated in the 1930s as a promotion for a "Three Star" brand of gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/top10/hockeygimmicks.html#threestars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615075333/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/top10/hockeygimmicks.html|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in international play (and outside North America), the ''three stars'' concept is rarely used. Instead, other leagues may issue awards to one player who performed best in the game.

==Rugby football==
Both codes of rugby, [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]], commonly have man of the match or player of the match awards. In televised or sponsored matches, a commentator or sponsor often decides who gets the award, and it is presented to the winner after the match.

Examples of man of the match awards in professional men's rugby league are the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] in the [[National Rugby League Grand Final]], the [[Karyn Murphy Medal]] in the [[NRL Women's Premiership Grand Final]] the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] in the [[Challenge Cup]] final and the [[Harry Sunderland Trophy]] in the [[Super League Grand Final]].

==College basketball and football==
In [[college basketball]] and [[college football]], the two collegiate sports with the most television coverage in the United States, a top player from each team is usually honoured as "players of the game." These athletes usually cannot collect material prizes due to [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] regulations. Instead, television companies broadcasting the game or corporate sponsors will often make donations to the scholarship funds of each school in the names of the winning players.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In college basketball's Final Four events, a [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] award is given, for performance across both the semi-final and championship game. A Most Outstanding Player award is also given for each of the four regionals, based upon performances in the regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen) and final (Elite Eight).

==Gridiron football==
The [[National Football League]] names an MVP for two prominent games on its schedule:
* A [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award]] has been awarded at each [[Super Bowl]] (the NFL's championship).
* The [[Pro Bowl]] has had an MVP award throughout its existence. The current Pro Bowl MVP format selects one offensive and one defensive player. From 1956–1971, two MVP awards were given, one to a [[skill position]] and the other to a [[lineman (American football)|lineman]] or [[linebacker]]. In 1972, an offensive and defensive MVP were named. From 1973–2012, a single Pro Bowl MVP was chosen.

Individual games typically have an informal player (or players) of the game chosen by the broadcast network covering the game; one prominent example of this phenomenon is the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day#Game MVPs|Turkey Leg Award, All-Iron Award and Galloping Gobbler]] trophies awarded for games held on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].

The [[Canadian Football League]] awards two MVP awards for its championship game, the [[Grey Cup]]. The [[Grey Cup Most Valuable Player]] award is open to all players; the [[Dick Suderman Trophy]] is limited to players with Canadian citizenship or who were raised in Canada since childhood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17601">In [[gridiron football]] and its variants, [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]], the [[quarterback]] position is often considered the most important on the team. This article examines racial issues faced by quarterbacks, predominantly [[African American]] ones.

== History ==
Since the beginning of professional football, the number of Black quarterbacks has been on the rise. In 1971 3% of quarterbacks who threw at least 100 passes in the season were Black, but by 2001 this number had risen to 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferrucci|first=Patrick|last2=Tandoc|first2=Edson C.|date=2017-06-12|title=The Spiral of Stereotyping: Social Identity Theory and NFL Quarterbacks|journal=Howard Journal of Communications|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=107–125|doi=10.1080/10646175.2017.1315693|issn=1064-6175}}&lt;/ref&gt;During the 2013 season, 67 percent of NFL players were [[African American]] (blacks make up 13 percent of the US population), yet only 17 percent of quarterbacks were; 82 percent of quarterbacks were white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2014 Racial and Gender Report Card: National Football League|url=http://www.tidesport.org/2014%20National%20Football%20League%20Racial%20and%20Gender%20Report%20Card.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203072538/http://www.tidesport.org/2014%20National%20Football%20League%20Racial%20and%20Gender%20Report%20Card.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2015|accessdate=3 February 2015|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the [[New York Giants]] benched longtime quarterback [[Eli Manning]] in favor of [[Geno Smith]], who was declared the starter for one week. The Giants were the last team to never field a black starting QB during an NFL season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theundefeated.com/features/first-black-starting-quarterback-for-each-nfl-team-geno-smith/|title=The first black starting quarterback for each NFL team — and how long he lasted|author=|date=30 November 2017|website=theundefeated.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inception of the game, only two quarterbacks with known black ancestry have led their team to a Super Bowl victory: [[Doug Williams (quarterback)|Doug Williams]] [[Super Bowl XXII|in 1988]] and [[Russell Wilson]], who is [[multiracial]], [[Super Bowl XLVIII|in 2014]].

== News Coverage ==
In 2003, conservative radio talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] made headlines when he claimed that the media was biased in favor of [[Donovan McNabb]], a prominent black quarterback at the time. Limbaugh stated that “the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well… he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he really didn’t deserve.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1627887|title=McNabb's performance: A Rush to judgment?|date=2003-10-01|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Limbaugh, McNabb reseived more media praise than he was due because he was black. The data shows that this is in fact not true. In a study of news coverage of White and Black quarterbacks, political Scientist David Niven of [[Florida Atlantic University]] found that bBlack quarterbacks, including McNabb, did not receive preferential treatment by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niven|first=David|date=2005|title=Race, Quarterbacks, and the Media: Testing the Rush Limbaugh Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=35|issue=5|pages=684–694|jstor=40034343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stereotyping of Black Quarterbacks ==
There is some controversy over how White and Black quarterbacks tend to be described by the media, especially draft prospects hoping to make it into the NFL. Draft experts and scouts have a history of describing Black quarterbacks in ways that perpetuate racial stereotypes and hurt those prospects chances of making it to the NFL as a quarterback.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bigler|first=Matthew|last2=Jeffries|first2=Judson L.|date=2008-03-04|title="An Amazing Specimen": NFL Draft Experts' Evaluations of Black Quarterbacks|journal=Journal of African American Studies|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=120–141|doi=10.1007/s12111-008-9036-7|issn=1559-1646}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even those who make it to the NFL continue to face bias towards or against them.&lt;ref name="Tyrod debate ESPN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/21251222/the-great-debate-buffalo-bills-quarterback-tyrod-taylor | title=The great Tyrod Taylor debate | publisher=[[ESPN]] | date=November 2, 2017 | author=Kimes, Mina}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An empirical study published in ''The Howard Journal of Communications'' supported this hypothesis. The researchers analyzed the written descriptions of quarterback prospects in the NFL Draft section of the ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' website from 1998 to 2007. They looked at each player’s description for words or phrases about athleticism and intelligence and sorted them into categories based on whether they were positive or negative. A significant difference was found between how black and White quarterbacks are described by SI. Black quarterbacks tend to be praised for their athleticism and criticized for a lack of intelligence. Meanwhile, white quarterbacks are often praised for their intelligence and criticized for a lack of athleticism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mercurio|first=Eugenio|last2=Filak|first2=Vincent F.|date=2010-01-29|title=Roughing the Passer: The Framing of Black and White Quarterbacks Prior to the NFL Draft|journal=Howard Journal of Communications|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=56–71|doi=10.1080/10646170903501328|issn=1064-6175}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Dante Culpepper]] and [[Tee Martin]], both black quarterbacks, were described with terms such as “physical specimen” and “impressive specimen,” respectively. Meanwhile, white players have been described as “good signal callers,” and “real student[s] of the game.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

These racial stereotypes have roots in [[Social Darwinism]], which looks at human races as species with different natural abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-Darwinism|title=social Darwinism {{!}} Definition &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;Social Darwinists associate darker skin with natural strength and instincts, and intellectual deficiencies. These ideas are largely disproven, but they still influence how many Americans see race.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sports have typically been an arena in which the construction of race occurs, as well as a lense through which we observe racial progress, so these stereotypes influence how Americans think about race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buffington|first=Daniel|date=March 2005|title=Contesting Race on Sundays: Making Meaning out of the Rise in the Number of Black Quarterbacks|url=|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|volume=22|issue=1|pages=19–37|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Media plays in important role in establishing public opinion, so their perpetuation of stereotypes has a lasting effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Notable examples of quarterbacks affected by stereotyping===
==== Marlin Briscoe ====
After a successful college career as a quarterback, the [[Denver Broncos]] drafted [[Marlin Briscoe]] in the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; round of the [[1968 NFL draft]], with plans to shift him to the defensive secondary. Because of racist stereotypes, pro football teams refused to let black players play quarterback, thinking they were not intelligent enough for the position. After injuries to Denver’s starter, Marlin Briscoe became the first black quarterback to start a game in a major professional football league in 1968. That season, Briscoe threw for 1,589 yards, broke the Broncos’ single-season rookie touchdown record with 14, and finished second in Rookie of the Year voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/marlin-briscoe-african-american-pioneer/|title=Marlin Briscoe, African American pioneer {{!}} Pro Football Hall of Fame Official Site|website=www.profootballhof.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, because of stereotypes, he was not invited to Denver’s off-season quarterback meetings. After being released, Briscoe signed with the [[Buffalo Bills]], who put him at wide receiver. Despite his success as a receiver in Buffalo and later with the [[Miami Dolphins]], Briscoe never played quarterback again for the rest of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Phil|date=July 6, 2015|title=Marlin Briscoe|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=103582872&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Sports Illustrated|volume=123|issue=1|pages=64–68|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== James Harris ====
While Briscoe never played quarterback for the Bills, his teammate [[James Harris (quarterback)|James "Shack" Harris]] got the honor of being the first black quarterback to start for the team and was the second overall to start for a team in NFL history. After being released by the Bills and signing with the [[Los Angeles Rams]], Harris stepped in for injured Rams starter [[John Hadl]] in 1974, and head coach [[Chuck Knox]] made him the permanent starter, a first for any black quarterback. Harris went on to also become the first black quarterback to make the [[Pro Bowl]] and start and win an NFL playoff game.&lt;ref name="JHarris"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://theundefeated.com/features/james-shack-harris-is-prominent-on-list-of-groundbreaking-quarterbacks/ | title=James 'Shack' Harris is prominent on list of groundbreaking quarterbacks | work=The Undefeated | date=12 October 2017 | accessdate=25 November 2018 | author=Reid, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Harris received hate mail and death threats due to his race, which eventually required security guards to protect him both on the field and at hotels. When Harris suffered injuries, Knox was reportedly pressured by Rams owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]] to play other quarterbacks such as an aging [[Joe Namath]] and [[Pat Haden]], even after Harris became healthy again. Harris's demotion and later trade to the [[San Diego Chargers]] became a racial issue in Los Angeles, with journalists such as [[Skip Bayless]] and [[Brad Pye Jr.]] covering the matter.&lt;ref name="shack&amp;Knox"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://theundefeated.com/features/chuck-knox-should-be-remembered-for-making-james-harris-the-nfls-first-black-starting-qb/ | title=Chuck Knox should be remembered for making James Harris the NFL's first black starting QB | work=The Undefeated | date=22 May 2018 | accessdate=25 November 2018 | author=Samuel G.

[[Michael Vick]] was the first black quarterback ever taken [[List of first overall National Football League draft picks|first overall in the NFL draft]]. Despite being known for "revolutionizing" the quarterback position in the NFL with his athletic ability, his legacy was arguably tarnished by his [[Michael Vick dog fighting scandal|involvement in a dogfighting ring]], which led to his arrest and incarceration for two years. [[Dog fighting]], while now considered illegal in the [[United States]], has been [[Dog fighting in the United States|historically prevalent]] in the country and is still run underground. While Vick has served his time and now devoted himself to raising awareness for animal rights, a certain demographic of NFL fans and activists have refused to forgive him, angrily protesting his tenures with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/animal-advocates-plan-candlelight-vigil-victims-mi/32192010 | title=Animal advocates plan candlelight vigil for victims of Michael Vick | publisher=WPXI-TV | date=31 August 2015 | accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that this was rooted in racism rather than concern for animals, as other NFL players such as [[Ray Lewis]] (acquitted of murdering another black man) and fellow Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] (acquitted of rape, but suspended for six games) were more easily forgiven for crimes arguably more heinous than endangering dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/03/leave-michael-vick-alone-the-racism-and-misogyny-of-football-fans/ | title=Leave Michael Vick Alone: the Racism and Misogyny of Football Fans | work=Counter Punch | date=3 September 2015 | accessdate=25 November 2018 | author=Ware, Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cam Newton ====
In 2015, controversy arose when [[Carolina Panthers]] quarterback [[Cam Newton]] was seen celebrating a touchdown against the [[Tennessee Titans]] with the [[Dab (dance)|dab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/11/cam-newton-styles-on-titans-linebacker-dances-all-up-in-his-face-video | title=Titans linebacker takes offense to Cam Newton's dancing, Newton keeps dancing in his face | publisher=USA Today | date=15 November 2015 | accessdate=4 November 2018 | author=Peters, Micah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many commentators said that Newton's celebration made him "look like a thug" especially when Titans players became upset at Newton for it, but it was also noted that he had been performing the dance as his touchdown celebration all year up to that point with little notice given until the Panthers were seen as a legitimate Superbowl contender. The dab celebration was similar to flamboyant celebrations by white quarterbacks such as [[Drew Stanton]]'s dance against the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and [[Aaron Rodgers]]' "championship belt". Newton was also called a "thug" by some reporters simply due to his clothing choices during press conferences and off the field, despite refraining from questionable behaviors seen in white quarterbacks such as [[Johnny Manziel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://detroit.cbslocal.com/2016/02/05/terry-foster-if-cam-newton-is-a-thug-then-so-is-johnny-manziel/ | title=Terry Foster: If Cam Newton Is A Thug Then So Is Johnny Manziel | publisher=CBS Detroit | date=5 February 2016 | accessdate=4 November 2018 | author=Foster, Terry}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Tyrod Taylor ====
A sixth-round draft pick in 2011 who had spent his early career as [[Joe Flacco]]'s backup with the [[Baltimore Ravens]], [[Tyrod Taylor]] claimed the starting position for the [[Buffalo Bills]] upon signing with them in 2015. Despite proving to be one of the most competent quarterbacks for Buffalo since its playoff drought began in 2000 (eventually leading the Bills to finally qualify in 2017, his last season with the team before being traded to the [[Cleveland Browns]]), Taylor continued to face criticism from a certain demographic of Bills fans for his perceived run-first mentality and indecisiveness. In a 2017 interview published by ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', Taylor mentioned that he always knew he would be criticized more than his white counterparts, a sentiment also echoed by Vick and Newton, but that it drives him to be a better player.&lt;ref name="Tyrod debate ESPN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TT unfiltered BN"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://buffalonews.com/2017/10/14/tyrod-taylor-unfiltered-win-everythings-great-lose-want-crucify/ | title=Tyrod Taylor unfiltered: 'When we win, everything's great. When we lose, they want to crucify me.' | work=[[The Buffalo News]] | date=26 October 2017 | accessdate=3 November 2018 | author=Kimberley A. Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text = It's always going to be twice as bad just because of who I am -- an African-American quarterback... Look across the league, man. We’re held to a certain standard. We almost have to be perfect.&lt;ref name="TT unfiltered BN" /&gt;|author = [[Tyrod Taylor]] on the evaluation of his play as a black quarterback|width=25em|float=left}}

==== Deshaun Watson ====
Despite his ability to both pass and run effectively, current [[Houston Texans]] signal-caller [[Deshaun Watson]] despises being called a [[dual-threat quarterback]] because he believes the term is often used to stereotype black quarterbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2017/01/08/alabama-jalen-hurts-clemson-deshaun-watson-dual-threat-qb/96322194/|title=Deshaun Watson, Jalen Hurts see 'dual-threat QB' in different light|publisher = USA Today|date = January 8, 2017|accessdate = August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Watson was the subject of racist remarks echoing these stereotypes after making a bad decision in a game. The superintendent of the Onalaska school district outside of Houston came under fire for saying that “when you need precision decision making you can't count on a black quarterback."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Onalaska-ISD-superintendent-apologizes-for-13236285.php|title=Superintendent apologizes for comment about black quarterbacks|date=2018-09-17|work=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional baseball==

=== Negro Leagues ===

{{Further|Negro league baseball}}
As sports progressed, race relations progressed at a comparable rate. In baseball for instance, [[African American]]s were barred from participation in the National Association of Baseball Players because of regional prejudice and unofficial color bans dating back to the 1890s.&lt;ref name="negroleaguebaseball.com"&gt;"Negro League History 101 - An Introduction To The Negro Leagues." Negro League Baseball Dot Com. Web. 13 March 2012. &lt;http://www.negroleaguebaseball.com/history101.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this segregation, blacks worked together to create the Negro Leagues. These leagues comprised mostly all African-American teams. As a whole, the Negro Leagues became one of the largest and most successful enterprises run by African Americans. Their founding and resilient growth stood as a testament to the determination and drive of African-Americans to battle the imposing [[racial segregation]] and social disadvantage.&lt;ref name="negroleaguebaseball.com" /&gt;

=== Jackie Robinson ===

{{Further information|Jackie Robinson}}
[[Jackie Robinson]] was born in Cairo, Georgia in 1919 and was the youngest of five children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/bb9e2490|title=Jackie Robinson {{!}} Society for American Baseball Research|website=sabr.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an early age, his father deserted the family and his mother, Mallie Robinson, decided to move the family to Pasadena in California. Here, Robinson began to excel at many sports, especially baseball.

After serving in the military, Robinson joined the [[Kansas City Monarchs]] of the American Negro Leagues and excelled with elite fielding and a batting average above .300.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although he was playing well, he did not like competing in a racially segregated league that was put in place by the [[Jim Crow laws]]. [[Branch Rickey]], president of the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers,]] signed Robinson to the Montreal Royals in 1946, which was an all-white minor league team.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jackie-robinson-9460813#breaking-the-color-barrier|title=Jackie Robinson|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He faced lots of adversity with racist comments from his own team members and especially during away games where opposing white players would spit, hit, and slide into him with sharp metal cleats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite this adversity, Robinson led the International League in both batting average (.349) and fielding percentage (.985) and was called up to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He played his first game on April 15, 1947, becoming the first African-American man to ever play professional baseball. The harassments in the Major Leagues only got worse with multiple opposing team's managers and players yelling derogatory terms and trying to inflict any harm possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Robinson went on to have a successful baseball career, being inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame and having his jersey number retired.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Golf==

===Tiger Woods===
Only a few minority players, such as [[Tiger Woods]], have dominated [[professional golf]]. Woods is of [[African American]] and [[Asian-American]] descent. With 83 percent of golf participants being white, a white majority dominates golf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2007/01/Issue-73/PGA-Tour-Season-Preview/Scarborough-Research-Mens-Golf-Fan-Demographics.aspx "Scarborough Research: Men's Golf Fan Demographics."], ''[[SportsBusiness Daily]]''. 4 January 2007. Web. 13 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Woods has the second most major wins of any individual in golf history, with 14.&lt;ref&gt;"Tiger Woods." TigerWoods.com: [http://web.tigerwoods.com/onTour/careerSummary/majorVictories On Tour: Major Victories]. Web. 13 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; His excellence was well recognized as he became one of the most marketable players in the world. Woods helped tear down the imposing racial discrepancies in golf by not only competing with golf's current best but also by challenging other accomplished golfers for being the best of all time. In 1997, he became the first black player to win a [[Men's major golf championship]] at just 21 years of age. After winning the [[1997 Masters Tournament]], Woods faced ridicule from [[Fuzzy Zoeller]], who won this championship in 1979. Zoeller responded to Woods' win by stating, "That little boy is driving well and he's putting well. He's doing everything it takes to win. So you know what you guys do when he gets in here. You pat him on the back and say congratulations and enjoy it and tell him not serve fried chicken next year. Got it." Zoeller says his comments were misconstrued, and later apologized.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/1997-04-21/us/9704_21_fuzzy_1_zoellers-wasnt-in-good-taste-collard-greens?_s=PM:US|title=Golfer Says Comments About Woods Misconstrued|date=2009-10-30|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- tHIS TEXT &amp; "In 1997, when Tiger Woods..." BELOW, NEED TO BE MERGED HERE-they deal with the same events &amp; use the same ref--&gt;

In 2011 Woods' former [[caddie]] [[Steve Williams (caddy)|Steve Williams]] described him as a "black arse", which sparked much controversy over the racial dynamic between Woods and the world of golf. His comments opened a debate on the racial tensions present in golf. Williams described his comments as "stupid" and not racist, and later apologized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jemele Hill]].

Broadcaster [[Kelly Tilghman]] was suspended from [[The Golf Channel]] after joking about [[Tiger Woods]] being "lynched in a back alley" during final round coverage of the [[Mercedes-Benz Championship (PGA Tour)|Mercedes-Benz Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.golf.com/tour-and-news/golf-channel-anchor-kelly-tilghman-suspended-lynch-remark-about-tiger-woods|title=Golf Channel anchor Kelly Tilghman suspended for 'lynch' remark about Tiger Woods|work=GOLF.com|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional basketball==

===Donald Sterling===
[[Donald Sterling]] was the previous owner of the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], who was banned from the NBA for life for racially insensitive remarks he made about African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-20|title=Donald Sterling|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_Sterling&amp;oldid=766438154|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing a picture that his then-girlfriend, V. Stiviano, posted with [[Magic Johnson]], Sterling was recorded saying:

"It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people. Do you have to? ... You can sleep with them [black people]. You can bring them in, you can do whatever you want. The little I ask you is not to promote it on that...and not to bring them to my games."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/10843525/nba-investigating-offensive-audio-recording-allegedly-los-angeles-clippers-owner-donald-sterling|title=NBA investigates alleged Sterling racist talk|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These remarks outraged his players and coach [[Doc Rivers]] (who is an African-American), who threatened to boycott games and called for Sterling to be removed as owner.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite the remarks, players kept striving to advance in the playoffs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The NBA commissioner, [[Adam Silver]], and the NBA Board of Governors officially approved the sale of the Clippers to Microsoft CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] for $2 billion, and effectively banned Sterling from the NBA for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/sale-of-clippers-to-steve-ballmer-closes-donald-sterling-out/|title=Sale of Clippers to Steve Ballmer closes; Donald Sterling out|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism in college athletics==

{{further|NCAA}}

=== College football ===
Despite universities making strides to diversify their student bodies, racism has had an effect on universities' athletics. According to Charles T Clotfelter, "No bigger issue has faced the United States during the reign of big-time college sports than the blot of racial segregation and discrimination."&lt;ref name="Clotfelter, Charles T 2011"&gt;Clotfelter, Charles T. Big-time Sports in American Universities. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As college sports have gained notoriety, the national attention towards this issue has increased. Clotfelter continues his analysis of equality in collegiate sports by stating that the "Brown v Board of Education decision of 2016 set the stage for an epic confrontation between... the South's devotion to college football and its cultural commitment to Jim Crow laws".&lt;ref name="Clotfelter, Charles T 2011" /&gt; With a significant portion of the South's football players being African-American, tensions between the players and the southern atmosphere became readily apparent. In terms of the South maintaining a sense of authority over blacks, in the year 20 "92.5 percent of university presidents in the FBS were white, 87.5 percent of the athletic directors were white and 100 percent of the conference commissioners were white". In comparison, "roughly 31 percent of position coaches are black and 12 percent of coordinators were black. Out of the players in the FBS, roughly 54 percent are black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/326890-tennessee-vols-hiring-of-dooley-shows-racism-in-cf-alive-and-well|title=Tennessee's Hire Shows Racism Is Alive and Well in College Football|first=Kevin|last=Scott|publisher=|date=January 15, 2010|work=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the NFL has implemented the Rooney Rule in order to create opportunities for minority coaches, college football has no such rule in place. However, over time racial cohesion in sports has improved, as Clotfelter states that there has been a "realization that future success would require integrated teams".&lt;ref name="Clotfelter, Charles T 2011" /&gt;

==== Ernie Davis ====
[[Ernie Davis]] was the first African-American to win the [[Heisman Trophy]] Award, and was an exceptional college football player.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/ernie-davis-9267805|title=Ernie Davis|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a three-sport athlete in high school, but excelled at football above all.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He was heavily recruited by many elite college football programs, but the [[National Football League|NFL]] legend [[Jim Brown]] convinced Davis to attend [[Syracuse University]] as it would be a welcoming place for a young black athlete in 1959.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many college sports teams at that time were resisting full-fledged integration, and Davis liked that Syracuse head football coach, [[Ben Schwartzwalder]], was so welcoming to African-American players.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myblackhistory.net/Ernie_Davis.htm|title=African American Athletes Ernie Davis|website=www.myblackhistory.net|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final season, Davis ran for 823 yards and capped off his college career becoming the first ever African-American to win the coveted Heisman Trophy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1962, Davis was the first African-American to be selected first overall in the [[National Football League Draft|NFL Draft]] by the [[Washington Redskins]], and was immediately traded to the [[Cleveland Browns]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

As an African-American playing a lot of college football in the South, Davis faced racism on several occasions. One such instance was after 1960 [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]] in 1960. Syracuse had defeated Texas 23-14, and Davis had an amazing game and earned MVP honors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Davis was told that he would be allowed to accept the award at the post-game banquet, but that he and other black teammates would have to leave the segregated facility shortly after.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The whole team wanted to leave and boycott the event, but Syracuse officials made the rest of the team stay in order to not cause a scene.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Shortly after being drafted, Davis was diagnosed with leukemia and died on May 18, 1963, not having played a game in the NFL.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== College basketball ===

==== Texas Western ====
In 1966, [[Don Haskins]] led a [[University of Texas at El Paso|Texas Western]] basketball team to a 23-1 and record, culminating in a national championship.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gloryroad.utep.edu/team/default.aspx|title=UTEP's Glory Road: The Team|last=Kovanic|first=Seth|website=gloryroad.utep.edu|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was made up of many African-American players, and throughout the regular season faced racism when playing many of their games in the South, As depicted in Haskins' book ''[[Glory Road]]'', one such event occurred when, during an away game, many of the black players had their hotel rooms broken into and vandalized, with racist remarks painted on the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=merron/060112|title=ESPN.com: Page 2 : Reel Life: 'Glory Road'|website=www.espn.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haskins made history when he started the first all-black lineup on March 19, 1966, against the [[University of Kentucky]] in the national championship game. The Miners defeated [[Adolph Rupp]]'s all-white, top ranked team.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; After this historic year in college basketball, teams began to recruit more and more African-American athletes, and college basketball became more integrated.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Patrick Ewing incident ====
In 1983, Georgetown University star center Patrick Ewing ran out onto the court only to be encountered by racist mockery made towards his character. A banana peel was thrown towards him on the court during play, and signs reading "Ewing is an Ape" and "Ewing Kant Read Dis" were held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1983/02/09/ewing-under-siege/a17fe474-6ec8-42a9-8ad6-19880d4d9990/|title=EWING UNDER SIEGE|last=Pomerantz|first=Gary|date=1983-02-09|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-03-16|last2=Pomerantz|first2=Gary|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the most dominant players in college basketball, Ewing continued to play despite the taunts. University President Rev. Timothy S. Healy described the actions as "cheap, racist stuff".&lt;ref&gt;Pomerantz, Gary. "Ewing Attracts Riotous Amount of Attention." Anchorage News 20 February 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Ewing would go on to play in the NBA and become an iconic figure in for Georgetown Athletics and Georgetown University. As a glorified alumnus of Georgetown University, his image reflects the university's advocacy for diversity, despite the racist actions of the past.

==== Don Imus ====
Radio talk show host Don Imus was suspended for two weeks, then fired by CBS after allegedly making racially disparaging comments about the Rutgers women's basketball team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/business/media/10imus.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1323700181-EmplinvgQjCB633Oz89N3g|title=Radio Host Is Suspended Over Racial Remarks|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=April 10, 2007|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=November 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,265701,00.html|title=Don Imus Fired By CBS Radio for Racist Comments, One Day After MSNBC Drops Show|last=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBSNews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/12/national/main2675273.shtml|title=CBS Fires Don Imus Over Racial Slur|publisher=CBSNews|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident occurred on April 11, 2007, with Imus calling the team "nappy headed-hoes" the day following the team losing in the NCAA Women's National Championship game against the University of Tennessee.&lt;ref name="Fox News" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBSNews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2007/04/don_imus_transcript.html Transcript of Imus' remarks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both teams were predominately Black,&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rKpX-xUVHk]&lt;/ref&gt; and "nappy" is an often pejorative term used to refer to Black hair styles and [[Afro-textured hair|texture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wp.nyu.edu/steinhardt-appsych_opus/hair-alteration-practices-amongst-black-women-and-the-assumption-of-self-hatred/]&lt;/ref&gt; Imus apologized, citing his lack of racism and the girls' unfamiliarity with his broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18022596/ns/msnbc-imus_on_msnbc/t/transcript-imus-puts-remarks-context/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Racism in international sports ==

===1936 Summer Olympics===
{{further|1936 Summer Olympics|Antisemitism in the Olympic Games}}

From the start of the 1936 Olympics, there was an opposition to the Olympic Games being held in Germany; "neither Americans nor the representatives of other countries can take part in the Games in Nazi Germany without at least acquiescing in the contempt of the Nazis for fair play and their sordid exploitation of the Games". Despite this resentment, the Olympic Games continued.&lt;ref name="la84foundation.org"&gt;Miller, Patrick B. [http://la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Olympika/Olympika_1996/olympika0501h.pdf  "The Nazi Olympics, Berlin, 1936: Exhibition at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C."] London, ON Olympika, 1996 (pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

The bidding for the 1936 Olympic Games was the first to be contested by IOC members, who cast their votes for their favorite host city. The vote occurred in 1931 during the Weimar Republic era, before Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933. By allowing only members of the "Aryan race" to compete for [[Nazi]]-controlled Germany, [[Hitler]] further promoted his ideological belief of [[racial supremacy]].

Other nations debated [[boycotting]], with Spain and the Soviet Union going through with a full boycott. The Amateur Athletic Union led newspaper editors and anti-Nazi groups to protest against American participation, contesting that racial discrimination was a violation of Olympic rules and creed and that participation in the Games was tantamount to support for the Third Reich. Most African-American newspapers supported participation in the Olympics. The Philadelphia Tribune and the Chicago Defender both agreed that black victories would undermine Nazi views of Aryan supremacy and spark renewed African-American pride. American Jewish organizations, meanwhile, largely opposed the Olympics. The American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee staged rallies and supported the boycott of German goods to show their disdain for American participation. The 1936 Summer Olympics ultimately boasted the largest number of participating nations of any Olympics to that point. However, some individual athletes, including Jewish Americans [[Milton Green]] and [[Norman Cahners]], chose to boycott the Games.

During these Olympics, Margaret Bergmann Lambert was excluded in the 1936 German Olympic team because she was Jewish.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;" TV SPORTS; 'Hitler's Pawn' on HBO: An Olympic Betrayal." The New York Times. The New York Times. Web. 13 March 2012. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/07/sports/tv-sports-hitler-s-pawn-on-hbo-an-olympic-betrayal.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  She had to withhold her anger and frustration in regard to Hitler's unequal and unfair ruling in Germany. Even though Lambert had equaled the German national record in the high jump a month before the Olympic Games, she was denied the opportunity to participate in the games.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; In addition, the Nazi Press described African Americans as "black auxiliaries" and eventually called for their exclusion from the Olympics.  Also, Hitler's Nazis created rules and restrictions within Germany that prohibited Jews from being able to use local facilities and playgrounds for appropriate training, occurring as early as March 1933. This gave Jews and other "non-Aryan" people unequal training methods.&lt;ref name="la84foundation.org" /&gt;

Great achievements by African Americans, such as Jesse Owens, challenged the "Aryan" ideal, or a Caucasian person without Jewish descent. Owens won four gold medals: one in 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump, and 4x100 meter relay. His achievements conveyed both the notions of "interracial education" as well as "muscular assimilation" to help promote sportsmanship towards African-Americans on and on the Olympic stage.  However, these achievements of interracial awareness and racial cohesion also solidified traditional social hierarchies through the guise of "scientific" discoveries in physiology and anatomy.&lt;ref name="la84foundation.org" /&gt;

Additionally, these achievements were met with much speculation and criticism. Since the games, there has existed a speculation of Hitler's unwillingness to shake hands with African-American gold medalists. From reports that Hitler had purposefully avoided acknowledging his victories, and had refused to shake his hand, Owens said at the time:&lt;blockquote&gt;Hitler had a certain time to come to the stadium and a certain time to leave. It happened he had to leave before the victory ceremony after the 100 meters. But before he left I was on my way to a broadcast and passed near his box. He waved at me and I waved back. I think it was bad taste to criticize the 'man of the hour' in another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zsoaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IkwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1814,6536771&amp;dq=jesse-owens+hitler&amp;hl=en|title=The Pittsburgh Press - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This racism was not limited to Germans, as Americans observed racism as well.  American Track and Field coach Dean Cromwell stated "It was not long ago that his [the black athlete's] ability to sprint and jump was a life-and-death matter to him in the jungle. His muscles are pliable, and his easy-going disposition is a valuable aid to the mental and physical relaxation that a runner and jumper must have." These thoughts percolated throughout the Olympics, and made discrimination commonplace in many aspects of the games.&lt;ref name="la84foundation.org" /&gt;

* American sprinters Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman were pulled from the 4 × 100 relay team the day before the competition, leading to speculation that U.S. Olympic committee did not want to add to the embarrassment of Hitler by having two Jews win gold medals.
* Hitler called for a rematch of the quarterfinals match to discount Peru's 4–2 win over Austria. The Peruvian national Olympic team refused to play the match again and withdrew from the games.
* During the games, the Nazis demoted Captain Wolfgang Fürstner, the half-Jewish commandant of the Olympic Village, and replaced him with Werner von Gilsa. After the games' conclusion, Fürstner, a career officer, committed suicide when he learned that the Nuremberg Laws classified him as a Jew, and, as such, he was to be expelled from the Wehrmacht.

===Association football===
{{For|racism in association football (also known as soccer)|Racism in association football}}
[[Association football]] has a history of racism events. Some players may be targeted because of their association with an opposing team. However, there have been instances of individuals being targeted by their own fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZfYh7n2qTMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sport+and+National+Identity+in+the+Post-War+World#v=onepage&amp;q=darkie&amp;f=false|title=Sport and national identity in the ... - Google Books|date=|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Centre for the Sociology of Sport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/so/css/resources/factsheets/fs6.html|title=Fact Sheet 6: Racism and Football|publisher=[[University of Leicester]]|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/8318117.stm|title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Football &amp;#124; My Club &amp;#124; R &amp;#124; Rangers &amp;#124; Police probe into abuse of Edu|date=2009-10-22|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 2013, a small Italian club, [[Aurora Pro Patria 1919|Pro Patria]], made their racist perspective known while playing [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]]. [[Kevin-Prince Boateng]] is a black male from Ghana and during this match was constantly abused for his skin color. &lt;blockquote&gt;“When Boateng touched the ball for the first time, a small part of the crowd made monkey noises: Oo -- oo -- oo -- oo...Fifty or so people called him an animal. He locked eyes with them and could see the hate. He pointed to his head, to say, 'You're an idiot.' The chants went on for 20 minutes: Oo -- oo -- oo -- oo...Finally, after about twenty more minutes of the chanting, Boateng picked up the ball, kicked it into the stands and walked off the field. The team then boarded its bus and headed back to the AC Milan compound. "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/9338962/when-beautiful-game-turns-ugly|title=When The Beautiful Game Turns Ugly|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Boateng incident, among others, prove that fans either don't pay attention to, or don't care, about regulating body's rules. The changes made by Association football do not have many effects on the fans, who are the biggest contributors to racism in football, which allows the racism to persist.

Some policies aimed at reducing racism in association football include [[Football Against Racism in Europe]], [[Show Racism The Red Card]], and [[Racism Breaks the Game]] in [[Romania]]; not all passed.

===Australian rugby ===
; Rugby in New South Wales and Anthony Mundine 
[[Anthony Mundine]] made publicity by claiming that [[New South Wales]] is a racist state in terms of the sport of [[rugby league]] and that it is one of the reasons he quit the sport to take up [[boxing]]. He believed that due to his race, he was never truly appreciated for his talents in the league, being forced to sit out and play different positions, despite proving himself to be among the most talented in the league. Contrary to this is the fact the first pick five-eighth for Australia &amp; New South Wales over Mundine's career was Laurie Daly, who captained his country &amp; state, &amp; who did make the [[indigenous team of the century]]. Other indigenous players of Mundines' era who represented their state &amp; country include [[Steve Renouf]]

Even as a professional boxer, Mundine still feels that there is racism in Australian sports, and this is evident in his decision to sit during the national anthem before his fight against [[Danny Green (boxer)|Danny Green]] on February 3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/boxing/anthony-mundine-refuses-to-acknowledge-national-anthem-before-danny-green-fight-20170129-gu131n.html|title=Anthony Mundine refuses to acknowledge national anthem before Danny Green fight|date=2017-01-30|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that the national anthem is not representative of the black people, who are still being oppressed in Australia, and did not acknowledge it.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/boxing/anthony-mundine-is-still-desperately-upset-that-his-rugby-league-rep-career-was-cut-short/news-story/cfc23d9e5c2a1870093fcc96fafad3fe|title=Anthony Mundine is still desperately upset that his rugby league rep career was cut short|date=2016-12-13|work=Fox Sports|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original scale introduced by Gunnar Borg rated exertion on a scale of 6-20. Borg then constructed a category (C) ratio (R) scale, the Borg CR10 Scale. This is especially used in clinical diagnosis of breathlessness and dyspnea, chest pain, angina and musculo-skeletal pain. The CR-10 scale is best suited when there is an overriding sensation arising either from a specific area of the body, for example, muscle pain, ache or fatigue in the quadriceps or from pulmonary responses.

The Borg scale can be compared to other linear scales such as the [[Likert scale]] or a [[visual analogue scale]]. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the results are broadly very similar, although the Borg may outperform the Likert scale in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grant | first1 = S. | last2 = Aitchison | first2 = T. | last3 = Henderson | first3 = E. | last4 = Christie | first4 = J. | last5 = Zare | first5 = S. | last6 = McMurray | first6 = J. | last7 = Dargie | first7 = H. | title = A Comparison of the Reproducibility and the Sensitivity to Change of Visual Analogue Scales, Borg Scales, and Likert Scales in Normal Subjects During Submaximal Exercise | doi = 10.1378/chest.116.5.1208 | journal = Chest | volume = 116 | issue = 5 | pages = 1208–1217 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10559077| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Set points on the RPE scale==
The Borg RPE scale is a numerical scale that ranges from 6 to 20,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/measuring/exertion.html|publisher=CDC|title=Measuring Physical Activity Intensity}}&lt;/ref&gt; where 6 means "no exertion at all" and 20 means "maximal exertion." When a measurement is taken, a number is chosen from the following scale by an individual that best describes their level of exertion during physical activity.
*6&amp;nbsp;– No exertion at all
*7&amp;nbsp;– Extremely light
*8
*9&amp;nbsp;– Very light
*10
*11&amp;nbsp;– Light
*12

A '''ring announcer''' is an in-ring (and sometimes on-camera) employee or contractor for a [[boxing]], [[professional wrestling]] or [[mixed martial arts]] event or promotion, who introduces the competitors to the audience.

In boxing and mixed martial arts bouts, introductions occur after both fighters have entered the ring or cage. Along with each fighter's name, the announcer typically also announces their height, weight, town, nickname, win/loss record and any current or past titles the fighter has won. In MMA, the fighting discipline is usually announced. In professional wrestling, wrestlers are similarly introduced, though usually before or as they come to the ring. In-ring introductions are sometimes used for title matches or other major bouts, to add a "big fight feel".

The ring announcer often states the rules of the match. In boxing and MMA, this is usually limited to the number of scheduled rounds and the length of each round. In professional wrestling, the [[Professional wrestling match types|variations are much more numerous]] and so the announcer may have to explain significantly more to the audience.

When an MMA or boxing bout concludes, the ring announcer announces the winner, time of finish and method. If the fight lasts all scheduled rounds, the announcer will read the fight judges' scorecard totals, before announcing a unanimous, majority, or split decision victory for one of the fighters, or a draw. This is typically done from inside the ring or cage.

In professional wrestling, the announcement is usually performed outside the ring, and typically doesn't mention the time or method of victory; however, as professional wrestling shows do incorporate an official timekeeper at ringside, much like boxing and MMA, some ring announcers may be informed of the time of the fall at the match's conclusion and will relay that information to the audience as well.

Even further to this, some professional wrestling matches will stipulate a time limit, the confines within which a wrestler must win if he wishes to avoid a time-limit draw. In cases like this, the ring announcer may inform the audience of how much time has passed (and will ordinarily do so every five minutes) and how much time remains.

In a championship match, the announcer specifies that the winner is either still the champion or the new champion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15033">{{for|United States Senate Rule 21|Closed sessions of the United States Senate}}
'''Rule 21''' of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) was a rule in force from 1897 to 2001 which banned members of the British [[security forces]] from membership of the GAA and thus from playing [[Gaelic games]]. The affected organisations included the [[British Armed Forces]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC), and prior to [[Partition of Ireland|partition]] the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) and [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]]. As well as the RUC in [[Northern Ireland]], it also applied to [[UK police|police forces in Great Britain]], which affected [[London GAA]] and the other [[British GAA]] affiliates. Rule 21 stated:&lt;ref name="ind26068246"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ind29925280"/&gt;
:Members of the British armed forces or police shall not be eligible for membership of the Association.
:A member of the Association participating in dances, or similar entertainment, promoted by or under the patronage of such bodies, shall incur suspension of at least three months.
The rule was abolished after the establishment of the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) as part of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]].

Rule 21 was introduced in 1897 and reflected the rise of "advanced nationalism", with the GAA and other [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] organisations founded in the [[Gaelic revival]] becoming more politicised and [[separatism|separatist]] in the build-up to the [[Irish revolutionary period|revolutionary period]].&lt;ref name="irishecho2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://irishecho.com/2011/02/gaa-delegates-vote-to-allow-cops-soldiers-3/|title=GAA delegates vote to allow cops, soldiers|last=Bushe|first=Andrew|date=16 February 2011|work=[[Irish Echo]]|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crokepark"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crokepark.ie/gaa-museum/gaa-archive/gaa-museum-irish-times-articles/the-removal-of-douglas-hyde-as-patron-of-the-assoc|title=Articles on the history of the GAA &gt; The Removal of Douglas Hyde as Patron of the Association, 1938|work=Library &amp; Archive|publisher=[[GAA Museum]]|accessdate=25 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905172855/http://www.crokepark.ie/gaa-museum/gaa-archive/gaa-museum-irish-times-articles/the-removal-of-douglas-hyde-as-patron-of-the-assoc|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to allay fears that RIC members were joining GAA clubs to spy on members' political activities.&lt;ref name="irishecho2011"/&gt; It was overshadowed by the introduction in 1901 of [[Rule 27]], commonly called "The Ban", which prohibited GAA members from playing "foreign games" like [[soccer]] and [[rugby union]].&lt;ref name="crokepark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweeney2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nauright2012"/&gt; In 1938 [[Douglas Hyde]], recently inaugurated as first [[President of Ireland]], was removed as Patron of the GAA after attending an [[Ireland national football team (FAI) results|Irish soccer international]].&lt;ref name="crokepark" /&gt; After Rule 27 was abolished in 1971, it was Rule 21 and [[Rule 42]], which prohibited foreign games being played at GAA grounds, which were the focus of debate.&lt;ref name="Sweeney2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Eamonn|title=O'Brien Pocket History of Gaelic Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWWNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT11|accessdate=25 August 2015|date=2012-10-04|publisher=O'Brien Press|isbn=9781847175212|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crokepark.ie/getmedia/7ce8a2b2-5059-47c9-9182-eaaf4ebd2163/senior-winner-shane-finegan.pdf |title=The role played by Tom Woulfe in the campaign (1959–1971) to remove the Ban on Foreign Games (Rule 27) from the rulebook of the GAA |last=Finegan |first=Shane |date=27 May 2011 |work=Winners of Secondary School Essay Competition |publisher=GAA |accessdate=25 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211343/http://www.crokepark.ie/getmedia/7ce8a2b2-5059-47c9-9182-eaaf4ebd2163/Senior-Winner-Shane-Finegan.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland==
After the 1922 creation of the [[Irish Free State]], Rule 21 continued to apply in Northern Ireland. Its strongest supporters were [[Physical force Irish republicanism|physical force republican]]s, and during [[the Troubles]] the GAA was suspected by many [[Irish unionism|unionists]] of collusion with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] and other paramilitaries.&lt;ref name="cronin1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nauright2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nauright|first=John|title=Sports around the World: History, Culture, and Practice|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYBtMajLAaAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA91|accessdate=25 August 2015|date=2012-04-06|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598843019|pages=91–92|chapter=Gaelic Athletic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some advocates of Rule 21 were opposed to any engagement with  "[[Crown forces]]", others linked it to alleged targeting by the security forces of the GAA, in particular the occupation of part of [[Crossmaglen Rangers GAC|Crossmaglen Rangers]]' grounds by a British Army base, which disrupted matches and other events there.&lt;ref name="Hassan2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassan|first=D.|year=2005|title=The Gaelic Athletic Association, Rule 21, and Police Reform in Northern Ireland|journal=Journal of Sport &amp; Social Issues|volume=29|issue=1|pages=60–78|issn=0193-7235|doi=10.1177/0193723504268731}}&lt;/ref&gt; One player affected by the ban was  [[Brian McCargo]] from [[Ardoyne]], who played for [[Antrim GAA|Antrim county team]] before being obliged to quit in 1969 after joining the RUC [[Reserve Police Officers|Reserve]], during a period after the abolition of the [[B Specials]] when some Catholic community leaders were encouraging Catholics to join the revised force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1634688.stm|title='No regrets as a Catholic in the RUC' |date=21 December 2001 |work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean McNulty from [[Warrenpoint]] won an [[All-Ireland Minor Football Championship|All-Ireland minor]] medal in 1977 but joined the RUC in 1982.&lt;ref name="it337706"/&gt; The [[Sports Council for Northern Ireland]] and Northern Ireland [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Department of Education]] made funding grants to GAA bodies while Rule 21 was in force, but at a lower level than would otherwise have been the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/csc/reports/sugdenharvie/sugdenharvie95-1.htm|title=Sport and Community Relations in Northern Ireland|last=Sugden|first=John |author2=Scott Harvie|year=1995|publisher=CAIN|pages=1.5.2 – Gaelic Sport|quote=Official funding for the GAA has been forthcoming through the Department of Education for Northern Ireland (DENI) and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland but has been limited by the continued existence of Rule 21 which excludes members of Northern Ireland’s security forces from joining.(24) This rule means that Gaelic organisations are treated by the government as clubs with restricted membership. As such they are only entitled to between 50% and 33.5% grant aid towards the cost of facilities development.|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==
During the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], abolishing Rule 21 was advocated by unionists, political leaders in the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]], and the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland, whose report led to the replacement of the RUC by the PSNI.&lt;ref name="cronin1999"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Jouvert: A Journal of Postcolonial Studies |publisher=College of the Humanities and Social Sciences |location=North Carolina State University |volume=4 |issue=1: Ireland 2000 |url=http://english.chass.ncsu.edu/jouvert/v4i1/cron.htm|title=Ignoring Postcolonialism: The Gaelic Athletic Association and the Language of Colony |last=Cronin |first=Mike |date=Fall 1999|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/police/patten/chapter15.pdf#page=1 |title=Recruitment |author=Independent Commission On Policing For Northern Ireland |format=PDF |date=9 September 1999 |work=A New Beginning: Policing in Northern Ireland - The Report of the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland |page=89; §15.2 |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was for two reasons: to boost nationalist trust of the police, and to improve unionist trust of the GAA. Nationalists were underrepresented in the RUC, contributing to a self-sustaining cycle of mistrust of it as unionist-biased; on the other hand, unionists saw Rule 21 as evidence of the GAA's support for republican violence. If the GAA ended its prohibition on membership, a reformed police force would be more likely to attract nationalist recruits. The prospect of unionist police officers joining the GAA was not a major consideration.&lt;ref name="it337706"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/support-divided-as-gaa-consider-lifting-controversial-rule-21-ban-1.337706|title=Support divided as GAA consider lifting controversial rule 21 ban|date=17 November 2001|work=[[The Irish Times]]|quote=few seriously believe British soldiers or members of Northern Ireland's brand new police service will be queuing up outside GAA clubs after the weekend|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scrimmage vest''', sometimes referred to as a '''[[Pinafore|pinnie]]''', is a piece of [[clothing]] or [[clothing|sportswear]], often made of mesh, used in practices as a substitute for a sports team's usual uniform or to differentiate temporary teams in informal scrimmages. Some teams elect to have benched players wear them during a game. A vest can come in a variety of forms, including a racerback cut,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lacrossepinnies.com/blog/pinnys/&lt;/ref&gt; collegiate cut, [[basketball]] cut or [[lacrosse]] pinnie.

Vests are usually made from poly-mesh material. [[Screen printing]] or vinyl heat press artwork is often applied directly to the mesh. New techniques include [[Dye-sublimation printer|dye-sublimation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6780">'''Side stitch''' (also called a '''side ache''', a '''side cramp''', a '''side crampie''', a '''side sticker''' or simply the '''stitch''') is an intense stabbing [[pain]] under the lower edge of the [[ribcage]] that occurs while [[exercise|exercising]]. It is also referred to as '''exercise-related transient abdominal pain''' ('''ETAP''').&lt;ref name=pub_med_ischemia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=DP|author2=Callister, R |title=Characteristics and etiology of exercise-related transient abdominal pain.|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|date=February 2000|volume=32|issue=2|pages=432–438|pmid=10694128|doi=10.1097/00005768-200002000-00026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people think that this [[abdominal pain]] may be caused by the internal organs (like the [[liver]] and [[stomach]]) pulling downwards on the [[Diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]],&lt;ref name=Collins09&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Andrew|title=On Running on Lessons from 40 Years of Running.|date=2009|publisher=Authorhouse|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=9781438936246|page=148|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xovMmC_USRYC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that theory is inconsistent with its frequent occurrence during [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]],&lt;ref&gt;"965 athletes in six different sports (running, swimming, cycling, aerobics, basketball, and horse riding). Over the course of a year of training and competition, 75% of swimmers had trouble with stitches, 69% of runners were afflicted, 62% of horse riders had ETAP, 52% of aerobics participants suffered, 47% of basketball players did so, and 32% of cyclists were affected " Characteristics and Etiology of Exercise-Related Transient Abdominal Pain,' Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise, Volume 32 (2), pp. 432-438, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; which involves almost no downward force on these organs. If the pain is present only when exercising and is completely absent at rest, in an otherwise healthy person, it does not require investigation.

== Causes ==
There is no single precise known reason for a stitch to occur. There are, however, a number of popular theories as to what may cause, increase the chances of, or otherwise exacerbate a stitch. A leading theory is that the pain may be caused by an increase in blood flow to the [[liver]] or [[spleen]]. Increases in the heart rate during exercise will force extra red blood cells into the liver which can cause temporary [[hepatomegaly]] and [[portal hypertension]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinically Oriented Anatomy|last=Moore|first=Keith|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary hepatomegaly and portal hypertension can restrict blood flow through the portal vein of the liver thus slowing blood flow to the rest of the body; this is why most runner's cramps are felt on the right side near the liver.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muir|first=Brad|date=2009-12-01|title=Exercise related transient abdominal pain: a case report and review of the literature|journal=The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association|volume=53|issue=4|pages=251–260|issn=0008-3194|pmc=2796944|pmid=20037690}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plausible mechanism for the pain is that high internal pressure in the liver or spleen restricts blood flow, causing hypoxia.

There are other theories regarding side stitches than simple stretching of the [[viscus|visceral]] [[ligaments]] due to repeated vertical translation and jolting. Such theories include diaphragmatic [[ischemia]],&lt;ref name="pub_med_ischemia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Having a stitch explained|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/treatment_room/newsid_2131000/2131547.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; imbalances of the [[Thoracic vertebrae|thoracic spine]],&lt;ref name="pub_med_posture"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=DP|author2=Callister, R |title=Influence of posture and body type on the experience of exercise-related transient abdominal pain.|journal=Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine Australia|date=September 2010|volume=13|issue=5|pages=485–8|pmid=20022301|doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2009.10.487}}&lt;/ref&gt; irritation of the parietal [[peritoneum]]&lt;ref name="pub_med_ischemia" /&gt; and strain on visceral ligaments by a fluid-engorged gut.&lt;ref name="pub_med_ischemia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pub_med_ligaments"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=BT|author2=Hopkins, WG |title=Investigation of the side pain "stitch" induced by running after fluid ingestion.|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|date=August 1999|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1169–75|pmid=10449020|doi=10.1097/00005768-199908000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further theory points to shallow breathing as a possible cause for a stitch&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Stop Runners' Cramps|url=http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/how-to-stop-runners-cramps|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one possible preventative measure involves adjusting at what point in a runner's stride they inhale, or reducing the frequency of inhales (with an increase in inspiratory capacity).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;p 391 The Lore of Running, Tim Noakes, Publisher: Human Kinetics Publishers Date Published: 1991 {{ISBN|978-0-88011-438-7}}  {{ISBN|0-88011-438-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for the variety of theories include, in particular, the prevalence of ETAP during swimming.

Most of the time, side stitches occur on the right side of the body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This may be because the largest organ in the abdominal cavity, the liver, is on that side. Certain athletes also report a pain in the tip of their [[shoulder blade]]. This is believed to be because this is a [[Referred pain|referred site]] of pain for the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve.&lt;ref name=pub_med_ischemia /&gt;{{better source|date=August 2013}} When the side stitch is on the right side, published advice is to try to exhale when the left foot lands.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There is also a belief that an imbalance of electrolytes (such as calcium, potassium, and sodium) in the blood could also contribute to the side stitch.&lt;ref name=webmd /&gt;

'''Sked''' is shortened version of the word ''schedule''. It can refer to a flight schedule, a baseball schedule, or any other type of schedule. In the context of [[amateur radio]] a '''sked''' is a pre-arranged or [http://noji.com/hamradio/glossary.php#sked scheduled contact] between ham radio operators. In boating, a '''sked''' is a pre-arranged check-in via VHF radio with a monitoring agency (rescue, fishing or other) while undertaking a long journey or when at sea for an longer than normal time. This is done for safety purposes to enable a search to start early if something untoward happens.

A '''sked''' is a pocket-sized bifold or trifold schedule about the size of a [[baseball card]] printed for a sports team. Typically, a team logo or an image associated with the team (a player or the stadium or arena, for example) appears on the front, one or more sponsors are listed on the back. Inside is a listing of the season's [[home game|home]] and [[away game]]s.

Skeds are collected as [[sports memorabilia]], trading heavily enough on [[Ebay]] to merit a [//www.ebay.com/sch/Schedules-/64495/i.html category]. Older schedules are like individual works of art, many featuring beautiful artwork, logos and pictures of many stars and hall of fame players. Often variations are available with different sponsors. Schedules can also be quite scarce. Most were put in a wallet and seldom survived past that season, and quantities produced are a lot lower than [[Topps]] or [[Upper Deck]] baseball cards. This makes them desirable as a collectible since many baseball card collectors feel that current baseball card production rates are too high.

== Sked collecting ==
The first reference to sports schedule collecting may be in The Sports Collectors Bible (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sugar|first=Bert|title=The Sports Collectors Bible|year=1979|publisher=The Bobbs-Merrill Company|location=New York|isbn=0-672-52605-0|pages=489–493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectors tend to use the moniker ''skedder'' to identify themselves. Many collectors first realized there were others who collected schedules when they saw ads in the back of Sports publications, advertising schedules for sale or schedules that advertisers were looking for. Collectors began to publish newsletters focused solely on schedules that were distributed to other collectors. Newsletters were made up of sked lists by sport, editorial pieces, and ads from Skedders about schedules they had for sale or trade or schedules they were in search of.

'''Sporting colours''', more often known merely as &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/colour|title=colour Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;''colours'' or ''house-colours'', are awarded to members of a university or school who have excelled in a sport.  Colours are traditionally worn in or on scarves, ties, blazers, gowns, cuff-links, and other items of apparel. The award system gives rise to phrases such as ''an Oxford Blue'', meaning a person who was awarded a [[Oxford Blue|Blue]] by the [[University of Oxford]]. Similarly a [[Cambridge Blue (colour)|Cambridge Blue]] is awarded by the [[University of Cambridge]]. ''Colours are not however, always known as 'a Blue'.''  A 'university sporting blue' is a generic term which stems from the Oxford and Cambridge Blue, but 'Colours' by definition may be any colour, and often reflect the colours associated with the school uniform, crest, or other significant semiotic.

In some award schemes, it is possible to receive a half colour, such as a Half-Blue. Typically, a given institution will award a single colour; for example, Cambridge and Oxford awards are different shades of blue, and the [[University of London]] awards a Purple.

American universities tend to award a [[varsity letter]] rather than a colour.

The system is common in the majority of British  [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep schools]], [[Independent school (UK)|independent schools]] and old schools of Australia, South African and Sri Lanka. Often [[blazer]]s are given to denote pupils who have achieved in a sport. The blazers are often distinct from the standard school blazer though often colours simply take the form of embellished arms or braided cord or ribbon edging on the standard blazer. Ties are also used as a common way of displaying representative ''colours''.

'''Sports economics''' is a discipline of [[economics]] focused on its relationship to [[sports]]. It covers both the ways in which economists can study the distinctive institutions of sports, and the ways in which sports can allow economists to research many topics, including [[discrimination]] and [[antitrust law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195387773.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195387773 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Sports Economics |date=2012-04-13 |publisher=Oxford University Press |language=en |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195387773.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical foundations of the discipline are heavily based on [[microeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.studyingeconomics.ac.uk/module-options/sports-economics/ |title=Sports Economics  |website=Studying Economics |language=en |access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, about 100 to 120 college professors taught sports economics courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/2006-07-27-sports-econ-usat_x.htm |title=Batter up!

{{Journalism sidebar}}
'''Sports journalism''' is a form of [[writing]] that reports on [[sport]]ing topics and [[sports competition|competitions]]. 

Sports [[journalism]] is the essential element of many [[news media]] organizations. While the sports department (along with [[Entertainment journalism|entertainment news]]) within some [[newspaper]]s has been mockingly called the ''toy department'', because sports [[journalist]]s do not concern themselves with the 'serious' topics covered by the news desk, sports coverage has grown in importance as sport has grown in [[wealth]], [[Economic power|power]], and [[Social influence|influence]].

Also, some media organizations are devoted entirely to sports [[Journalism|reporting]] — newspapers and [[magazine]]s such as ''[[L'Equipe]]'' in [[France]], ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' in [[Italy]], ''[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'' in [[Spain]], the defunct ''[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' in Britain, and American ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and ''[[Sporting News]]''; [[television network]]s such as ''[[Eurosport]]'', ''[[Fox Sports]]'', ''[[ESPN]]''; [[sports radio]] stations such as ''[[BBC Radio 5 Live]]'', ''[[ESPN Radio]]'', ''[[Fox Sports Radio]]'' and ''[[TSN Radio]]''; and ''[[The Sports Network|The Sports Network (TSN)]]''; and websites such as [[ESPN.com]], [[Foxsports.com]], and [[Yahoo! Sports]].

== Socio-political significance ==
[[Major League Baseball]] gave print journalists a special role in its games. They were named [[official scorer]]s and kept statistics that were considered part of the official record of league.  Active sportswriters were removed from this role in 1980.  Although their statistical judgment calls could not affect the outcome of a game in progress, the awarding of errors and wins/saves were seen as powerful influences on pitching staff selections and play lists when coach decisions seemed unusual.  The removal of writers, who could benefit fiscally from sensational sports stories, was done to remove this perception of a [[conflict of interest]], and to increase statistics volume, consistency, and accuracy.

Sports stories occasionally transcend the games themselves and take on socio-political significance: [[Jackie Robinson]] breaking the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]] in baseball is an example of this. Modern controversies regarding the hyper-compensation of top athletes, the use of [[anabolic steroids]] and other, banned [[performance-enhancing drugs]], and the cost to local and national governments to build sports venues and related infrastructure, especially for [[Olympic Games]], also demonstrates how sports can intrude on to the news pages.

Sportswriters regularly face more deadline pressure than other reporters because sporting events tend to occur late in the day and closer to the deadlines many organizations must observe. Yet they are expected to use the same tools as news journalists, and to uphold the same professional and ethical standards. They must take care not to show bias for any team.

== In Europe ==
The tradition of sports reporting attracting some of the finest writers in journalism can be traced to the coverage of sport in Victorian England, where several modern sports – such as association football, [[cricket]], [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]] – were first organized and codified into something resembling what we would recognize today.&lt;!-- Reference?  --&gt;

Andrew Warwick has suggested that [[The Boat Race]] provided the first mass spectator event for journalistic coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Warwick (2003) ''Masters of Theory: Cambridge and the Rise of Mathematical Physics'',  page 213, [[University of Chicago Press]]  {{ISBN|0-226-87374-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Race, an annual [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] event between the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford]], has been held annually from 1856.

[[Cricket]], possibly because of its esteemed place in society, has regularly attracted the most elegant of writers. The ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'', in the first half of the 20th century, employed [[Neville Cardus]] as its cricket correspondent as well as its music critic. Cardus was later knighted for his services to journalism. One of his successors, [[John Arlott]], who became a worldwide favorite because of his radio commentaries on the [[BBC]], was also known for his poetry.

The first [[1908 Summer Olympics|London Olympic Games]] in 1908 attracted such widespread public interest that many newspapers assigned their very best-known writers to the event. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' even had Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] at the [[White City Stadium]] to cover the finish of the [[Marathon]].

Such was the drama of that race, in which [[Dorando Pietri]] collapsed within sight of the finishing line when leading, that Conan Doyle led a public subscription campaign to see the gallant Italian, having been denied the gold medal through his disqualification, awarded a special silver cup, which was presented by [[Queen Alexandra]]. And the public imagination was so well caught by the event that annual races in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, and London, and at future Olympics, were henceforward staged over exactly the same, 26-mile, 385-yard distance used for the [[1908 Olympic Marathon]], and the official length of the event worldwide to this day.

The London race, called the [[Polytechnic Marathon]] and originally staged over the 1908 Olympic route from outside the royal residence at [[Windsor Castle]] to White City, was first sponsored by the ''Sporting Life'', which in those Edwardian times was a daily newspaper which sought to cover all sporting events, rather than just a betting paper for horse racing and greyhounds that it became in the years after the [[Second World War]].

The rise of the radio made sports journalism more focused on the live coverage of the sporting events. The first sports reporter in Great Britain, and one of the first sports reporters in the World, was an English writer [[Edgar Wallace]], who made a report on [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] on June 6, 1923 for the [[British Broadcasting Company]].

In France, ''[[L'Auto]]'', the predecessor of ''L'Equipe'', had already played an equally influential part in the sporting fabric of society when it announced in 1903 that it would stage an annual bicycle race around the country. The [[Tour de France]] was born, and sports journalism's role in its foundation is still reflected today in the leading rider wearing a yellow jersey - the color of the paper on which ''L'Auto'' was published (in Italy, the [[Giro d'Italia]] established a similar tradition, with the leading rider wearing a jersey the same pink color as the sponsoring newspaper, ''La Gazzetta'').

== Sports stars in the press box ==
After the Second World War, the sports sections of British national daily and Sunday newspapers continued to expand, to the point where many papers now have separate standalone sports sections; some Sunday tabloids even have sections, additional to the sports pages, devoted solely to the previous day's football reports. In some respects, this has replaced the earlier practice of many regional newspapers which - until overtaken by the pace of modern electronic media - would produce special results editions rushed out on Saturday evenings.

Some newspapers, such as ''[[Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', with 1924 Olympic 100 metres champion [[Harold Abrahams]], or the London ''Evening News'' using former England cricket captain Sir [[Leonard Hutton]], began to adopt the policy of hiring former sports stars to pen columns, which were often ghost written. Some such ghosted columns, however, did little to further the reputation of sports journalism, which is increasingly becoming the subject of academic scrutiny of its standards.

Many "ghosted" columns were often run by independent sports agencies, based in Fleet Street or in the provinces, who had signed up the sports star to a contract and then syndicated their material among various titles. These agencies included Pardons, or the [[Cricket Reporting Agency]], which routinely provided the editors of the [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]] cricket almanac, and Hayters.

Sportswriting in Britain has attracted some of the finest journalistic talents. The ''Daily Mirror'''s Peter Wilson, [[Hugh McIlvanney]], first at ''The Observer'' and lately at the ''Sunday Times'', [[Ian Wooldridge]] of the ''Daily Mail'' and soccer writer [[Brian Glanville]], best known at the ''Sunday Times'', and columnist Patrick Collins, of the ''Mail on Sunday'', five times the winner of the Sports Writer of the Year Award.

Many became household names in the late 20th century through their trenchant reporting{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} of often earth-shattering events that have transcended the back pages and been reported on the front pages: the [[Munich massacre|Massacre at the Munich Olympics]] in 1972; [[Muhammad Ali]]'s fight career, including his 1974 title bout against [[George Foreman]]; the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster|Heysel]] Stadium disaster; and the career highs and lows of the likes of [[Tiger Woods]], [[George Best]], [[David Beckham]], [[Lester Piggott]] and other high-profile stars.

McIlvanney and Wooldridge, who died in March 2007, aged 75, both enjoyed careers that saw them frequently work in television. During his career, Wooldridge became so famous that, like the sports stars he reported upon, he hired the services of [[IMG (company)|IMG]], the agency founded by the American businessman, [[Mark McCormack]], to manage his affairs. Glanville wrote several books, including novels, as well as scripting the memorable official film to the 1966 World Cup staged in England.

== Investigative journalism and sport ==
Since the 1990s, the growing importance of sport, its impact as a global business and the huge amounts of money involved in the staging of events such as the Olympic Games and football World Cups, has also attracted the attention of investigative journalists. The sensitive nature of the relationships between sports journalists and the subjects of their reporting, as well as declining budgets experienced by most Fleet Street newspapers, has meant that such long-term projects have often emanated from television documentary makers.

[[Tom Bower]], with his 2003 sports book of the year ''Broken Dreams'', which analyzed British football, followed in the tradition established a decade earlier by [[Andrew Jennings]] and [[Vyv Simson]] with their controversial investigation of corruption within the International Olympic Committee. Jennings and Simson's ''The Lords of the Rings'' in many ways predicted the scandals that were to emerge around the staging of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City; Jennings would follow-up with two further books on the Olympics and one on [[FIFA]], the world football body.

Likewise, award-winning writers [[Duncan Mackay (journalist)|Duncan Mackay]], of ''The Guardian'', and [[Steven Downes]] unravelled many scandals involving doping, fixed races and bribery in international athletics in their 1996 book, ''Running Scared'', which offered an account of the threats by a senior track official that led to the suicide of their sports journalist colleague, [[Cliff Temple]].

But the writing of such exposes - referred to as "spitting in the soup" by [[Paul Kimmage]], the former Tour de France professional cyclist, now an award-winning writer for the ''Sunday Times'' – often requires the view of an outsider who is not compromised by the need of day-to-day dealings with sportsmen and officials, as required by "beat" correspondents.
 
The stakes can be high when upsetting sport's powers: in 2007, England's [[the Football Association|FA]] opted to switch its multimillion-pound contract for UK coverage rights of the [[FA Cup]] and England international matches from the BBC to rival broadcasters ITV. One of the reasons cited was that the BBC had been too critical of the performances of the [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/2323773/Exclusive-the-England-players-revolt.html England football team].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Sports books==

Increasingly, sports journalists have turned to [[Long-form journalism|long-form writing]], producing popular books on a range of sporting topics, including biographies, history and investigations. [[Dan Topolski]] was the first recipient of the [[William Hill Sports Book of the Year]] award in 1989, which has continued to reward authors for their excellence in sports literature.

== Organizations ==
Most countries have their own national [[Sports Journalists' Association|association of sports journalists]]. Many sports also have their own clubs and associations for specified journalists. These organizations attempt to maintain the standard of press provision at sports venues, to oversee fair accreditation procedures and to celebrate high standards of sports journalism.

The International Sports Press Association, AIPS, was founded in 1924 during the Olympic Games in Paris, at the headquarters of the Sporting Club de France, by Frantz Reichel, the press chief of the Paris Games, and the Belgian Victor Boin. AIPS operates through a system of continental sub-associations and national associations, and liaises closely with some of the world's biggest sports federations, including the [[International Olympic Committee]], football's world governing body FIFA, and the [[IAAF]], the international track and field body. The first statutes of AIPS mentioned these objectives:
* to enhance the cooperation between its member associations in defending sport and the professional interest of their members.
* to strengthen the friendship, solidarity and common interests between sports journalists of all countries.
* to assure the best possible working conditions for the members.

For horse racing the Horserace Writers and Photographers’ Association was founded in 1927, was revived in 1967, and represents the interests of racing journalists in every branch of the media.

[[File:Press room at the Philips Stadion.jpg|thumb|Press room at the Philips Stadion, home of [[PSV Eindhoven]], prior to a press conference]]

In Britain, the Sports Journalists' Association was founded in 1948. It stages two awards events, an annual Sports Awards ceremony which recognizes outstanding performances by British sportsmen and women during the previous year, and the British Sports Journalism Awards, the industry's "Oscars", sponsored by UK Sport and presented each March. Founded as the Sports Writers' Association, following a merger with the Professional Sports Photographers' Association in 2002, the organization changed its title to the more inclusive SJA. Its president is the veteran broadcaster and columnist [[Sir Michael Parkinson]]. The SJA represents the British sports media on the [[British Olympic Association]]'s press advisory committee and acts as a consultant to organizers of major events who need guidance on media requirements as well as seeking to represent its members' interests in a range of activities. In March 2008, [[Martin Samuel]], then the chief football correspondent of ''The Times'', was named British Sportswriter of the Year, the first time any journalist had won the award three years in succession. At the same awards, [[Jeff Stelling]], of Sky Sports, was named Sports Broadcaster of the Year for the third time, a prize determined by a ballot of SJA members. Stelling won the vote again the following year, when the ''Sunday Times'''s Paul Kimmage won the interviewer of the year prize for a fifth time.

In the United States, the Indianapolis-based [[National Sports Journalism Center]] monitors trends and strategy within the sports media industry. The center is also home to the Associated Press Sports Editors, the largest group of sports media professionals in the country.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In more recent years,{{When|date=May 2015}} sports journalism has turned its attention to online news and press release media and provided services to Associated Press and other major news syndication services. This has become even more apparent with the increase in online social engagement. This has led to an increasing number of freelance journalism in the sports industry and an explosion of sports related news and industry websites.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Fanzines and blogs ==
Through the 1970s and '80s, a rise in "citizen journalism" in Europe was witnessed in the rapid growth in popularity of soccer "fanzines" - cheaply printed magazines written by fans for fans that bypassed often stilted official club match programs and traditional media. Many continue today and thrive.

Some authors, such as [[Jim Munro]], have been adopted by their clubs. Once an editor of the [[West Ham United]] fanzine ''Fortune's Always Dreaming'', Munro was hired by the club to write for its matchday magazine and is now sports editor of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' Online. Other titles, such as the irreverent monthly soccer magazine ''When Saturday Comes'', have effectively gone mainstream.

The advent of the internet has seen much of this fan-generated energy directed into sports blogs. Ranging from team-centric blogs to those that cover the sports media itself, [[Bleacher Report]], [[Deadspin.com]], ProFootballTalk.com, BaseballEssential.com, Tireball Sports, AOL Fanhouse, [http://www.massholesports.com Masshole Sports], the blogs in the [[Yardbarker]] Network, and others have garnered massive followings.

Blogging has also been taken up by former athletes such as [[Curt Schilling]], [[Paula Radcliffe]], [[Greg Oden]], [[Donovan McNabb]], and [[Chris Cooley (American football)|Chris Cooley]].

==Smartphones==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2015}}
Since the beginning of smartphones and the use of applications, sports media has taken off and has become accessible from almost anywhere at any time. Not only can fans check the scores on different apps such as ESPN and Global Sports Media, but people can use social media apps as well to find out different scores. These apps give score updates, rosters, game schedules, injury updates, and much more right when it happens. People can get real time results right from their phone. They do not need to be at the game, or right by their television, to see how their favorite team is doing. Now people can stream games right from their phone.

This type of fast, easy information is very important to sports fans. As stated in a Time magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/01/26/social-media-and-sports-natural-teammates/|title=Social Media and Sports: Natural Teammates|work=TIME.com|accessdate=21 May 2015|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Enthusiastic fans are eager for updates on their favorite teams and the opportunity to rant about what went wrong in the playoffs or why their coach should be fired”. Many people want to discuss matters about sports, teams and games, and this article shows that with the sports apps, the news can be found at a moment’s notice.

Thanks to the smartphone, a fan no longer has to wait for scores or search the web for information on players. All the information is available at the palm of their hand. Sports apps do not always have to be about giving scores, as some applications include workout helpers, rule books, and even games. The workout apps can show how the professionals’ workout and can give inspiration to do the same workout. The rule books are important, because it spreads the knowledge about the game, and it can get people interested in new games. The games apps are a good way of teaching people how the game is played, and can give players a bigger interest in a specific sport. All of these different apps are a part of sports media in the form of using smartphones and apps. This helps spread information about sports to anyone who wants it.

Smartphones can not only be used just for scores, they can also help athletes become known and recruited. These days most everything is caught on camera, and that includes great plays made by athletes. Once a video is taken it will be spread through the social media sites in no time.

==Gender==

The number of women in the sports journalism industry is rapidly growing, and this has caused a lot of controversy in recent years. Many traditionalists believe that the sporting industry should be predominately for men, and female journalists have endured a lot of criticism for breaking the mold.

There has been an ongoing debate as to whether or not female reporters should be allowed in the locker rooms after games. If they are denied access, this gives male reporters a competitive advantage in the field, as they can interview players in the locker room after games. If locker room access is denied to all reporters - male and female - because of this controversy, male journalists would likely resent female reporters for having their access taken away.

Some breakthrough female reporters include [[Adeline Daley]] (whom some consider the "Jackie Robinson of female sportswriters"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kipen|first=David|title=Fact: The Golden State is the epicenter of baseball, a mother lode of sun-ripened talent|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Fact-The-Golden-State-is-the-epicenter-of-2705387.php|accessdate=2014-05-20|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2004-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Anita Martini]], Tracy Dodds, [[Mary Garber]], [[Lesley Visser]] and [[Sally Jenkins]].

A '''sports rating system''' is a system that analyzes the results of sports competitions to provide [[Evaluation|rating]]s for each team or player. Common systems include polls of expert voters, [[crowdsourcing]] non-expert voters, betting markets, and computer systems. Ratings, or '''power ratings''', are numerical representations of competitive strength, often directly comparable so that the game outcome between any two teams can be predicted. [[Ranking]]s, or '''power rankings''', can be directly provided (e.g., by asking people to rank teams), or can be derived by sorting each team's ratings and assigning an [[Ordinal scale|ordinal]] rank to each team, so that the highest rated team earns the #1 rank. Rating systems provide an alternative to traditional sports [[standings]] which are based on win-loss-tie ratios.

[[File:UCF at the Texas goal line.jpg|thumb|right|College football players in the United States]]
In the United States, the biggest use of sports ratings systems is to rate [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] college football teams in [[NCAA Division I|Division I FBS]], choosing teams to play in the [[College Football Playoff]]. Sports ratings systems are also used to help determine the field for the NCAA [[College basketball|men's and women's basketball]] tournaments, men's professional [[golf]] tournaments, professional [[tennis]] tournaments, and [[NASCAR]]. They are often mentioned in discussions about the teams that could or should receive invitations to participate in certain contests, despite not earning the most direct entrance path (such as a league championship).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2011-03-09/sorting-through-teams-on-one-big-bubble |website=[[Sporting News]] |accessdate=2011-03-24 |date=2011-03-09 |last=Fagan |first=Ryan |title=Sorting through teams on one big bubble |quote=This is a look at 20 of the teams (in alphabetical order) residing on this year’s big ol’ bubble. We’ve included three statistical rankings. The RPI (ratings percentage index, taken from collegeRPI.com) is considered the standard and is provided to committee members during the selection process. The two other ranking indexes include margin of victory in their formulas—the Pomeroy ratings (at kenpom.com) and Sagarin ratings (via USA Today)—aren’t new but have played an increased role in discussions about potential seeds during this college basketball season.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer rating systems can tend toward [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]], without specific player, team, regional, or style bias. [[Ken Massey]] writes that an advantage of computer rating systems is that they can "objectively track all" 351 college basketball teams, while human polls "have limited value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[Ken Massey]] |user= masseyratings|number= 529238966965661696 |date= 3 Nov 2014 |title= @kenpomeroy human polls have limited value.  Computer systems can objectively track all the teams.  http://www.masseyratings.com/cb/compare.htm #all351 |access-date= 9 Nov 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer ratings are verifiable and repeatable, and are comprehensive, requiring assessment of all selected criteria. By comparison, rating systems relying on human polls include inherent human subjectivity; this may or may not be an attractive property depending on system needs.

== History ==

Sports ratings systems have been around for almost 80 years, when ratings were calculated on paper rather than by computer, as most are today.  Some older computer systems still in use today include: [[Jeff Sagarin|Jeff Sagarin's]] systems, the ''[[New York Times]]'' system, and the [[Dunkel Index]], which dates back to 1929. Before the advent of the college football playoff, the [[Bowl Championship Series]] championship game participants were determined by a combination of expert polls and computer systems.

== Theory ==

Sports ratings systems use a variety of methods for rating teams, but the most prevalent method is called a power rating.  The power rating of a team is a calculation of the team's strength relative to other teams in the same league or division.  The basic idea is to maximize the amount of [[transitive relation]]s in a given data set due to game outcomes.  For example, if A defeats B and B defeats C, then one can safely say that A&gt;B&gt;C.

There are obvious problems with basing a system solely on wins and losses.  For example, if C defeats A, then an [[Intransitivity|intransitive]] relation is established (A&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;C&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;A) and a ranking violation will occur if this is the only data available.  Scenarios such as this happen fairly regularly in sports—for example, in the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season]], [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] beat [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], Ohio State beat [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], and Michigan beat Penn State.  To address these logical breakdowns, rating systems usually consider other criteria such as the game's score and where the match was held (for example, to assess a [[home field advantage]]).  In most cases though, each team plays a sufficient amount of other games during a given season, which lessens the overall effect of such violations.

From an [[academic]] perspective, the use of [[linear algebra]] and [[statistics]] are popular among many of the systems' authors to determine their ratings. Some academic work is published in forums like the [[MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference]], others in traditional statistics, mathematics, psychology, and computer science journals.

If sufficient "inter-divisional" league play is not accomplished, teams in an isolated division may be artificially propped up or down in the overall ratings due to a lack of correlation to other teams in the overall league.  This phenomenon is evident in systems that analyze historical college football seasons, such as when the top [[Ivy League]] teams of the 1970s, like [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], were calculated by some rating systems to be comparable with accomplished powerhouse teams of that era such as [[University of Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], and [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]].  This conflicts with the subjective opinion that claims that while good in their own right, they were not nearly as good as those top programs.  However, this may be considered a "pro" by non-[[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] teams in Division I-A college football who point out that ratings systems have proven that their top teams belong in the same strata as the BCS teams.  This is evidenced by the 2004 [[University of Utah|Utah]] team that went undefeated in the regular season and earned a BCS bowl bid due to the bump in their overall BCS ratings via the computer ratings component.  They went on to play and defeat the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] champion [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] in the 2005 [[Fiesta Bowl]] by a score of 35-7.  A related example occurred during the 2006 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament]] where [[George Mason University|George Mason]] were awarded an at-large tournament bid due to their regular season record and their [[Ratings Percentage Index|RPI rating]] and rode that opportunity all the way to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]].

Goals of some rating systems differ from one another. For example, systems may be crafted to provide a perfect retrodictive analysis of the games played to-date, while others are predictive and give more weight to future trends rather than past results.  This results in the potential for misinterpretation of rating system results by people unfamiliar with these goals; for example, a rating system designed to give accurate [[point spread]] predictions for gamblers might be ill-suited for use in selecting teams most deserving to play in a championship game or tournament.

==Rating considerations==

===Home advantage===
[[File:France national team fans.jpg|thumb|right|France national basketball team fans]]
{{main article|Home advantage}}
When two teams of equal quality play, the team at home tends to win more often. The size of the effect changes based on the era of play, game type, season length, sport, even [[Circadian advantage|number of time zones crossed]]. But across all conditions, "simply playing at home increases the chances of winning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wjh.harvard.edu/~jamieson/JJ_JASP.pdf|title=The Home Field Advantage in Athletics: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|last=Jamieson|first=Jeremy P.|accessdate=11 November 2014|date=2010|volume=40|issue=7|pages=1819–1848|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A win away from home is therefore seen more favorably than a win at home, because it was more challenging. Home advantage (which, for sports played on a pitch, is almost always called "home field advantage") is also based on the qualities of the individual stadium and crowd; the advantage in the NFL can be more than a 4-point difference from the stadium with the least advantage to the stadium with the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/bill-barnwell-best-home-field-advantages/|website=[[Grantland]]|last=Barnwell|first=Bill|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2014|title=Safe at Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strength of schedule===
{{main article|Strength of schedule}}
Strength of schedule refers to the quality of a team's opponents. A win against an inferior opponent is usually seen less favorably than a win against a superior opponent. Often teams in the same league, who are compared against each other for championship or playoff consideration, have not played the same opponents. Therefore, judging their relative win-loss records is complicated.
{{quote|text=We looked beyond the record. The committee placed significant value on Oregon's quality of wins.|sign=[[College football playoff]] committee chairman [[Jeff Long (athletic director)|Jeff Long]]|source=press conference, week 12 of the 2014 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Russo |first=Ralph D. |title=Oregon up to 2 in playoff rankings; TCU to 4th |url=http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/347875155d53465d95cec892aeb06419/Article_2014-11-11-FBC-Playoff-Rankings/id-c0570dfb5a0044a798224fbef5da73b8 |agency=Associated Press |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after ranking 9–1 Oregon above 9–0 Florida State}}
The college football playoff committee uses a limited strength-of-schedule algorithm that only considers opponents' records and opponents' opponents' records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[Stewart Mandel]] |user= slmandel|number= 532624545300369408 |date= 12 Nov 2014 |title= Committee doesn't use an SOS ranking. It looks at opponents' record and opponents' opponents record. |access-date= 12 Nov 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (much like [[Ratings Percentage Index|RPI]]).

===Points versus wins===
A key dichotomy among sports rating systems lies in the representation of game outcomes. Some systems store final scores as [[Three-valued logic|ternary]] discrete events: wins, draws, and losses. Other systems record the exact final game score, then judge teams based on [[margin of victory]]. Rating teams based on margin of victory is often criticized as creating an incentive for coaches to run up the score, an "unsportsmanlike" outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/RICHARDS%253A-BCS-removes-margin-of-victory-element |newspaper=[[Fox Sports]] |date=2001 |accessdate=12 November 2014|last=Richards|first=Darryl|title=BCS removes margin-of-victory element}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other systems choose a middle ground, reducing the [[marginal value]] of additional points as the margin of victory increases. Sagarin chose to clamp the margin of victory to a predetermined amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/ncaaf/sagarin/|title=NCAAF Jeff Sagarin Ratings|last=Sagarin|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Sagarin|date=Fall 2014|accessdate=12 November 2014|website=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches include the use of a decay function, such as a [[logarithm]] or placement on a [[cumulative distribution function]].

===In-game information===
Beyond points or wins, some system designers choose to include more granular information about the game. Examples include time of possession of the ball, individual statistics, and lead changes. Data about weather, injuries, or "throw-away" games near season's end may affect game outcomes but are difficult to model. "Throw-away games" are games where teams have already earned playoff slots and have secured their playoff seeding before the end of the regular season, and want to rest/protect their starting players by benching them for remaining regular season games. This usually results in unpredictable outcomes and may skew the outcome of rating systems.

===Team composition===
Teams often shift their composition between and within games, and players routinely get injured. Rating a team is often about rating a specific collection of players. Some systems assume [[parity (sports)|parity]] among all members of the league, such as each team being built from an equitable pool of players via a [[Draft (sports)|draft]] or [[free agent|free agency]] system as is done in many major league sports such as the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Major League Baseball|MLB]], [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and [[National Hockey League|NHL]]. This is certainly not the case in collegiate leagues such as Division I-A football or men's and women's basketball.

===Cold start===
At the beginning of a season, there have been no games from which to judge teams' relative quality. Solutions to the cold start problem often include some measure of the previous season, perhaps weighted by what percent of the team is returning for the new season. [[ARGH Power Ratings]] is an example of a system that uses multiple previous years plus a percentage weight of returning players.

==Rating methods==
{{inc-sport}}

===Permutation of standings===
Several methods offer some permutation of traditional standings. This search for the "real" win-loss record often involves using other data, such as point differential or identity of opponents, to alter a team's record in a way that is easily understandable. Sportswriter [[Gregg Easterbrook]] created a measure of Authentic Games, which only considers games played against opponents deemed to be of sufficiently high quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/TMQWeekEleven141118/more-defensive-penalties-causes-change-nfl-tuesday-morning-quarterback|title=More flags on D spins scoreboards|last=Easterbrook|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Easterbrook|date=18 November 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014|website=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus is that all wins are not created equal.
{{quote|text=I went through the first few weeks of games and redid everyone’s records, tagging each game as either a legitimate win or loss, an ass-kicking win or loss, or an either/or game. And if anything else happened in that game with gambling repercussions – a comeback win, a blown lead, major dysfunction, whatever — I tagged that, too.|sign=[[Bill Simmons]], sportswriter|source=[[Grantland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/week-8-picks-a-gambling-epiphany/|title=Week 8 Picks: A Gambling Epiphany|last=Simmons|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Simmons|date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014|website=[[Grantland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Pythagorean====
{{main article|Pythagorean expectation}}
Pythagorean expectation, or Pythagorean projection, calculates a percentage based on the number of points a team has scored and allowed. Typically the formula involves the number of points scored, raised to some exponent, placed in the numerator. Then the number of points the team allowed, raised to the same exponent, is placed in the denominator and added to the value in the numerator. [[Football Outsiders]] has used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schatz|first1=Aaron|last2=Alamar|first2=Ben|last3=Barnwell|first3=Bill |author4=Bill Connelly |author5=Doug Farrar|title=Football Outsiders Almanac 2011: The Essential Guide to the 2011 NFL and College Football Seasons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E84YYAAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=978-1-4662-4613-3|page=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Pythagorean wins} = \frac{\text{Points For}^{2.37}}{\text{Points For}^{2.37} + \text{Points Against}^{2.37}}\times \text{Games Played}.&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting percentage is often compared to a team's true winning percentage, and a team is said to have "overachieved" or "underachieved" compared to the Pythagorean expectation. For example, [[Bill Barnwell]] calculated that before week 9 of the 2014 NFL season, the [[Arizona Cardinals]] had a Pythagorean record two wins lower than their real record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nfl-at-the-half-breaking-down-the-numbers/|title=NFL at the Half: Breaking Down the Numbers|last=Barnwell|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Barnwell|date=November 5, 2014|accessdate=January 7, 2015|website=[[Grantland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Simmons]] cites Barnwell's work before week 10 of that season and adds that "any numbers nerd is waving a “REGRESSION!!!!!” flag right now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/revisiting-the-y2k-compliant-quarterbacks/|last=Simmons|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Simmons|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=10 November 2014|title=Revisiting the Y2K-Compliant Quarterbacks}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, the Arizona Cardinals' regular season record was 8-1 going into the 10th week of the 2014 season. The Pythagorean win formula implied a winning percentage of 57.5%, based on 208 points scored and 183 points allowed. Multiplied by 9 games played, the Cardinals' Pythagorean expectation was 5.2 wins and 3.8 losses. The team had "overachieved" at that time by 2.8 wins, derived from their actual 8 wins less the expected 5.2 wins, an increase of 0.8 overachieved wins from just a week prior.

===Trading "skill points"===
{{main article|Elo rating system}}
Originally designed by [[Arpad Elo]] as a method for ranking chess players, several people have adapted the Elo rating system for team sports such as basketball, soccer and American football. For instance, [[Jeff Sagarin]] and [[FiveThirtyEight]] publish NFL football rankings using Elo methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/introducing-nfl-elo-ratings/|title=Introducing NFL Elo Ratings|last=Silver|first=Nate|authorlink=Nate Silver|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=10 November 2014|website=[[FiveThirtyEight]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elo ratings initially assign strength values to each team, and teams trade points based on the outcome of each game.

===Solving equations===

Researchers like Matt Mills use [[Markov chains]] to model college football games, with team strength scores as outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thespread.us/continuous-markov-ratings.html|last=Mills|first=Matt|website=The Spread|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=21 December 2014|title=Using Continuous-Time Markov Chains to Rank College Football Teams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algorithms like Google's [[PageRank]] have also been adapted to rank football teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ranking-nfl-teams-using-network-science-konstantinos-pelechrinis?trk=prof-post/|website=[[LinkedIN]]|date=17 March 2016|accessdate=17 March 2016|title=Ranking NFL teams using Network Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/CFBAnalysis/comments/2ppfg3/modifying_googles_page_ranking_algorithm_to_rank/|website=[[Reddit]]|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014|title=Modifying Google's Page Ranking Algorithm to rank teams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Street workout''' is a physical activity performed mostly in outdoor parks or public facilities. It originated in Ancient Greece, but became a popular movement in Russia, Eastern Europe, and the [[United States]], especially in [[New York City]], Baltimore's urban neighborhoods and Myanmar.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  It has now spread all over the world. It is a combination of [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[calisthenics]], and [[sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CALISTHENICS - Street Workout Academy|url = http://streetworkoutacademy.com/calisthenics/#|website = Street Workout Academy|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017}} Street workout is a modern name for bodyweight workouts in outdoor parks. Street workout teams and organized competitions exist.

== Overview ==
A typical street workout routine often consists of [[physical exercises]] such as pull-ups, chin-ups, push-ups, dips, muscle-ups, sit-ups and squats. Street workout also involves some static (isometric) holds such as the human flag, front lever, back lever and planche.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Isometric exercises - Street Workouts|url = https://www.street-workouts.com/tag/isometric-exercises/|website = Street Workouts|access-date = 2016-01-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017}}

Street workout is divided in two main branches, the first one being strength training and the second dynamics. Strength training includes the isometric holds like: planche, front lever, back lever, etc. Also, strength training includes single arm pull ups, hefestos, muscle-ups and many others. Dynamics includes movements like 360s and its variations, switchblades, and an incredible variety of tricks developed by the athletes which are connected with other moves in order to create routines or sets.

Some of the main benefits of street workout activities are:

* It is a social event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the beginning of the 21st century, [[bodyweight exercise|classic exercises]] were modified and combined with elements from other sports. The starting point of the whole was New York. Through the sports parks there, people could do their workout without fitness studios. Sport or workout parks consist mostly of different pull-up bars, bars and hammocks, so that training is mainly with one's own body weight.

Different groups developed their own style by combining classical calisthenics with exercises from gymnastics, break dance, hip hop and freerunning, or to develop new movements themselves. These groups presented videos of the novel form of calisthenics on the internet and thus triggered a regular boom, especially in Eastern Europe.

In 2011 the first World Championship for Calisthenics / Street Workout in Riga was held. The WSWCF is the World Street Workout and Calisthenics Federation. Since then, a world championship has been held every year.

Among the best-known representatives of the modern calisthenics are the groups Barentaz, Baristi, Barstarzz, Bar-Barians and Street Workout Ukraine, and individuals such as Hannibal for King and Frank Medrano.

==Basics of street workout==
A typical street workout routine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.street-workouts.com/street-workout-programs/|title = Street Workout Programs|date = |access-date = 2016-01-16|website = Street Workouts|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of:
* [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] exercising – a system of exercises with various levels of exertion provided for health strengthening, development of strength and stamina, as well as for shaping an athletic constitution. Athletics exercising is used to increase strength level, develop physical shape and for rehabilitation.
* [[Isometric exercise]]s – a type of strength training whereby you hold a static position.
* [[Calisthenics]] (Kalestenos) – is a complex of many simple exercises which are performed using purely body weight. The aim of these exercises is to train muscular strength and to evolve comprehensive fitness.
* [[Calisthenics|Urban calisthenics]] – a form of body weight exercise performed with no or little apparatus. Individuals and/or groups train and exercise in urban areas and spaces. Advanced urban calisthenics skills include muscle ups, typewriter pull-ups and both front and back levers.
Street workouts are usually performed outdoor or in specifically designed street workout parks. A typical street workout park looks like a playground with a soft underground and consists of several bars, poles and other objects used for body weight exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://imgarcade.com/1/street-workout-park/|title = IMG Arcade - Street Workout Parks|date = |access-date = 2015-01-15|website = IMG Arcade|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Street workout Slovenija 3.JPG|thumb|Street workout in [[Slovenia]]]]
In street workout, people often create teams.

The '''transfer window''' is the period during the year in which a [[football club]] can [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] players from other playing staff into their playing staff. Such a transfer is completed by registering the player into the new club through FIFA. "Transfer window" is the unofficial term commonly used by the media for the concept of "registration period" as described in the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations%5fon%5fthe%5fstatus%5fand%5ftransfer%5fof%5fplayers%5fen%5f33410.pdf |format=PDF |title=Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (2008) |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=23 January 2008 |date=19 October 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913151636/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations_on_the_status_and_transfer_of_players_en_33410.pdf |archivedate=13 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rules, each national football association decides on the time (such as the dates) of the 'window' but it may not exceed 12 weeks. The second registration period occurs during the season and may not exceed four weeks.

The transfer window of a given football association governs only international transfers into that football association. International transfers out of an association are always possible to those associations that have an open window. The transfer window of the association that the player is leaving does not have to be open.

The window was introduced in response to negotiations with the [[European Commission]]. The system has been used in many [[UEFA|European leagues]] before being brought into compulsory effect by [[FIFA]] during the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1780263.stm|title=Uefa wants transfer windows|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 October 2008|date=24 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; English football was initially behind the plans when they were proposed in the early 1990s, in the hope that it would improve teams' stability and prevent agents from searching for deals all year around, but by the time it was eventually introduced they had to be persuaded that it would work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=John |last1=Ashdown |first2=Rob |last2=Smyth |title=Why does the Premier League have a January transfer window |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/01/the-knowledge-premier-league-transfer-window |work=The Guardian  |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact regulations and possible exceptions are established by each competition's governing body rather than by the national football association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/NewsFromTheFA/Postings/2005/01|archive-url=https://archive.is/20071029052205/http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/NewsFromTheFA/Postings/2005/01|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 October 2007|title=Transfer clarification|publisher=Football Association|accessdate=29 October 2008|date=1 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current schedules and exceptions ==

FIFA regulates in general that there shall be two windows, a longer one (max. twelve weeks) in the break between seasons and a shorter one (max. one month) in the middle of a season. The specific periods depend on the league's season cycle and are determined by the national football authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations_on_the_status_and_transfer_of_players_en_33410.pdf|format=PDF|title=Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=29 October 2008|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major European leagues commence in the second half of the year (e.g. August or September) and stretch over two calendar years to the first half of the next year (e.g. May), resulting in a close season window in the Summer ending in August, and a mid-season window in January.

The periods are different when a league runs throughout a single calendar year, as in most [[Nordic countries]] due to weather constraints, [[Major League Soccer]] due to both weather and competition from other locally popular sports (notably [[basketball]] and [[American football]]), or as the traditional season in the Southern Hemisphere. The first window generally opens from 1 March until midnight of 30 April, followed by the in-season window from 1 to 31 August.

[[Premier League clubs]] in England voted to end the summer window on the Thursday before the start of the season - on August 9 in 2018, instead of August 31.  Because FIFA demands the window must be open for 12 weeks, the window will open around May 17, shortly after the final games of the season on May 13. Clubs will be able to sell players until August 31 but not buy replacements after the deadline of August 9.

Although, in England, transfers between clubs in the same league can take place as soon as the last competitive fixtures for the season have been played, many transfers will not be completed until 1 July because many players' contracts expire on 30 June. International transfers into the English leagues (including the Premier League) cannot be made until the window has opened on 17 May. Outside the transfer window, a club may still sign players on an emergency basis, usually if they have no goalkeeper available. Special dispensation from their competition's governing body, for example the Premier League, is required. The transfer window restriction does not apply to clubs in or below the [[National League (division)|National League division]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/mobile/football/13600908.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Transfers – June 2011 | date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the last day of a transfer window is on a weekend, the deadline can be extended to the following Monday at the request of those involved for business reasons.&lt;ref name="deadline_day_rules_and_regulations" /&gt; The first shift of the deadline since its inception took place in summer 2008, when the deadline was extended by 24 hours to fall on Monday 1 September at midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7568921.stm |title=Transfer deadline to be extended |date=18 August 2008 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=7 October 2008 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5bOAGADJu?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7568921.stm |archivedate=7 October 2008 |df=dmy }}  7 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/wenger-urges-fans-to-support-adebayor-as-striker-seals-new-deal-901913.html|author=Gatward, Matt|title=Wenger urges fans to support Adebayor as striker seals new deal|work= The Independent|date= 19 August 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer deadline in England was similarly extended to 5&amp;nbsp;pm 1 September 2009, due to the August Bank Holiday. The [[Deutsche Fußball Liga|German football league]] announced an extension of the January 2009 deadline to 2 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesliga.de/de/liga/news/2008/index.php?f=0000105068.php|title=Wechselperiode I endet erst am Montag|publisher=Bundesliga|accessdate=29 October 2008|date=29 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Free agent]]s can be signed by a club at any time during the season, if they had been released by their previous club before the end of the transfer window.&lt;ref name="deadline_day_rules_and_regulations"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/6971785.stm|title=Deadline day rules &amp; regulations|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 October 2008|date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A club can request to sign a player on emergency basis, e.g. if several [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] are injured at the same time.&lt;ref name="deadline_day_rules_and_regulations" /&gt; Outside the transfer window in [[Football in England|England]], once seven days have passed following the end of a transfer window, clubs from the [[English Football League]] (Regulation 53.3.4)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/global/section6.aspx#TQpEOrzdeJySOqaP.99|title=Section 6 - Players|first=The Football|last=League|publisher=|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (provided the player is not registered with a club from any league below the National League division) [[National League (division)|National League division]]&lt;ref&gt;http://footballconference.co.uk/uploads/docs/Rules.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (Rule 6.6.4) can loan in players i) in the first half of the season, until 5.00pm on the fourth Thursday in November and ii) in the second half of the season, until 5.00pm on the fourth Thursday in March.

The day upon which a window closes is known as '''transfer deadline day''', and is usually one of the busiest days of the window, generating a flurry of transfers, often because a number of interdependent transfers are completed resembling a [[Chain (in selling a house)|housing chain]], generating much media interest.

== Calls to end the transfer window ==

[[Steve Coppell]], former manager of [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in England's [[Premier League]], and others have called for the transfer window to be scrapped in favour of the previous system, where deals could be struck throughout the season until the closing weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2 January 2008| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/reading/article3120658.ece | title=Steve Coppell calls for end to transfer window | work=The Times | accessdate=2 January 2008 | location=London | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coppell said that the transfer window breeds panic and encourages "scurrilous" transfer activity adding that "I cannot see the logic in a transfer window. It brings on a fire-sale mentality, causes unrest via the media and means clubs buy too many players" adding that "The old system, where if you had a problem you could look at loans or make a short-term purchase, was far better than this system we have at the moment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2287651/Managers-hit-out-at-rubbish-transfer-system.html |title=Managers hit out at 'rubbish' transfer system |publisher=The Telegraph |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former England Manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] has also questioned the value of the transfer window, commenting: "You do wonder at times if it is right to have a window, it was easier when it was open all the time and perhaps fairer for the players. I am sure much of the business being done on the last day is a little bit desperate and that is not right. I think it was better before, but then I am old".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_7152349,00.html? |title=Sven wants windows scrapped |publisher=Sky Sports |date=5 September 2011 |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] manager [[Arsène Wenger]] asked for the January transfer window to be limited to two transfers per window and claimed it is "unfair" in its current form. He cited [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] transfer activity as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21193630 |title=Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger wants two-player transfer limit |work=BBC |date=25 January 2013 |accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Wenger hit out at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s £37m purchase of [[Juan Mata]] from rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Wenger argued that the transfer was unfair because United and Chelsea had already played each other twice during the season, but United would still have to play Arsenal, and said that "the rules should be adapted more for fairness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/9129436/arsene-wenger-thinks-juan-matas-proposed-transfer-to-man-utd-from-chelsea-is-unfair |title=Arsene Wenger thinks Juan Mata's proposed transfer to Man Utd from Chelsea is unfair |publisher=Sky Sports |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager [[Manuel Pellegrini]] backed the sentiment of Wenger, disagreeing that a player "can go from one team to another team in the same league at this part of the year" and also said that the winter transfer window was unbalanced in favour of big clubs, saying "a club with money can take the best players from the other teams".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manuel-pellegrini-agrees-with-arsene-wenger--juan-mata-moving-from-chelsea-to-manchester-united-is-unfair-9083543.html |title=Manuel Pellegrini agrees with Arsene Wenger - Juan Mata moving from Chelsea to Manchester United is unfair |publisher=The Independent |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/10596136/Manchester-City-manager-Manuel-Pellegrini-backs-Arsenal-conterpart-Arsene-Wenger-over-Juan-Mata-transfer.html |title=Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini backs Arsenal conterpart Arsène Wenger over Juan Mata transfer |publisher=The Telegraph |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] manager [[Alan Pardew]] questioned why the Premier League transfer window remains open after the start of the season after [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] made a bid for midfielder [[Yohan Cabaye]] during his time as [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] manager in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23765521 |title=Alan Pardew unhappy at timing of Arsenal bid |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 August 2013 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, [[FIFPro]] said that the current transfer window system is "failing football and its players", one of the main issues being that players are released from clubs without explanation or compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31001193|title= Fifpro: players' union says 'failing' transfer system needs reform|date=27 January 2015|accessdate=27 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USA Swimming''' is the national [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for [[Swimming (sport)|competitive swimming]] in the United States. It is charged with selecting the United States Olympic Swimming team and any other teams which officially represent the United States, as well as the overall organization and operation of the sport within the country, in accordance with the [[Amateur Sports Act of 1978|Amateur Sports Act]]. The national headquarters of USA Swimming is located at the [[U.S. Olympic Training Center]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.usaswimming.org/usasweb/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabId=21&amp;Alias=Rainbow&amp;Lang=en "About USA Swimming"], ''USA Swimming''. &lt;!--accessed May 8, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
USA Swimming was originally called United States Swimming (USS) upon its departure from the AAU. Thus, there are several terms used to describe the organization at different times. These terms are: USA Swimming, USA-S, United States Swimming, USS, and US Swimming.  Prior to the existence of "USS", the AAU, or the [[Amateur Athletic Union]], served as the governing body for swimming and other sports across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaswimming.org/ViewMiscArticle.aspx?TabId=1599&amp;mid=7128&amp;ItemId=3511 "USA Swimming History"], ''USA Swimming''.&lt;!--accessed Dec 2, 1015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amateur Athletic Union===
The [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) was the official organization responsible for the running of all amateur sports in the United States, established in 1888.  The AAU was officially charged with the organization and operation of many sports in the US.  During this time, swimming was one of the committees in the organization and was not an independent governing body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww3.aausports.org/Resources/AboutAAU.aspx "About AAU"], ''AAU USA''&lt;!--accessed Dec 2, 1015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amateur Sports Act of 1978]] enabled the governance of sports in the USA by organizations other than the AAU.  This act made each sport set up its own National governing body (NGB). Each of these governing bodies would be part of the [[United States Olympic Committee]], but would not be run by the Committee. Thus, ''United States Swimming'' was born. From 1978 to 1980, the official responsibilities of governing the sport were transferred from the AAU Swimming Committee to the new United States Swimming.  Bill Lippman, the last head of the Swimming Committee, and Ross Wales, the first president of United States Swimming, worked together to ease the transition. This process was made more interesting because the United States boycotted the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] and, during this time, the leadership of the sport was in flux.

The AAU still holds several aquatic events, but it is no longer the official governing body of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aauswimming.org/ AAU Swimming &lt;!--accessed Dec 2, 1015--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
When it was part of the AAU to 1981, USA Swimming had its headquarters in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. In 1981, USA Swimming moved to its present-day location in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]].  At the time of the 1981 move, it had four staff members.

In 1997, work was completed on the official USA Swimming Headquarters, which is currently the official home of USA Swimming.

Through the national headquarters, the organization provides various programs and services to its members, supporters, affiliates and the interested public.  This includes educational programs, fund-raising activities, general information, publications, resources, and sports medicine programs, all relating to the sport of swimming.

==Organizational structure==
There are several parts and levels that make up USA Swimming.  There is the National governing body (national) level, the Zone (regional) level, and the Local Swimming Committee (local/state) level.

===Safe Sport===
USA Swimming’s Safe Sport program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reducing the Risk of Abuse in Youth Sports|url=http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_28124483/guest-commentary-reducing-risk-abuse-youth-sports|accessdate=20 October 2015|issue=May 15, 2015|publisher=The Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; established by USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chuck|first1=Wielgus|title=USA Swimming Ed|url=http://chuckwielgus.tumblr.com/safesport|website=Tumblr|publisher=Tumblr|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed raise awareness and reduce the risk and help prevent athletes from being [[sexually abused]]. The program includes mandatory training, [[background checks]] and an overall awareness of warning signs. USA Swimming requires free, mandatory training for members and volunteers who work with athletes, as well as provides free training for athletes and parents to further protect swimmers from abuse.

To date, USA Swimming has banned more than 100 coaches for violating USA Swimming’s detailed [http://www.usaswimming.org/ViewMiscArticle.aspx?TabId=1599&amp;Alias=Rainbow&amp;Lang=en&amp;mid=6074&amp;ItemId=5773 Code of Conduct].

USA Swimming encourages any swimmers or parents who suspect any abuse or inappropriate behavior to come forward by either contacting the Athlete Protection Officer or logging a complaint of sexual misconduct or abuse relating to USA Swimming through its online reporting system. The complaint process involves USA Swimming working with a third-party investigator to effectively and thoroughly investigate all complaints of abuse.

===The National governing body===
The National governing body (NGB) of United States Swimming is an extension of the [[United States Olympic Committee]].  While all of the separate swim teams, LSC's, and Zones do not officially make up the NGB, they are all members and are subject to the laws of the NGB.

The NGB is made up of both staff members of USA Swimming and volunteer members of the board.  The office of the President is the head of the board and is responsible for the overall direction of USA Swimming.  The chief executive is the head of the staff located at the national headquarters in Colorado Springs at the Olympic Training Center.  The chief executive is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the organization at the national level.

The NGB is responsible for nearly all aspects of USA Swimming, and swimming in the United States in general.  Its most important responsibility is to set the rules for the sport in the United States.  These rules are guided by the international governing body for aquatic sports ([[FINA]]).  FINA makes the rules that are to be followed at all international level meets.  USA Swimming follows accordingly to make the rules of USA Swimming match the rules of FINA, however it does not have to.  In theory, an NGB could make its rules whatever it wanted and have all national level meets and below follow those rules, but it would not have jurisdiction over international level meets held within the borders of the United States, and such a meet would have to follow FINA rules.

===The Local Swimming Committee===
The '''Local Swimming Committee''' (LSC) is the local level of USA Swimming.  Each LSC is a separate entity, with each being an individual member of USA Swimming, although all act on behalf of USA Swimming on the local level.  LSCs are the local administrative organization responsible for the registration, support and governance of the USA Swimming member swim clubs in their designated region. Over 2800 swim clubs across the US are registered with USA Swimming through their respective LSCs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaswimming.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabId=2018&amp;Alias=Rainbow&amp;Lang=en "Governance &amp; LSCs"] ''USA Swimming''&lt;!-- accessed December 2, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaswimming.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabId=1606&amp;Alias=Rainbow&amp;Lang=en "Starting a Club"] ''USA Swimming''&lt;!-- accessed December 2, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The LSC gives USA Swimming sanctions to swimming meets in their area.  A sanction from the LSC allows the meet to be run under USA Swimming rules.  The LSC is responsible for enforcing these rules at the meet.  The LSC does this by training officials for the meet.  These officials are typically parents' of swimmers and volunteers.  The technical swimming rules for USA Swimming are the same for all LSCs as mandated by USA Swimming.  This allows an official in one LSC to officiate in another LSC without having to learn a new set of rules.  This is able to be done because while each LSC may have its own set of rules they are not different regarding the actual strokes.

An LSC is typically responsible for an entire state; however, several bigger states (e.g. California, Texas, Pennsylvania, among others) have multiple LSCs within their boundaries. The size of the LSCs is supposed to be roughly the same and allow for easier travel between meets. The result is that while borders tend to follow state borders, this is not a rule. There are currently 59 LSCs in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaswimming.org/_Rainbow/Documents/3e42c39d-a3ff-4383-969f-85564bce30c6/LSC-maps-2012.pdf mapped here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meets==
There are several different types and levels of meets, all but the very top level directed by individual clubs and the Local Swimming Committee.  The following is a list of the types of meets, listed from lowest and most common level to highest and least common level.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Dual Meet, Double Dual, Triangular, Quadrangular, etc.===
A dual meet is a meet where each individual event is ranked based on how individual swimmers on a team swim.  It is generally limited to 2 teams, but different variations can have more.  In a dual meet, there is almost always a limit to the number of events that a certain person can swim, usually four,and to the number of swimmers that a certain team can enter.  meet entries close up when the maximum number of people have entered.  Generally, there is only 1 heat in each event and each team alternates lanes so that each team swims in half the pool, regardless of how fast each swimmer is.  While this style of meet is generally uncommon for individual USA Swimming clubs, it is by far the most common of [[high school]] ([[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]]) swimming, [[YMCA]] swimming, [[college]] ([[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]) swimming, and summer league swimming.  Meets of this variety are almost always a low level meet because entry time standards are almost never applied to enter the meet.  It can, however, be rather high level when both teams involved are very fast and have exclusively high level swimmers, as is the case with college swimming.

===Invitational Meet===
An invitational meet is a meet with many more teams and swimmers than a dual meet.  The term "Invitational" comes from the fact that for a team to attend this type of meet, a team had to be invited to attend from the host team, but now is a general catch-all term for this style of meet (although there are still occasional invitation-only meets.)  Meets of this variety generally have hundreds of swimmers, many teams, and many different events.  Within the definition of an invitational meet, there are dozens of different styles of scoring and placing but the standard method is described here.  All levels of swimming use invitational style meets at least once during their season (usually as a championship meet of all the clubs in a league), but the clubs of USA Swimming use this meet almost exclusively since there are very few leagues in USA Swimming and it acts as one giant league itself.  Most meets of this style have no limits as to the number of swimmers that a team can enter, and only limit the number of times a swimmer can swim in order to make the flow of the meet manageable.  Meets of this style can be at any level of swimming since all of the higher level meets use this style of meet with just more restrictive rules applied. Meets of this style usually do not have entry time standards, but can have them to either reduce the size of the meet, or raise the competition level.

===LSC Championships===
Each Local Swimming Committee (LSC) is mandated to have a season ending championships twice a year for both Age Group (younger) and Senior (no age requirement) swimmers.  Most LSC's split these up into two separate meets.  The meet style is an invitational meet open only to club teams within the LSC.  Almost universally, entry time standards are applied so that only the top level swimmer of the LSC can attend; only a few of the smaller LSCs do not have a time standard. Each LSC sets their own time standards (due to LSC size differences), so the competition level of the meet is not exactly the same across the country.  Normally, this style meet is a prelim/final format.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Common age groups are 10 and under, 11-12, 13-14, 15 and over, also known as seniors.

===Zone/Sectional Championship===
As stated before, there are four zones and 59 LSCs in the country.  While the LSC championship is a high level meet, the Zone/Sectional Championships are even higher.  These meets are also of the invitational format, but the entry time standards are even higher so that only the fastest swimmers of Zones qualify.  Zone and Sectional meets are of the same competition level, but serve different purposes.  Zone meets are for age group swimmers and Sectional meets are for Senior swimmers.  While the intention is to have one champion for the whole Zone, this is generally not possible because to have a meet of that high of a competition level, there would be very little difference between this level and the next level, so the entry times can only be made so fast.  Thus, there are sometimes too many swimmers qualifying for this meet to have only a single meet in a Zone.  Currently, the Central States Zone is the only one that has more than one Zone Championship meet (Age Group swimmers), and all four zones have multiple Sectional Championships (Senior swimmers).  After Zone meets for age group swimmers some may qualify for Junior Nationals.

=== Arena Pro Swim Series ===
The Arena Pro Swim Series (PSS), formally known as the Speedo Grand Prix, is a series of 7 meets held throughout the season. Held in either Short Course Yards (SCY) or long Course Meters (LCM). Swimmers race in both Olympic and non-Olympic distances, but only receive points for Olympic distances. First place receives 5 points and $1,000. Second place receives 3 points and $600. Third place receives 1 point and $200. The swimmer that accumulates the most points by the end of the series, wins a $10,000 bonus. Any swimmer of any nationality can compete in the PSS but are not eligible to some of the prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usaswimming.org/_Rainbow/Documents/68568364-081a-49ae-a81e-25c44c10a009/2015-16%20Arena%20Pro%20Swim%20Series%20Rules.pdf|title=2015-16 Arena Pro Swim Series Rules|last=|first=|date=|website=USA Swimming|publisher=|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Championship/US Open===
There is only 1 National Championship meet at the conclusion of each season across the country. The National Championships are also of the invitational meet format and offer extremely high level competition.  Only a very small percentage of people who ever swim will make it to this high a level of competition.  This meet is generally used to determine the US National Team for various international level meets each year, but is not used to determine the US Olympic Team.  Currently, there are 2 National Championships each year, but the Spring Championships have traditionally been of a significantly lower level of competition than the Summer Championships.  This is because the Spring Championships are so close to NCAA Championships and the fact that Spring Championships are rarely used as a selection meet for national teams.

In many other sports, the National Championship of the sport is known as the "US Open" and while swimming did have a very high national level meet by that name each year, it was just a high level meet and not a national championship meet.  This specific meet was ended in 2006 and was replaced with a reformulated Spring/Winter National Championship.  Since there is no "US Open" meet of the old format, the National Championships (specifically Summer '08) have begun to be called the "US Open" to bring it in line with the nomenclature of other sports.

===US Olympic Trials===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
{{update|section|date=June 2016}}
The [[United States Olympic Trials (swimming)|Olympic Trials]] are held once every 4 years.  Since this meet offers such a coveted prize (a spot on the US Olympic Team) it never fails to attract the absolute fastest in the sport of swimming in the United States.  Because of this, the entry time standards are even faster than the National Championships.  However, even though this is a faster meet and would actually offer a truer indication of who is the fastest swimmer in the United States, the winner of each event in this meet is not officially considered a National Champion and this meet is NOT held in place of the National Championships every 4 years (although the Nationals are generally not held when the Olympic Trials occur, or other selection trials).  However, for 2008, the winners of the Olympic Trials were indeed officially be a National Champion with the trials meet taking the place of the National Championship meet for 2008.  It is unclear if this will continue for future trials.  Unlike all other US Swimming meets, United States citizenship is required to compete at this meet since only United States citizens are allowed to represent the United States at the Olympics.  The Olympic Trials are also under unique requirements made by the [[United States Olympic Committee|USOC]].

Trials meets are also held for the World Championships, Pan American Games and World University Games, typically at a national championship meet.

The '''World Anti-Doping Agency''' ('''WADA'''; {{lang-fr|Agence mondiale antidopage}}, '''AMA''') is a foundation initiated by the [[International Olympic Committee]] based in [[Canada]] to promote, coordinate and monitor the fight against drugs in sports. The agency's key activities include scientific research, education, development of anti-doping capacities, and monitoring of the World Anti-Doping Code, whose provisions are enforced by the [[UNESCO]] [[International Convention against Doping in Sport]]. The aims of the [[Council of Europe]] Anti-Doping Convention and the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] are also closely aligned with those of WADA.

==History==
The World Anti-Doping Agency is a foundation created through a collective initiative led by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). It was set up on 10 November 1999 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], as a result of what was called the "Declaration of Lausanne",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Lausanne Declaration on Doping in Sport|author=Staff|newspaper=sportunterricht.de, |date=4 February 1999 |url=http://www.sportunterricht.de/lksport/Declaration_e.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote, coordinate and monitor the fight against [[doping in sport|drugs in sports]]. Since 2002, the organization's headquarters have been located in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. The Lausanne office became the regional office for Europe. Other regional offices have been established in Africa, Asia/Oceania and Latin America. WADA is responsible for the '''World Anti-Doping Code''', adopted by more than 600 sports organizations, including international sports federations, national anti-doping organizations, the IOC, and the [[International Paralympic Committee]].  {{As of|2014}}, its president is [[Craig Reedie|Sir Craig Reedie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wada-ama.org/About-WADA/Governance/Executive-Committee/ Executive Committee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613020554/http://wada-ama.org/About-WADA/Governance/Executive-Committee/ |date=13 June 2010 }} at WADA official website, June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially funded by the [[International Olympic Committee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6QIYvAQMDUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=International+Olympic+Committee&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Olympic%20Committee&amp;f=false|title=Drug Games: The International Olympic Committee and the Politics of Doping, 1960–2008|last=Hunt|first=Thomas M.|date=2011-01-15|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=|isbn=9780292739574|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; WADA receives half of its budgetary requirements from them, with the other half coming from various national governments. Its governing bodies are also composed in equal parts by representatives from the sporting movement (including athletes) and governments of the world. The agency's key activities include scientific research, education, development of anti-doping capacities, and monitoring of the World Anti-Doping Code.

==Organization==
The highest decision-making authority in WADA is the 38-member foundation board, which is comprised equally of [[IOC]] representatives and representatives of national governments.&lt;ref name=WADA-gov /&gt; The Foundation Board appoints the agency's president.&lt;ref name=Reedle-elect&gt;{{cite web|title=Briton Sir Craig Reedie elected World Anti-Doping Agency President|url=http://www.ukad.org.uk/news/article/briton-sir-craig-reedie-elected-world-anti-doping-agency-president/|website=UK Anti-Doping|accessdate=11 November 2015|date=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most day-to-day management is delegated to a 12-member executive committee, membership of which is also split equally between the IOC and governments.&lt;ref name=WADA-gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Governance|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/who-we-are/governance|website=wada-ama.org|publisher=WADA|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also exist several sub-committees with narrower remits, including a Finance and Administration Committee&lt;ref name=WADA-fin&gt;{{cite web|title=Finance and Administration Committee|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/who-we-are/governance/finance-administration-committeepublisher=WADA|website=wada-ama.org|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Athlete Committee peopled by athletes.&lt;ref name=WADA-ath&gt;{{cite web|title=Athlete Committee|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/who-we-are/governance/athlete-committee|website=wada-ama.gov|publisher=WADA|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WADA is an international organisation. It delegates work in individual countries to Regional and [[List of national anti-doping organizations|National Anti-Doping Organizations]] (RADOs and NADOs) and mandates that these organisations are compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code.&lt;ref name=WADA-NADO-list&gt;{{cite web|title=National Anti-Doping Organizations (NADO)|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/who-we-are/anti-doping-community/national-anti-doping-organizations-nado|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WADA-RADO-list&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Anti-Doping Organizations (RADO)|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/who-we-are/anti-doping-community/regional-anti-doping-organizations-nado|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; WADA also accredits around 30 laboratories to perform the required scientific analysis for doping control.&lt;ref name=WADA-labs&gt;{{cite web|title=Accredited and approved laboratories|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/who-we-are/anti-doping-community/accredited-approved-laboratories|website=wada-ama.org|publisher=WADA|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutes of WADA and the World Anti-Doping Code mandate the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]]'s ultimate jurisdiction in deciding doping-related cases.&lt;ref&gt;World Anti-Doping Agency: [http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/code_v2009_en.pdf 2009 World Anti-Doping Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824032644/http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/code_v2009_En.pdf |date=24 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Anti-Doping Code ==
{{Doping in sport sidebar |expanded=Anti-doping bodies}}
The Code is a document aiming to harmonize anti-doping regulations in all sports and countries. It embodies an annual list of prohibited substances and methods that sportspersons are not allowed to take or use.

In 2004, the World Anti-Doping Code was implemented by sports organizations prior to the [[Olympic Games]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. In November 2007, more than 600 sports organizations (international sports federations, national anti-doping organizations, the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, and a number of professional leagues in various countries of the world) unanimously adopted a revised Code at the Third World Conference on Doping in Sport, to take effect on 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Steroids (Health and Medical Issues Today)|last=Zorea|first=Aharon|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1440802997|location=Westport, CT|pages=77–83|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, further amendments to the Code were approved, doubling the sanction for a first offence where intentional doping is established, but allowing for more lenient sanctions for inadvertent rule violations or for athletes co-operating with anti-doping agencies. The updated code came into effect on 1 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/24955873 |title=Drugs in sport: Wada doubles doping ban in new code |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/World_Anti-Doping_Program/WADP-The-Code/Code_Review/Code%20Review%202015/Code%20Final%20Draft/WADC-2015-final-draft-EN.pdf 2015 World Anti-Doping Code - Final Draft] WADA. Retrieved 21 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention ==
The Anti-Doping Convention of the [[Council of Europe]] in Strasbourg was opened for signature on 16 December 1989 as the first multilateral legal standard in this field. It has been signed by 48 states including the Council of Europe and non-member states Australia, Belarus, Canada and Tunisia. The Convention is open for signature by other non-European states. It does not claim to create a universal model of anti-doping, but sets a certain number of common standards and regulations requiring parties to adopt legislative, financial, technical, educational and other measures. In this sense the Convention strives for the same general aims as WADA, without being directly linked to it.

The main objective of the Convention is to promote the national and international harmonization of the measures to be taken against doping. Furthermore, the Convention describes the mission of the monitoring group set up in order to monitor its implementation and periodically re-examine the list of prohibited substances and methods which can be found in an annex to the main text. An additional protocol to the Convention entered into force on 1 April 2004 with the aim of ensuring the mutual recognition of anti-doping controls and of reinforcing the implementation of the Convention using a binding control system.

== UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport ==
{{main|International Convention against Doping in Sport}}
Given that many governments cannot be legally bound by a non-governmental document such as the World Anti-Doping Code, they are implementing it by individually ratifying the [[UNESCO]] [[International Convention against Doping in Sport]], the first global international treaty against doping in sport, which was unanimously adopted by 191 governments at the UNESCO General Conference in October 2005 and came into force in February 2007. As of June 2013, 174 states had ratified the Convention, setting a UNESCO record in terms of speed.

The UNESCO Convention is a practical and legally binding tool enabling governments to align domestic policy with the World Anti-Doping Code, thus harmonizing the rules governing anti-doping in sport. It formalizes governments' commitment to the fight against doping in sport, including by facilitating doping controls and supporting national testing programs; encouraging the establishment of "best practice" in the labelling, marketing, and distribution of products that might contain prohibited substances; withholding financial support from those who engage in or support doping; taking measures against manufacturing and trafficking; encouraging the establishment of codes of conduct for professions relating to sport and anti-doping; and funding education and research.

== Criticism ==
=== Statistical validity ===
Professor Donald A. Berry has argued that the closed systems used by anti-doping agencies do not allow statistical validation of the tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berry DA |title=The science of doping |journal=Nature |volume=454 |issue=7205 |pages=692–3 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18685682 |doi=10.1038/454692a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7205/full/454692a.html}} Full access is restricted to subscribers&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was seconded by an accompanying editorial in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (7 August 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=A level playing field? |journal=Nature |volume=454 |issue=7205 |page=667 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18685647 |doi=10.1038/454667a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7205/full/454667a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-doping community and scientists familiar with anti-doping work rejected these arguments. On 30 October 2008, ''Nature'' (Vol 455) published a letter to the editor from WADA countering Berry's article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7217/full/4551176a.html Doping: world agency sets standards to promote fair play] ''Nature'', 30 October 2008, p.1176. Full access is restricted to subscribers&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been at least one case where the development of statistical decision limit used by WADA in HGH use testing was found invalid by the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Bulletin_2013_2_complete.pdf |title=Arbitration CAS 2011/A/2566. Andrus Veerpalu v. International Ski Federation (ISF) |publisher=[[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] |work=Bulletin TAS - CAS Bulletin |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Whereabouts rule ==
{{see also|Biological passport#Whereabouts rules}}
The anti-doping code revised the ''whereabouts'' system in place since 2004, under which, {{As of|2014|lc=y}}, athletes are required to select one hour per day, seven days a week to be available for no-notice drugs tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/7892590.stm | work=BBC News | title=Athletes air issues over testing | date=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was unsuccessfully challenged at law in 2009 by Sporta, the Belgian sports union, arguing that the system violated [[Article 8 ECHR|Article 8]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]];&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/7844918.stm | work=BBC News | first=Matt | last=Slater | title=Legal threat to anti-doping code | date=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[FIFPro]], the international umbrella group of football players' unions, basing its case on data protection and employment law.&lt;ref name="bbc2"/&gt;

A significant number of sports organizations, governments, athletes, and other individuals and organizations have expressed support for the "whereabouts" requirements. The [[International Association of Athletics Federations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iaaf.org/news/news/iaaf-opinion-on-new-whereabouts-requirements|title=IAAF: IAAF opinion on "new" whereabouts requirements- News - iaaf.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UK Sport]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukad.org.uk/support-personnel/about-whereabouts/ Whereabouts] at [[UK Anti-Doping]], 2014&lt;/ref&gt; are two of the most vocal supporters of this rule. Both [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]] have criticized the system, citing privacy concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trickstopassadrugtests12.wordpress.com/2009/03/23/football-could-face-olympic-axe/|title=WordPress.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/03/stories/2009080357830100.htm Hindu.com] {{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/03/stories/2009080357830100.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804034843/http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/03/stories/2009080357830100.htm | archivedate=4 August 2009 | title=BCCI opposes doping clause | newspaper=The Hindu | date=3 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

WADA has published a Q&amp;A explaining the rationale for the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/en/World-Anti-Doping-Program/Sports-and-Anti-Doping-Organizations/International-Standards/Testing/QA-on-Whereabouts//|title=What we do|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Football League ==
It was revealed in May 2011 that the American [[National Football League]] (NFL), which had previously resisted more stringent drug testing, may allow WADA to conduct its drug tests instead of doing it in-house.  This could lead the way to testing for HGH, which had previously been without testing in professional [[American football]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportssupplementreviewer.com/2011/05/nfl-could-enlist-wada-testing/ WADA to test NFL] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515093332/http://sportssupplementreviewer.com/2011/05/nfl-could-enlist-wada-testing/ |date=15 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{As of|2013|9|lc=y}}, cooperation was stalemated because "blood-testing for [[Growth hormone|human growth hormone]] in the NFL had been delayed by the players' union, who had tried 'every possible way to avoid testing{{' "}}.&lt;ref&gt;Ingle, Sean [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/27/nfl-wada-drugs-testing "NFL faces battle with Wada over transparency of drug-testing"] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 28 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Database leaks==
In August 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency reported the receipt of [[phishing]] emails sent to users of its database claiming to be official WADA communications requesting their login details. After reviewing the two domains provided by WADA, it was found that the websites' registration and hosting information were consistent with the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/russian-hackers-fancy-bear-likely-breached-olympic-drug-testing-agency-dnc-experts-say-1577508 |title=Russian hackers 'Fancy Bear' likely breached Olympic drug-testing agency and DNC, experts say|author=Hyacinth Mascarenhas|work=[[International Business Times]]| date=August 23, 2016| accessdate =September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/37374053/what-we-know-about-fancy-bears-hack-team | title=What we know about Fancy Bears hack team | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to WADA, some of the data the hackers released had been forged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Sean|title=Researchers find fake data in Olympic anti-doping, Guccifer 2.0 Clinton dumps|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/10/researchers-find-fake-data-in-olympic-anti-doping-guccifer-2-0-clinton-dumps/|accessdate=26 October 2016|publisher=Ars Technica|date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to evidence of widespread [[Doping in Russia|doping by Russian athletes]], WADA recommended that Russian athletes be barred from participating in the 2016 Rio Olympics and Paralympics.
