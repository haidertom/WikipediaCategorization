 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversial book by [[Stephen Wolfram]], published by his own company in 2002. It contains an empirical and systematic study of computational systems such as [[cellular automata]]. Wolfram calls these systems ''simple programs'' and argues that the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] and methods appropriate for the study of simple programs are relevant to other fields of science.

== Contents ==

=== Computation and its implications===
The thesis of ''A New Kind of Science'' (''NKS'') is twofold: that the nature of [[computation]] must be explored experimentally, and that the results of these experiments have great relevance to understanding the [[physical world]]. Since its nascent beginnings in the 1930s, computation has been primarily approached from two traditions: [[engineering]], which seeks to build practical systems using computations; and [[mathematics]], which seeks to prove theorems about computation.  However, as recently as the 1970s, computing has been described as being at the crossroads of mathematical, engineering, and empirical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Peter | last = Wegner | title = Research Paradigms in Computer Science | booktitle = Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering | pages = 322–330 | publisher = IEEE Press | year = 1976 | location = San Francisco, CA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last = Denning | first = Peter J. | title = Computing as a Discipline | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–23 | year = 1989| doi = 10.1145/63238.63239|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram introduces a third tradition that seeks to empirically investigate computation for its own sake: He argues that an entirely new method is needed to do so because traditional mathematics fails to meaningfully describe [[complex systems]], and that there is an upper limit to complexity in all systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/emergence/DBergerNKS.pdf The World According to Wolfram]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple programs===
The basic subject of Wolfram's "new kind of science" is the study of simple abstract rules—essentially, elementary [[computer program]]s. In almost any class of a computational system, one very quickly finds instances of great complexity among its simplest cases (after a time series of multiple iterative loops, applying the same simple set of rules on itself, similar to a self-reinforcing cycle using a set of rules). This seems to be true regardless of the components of the system and the details of its setup. Systems explored in the book include, amongst others, cellular automata in one, two, and three dimensions; [[Mobile automaton|mobile automata]]; [[Turing machine]]s in 1 and 2 dimensions; several varieties of substitution and network systems; primitive recursive functions; nested [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]]; [[combinator]]s; [[tag system]]s; [[register machine]]s; [[Palindromic number|reversal-addition]]. For a program to qualify as simple, there are several requirements:
# Its operation can be completely explained by a simple graphical illustration.
# It can be completely explained in a few sentences of [[human language]].
# It can be implemented in a computer language using just a few lines of code.
# The number of its possible variations is small enough so that all of them can be computed.

Generally, simple programs tend to have a very simple abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things.  This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of [[emergence]]. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program's rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a [[brute-force search]] through all of the possible components for the best match.

Simple programs are capable of a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be [[universal computer]]s. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] behavior, [[continuum mechanics|continuum]] behavior, conserved quantities, [[percolation]], [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], and others. They have been used as models of [[traffic]], material fracture, [[crystal growth]], biological growth, and various [[sociology|sociological]], [[geology|geological]], and [[ecology|ecological]] phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall [[complexity]]. ''A New Kind of Science'' argues that this is evidence that simple programs are enough to capture the essence of almost any [[complex system]].

===Mapping and mining the computational universe===
In order to study simple rules and their often complex behaviour, Wolfram argues that it is necessary to systematically explore all of these computational systems and document what they do. He further argues that this study should become a new branch of science, like [[physics]] or [[chemistry]].  The basic goal of this field is to understand and characterize the computational universe using experimental methods.

The proposed new branch of scientific exploration admits many different forms of scientific production. For instance, qualitative classifications are often the results of initial forays into the computational jungle. On the other hand, explicit proofs that certain systems compute this or that function are also admissible. There are also some forms of production that are in some ways unique to this field of study. For example, the discovery of computational mechanisms that emerge in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.

Another kind of production involves the creation of programs for the analysis of computational systems. In the ''NKS'' framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this idea is that the human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes that programs and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. However, in general Wolfram's idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.

Wolfram has since expressed "A central lesson of ''A New Kind of Science'' is that there’s a lot of incredible richness out there in the computational universe. And one reason that’s important is that it means that there’s a lot of incredible stuff out there for us to 'mine' and harness for our purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/|title=A New Kind of Science: A 15-Year View—Stephen Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic abstract science===
While Wolfram advocates simple programs as a scientific discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is that the study of simple programs is the minimal possible form of science,  grounded equally in both [[abstraction]] and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology advocated in ''NKS'' is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment will do something unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has much to offer the sciences.

Wolfram argues that the computational realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by understanding the importance of these realities, we can learn to use them in our favor. For instance, instead of [[reverse engineering]] our theories from observation, we can [[enumeration|enumerate]] systems and then try to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of ''NKS''  is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.

===Philosophical underpinnings===

====Computational irreducibility====
Wolfram argues that one of his achievements is in providing a coherent system of ideas that justifies computation as an organizing [[Philosophy of science|principle of science]]. For instance, he argues that the concept of ''[[computational irreducibility]]'' (that some complex computations are not amenable to short-cuts and cannot be "reduced"), is ultimately the reason why computational models of nature must be considered in addition to traditional [[mathematical models]]. Likewise, his idea of intrinsic randomness generation—that natural systems can generate their own randomness, rather than using chaos theory or stochastic perturbations—implies that computational models do not need to include explicit randomness.

====Principle of computational equivalence====
Based on his experimental results, Wolfram developed the '''principle of computational equivalence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''PCE'''): the principle states that [[systems]] found in the [[natural environment|natural world]] can perform [[computation]]s up to a [[maximum|maximal]] ("universal") level of [[computational power]]. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the same things as a computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating [[Input/output|input and outputs]] from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.

The principle can be restated as follows: almost all processes that are not obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. From this principle, Wolfram draws an array of concrete deductions which he argues reinforce his theory. Possibly the most important among these is an explanation as to why we experience [[randomness]] and [[complexity]]: often, the systems we analyze are just as sophisticated as we are. Thus, complexity is not a special quality of systems, like for instance the concept of "heat,"  but simply a label for all systems whose computations are sophisticated. Wolfram argues that understanding this makes possible the "normal science" of the ''NKS'' paradigm.

At the deepest level, Wolfram argues that—like many of the most important scientific ideas—the principle of computational equivalence allows science to be more general by pointing out new ways in which humans are not "special"; that is, it has been claimed that the complexity of human intelligence makes us special, but the Principle asserts otherwise. In a sense, many of Wolfram's ideas are based on understanding the scientific process—including the human mind—as operating within the same universe it studies, rather than being outside it.

===Applications and results===
There are a number of specific results and ideas in the ''NKS'' book, and they can be organized into several themes. One common theme of examples and applications is demonstrating how little complexity it takes to achieve interesting behavior, and how the proper methodology can discover this behavior.

First, there are several cases where the ''NKS'' book introduces what was, during the book's composition, the simplest known system in some class that has a particular characteristic. Some examples include the first primitive recursive function that results in complexity, the smallest universal [[Turing Machine]], and the shortest [[axiom]] for [[propositional calculus]]. In a similar vein, Wolfram also demonstrates many simple programs that exhibit phenomena like [[phase transition]]s, [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]], continuum behavior, and [[thermodynamics]] that are familiar from traditional science. Simple [[computational model]]s of natural systems like [[shell growth]], [[fluid turbulence]], and [[phyllotaxis]] are a final category of applications that fall in this theme.

Another common theme is taking facts about the computational universe as a whole and using them to reason about fields in a [[holistic]] way. For instance, Wolfram discusses how facts about the computational universe inform [[evolutionary theory]], [[SETI]], [[free will]], [[computational complexity theory]], and philosophical fields like [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and even [[postmodernism]].

Wolfram suggests that the theory of computational irreducibility may provide a resolution to the existence of free will in a nominally [[deterministic]] universe.  He posits that the computational process in the [[brain]] of the being with free will is actually [[Complexity|complex]] enough so that it cannot be captured in a simpler computation, due to the principle of computational irreducibility.  Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, there is no better way to determine the being's will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.

The book also contains a vast number of individual results—both experimental and analytic—about what a particular automaton computes, or what its characteristics are, using some methods of analysis.

The book contains a new technical result in describing the [[Turing completeness]] of the [[Rule 110]] cellular automaton. Very small Turing machines can simulate Rule 110, which Wolfram demonstrates using a 2-state 5-symbol [[universal Turing machine]]. Wolfram conjectures that a particular [[Wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine|2-state 3-symbol Turing machine]] is universal. In 2007, as part of commemorating the book's fifth anniversary, Wolfram's company offered a $25,000 prize for proof that this Turing machine is universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Research Prize | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/ | accessdate=2011-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515032324/http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/| archivedate= 15 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alex Smith, a computer science student from [[Birmingham]], UK, won the prize later that year by proving Wolfram's conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Is Universal! | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_news.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Technical Commentary [on Wolfram 2,3 Turing machine universality proof] | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_technical.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NKS Summer School==
Every year, Wolfram and his group of instructors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2009/faculty.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2009: Faculty|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; organize a summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/|title=Wolfram Science Summer School|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2006, these classes were held at [[Brown University]]. In 2007, the summer school began being hosted by the [[University of Vermont]] at Burlington, with the exception of 2009 which was held at the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione of the CNR in [[Pisa, Italy]].  In 2012, the program was held at [[Curry College]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Since 2013, the Wolfram Summer School has been held annually at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. After 14 consecutive summer schools, more than 550 people have participated, some of whom continued developing their 3-week research projects as their Master's or Ph.D theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2006/participants/letourneau.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2006: Alumni—Paul-Jean Letourneau|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research done in the summer school has resulted in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Rowland | title=A natural prime-generating recurrence | year=2008 | volume=11 | issue=08 | journal=Journal of Integer Sequences| arxiv=0710.3217 | bibcode=2008JIntS..11...28R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m624350kj28305u9/|title=Planar Trivalent Network Computation | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74593-8_13 | journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=146–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Palasek , S. | title=Information flow in cellular automata | year=2013 | volume=22 | issue=2 | pages=193–202 | journal=Complex Systems | url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/22-2-4.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published on April 3, 2018, ''A New Kind of Science'' was listed among the 190 books recommended by Bill Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolinsky|first=Jacob|title=190 Books Recommended by Bill Gates|url=https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/04/bill-gates-books/|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific philosophy===
A tenet of ''NKS'' is that the simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur in a wide variety of more complicated contexts. Therefore, ''NKS'' argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. ''NKS'' has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.

===Methodology===
A common criticism of ''NKS'' is that it does not follow established [[scientific methodology]]. For instance, ''NKS'' does not establish [[rigorous]] mathematical definitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=David|title=A Reclusive Kind of Science|journal=Computing in Science and Engineering|pages=79–81|date=September 2002|url = http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-wolfram.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it attempt to prove [[theorem]]s; and most formulas and equations are written in [[Mathematica]] rather than standard notation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Mathematician Looks at Wolfram's New Kind of Science|last=Gray|first=Lawrence|journal=Notices of the AMS|year=2003|volume=50|issue=2|pages=200–211|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200302/fea-gray.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, ''NKS'' has also been criticized for being heavily visual, with much information conveyed by pictures that do not have formal meaning.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; It has also been criticized for not using modern research in the field of [[complexity]], particularly the works that have studied complexity from a rigorous mathematical perspective.&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt; And it has been criticized for misrepresenting [[chaos theory]]: "Throughout the book, he equates chaos theory with the phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC)."&lt;ref name=Drysdale&gt;{{cite web|last=Drysdale|first=David|title=Review of "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.lurklurk.org/wolfram/review.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
''NKS'' has been criticized for not providing specific results that would be immediately applicable to ongoing scientific research.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; There has also been criticism, implicit and explicit, that the study of simple programs has little connection to the physical universe, and hence is of limited value. [[Steven Weinberg]] has pointed out that no real world system has been explained using Wolfram's methods in a satisfactory fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/In+search+of+a+scientific+revolution%3A+controversial+genius+Stephen...-a0107699603 | work=Science News | title=In search of a scientific revolution: controversial genius Stephen Wolfram presses onward | first=Peter | last=Weiss | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCE===
The '''Principle of computational equivalence''' has been criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;!-- However, Wolfram's group has described the principle as such, not a law, theorem or formula. [They described it as being vague, unmathematical, and not able to make directly verifiable predictions?] --&gt; It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Moreover, critics such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent.&lt;ref name=Kurzweil/&gt; Others suggest it is little more than a rechristening of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt;&lt;!--  However, the Church-Turing thesis imposes an upper limit while Wolfram's PCE suggests the nonexistence of intermediate degrees of computation sending a computational system either to the upper level (universal) or to the lowest degree. [No. The claim is that intermediate degrees are derived from the complete degree, hence equivalent in "sophistication".] --&gt;

===The fundamental theory (''NKS'' Chapter 9)===
Wolfram's speculations of a direction towards a fundamental theory of physics have been criticized as vague and obsolete. [[Scott Aaronson]], Professor of Computer Science at University of Texas Austin, also claims that Wolfram's methods cannot be compatible with both [[special relativity]] and [[Bell's theorem]] violations, and hence cannot explain the observed results of [[Bell test experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|title=Book Review of ''A New Kind of Science''|journal=Quantum Information and Computation|volume=2|issue=5|year=2002|pages=410–423|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/nks.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aaronson's arguments are either right and apply to the entire scientific field of [[Quantum gravity]] that seeks to find theories unifying relativity and quantum mechanics or they are fundamentally flawed (e.g. under a non-local hidden variable theory of superdeterminism acknowledged by Bell himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = J. S. | year = 1981 | title = Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality | url = | journal = Journal de Physique | volume = 42 | issue = C2| pages = 41–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and even explored by e.g. physics Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]],&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|author='t Hooft, G.|title=Discreteness and Determinism in Superstrings |date=15 Sep 2012|eprint=1207.3612}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also replies to [[Digital physics#Locality|criticism of digital physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Wheeler]], 1990, "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links" in W. Zurek (ed.) ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201031 Matrix models as non-local hidden variables theories]", 2002; also published in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26669-0_10 Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics? The Frontiers Collection], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 2005, pp 121-152, {{ISBN|978-3-540-22188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|date=April 2017}}

[[Edward Fredkin]] and [[Konrad Zuse]] pioneered the idea of a [[Cellular automaton#CA as models of the fundamental physical reality|computable universe]], the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might be like a cellular automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_zuse_fredkin_thesis.html|title=ZUSE-FREDKIN-THESIS|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that ''NKS'' tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe is a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-9.7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] has also charged that his work on [[Turing machine]]-computable [[physics]] was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.&lt;ref name=Schmid&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jurgen|title=Origin of main ideas in Wolfram's book "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/wolfram.html|publisher=CERN Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 review of ''NKS'', the Nobel laureate and elementary particle physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] wrote, "Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I suppose he can't resist trying to apply his experience with digital computer programs to the laws of nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that this is the sort of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|title=Is the Universe a Computer?|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=24 October 2002|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]] has more recently also suggested a cellular automaton-based unifying theory of quantum gravity as an interpretation of superstring theory where the evolution equations are classical, "[b]oth the bosonic string theory and superstring theory can be reformulated in terms of a special basis of states, defined on a [[space-time]] [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] with lattice length &lt;math&gt;2\pi\sqrt{\alpha'.}&lt;/math&gt;"&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"/&gt;

===Natural selection===
Wolfram's claim that [[natural selection]] is not the fundamental cause of complexity in biology has led non-scientist journalist Chris Lavers to state that Wolfram does not understand the [[theory of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavers|first=Chris|title=How the cheetah got his spots|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 August 2002|url= https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4473834,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Originality===
''NKS'' has been heavily criticized as not being original or important enough to justify its title and claims.

The authoritative manner in which ''NKS'' presents a vast number of examples and arguments has been criticized as leading the reader to believe that each of these ideas was original to Wolfram;&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt; in particular, one of the most substantial new technical results presented in the book, that the [[Rule 110|rule 110 cellular automaton]] is [[Turing complete]], was not proven by Wolfram, but by his research assistant, [[Matthew Cook]]. However, the notes section at the end of his book acknowledges many of the discoveries made by these other scientists citing their names together with historical facts, although not in the form of a traditional bibliography section. Additionally, the idea that very simple rules often generate great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in [[chaos theory]] and [[complex systems]].&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt;

This page contains tables of [[azeotrope]] data for various binary and ternary mixtures of solvents. The data include the composition of a mixture by weight (in binary azeotropes, when only one fraction is given, it is the fraction of the second component), the [[boiling point]] ('''b.p.''') of a component, the boiling point of a mixture, and the [[specific gravity]] of the mixture. Boiling points are reported at a pressure of 760&amp;nbsp;mm Hg unless otherwise stated. Where the mixture separates into layers, values are shown for upper ('''U''') and lower ('''L''') layers.

The data were obtained from Lange's 10th edition&lt;ref name="Langes"&gt;''Lange's Handbook of Chemistry'', 10th ed. pp1496-1505&lt;/ref&gt; and CRC 44th edition&lt;ref name="crc"&gt;''CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics'', 44th ed. pp 2143-2184&lt;/ref&gt; unless otherwise noted (see color code table).

A list of 15825 binary and ternary mixtures was collated and published by the ACS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Lee H. Horsley|title=Azeotropic Data—III|url=http://pubs.acs.org/isbn/9780841201668|series=Advances in Chemistry Series No. 166|date=1 June 1973|publisher=AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY|isbn=9780841201668}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An azeotrope databank is also available online through Edinburgh University&lt;ref&gt;http://ecosse.org/jack/newWork/Chemeng/azeotrope/hetero.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2144">[[File:Bateson's cube x.png|thumb|right|400px|The cube has three axes measuring suffering, certainty of benefit and quality of research.  If the research is high-quality, certain to be beneficial, and not going to inflict suffering, then it will fall into the hollow section (top front) meaning research should proceed.   Painful, low-quality research with lower likelihood of success will be lower back in the solid area, and should not proceed.  Most research will not be clear-cut, but the guiding principle is 'hollow' should continue, 'solid' should not.]]
'''Bateson's cube''' is a model of the [[cost–benefit analysis]] for [[animal research]] developed by Professor [[Patrick Bateson]], president of the [[Zoological Society of London]]. &lt;ref&gt;P. Bateson, When to experiment on animals. New Scientist, 109 (1986), pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Bateson, P. Biggs, A. Cuthbert, I. Cuthill, M. Festing, E.B. Keverne, S. King, C. Page, O. Petersen, N. Rothwell, M. Rushworth, V. Walsh, O. Roberts. The Use of Non-human Animals in Research: a Guide for Scientists. The Royal Society, Policy Document 01/04 The Royal Society, London (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bateson's cube evaluates proposed research through three criteria:

* the degree of animal suffering,
* the quality of the research,
* the potential medical benefit.

Bateson suggested that research that does not meet these requirements should not be approved or performed, in accordance with the [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]]. It is not intended as a formal model for optimal trade-offs, but rather a tool for making judicial decisions, since the three axes are not in a common currency.&lt;ref&gt;P. Bateson. Ethics and behavioural biology. Advances in the Study of Behavior, 35 (2005), pp. 211–233&lt;/ref&gt; The third criterion also does not necessarily have to be medical benefit, but could be a wider form of utility. &lt;ref&gt;[[Innes C. Cuthill]], Ethical regulation and animal science: why animal behaviour is not so special. Animal Behaviour. Volume 74, Issue 1, July 2007, Pages 15–22&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6797">'''CEASE''' (Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression) therapy is used by [[Naturopathy|naturopaths]] (particularly [[Homeopathy|homeopaths]]) who claim, without evidence, that it can treat or even cure people with [[autism]]. It involves a mixture of supplements, high-dose vitamin C, 'orthomolecular support', dietary restrictions and [[homeopathy]] and was developed by the late Tinus Smits - a Dutch doctor. Smits claimed to have used it to treat over 300 children with autism. The therapy became more notable in 2017/2018 because of regulatory action taken by professional bodies in The Netherlands, UK and Canada following a series of complaints about unfounded claims. 

Smits in the book "Autism Beyond Despair - CEASE Therapy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/654303657|title=Autism : beyond despair : CEASE therapy|last=Tinus.|first=Smits,|date=2010|publisher=Emryss Publishers|others=Owens, Tim.|isbn=9076189285|location=[Haarlem, The Netherlands]|oclc=654303657}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that autistic children should never be vaccinated.   

In October 2017 the Dutch Advertising Code Foundation (Stichting Reclame Code) found that the official website for CEASE therapy was in breach of advertising regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reclamecode.nl/webuitspraak.asp?ID=199321&amp;acCode|title=2017/00594|publisher=Stichting Reclame|date=3 October 2017|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UK Homeopathy Regulation: More on CEASE Therapy |url=http://ukhomeopathyregulation.blogspot.com/2017/10/more-on-cease-therapy.html |website=UK Homeopathy Regulation |accessdate=14 July 2018 |date=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care|Professional Standards Authority]] (PSA) placed some requirements on the Society of Homeopaths (SoH) when they reaccredited their members' register under their Accredited Register scheme, due to concerns about the way in which members marketed CEASE therapy. The PSA asked the SoH to confirm "what action it will take to ensure children are safe as a condition of its re-accreditation".&lt;ref name=CEASE120homeopaths&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/27/more-than-120-homeopaths-trying-to-cure-autism-in-uk|title=More than 120 homeopaths trying to ‘cure’ autism in UK|publisher=The Guardian|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018 the Society of Homeopaths published a position statement advising their members not to imply any cure of autism when marketing CEASE therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715064408/https://homeopathy-soh.org/society-publishes-position-statement-on-cease/|title=Society publishes position statement on CEASE|publisher=Society of Homeopaths|date=1 June 2018|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that more than 120 homeopaths are offering CEASE in the UK though not all are SoH members.&lt;ref name=CEASE120homeopaths /&gt; In July 2015 the UK's [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) found Teddington Homeopathy's marketing of CEASE therapy in breach of the Advertising Standards Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/teddington-homeopathy-a15-299143.html|title=ASA Ruling on Teddington Homeopathy|publisher=Advertising Standards Authority|date=22 July 2015|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month the ASA added the company to its list of [https://www.asa.org.uk/codes-and-rulings/non-compliant-online-advertisers.html non-compliant online advertisers] for "making unproven efficacy claims for CEASE therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/non-compliant/teddington-homeopathy.html|title=Teddington Homeopathy|publisher=Advertising Standards Authority|date=27 August 2015|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2018 the ASA upheld an adjudication against Bubbling Life's website, determining that the claims relating to CEASE, vaccination, autism and [[Autism_spectrum|ASD]] could discourage customers from seeking appropriate advice or treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/elle-fox--a18-443476.html|title=ASA Ruling on Bubbling Life|date=18 July 2018|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[British Columbia]], Canada, the Board of the College of Naturopathic Physicians investigated three CEASE practitioners &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/homeopathy-for-autism-certainly-not-based-on-science-b-c-health-official-says-1.4677128|title=Homeopathy for autism 'certainly not based on science,' B.C. health official says|publisher=CBC News|date=25 May 2018|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; following complaints from the public and subsequently "determined that naturopathic doctors in British Columbia must not advertise or offer CEASE therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/naturopath-college-outlaws-therapy-promising-complete-elimination-of-autism-1.4682714|title=Naturopath college outlaws therapy that promises 'complete elimination' of autism|publisher=CBC News|date=29 May 2018 |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this prohibition the College's updated position statements also clarify that naturopathic doctors in BC must not offer anti-vaccination materials or advice (including on social media) and must not imply that vaccination causes autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnpbc.bc.ca/changes-to-the-colleges-immunization-standard-and-prohibition-of-cease-therapy-2/|title=Changes to the College’s Immunization Standard and prohibition of CEASE therapy|publisher=College of Naturopathic Physicians of British Columbia|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Challenger Center for Space Science Education''' is a [[United States]] 501(c)(3) [[non-profit organization]] headquartered in [[Washington, DC]]. It was founded in 1986 by the families of the astronauts who died in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] on January 28, 1986.

The organization offers dynamic, hands-on exploration and discovery opportunities to students around the world. These programs equip students with the knowledge, confidence, and skills that will help better our national social and economic well-being.

Challenger Learning Centers give students the chance to become astronauts and engineers and solve real-world problems as they share the thrill of discovery on missions through the Solar System. Using space simulation and role-playing strategies, students bring their classroom studies to life and cultivate the skills needed for future success.

[[File:Metsu, Gabriël - L'Apothicaire - c. 1651-1667.jpg|thumb|250px|''The 
Apothecary'' or ''The Chemist'' by [[Gabriël Metsu]] (c. 1651–67).]]
A '''chemist''' (from Greek chēm (ía) alchemy; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/chemist?s=t&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[scientist]] trained in the study of [[chemistry]]. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of [[molecule]]s and their component [[atom]]s. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] rates, and other [[chemical properties]]. The word 'chemist' is also used to address [[Pharmacist]]s in Commonwealth English.

Chemists use this knowledge to learn the composition and properties of unfamiliar substances, as well as to reproduce and synthesize large quantities of useful naturally occurring substances and create new artificial substances and useful processes. Chemists may specialize in any number of [[Chemistry#Subdisciplines|subdisciplines of chemistry]]. [[Materials science|Materials scientists]] and metallurgists share much of the same education and skills with chemists. The work of chemists is often related to the work of [[chemical engineer]]s, who are primarily concerned with the proper design, construction and evaluation of the most cost-effective large-scale [[chemical plant]]s and work closely with industrial chemists on the development of new processes and methods for the commercial-scale manufacture of chemicals and related products.

==History of chemistry==
{{main|History of chemistry}}
[[File:Medeleeff by repin.jpg|thumb|Russian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] - author of the first modern [[periodic table of elements]]]]
[[File:Antoine lavoisier color.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Antoine Lavoisier (1743–94) is considered the "[[People known as the father or mother of something|Father of Modern Chemistry]]".]]
The roots of chemistry can be traced to the phenomenon of [[combustion|burning]]. [[Fire]] was a mystical force that transformed one substance into another and thus was of primary interest to mankind. It was fire that led to the [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] of [[iron]] and [[glasses]]. After [[gold]] was discovered and became a precious metal, many people were interested to find a method that could convert other substances into gold. This led to the [[protoscience]] called [[alchemy]]. The word ''chemist'' is derived from the [[New Latin]] noun ''chimista'', an abbreviation of ''alchimista'' ([[Alchemy|alchemist]]). Alchemists discovered many [[chemical process]]es that led to the development of modern chemistry. Chemistry as we know it today, was invented by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] with his law of [[conservation of mass]] in 1783. The [[discoveries of the chemical elements]] has a long history culminating in the creation of the [[periodic table]] by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]. The [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] created in 1901 gives an excellent overview of chemical discovery since the start of the 20th century.

==Education==
Jobs for chemists usually require at least a [[bachelor's degree]], but many positions, especially those in research, require a  [[Master of Science]] or a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD.). Most undergraduate programs emphasize [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] as well as chemistry, partly because chemistry is also known as "[[the central science]]", thus chemists ought to have a well-rounded knowledge about science. At the [[Master's degree|Master's]] level and higher, students tend to specialize in a particular field. Fields of specialization include [[biochemistry]], [[nuclear chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[inorganic chemistry]], [[polymer chemistry]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[theoretical chemistry]], [[quantum chemistry]], [[environmental chemistry]], and [[thermochemistry]]. [[Postdoctoral]] experience may be required for certain positions.

Workers whose work involves chemistry, but not at a complexity requiring an education with a chemistry degree, are commonly referred to as ''[[chemical technician]]s''. Such technicians commonly do such work as simpler, routine analyses for [[quality control]] or in [[Clinical laboratory|clinical laboratories]], having an [[associate degree]]. A chemical technologist has more education or experience than a chemical technician but less than a chemist, often having a bachelor's degree in a different field of science with also an associate degree in chemistry (or many credits related to chemistry) or having the same education as a chemical technician but more experience. There are also degrees specific to become a chemical technologist, which are somewhat distinct from those required when a student is interested in becoming a professional chemist. A Chemical technologist is more involved in the management and operation of the equipment and instrumentation necessary to perform chemical analyzes than a chemical technician. They are part of the team of a chemical laboratory in which the quality of the raw material, intermediate products and finished products is analyzed. They also perform functions in the areas of environmental quality control and the operational phase of a chemical plant.

In addition to all the training usually given to chemical technologists in their respective degree (or one given via an associate degree), a chemist is also trained to understand more details related to chemical phenomena so that the chemist can be capable of more planning on the steps to achieve a distinct goal via a chemistry-related endeavor. The higher the competency level achieved in the field of chemistry (as assessed via a combination of education, experience and personal achievements), the higher the responsibility given to that chemist and the more complicated the task might be. Chemistry, as a field, have so many applications that different tasks and objectives can be given to workers or scientists with these different levels of education or experience. The specific title of each job varies from position to position, depending on factors such as the kind of industry, the routine level of the task, the current needs of a particular enterprise, the size of the enterprise or hiring firm, the philosophy and management principles of the hiring firm, the visibility of the competency and individual achievements of the one seeking employment, economic factors such as [[recession]] or [[economic depression]], among other factors, so this makes it difficult to categorize the exact roles of these chemistry-related workers as standard for that given level of education. Because of these factors affecting exact job titles with distinct responsibilities, some chemists might begin doing technician tasks while other chemists might begin doing more complicated tasks than those of a technician, such as tasks that also involve formal applied research, management, or supervision included within the responsibilities of that same job title. The level of supervision given to that chemist also varies in a similar manner, with factors similar to those that affect the tasks demanded for a particular chemist.
[[File:Kolo Naukowe Flogiston.jpg|thumb|A chemist in a lab]]
It is important that those interested in a Chemistry degree understand the variety of roles available to them (on average), which vary depending on education and job experience. Those Chemists who hold a bachelor's degree are most commonly involved in positions related to either research assistance (working under the guidance of senior chemists in a research-oriented activity), or, alternatively, they may work on distinct (chemistry-related) aspects of a business, organization or enterprise including aspects that involve quality control, quality assurance, manufacturing, production, formulation, inspection, method validation, visitation for troubleshooting of chemistry-related instruments, [[regulatory affairs]], "on-demand" technical services, chemical analysis for non-research purposes (e.g., as a legal request, for testing purposes, or for government or non-profit agencies); chemists may also work in environmental evaluation and assessment. Other jobs or roles may include sales and marketing of chemical products and chemistry-related instruments or technical writing. The more experience obtained, the more independence and leadership or management roles these chemists may perform in those organizations. Some chemists with relatively higher experience might change jobs or job position to become a manager of a chemistry-related enterprise, a supervisor, an entrepreneur or a chemistry consultant. Other chemists choose to combine their education and experience as a chemist with a distinct credential to provide different services (e.g., forensic chemists, chemistry-related software development, patent law specialists, environmental law firm staff, scientific news reporting staff, engineering design staff, etc.).

In comparison, chemists who have obtained a Master of Science (M.S.) in chemistry or in a very related discipline may find chemist roles that allow them to enjoy more independence, leadership and responsibility earlier in their careers with less years of experience than those with a bachelor's degree as highest degree. Sometimes, M.S. chemists receive more complex tasks duties in comparison with the roles and positions found by chemists with a bachelor's degree as their highest academic degree and with the same or close-to-same years of job experience. There are positions that are open only to those that at least have a degree related to chemistry at the master's level. Although good chemists without a Ph. D. degree but with relatively many years of experience may be allowed some applied research positions, the general rule is that Ph. D. chemists are preferred for research positions and are typically the preferred choice for the highest administrative positions on big enterprises involved in chemistry-related duties. Some positions, especially research oriented, will only allow those chemists who are Ph. D. holders. Jobs that involve intensive research and actively seek to lead the discovery of completely new chemical compounds under specifically assigned monetary funds and resources or jobs that seek to develop new scientific theories require a Ph. D. more often than not. Chemists with a Ph. D. as the highest academic degree are found typically on the research-and-development department of an enterprise and can also hold [[university]] positions as professors. Professors for research universities or for big universities usually have a Ph. D., and some research-oriented institutions might require post-doctoral training. Some smaller colleges (including some smaller four-year colleges or smaller non-research universities for undergraduates) as well as [[community colleges]] usually hire chemists with a M.S. as professors too (and rarely, some big universities who need part-time or temporary instructors, or temporary staff), but when the positions are scarce and the applicants are many, they might prefer Ph. D. holders instead.

==Employment==
The three major employers of chemists are academic institutions, industry, especially the [[chemical industry]] and the [[pharmaceutical industry]], and government laboratories.

Chemistry typically is divided into several major sub-disciplines. There are also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry. There is a great deal of overlap between different branches of chemistry, as well as with other scientific fields such as biology, medicine, physics, [[radiology]], and several engineering disciplines.

*[[Analytical chemistry]] is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[structure]]. Analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry. These methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry.
*[[Biochemistry]] is the study of the [[chemical compound|chemicals]], [[chemical reaction]]s and [[chemical interaction]]s that take place in living [[organism]]s. Biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related, for example, in [[medicinal chemistry]].

[[File:Laura Miller at ANL.jpg|right|frame|A chemist prepares a new [[fuel cell]] for testing.]]
[[File:Julie Perkins at LLNL.jpg|right|frame|A chemist pours from a [[round-bottom flask]].]]

*[[Inorganic chemistry]] is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. The distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of [[organometallic chemistry]]. The [[Inorganic chemistry]] is also the study of atomic and molecular structure and bonding.
*[[Medicinal chemistry]] is the science involved with designing, synthesizing and developing pharmaceutical drugs. Medicinal chemistry involves the identification, synthesis and development of new chemical entities suitable for therapeutic use. It also includes the study of existing drugs, their biological properties, and their quantitative structure-activity relationships.
*[[Organic chemistry]] is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and chemical reaction of carbon compounds.
*[[Physical chemistry]] is the study of the physical fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Important areas of study include chemical thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, electrochemistry, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, and spectroscopy. Physical chemistry has a large overlap with theoretical chemistry and molecular physics. Physical chemistry involves the use of [[calculus]] in deriving equations.
*[[Theoretical chemistry]] is the study of chemistry via theoretical reasoning (usually within [[mathematics]] or [[physics]]). In particular, the application of [[quantum mechanics]] to chemistry is called [[quantum chemistry]]. Since the end of the [[Second World War]], the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of [[computational chemistry]], which is the art of developing and applying [[computer program]]s for solving chemical problems. Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with [[condensed matter physics]] and [[molecular physics]]. See [[reductionism]].

All the above major areas of chemistry employ chemists. Other fields where chemical degrees are useful include [[astrochemistry]] (and [[cosmochemistry]]), [[atmospheric chemistry]], [[chemical engineering]], [[chemo-informatics]], [[electrochemistry]], [[environmental science]], [[forensic science]], [[geochemistry]], [[green chemistry]], [[history of chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[medical science]], [[molecular biology]], [[molecular genetics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[nuclear chemistry]], [[oenology]], [[organometallic chemistry]], [[petrochemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[photochemistry]], [[phytochemistry]], [[polymer chemistry]], [[supramolecular chemistry]] and [[surface chemistry]].

==Professional societies==
Chemists may belong to [[Professional society|professional societies]] specifically for professionals and researchers within the field of Chemistry, such as the  [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] in the United Kingdom, or the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS) in the United States.

==Honors and awards==
The highest honor awarded to chemists is the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], awarded since 1901, by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

'''Correactology''' is a system of [[alternative medicine]] based on the unsubstantiated claim that "regulating the density of cells" in the body improves a wide range of ailments. An offshoot of [[Chiropractic|chiropractics]], the treatment was developed in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury (Ontario)]] in 2002 by brothers Michael and Allan Lapointe.&lt;ref name=CBCBoreal/&gt; It has been branded a [[pseudoscience]] by critics&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;&lt;ref name=kata/&gt; and the sole training program in the subject has been taken to court by former students.&lt;ref name=court/&gt;

During correactology treatments, the practitioners hold their hands over patients, snap their fingers and apply a light touch to the skin of the patient. Allan Lapointe claims they are first looking for "areas of resistance in the eight segments of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], indicating areas of [[Pathology|pathological]] or [[Anatomy|anatomical]] dysfunction." The practitioner then allegedly uses his hands to change the behaviour of [[Protein|proteins]] present in human cells, to improve wellness and reduce pain: "We cause a cascading effect to change the behaviour of the proteins. When the proteins change, our behaviour changes because of course proteins control all."&lt;ref name=audio/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBCBoreal/&gt;&lt;ref name=kata/&gt;

Medical professionals have been questioning the practice as it becomes more widespread. Deputy Editor of the [[Canadian Medical Association Journal|''Canadian Medical Association Journal'']] Matthew Stanbrook denounced the claims made by the practitioners: "That is [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-science]] that uses a scientific word that doesn't mean what density means. That makes absolutely no sense, to talk about the density of cells not being optimal. It makes even less sense to put forward the idea that through the manipulation involving touching, one could set the density of cells to an optimum level."&lt;ref name=audio/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBCBoreal/&gt; McGill University's [[Office for Science and Society]] also identifies correactology as a pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;

While they have no formal medical training, the Lapointes say they are working on research showing their techniques are more effective than placebos.&lt;ref name=audio/&gt;

Practitioners are present in a dozen clinics throughout Ontario, as well as one in [[Gatineau|Gatineau (Quebec)]]. Correactology is a term trademarked by a corporation owned by the Lapointe brothers and run by their parents. The treatment is not recognized by either the Ontario College of Chiropractors or the [[College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario|Ontario College of Physicians]]. The Quebec College of Physicians is investigating the techniques and claims related to correactology.&lt;ref name=audio/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBCBoreal/&gt;

==Collège Boréal programme and court case==

In 2016, the [[Collège Boréal]] signed a four-year agreement by which Sudbury's Correactology Health Care Center would offer a training programme for the College's students, at a cost of $50,000 per student. Boréal cancelled the agreement after two years,&lt;ref name=audio/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBCBoreal/&gt; as three former students took the correactology center to court on charges of false statements, conspiracy, impediment to trade and breach of contract.&lt;ref name=court/&gt;

The court proceedings showed the students had to commit to giving 30 percent of their future earnings to the correactology center. An attempt to have the court case dismissed by invoking the confidentiality clause of the training contract was rebuffed by the court in July, 2018. The court proceedings continue.&lt;ref name=court/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9606">'''Daffy's Elixir''' (also sometimes known as '''Daffey's Elixir''' or '''Daffye's Elixir''') is a name that has been used by several [[patent medicines]] over the years. It was originally designed for diseases of the stomach, but was later marketed as a universal cure. It remained a popular remedy in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and later the [[United States of America]] throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

[[Image:Three early medicine bottles.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three empty bottle medicine bottles, the centre on embossed with the words 'Dicey and Co. True Daffy's Elixir|An empty bottle of True Daffy's Elixir (centre) Dicey and Co.]]

== Origins ==

Daffy's Elixir was one of the most popular and frequently advertised [[patent medicines]] in Britain during the 18th century. It is reputed to have been invented by clergyman [[Thomas Daffy]] rector of [[Redmile]], [[Leicestershire]], in 1647. He named it '''elixir salutis''' (lit. ''elixir of health'') and promoted as a generic [[cure-all]].

[[Image:Daffy's elixir.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=A recipe for Daffey's Elixir|A home recipe for the True Daffy's Elixir, from William Augustus Henderson ''Modern domestic cookery and useful receipt book'', New York, 1829.]]

== Ingredients ==

An early recipe for "True Daffy" from 1700 lists the following ingredients: [[aniseed]], [[brandy]], [[cochineal]], [[elecampane]], [[fennel seed]], [[jalap]], [[manna]], [[parsley seed]], [[raisin]], [[rhubarb]], [[saffron]], [[Senna (plant)|senna]] and [[spanish liquorice]]. Chemical analysis has shown this to be a [[laxative]] made mostly from alcohol.

== Subsequent history ==

After Daffy's death in 1680 the recipe was left to his daughter Catherine, and his kinsmen Anthony and Daniel who were [[apothecary|apothecaries]] in [[Nottingham]]. Anthony Daffy moved to London in the 1690s and began to exploit the product issuing pamphlets such as ''Directions for taking elixir salutis or, the famous purging cordial, known by the name of Daffy's elixir salutis'' [London], [1690?]. His widow Elleanor Daffy continued from about 1693 and (their daughter?) Katharine from about 1707. During the early 18th century the product was advertised widely in the emerging national and local [[newspaper]]s. The success attracted several counterfeit copies, using inferior alcohol rather than brandy.

The medicine was later produced by William and Cluer Dicey &amp; Co. of Bow Church yard c.1775 who claimed the sole rights of manufacture of the True Daffy's Elixir, although the recipe was not subject to any patent. Proprietorship was also then claimed by Peter Swinton of Salisbury Court and his son Anthony Daffy Swinton who may have been descended from the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, (1953), p.238.&lt;/ref&gt; Dicey and Co. and their successors marketed it in the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Coxe | first = John Redman | title = The American dispensatory | publisher = Carey and Lea | year = 1831 | location = Philadelphia  | page = 780  | url =  | doi =  | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It then passed to Dicey and Sutton, and later to Messrs W. Sutton &amp; Co. of [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] [[Middlesex]] who continuing to market it throughout the nineteenth century. The use of Daffy's elixir is referred to in [[Anthony Trollope]]'s novel [[Barchester Towers]], 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Trollope | first = Anthony | title = Barchester Towers | publisher = Folio Society | year = 1977 | location = London | page = 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daffy's elixir is also mentioned on several occasions in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel [[Mason &amp; Dixon]], particularly by [[Jeremiah Dixon]], who attempts to procure large quantities before beginning his surveying trip with [[Charles Mason]].  Dixon is warned by [[Benjamin Franklin]], however, that imported Daffy's Elixir is extremely expensive, and he would be better off ordering a customized version from the [[apothecary]].  During the same visit, Dixon also orders [[laudanum]], a well-known constipating agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pynchon | first = Thomas | title = Mason &amp; Dixon | publisher = Penguin | year = 1997 | location = New York | page = 267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daffy's elixir is also mentioned in the [[Charles Dickens]] book, [[Oliver Twist]], Ch. II, where it is referred to as Daffy, in the sentence: 'Why, it's what I'm obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into the blessed infants' Daffy, when they ain't well, Mr. Bumble,(the Parish [[Beadle]])' replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and glass. 'It's gin. I'll not deceive you, Mr. B. It's gin.'

Daffy’s Elixir is also mentioned in the [[Works of William Makepeace Thackeray]] book, [[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]], Chapter XXXVIII A Family In a Small Way, where it is referenced in the sentence ‘..and there found Mrs. Sedley  in the act of surreptitiously administering Daffy’s Elixir to the infant.’

'''''De rerum natura''''' ({{IPA-la|deːˈreːrũn&lt;!-- FOR INFO ON WHY THIS IS AN "N" INSTEAD OF AN "M", SEE: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABrutal_Russian&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=825617811&amp;oldid=825527381 --&gt;.naːˈtuːraː|lang}}; '''''On the Nature of Things''''') is a first-century BC [[Didacticism|didactic]] poem by the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[poet]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Lucretius]] (c. 99 BC – c. 55 BC) with the goal of explaining [[Epicureanism|Epicurean philosophy]] to a Roman audience. The poem, written in some 7,400 [[dactylic hexameter]]s, is divided into six untitled books, and explores Epicurean physics through poetic language and metaphors.&lt;ref name=TNY&gt;[[#Greenblatt1|Greenblatt (2011)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Namely, Lucretius explores the principles of [[atomism]]; the nature of the [[mind]] and [[soul]]; explanations of [[Sense|sensation]] and [[thought]]; the development of the [[world]] and its phenomena; and explains a variety of [[Celestial sphere|celestial]] and [[Earth|terrestrial]] phenomena. The [[universe]] described in the poem operates according to these physical principles, guided by ''fortuna'' ("chance"),&lt;ref&gt;In particular, ''De rerum natura'' 5.107 (''fortuna gubernans'', "guiding chance" or "fortune at the helm"). See: [[#Gale19941996|Gale (1996) [1994]]], pp. 213, 223{{en dash}}24.&lt;/ref&gt; and not the divine intervention of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional Roman deities]].

==Background==

[[File:Lucretius1.png|thumb|right|''De rerum natura'' was written by the Roman poet [[Lucretius]].]]

To the Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]], the unhappiness and degradation of [[human]]s arose largely from the dread which they entertained of the power of the [[Greek gods|deities]], from terror of their wrath. This wrath was supposed to be displayed by the misfortunes inflicted in this life and by the everlasting tortures that were the lot of the guilty in a future state (or, where these feelings were not strongly developed, from a vague dread of gloom and misery after death). Epicurus thus made it his mission to remove these fears, and thus to establish tranquility in the minds of his readers. To do this, Epicurus invoked the [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] to demonstrate that the material universe was formed not by a [[Supreme Being]], but by the mixing of elemental particles that had existed from all eternity governed by certain simple laws. He argued that the deities (whose existence he did not deny) lived forevermore in the enjoyment of absolute peace{{em dash}}strangers to all the passions, desires, and fears, which affect humans{{em dash}} and totally indifferent to the world and its inhabitants, unmoved alike by their virtues and their crimes. This meant that humans had nothing to fear from them.

Lucretius's task was to clearly state and fully develop these views in an attractive form; his work was an attempt to show through poetry that everything in nature can be explained by natural laws, without the need for the intervention of divine beings.&lt;ref name="ramsay"&gt;[[#Ramsay|Ramsay (1867)]], pp. 829{{en dash}}30.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucretius identifies the [[supernatural]] with the notion that the deities created our world or interfere with its operations in some way. He argues against fear of such deities by demonstrating, through observations and arguments, that the operations of the world can be accounted for in terms of natural phenomena. These phenomena are the result of regular, but purposeless motions and interactions of tiny [[atom]]s in empty space.

==Contents==

===Synopsis===

The poem consists of six untitled books, in [[dactylic hexameter]]. The first three books provide a fundamental account of being and nothingness, matter and space, the atoms and their movement, the infinity of the universe both as regards time and space, the regularity of reproduction (no prodigies, everything in its proper habitat), the nature of mind (''animus'', directing thought) and spirit (''anima'', sentience) as material bodily entities, and their mortality, since, according to Lucretius, they and their functions (consciousness, pain) end with the bodies that contain them and with which they are interwoven. The last three books give an atomic and materialist explanation of phenomena preoccupying human reflection, such as vision and the senses, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Epicurean sexuality|sex and reproduction]], natural forces and agriculture, the heavens, and disease.

[[File:Ares e Afrodite.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Lucretius opens his poem by addressing [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] (''center''), urging her to pacify her lover, Mars (''right''). Given Lucretius's relatively secular philosophy and his eschewing of superstition, his invocation of Venus has caused much debate.]]

Lucretius opens his poem by addressing [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] not only as the mother of Rome (''Aeneadum genetrix'') but also as the veritable [[Mother Nature|mother of nature]] (''Alma Venus''), urging her to pacify her lover [[Mars (god)|Mars]] and spare Rome from strife.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leonard|Leonard (1916)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt; By recalling the opening to poems by [[Homer]], [[Ennius]], and [[Hesiod]] (all of which begin with an invocation to [[the Muses]]), the proem to ''De rerum natura'' conforms to epic convention. The entire proem is also written in the format of a hymn, recalling other early literary works, texts, and hymns and in particular the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Keith|Keith (2012)]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The choice to address Venus may have been due to [[Empedocles]]'s belief that Aphrodite represents "the great creative force in the cosmos".&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford&gt;[[#Sedley|Sedley (2013) [2004]]].&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Lucretius goes on to argue that the gods are removed from human life, many have thus seen this opening to be contradictory: how can Lucretius pray to Venus and then deny that the gods listen to or care about human affairs?&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt; In response, many scholars argue that the poet uses Venus poetically as a [[metonym]]. For instance, Diskin Clay sees Venus as a poetic substitute for sex, and Bonnie Catto sees the invocation of the name as a metonym for the "creative process of ''natura''".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catto|Catto (1988)]], p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the opening, the poem commences with an enunciation of the proposition on the nature and being of the deities, which leads to an invective against the evils of [[superstition]]. Lucretius then dedicates time to exploring the [[axiom]] that [[nothing]] can be produced from nothing, and that nothing can be reduced to nothing (''Nil fieri ex nihilo, in nihilum nil posse reverti''). Following this, the poet argues that the universe comprises an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of [[Atomism|Atoms]], which are scattered about in an infinite and vast void (''Inane''). The shape of these atoms, their properties, their movements, the laws under which they enter into combination and assume forms and qualities appreciable by the senses, with other preliminary matters on their nature and affections, together with a refutation of objections and opposing [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], occupy the first two books.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;

In the third book, the general concepts proposed thus far are applied to demonstrate that the vital and intellectual principles, the ''Anima'' and ''Animus'', are as much a part of us as are our limbs and members, but like those limbs and members have no distinct and independent existence, and that hence soul and [[Human body|body]] live and perish together; the book concludes by arguing that the fear of death is a folly, as death merely extinguishes all feeling{{em dash}}both the good and the bad.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;

The fourth book is devoted to the theory of the senses, [[Visual perception|sight]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[taste]], [[Olfaction|smell]], of [[sleep]] and of [[dream]]s, ending with a disquisition upon [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Epicurean sexuality|love and sex]].&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;

The fifth book is described by Ramsay as the most finished and impressive,&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt; while Stahl argues that its "puerile conceptions" is proof that Lucretius should be judged as a poet, not as a scientist.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stahl|Stahl (1962)]], pp. 82{{en dash}}83.&lt;/ref&gt;  This book addresses the origin of the [[world]] and of all things therein, the movements of the heavenly bodies, the changing of the [[season]]s, [[day]] and [[night]], the rise and progress of humankind, [[society]],  political institutions, and the invention of the various [[The arts|arts]] and [[science]]s which embellish and ennoble life.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;

The sixth book contains an explanation of some of the most striking natural appearances, especially [[thunder]], [[lightning]], [[hail]], [[rain]], [[snow]], [[ice]], [[cold]], [[heat]], [[wind]], [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano]]es, [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and localities noxious to [[animal]] life, which leads to a discourse upon [[disease]]s. This introduces a detailed description of the [[Plague of Athens|great pestilence]] that devastated [[Classical Athens|Athens]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. With this episode, the book closes; this abrupt ending suggests that Lucretius might have died before he was able to finalize and fully edit his poem.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;

===Purpose===

Lucretius wrote this epic poem to "Memmius", who may be [[Gaius Memmius (poet)|Gaius Memmius]], who in 58 BC was a [[praetor]], a judicial official deciding controversies between citizens and the government.&lt;ref name="Englert2003"&gt;[[#Englert|Englert (2003)]], p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; There are over a dozen references to "Memmius" scattered throughout the long poem in a variety of contexts in translation, such as "Memmius mine", "my Memmius", and "illustrious Memmius". According to Lucretius's frequent statements in his poem, the main purpose of the work was to free Gaius Memmius's mind of the [[supernatural]] and the [[fear]] of [[death]]—and to induct him into a state of ''[[ataraxia]]'' by expounding the philosophical system of [[Epicurus]], whom Lucretius glorifies as the hero of his epic poem.

However, the purpose of the poem is subject to ongoing scholarly debate. Lucretius refers to Memmius by name four times in the first book, three times in the second, five in the fifth, and not at all in the third, fourth, or sixth books. In relation to this discrepancy in the frequency of Lucretius's reference to the apparent subject of his poem, Kannengiesse advances the theory that Lucretius wrote the first version of ''De rerum natura'' for the reader at large, and subsequently revised in order to write it for Memmius. However, Memmius' name is central to several critical verses in the poem, and this theory has therefore been largely discredited.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stearns|Stearns (1931)]], p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The German classicists [[Ivo Bruns]] and Samuel Brandt set forth an alternative theory that Lucretius did at first write the poem with Memmius in mind, but that his enthusiasm for his patron cooled.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bruns|Bruns (1884)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1885)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Stearns suggests that this is because Memmius reneged on a promise to pay for a new school to be built on the site of the old Epicurean school.&lt;ref name=stearns68/&gt; Memmius was also a tribune in 66, praetor in 58, governor of Bithynia in 57, and was a candidate for the consulship in 54 but was disqualified for bribery, and Stearns suggests that the warm relationship between patron and client may have cooled (''sed tua me virtus tamen et sperata voluptas'' / ''suavis amicitiae quemvis efferre laborem'', "But still your merit, and as I hope, the joy / Of our sweet friendship, urge me to any toil").&lt;ref name=stearns68&gt;[[#Stearns|Stearns (1931)]], p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 1.140.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a certain irony to the poem, namely that while Lucretius extols the virtue of the Epicurean school of thought, Epicurus himself had advised his acolytes from penning poetry because he believed it to make that which was simple overly complicated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lucretius-De-May|Lucretius &amp; de May (2009)]], v.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his first book, Lucretius defends his fusion of Epicureanism and poetry with a [[simile]], arguing that the philosophy he espouses is like a medicine: life-saving but often unpleasant. Poetry, on the other hand, is like honey, in that it is a "a sweetener that sugarcoats the bitter medicine of Epicurean philosophy and entices the audience to swallow it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 1.936{{en dash}}50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Keith|Keith (2013)]], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; (Of note, Lucretius repeats these 25 lines, almost verbatim, in the introduction to the fourth book.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 4.1{{en dash}}25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Completeness===

The state of the poem as it currently exists suggests that it was released in an unfinished state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the poem concludes rather abruptly, there are dual passages throughout, and at 5.155 Lucretius mentions that he will spend a great deal of time discussing the nature of the gods, which never comes to pass.&lt;ref name=ramsay /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 2, note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that Lucretius died before being able to edit, finalize, and publish his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#West|West (2007)]], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main ideas==

===Metaphysics===

====Lack of divine intervention====

After the poem was rediscovered and made its rounds across Europe and beyond, numerous thinkers began to see Lucretius's Epicureanism as a "threat synonymous with atheism."&lt;ref name=sheppard31/&gt; Some Christian apologists viewed ''De rerum natura'' as an [[atheist]] manifesto and a dangerous foil to be thwarted.&lt;ref name=sheppard31&gt;[[#Sheppard|Sheppard (2015)]], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at that time the label was extremely broad and did not necessarily mean a denial of divine entities (for example, some large Christian sects labelled dissenting groups as atheists).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sheppard|Sheppard (2015)]], pp. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; What is more, Lucretius does not deny the existence of deities;&lt;ref name=palmer26&gt;[[#Palmer|Palmer (2014)]], p. 26. "Lucretius was a theist."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bullivant|Bullivant &amp; Ruse 2013]]. "To be sure, Lucretius and Epicurus are not professed atheists [but] the resulting theism is one that denies providence and rejects transcendentalism."&lt;/ref&gt; he simply argues that they did not create the universe, that they do not care about human affairs, and that they do not intervene in the world.&lt;ref name="sheppard31"/&gt; Regardless, due to the ideas espoused in the poem, much of Lucretius's work was seen by many as direct a challenge to theistic, Christian belief.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sheppard|Sheppard (2015)]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ada Palmer]] has labelled six ideas in Lucretius's thought (viz. his assertion that the world was created from chaos, and his denials of Providence, divine participation, miracles, the efficacy of prayer, and an afterlife) as "proto-atheistic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Palmer|Palmer (2014)]], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=palmer26again&gt;[[#Palmer|Palmer (2014)]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; She qualifies her use of this term, cautioning that it is not to be used to say that Lucretius was himself an atheist in the modern sense of the word, nor that atheism is a [[teleology|teleological]] necessity, but rather that many of his ideas were taken up by 19th, 20th, and 21st century atheists.&lt;ref name=palmer26again/&gt;

====Repudiation of immortality====

''De rerum natura'' does not argue that the soul does not exist; rather, the poem claims that the soul, like all things in existence, is made up of atoms, and because these atoms will one day drift apart, the human soul is not immortal. Lucretius thus argues that death is simply annihilation, and that there is no [[afterlife]]. He likens the physical body to a vessel that holds both the mind (''mens'') and spirit (''anima''). To prove that neither the mind nor spirit can survive independent of the body, Lucretius uses a simple analogy: when a vessel shatters, its contents spill everywhere; likewise, when the body dies, the mind and spirit dissipate. And as a simple ceasing-to-be, death can be neither good nor bad for this being, since a dead person{{em dash}}being completely devoid of sensation and thought{{em dash}}cannot miss being alive.&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt; To further alleviate the fear of non-existence, Lucretius makes use of the [[symmetry argument]]: he argues that the [[eternal oblivion]] awaiting all humans after death is exactly the same as the infinite nothingness that preceded our birth. Since that nothingness (which in fact, was like a deep, peaceful sleep) caused us no pain or discomfort, we should not fear the same nothingness that will follow our own demise:&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Look back again{{em dash}}how the endless ages of time comes to pass
:Before our birth are nothing to us. This is a looking glass
:Nature holds up for us in which we see the time to come
:After we finally die. What is there that looks so fearsome?
:What's so tragic? Isn't it more peaceful than any sleep?&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 3.972{{en dash}}76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Lucretius sees those who fear death as embracing the fallacious assumption that they will be present in some sense "to regret and bewail [their] own non-existence."&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt;

===Physics===

Lucretius maintained that he could free humankind from fear of the deities by demonstrating that all things occur by natural causes without any intervention by the deities. Historians of science, however, have been critical of the limitations of his Epicurean approach to science, especially as it pertained to [[astronomy|astronomical]] topics, which he relegated to the class of "unclear" objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lloyd|Lloyd (1973)]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stahl|Stahl (1962)]], pp. 81{{en dash}}83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, he began his discussion by claiming that he would
&lt;blockquote&gt;explain by what forces nature steers the courses of the Sun and the journeyings of the Moon, so that we shall not suppose that they run their yearly races between heaven and earth of their own free will [i.e., are gods themselves] or that they are rolled round in furtherance of some divine plan....&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 5.76{{en dash}}81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, when he set out to put this plan into practice, he limited himself to showing how one, or several different, naturalistic accounts could explain certain natural phenomena. He was unable to tell his readers how to determine which of these alternatives might be the true one.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Alioto|Alioto (1987)]], p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when considering the reason for stellar movements, Lucretius provides two possible explanations: that the sky itself rotates, or that the sky as a whole is stationary while constellations move.  If the latter is true, Lucretius, notes, this is because: "either swift currents of ether whirl round and round and roll their fires at large across the nocturnal regions of the sky"; "an external current of air from some other quarter may whirl them along in their course"; or "they may swim of their own accord, each responsive to the call of its own food, and feed their fiery bodies in the broad pastures of the sky". Lucretius concludes that "one of these causes must certainly operate in our world... But to lay down which of them it is lies beyond the range of our stumbling progress."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 5.510{{en dash}}533.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on these, and other passages, William Stahl considered that "The anomalous and derivative character of the scientific portions of Lucretius' poem makes it reasonable to conclude that his significance should be judged as a poet, not as a scientist."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stahl|Stahl (1962)]], p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Determinism]] appears to conflict with the concept of [[free will]]. Lucretius attempts to allow for free will in his [[physicalism|physicalistic]] universe by postulating an [[indeterminism|indeterministic]] tendency for atoms to veer randomly ({{lang-la|[[clinamen]]}}, literally "the turning aside of a thing", but often translated as "the swerve").&lt;ref name=TNY/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lewis-&amp;-Short|Lewis &amp; Short (1879)]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lucretius, this unpredictable swerve occurs at no fixed place or time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When atoms move straight down through the void by their own weight, they deflect a bit in space at a quite uncertain time and in uncertain places, just enough that you could say that their motion has changed. But if they were not in the habit of swerving, they would all fall straight down through the depths of the void, like drops of rain, and no collision would occur, nor would any blow be produced among the atoms. In that case, nature would never have produced anything.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 2.216{{en dash}}224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lucretius-Inwood|Lucretius, Inwood, &amp; Gerson (1994)]], pp. 65{{en dash}}66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This swerving provides the indeterminacy that Lucretius argues allows for the "free will which living things throughout the world have" (''libera per terras'' ... ''haec animantibus exstat'' ... ''voluntas'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucretius]], ''De rerum natura'' 2.256{{en dash}}57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual history==

===Classical antiquity to the Middle Ages===

[[File:MatthiasStom-SaintJerome-Nantes.jpg|thumb|right|[[St. Jerome]] contended in his ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' that Cicero amended and edited ''De rerum natura''. This assertion has been hotly debated, with most scholars thinking it was a mistake on Jerome's part.]]

[[Martin Ferguson Smith]] notes that [[Cicero]]'s close friend, [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]], was an Epicurean publisher, and it is possible his slaves made the very first copies of ''De rerum natura''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith&amp;Rouse|Smith (1992) [1924]]], pp. xiii{{en dash}}xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; If this were the case, then it might explain how Cicero came to be familiar with Lucretius's work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith&amp;Rouse|Smith (1992) [1924]]], p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; In c. AD 380, [[St. Jerome]] would contend in his ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' that Cicero amended and edited ''De rerum natura'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]], ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; although most scholars argue that this is an erroneous claim;&lt;ref name=butterfield1n4/&gt; the classicist David Butterfield argues that this mistake was likely made by Jerome (or his sources) because the earliest reference to Lucretius is in the aforementioned letter from Cicero.&lt;ref name=butterfield1n4&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 1, note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a small minority of scholars argue that Jerome's assertion may be credible.&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt;

The oldest purported fragments of ''De rerum natura'' were published by K. Kleve in 1989 and consist of sixteen fragments. These remnants were discovered among the Epicurean library in the [[Villa of the Papyri]], [[Herculaneum]]. Because, as W. H. D. Rouse notes, "the fragments are so minute and bear so few certainly identifiable letters", at this point in time "some scepticism about their proposed authorship seems pardonable and prudent."&lt;ref name=earlymanu/&gt; However, Kleve contends that four of the six books are represented in the fragments, which he argues is reason to assume that the entire poem was at one time kept in the library. If Lucretius's poem were to be definitely placed at the Villa of the Papyri, it would suggest that it was studied by the Neapolitan Epicurean school.&lt;ref name=earlymanu&gt;[[#Rouse|Rouse (1992) [1924]]], pp. liv{{en dash}}lv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copies of the poem were preserved in a number of medieval libraries, with the earliest extant manuscripts dating from the ninth-century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 6{{en dash}}13.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest{{em dash}}and, according to David Butterfield, most famous{{em dash}}of these is the Codex Oblongus, often called O. This copy has been dated to the early ninth century and was produced by a [[Carolingian]] [[scriptorium]] (likely a monastery connected to the court of [[Charlemagne]]).&lt;ref name="o_68"&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 6{{en dash}}8.&lt;/ref&gt; O is currently housed at [[Leiden University]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these ninth-century manuscripts is the Codex Quadratus, often called Q. This manuscript was likely copied after O, sometime in the mid-ninth century.&lt;ref name="q_89"&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 8{{en dash}}9.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Q is also housed at Leiden University.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; The third and final ninth-century manuscript{{em dash}}which comprises the ''Schedae Gottorpienses'' fragment (commonly called G and located in the Kongelige Bibliotek of [[Copenhagen]]) and the ''Schedae Vindobonenses'' fragments (commonly called V and U and located in the [[Austrian National Library]] in [[Vienna]]){{em dash}}was christened by Butterfield as S and has been dated to the latter part of the ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 10{{en dash}}11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 313{{en dash}}14.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars consider manuscripts O, Q, and S to all be descendants of the original [[Archetype (textual criticism)|archetype]], which they dub Ω.&lt;ref name=b17&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while O is a direct descendant of the archetype,&lt;ref name=b17/&gt; Q and S are believed to have both been derived from a manuscript (Ψ) that in turn had been derived from a damaged and modified version of the archetype (Ω&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 15{{en dash}}16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 18{{en dash}}19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rediscovery to the present===

[[File:Gianfrancesco Poggio Bracciolini - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Engraving of Poggio Bracciolini in middle age|''De rerum natura'' was rediscovered by [[Poggio Bracciolini]] c.{{nbsp}}1416{{en dash}}1417.]]

While there exist a handful of references to Lucretius in Romance and Germanic sources dating between the ninth-and fifteenth centuries (references that, according to Ada Palmer, "indicate a tenacious, if spotty knowledge of the poet and some knowledge of [his] poem"), no manuscripts of ''De rerum natura'' currently survive from this span of time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Palmer|Palmer (2014)]], p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, all the remaining Lucertian manuscripts that are currently extant date from or after the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith&amp;Rouse|Smith (1992) [1924]]], p. lvi.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because ''De rerum natura'' was rediscovered in January 1417 by [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini|Poggio Bracciolini]], who probably found the poem in the Benedictine library at [[Fulda]]. The manuscript that Poggio discovered did not survive, but a copy (the "Codex Laurentianus 35.30") of it by Poggio's friend, [[Niccolò de' Niccoli]], did, and today it is kept at the [[Laurentian Library]] in Florence.&lt;ref name=TNY /&gt;

[[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] made a copy early in his life. [[Molière]] produced a verse translation which does not survive; [[John Evelyn]] translated the first book.&lt;ref name=TNY /&gt;

The Italian scholar Guido Billanovich demonstrated that Lucretius's poem was well known in its entirety by [[Lovato Lovati]] (1241–1309) and some other Paduan pre-humanists during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="edu.lascuola.it" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bil1958|Billanovich (1958)]].&lt;/ref&gt; This proves that the work was known in select circles long before the official rediscovery by Poggio.  It has been suggested that [[Dante]] (1265–1321) might have read Lucretius's poem, as a few verses of his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' exhibit a great affinity with ''De rerum natura'', but there is no conclusive evidence that Dante ever read Lucretius.&lt;ref name="edu.lascuola.it"&gt;{{cite web|author=Piazzi, Francesco|year=2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010172026/http://www.edu.lascuola.it/edizioni-digitali/Cappelli/HortusApertus/vol_1/Lucrezio/26_LAFORTUNA.pdf|archivedate=October 10, 2015|publisher=Editrice La Scuola |title=Hortus Apertus {{en dash}} La fortuna {{en dash}} Dante e Lucrezio | url=http://www.edu.lascuola.it/edizioni-digitali/Cappelli/HortusApertus/vol_1/Lucrezio/26_LAFORTUNA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first printed edition of ''De rerum natura'' was produced in [[Brescia]], [[Lombardy]], in 1473. Other printed editions followed soon after. Additionally, although only published in 1996, [[Lucy Hutchinson|Lucy Hutchinson's]] translation of ''De rerum natura'' was in all likelihood the first in English and was most likely completed some time in the late 1640s or 1650s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goldberg|Goldberg (2006)]], p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Classical antiquity===

{{multiple image| total_width = 400|image1=Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|alt1=Bust of Cicero|image2=Publius_Vergilius_Maro1.jpg|alt2=Presumed marble bust of Virgil|footer=Many scholars believe that Lucretius and his poem were referenced or alluded to by [[Cicero]] (''left'') and [[Virgil]] (''right'').}}

The earliest recorded critique of Lucretius's work is in a letter written by the Roman statesman [[Cicero]] to his brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus]], in which the former claims that Lucretius's poetry is "full of inspired brilliance, but also of great artistry" (''Lucreti poemata, ut scribis, ita sunt, multis luminibus ingeni, multae tamen artis'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lucretius-Lee|Lucretius &amp; Lee (1893)]], p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Epistulae ad Quintum Fratrem]]'' 2.10.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also believed that the Roman poet [[Virgil]] referenced Lucretius and his work in the second book of his ''[[Georgics]]'' when he wrote: "Happy is he who has discovered the causes of things and has cast beneath his feet all fears, unavoidable fate, and the din of the devouring Underworld" (''felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas''/''atque metus omnis et inexorabile fatum''/''subiecit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis avari'').&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''[[Georgics]]'' 2.490-492.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith&amp;Rouse|Smith (1992) [1924]]], p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Sedley of the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "With these admiring words, Virgil neatly encapsulates four dominant themes of the poem{{em dash}}universal causal explanation, leading to elimination of the threats the world seems to pose, a vindication of free will, and disproof of the soul's survival after death."&lt;ref name=lucretius_stanford/&gt;

Lucretius was almost certainly read by the imperial poet [[Marcus Manilius]] (fl. 1st century AD), whose didactic poem ''[[Astronomica (Manilius)|Astronomica]]'' (written c. AD 10{{en dash}}20), alludes to ''De rerum natura'' in a number of places.&lt;ref name=volk192&gt;[[#Volk|Volk (2009)]], p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Manilius's poem, espouses a [[Stoicism|Stoic]], [[Determinism|deterministic]] understanding of the universe,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volk|Volk (2009)]] (2009), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and by its very nature attacks the very philosophical underpinnings of Lucretius's worldview.&lt;ref name=volk192/&gt; This has led scholars like Katharina Volk to argue that "Manilius is a veritable anti-Lucretius".&lt;ref name=volk192/&gt; What is more, Manilius also seems to suggest throughout this poem that his work is superior to that of Lucretius's.&lt;ref name=volk193&gt;[[#Volk|Volk (2009)]], p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; (Coincidentally, ''De rerum natura'' and the ''Astronomica'' were both rediscovered by Poggio Bracciolini in the early 15th century.)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Britannica|"Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini" (2013)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Lucretius's work is discussed by the Augustan poet [[Ovid]], who in his ''Amores'' writes "the verses of the sublime Lucretius will perish only when a day will bring the end of the world" (''Carmina sublimis tunc sunt peritura Lucreti / exitio terras cum dabit una dies''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' 1.15.23{{en dash}}24.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Classical Latin#Authors of the Silver Age|Silver Age]] poet [[Statius]], who in his ''[[Silvae]]'' praises Lucretius as being highly "learned".&lt;ref name=bp50/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''[[Silvae]]'' 2.7.76.&lt;/ref&gt; David Butterfield also writes that "clear echoes and/or responses" to ''De rerum natura'' can be detected in the works of the Roman [[Elegy|elegiac]] poets [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], and [[Tibullus]], as well as the [[lyric poetry|lyric poet]] [[Horace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 47{{en dash}}48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to prose writers, a number either quote from Lucretius's poem or express great admiration for ''De rerum natura'', including: [[Vitruvius]] (in ''De Architectura''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitruvius]], ''De Architectura'' 9.pr.17{{en dash}}18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=butterfield49&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]] (in the ''Historiae Romanae''),&lt;ref name=butterfield49/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]], ''Historiae Romanae'' 2.36.2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quintilian]] (in the ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''),&lt;ref name=bp50&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 50{{en dash}}51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintilian]], ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' 1.4.4; 3.1.4; 10.1.87; 12.11.27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tacitus]] (in the ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''),&lt;ref name=bp50/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]'' 23.1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]] (in ''De eloquentia''),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 52{{en dash}}53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]], ''De eloquentia'' 3.2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornelius Nepos]] (in the ''Life Of Atticus''),&lt;ref name=butterfield49/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornelius Nepos]], ''Vitae'', "Atticus" 12.4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apuleius]] (in ''De Deo Socratis''),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 53{{en dash}}54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Apuleius]], ''De Deo Socratis'' 1.7; 10.7.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] (in the ''Fabulae'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 57, 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Pliny the Elder]] lists Lucretius (presumably referring to his ''De rerum natura'') as a source at the beginning of his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'', and [[Seneca the Younger]] quoted six passages from ''De rerum natura'' across several of his works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], pp. 49{{en dash}}50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late antiquity and the Middle Ages===

{{multiple image| total_width = 500|image1=Lactantius.jpg|alt1=A fresco of Lactantius|image2=Isidor von Sevilla.jpeg|alt2=A painting of Isidore sitting consulting a book|footer=Lucretius was quoted by several early Christian writers, including [[Lactantius]] (''left'') and [[Isidore of Seville]] (''right'').}}

Because Lucretius was critical of religion and the claim of an immortal soul, his poem was disparaged by most early [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref name="Butterfield 2013 p. 56"&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Early Christian]] [[apologetics|apologist]] Lactantius, in particular, heavily cites and critiques Lucretius in his ''[[The Divine Institutes]]'' and its ''Epitome'', as well as his ''De ira Dei''.&lt;ref name="Butterfield 2013 p. 56"/&gt; While he argued that Lucretius's criticism of Roman religion were "sound attacks on paganism and superstition", Lactantius claimed that they were futile against the "True Faith" of Christianity.&lt;ref name=palmer125/&gt; Lactantius also disparages the science of ''De rerum natura'' (as well as of Epicureanism in general), calls Lucretius "the most worthless of the poets" (''poeta inanissimus''), notes that he is unable to read more than a few lines of ''De rerum natura'' without laughing, and sarcastically asks, "Who would think that [Lucretius] had a brain when he said these things?"&lt;ref name=palmer125&gt;[[#Palmer|Palmer (2014)]], p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lactantius's time, Lucretius was almost exclusively referenced or alluded to in a negative manner by the [[Church Fathers]]. The one major exception to this was [[Isidore of Seville]], who at the start of the 7th century produced a work on astronomy and natural history dedicated to the Visigothic king [[Sisebut]] that was entitled ''De natura rerum''. In both this work, and as well as his more well-known ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (c. AD 600{{en dash}}625), Isidore liberally quotes from Lucretius a total of twelve times, drawing verses from all of Lucretius's books except his third.&lt;ref name=dronke&gt;[[#Dronke|Dronke (1984)]], p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butterfield|Butterfield (2013)]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; (Of note, about a century later, the British historian and Doctor of the Church [[Bede]] produced a work also called ''De natura rerum'', partly based on Isidore's work but apparently ignorant of Lucretius's poem.)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kendall|Kendall &amp; Wallis (2010)]], p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance to the present===

[[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] owned a Latin edition published in Paris, in 1563, by [[Denis Lambin]] which he heavily annotated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titi Lucretii Cari ''De rerum natura'' Libri Sex (Montaigne.1.4.4)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-MONTAIGNE-00001-00004-00004/1|publisher=[[Cambridge University]]|via=[[Cambridge Digital Library|The Cambridge Digital Library]]|accessdate=July 9, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829134742/http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-MONTAIGNE-00001-00004-00004/1|archivedate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' contain almost a hundred quotes from ''De rerum natura''.&lt;ref name=TNY /&gt; Additionally, in his [[Essays (Montaigne)|essay]] "Of Books", he lists Lucretius along with Virgil, [[Horace]], and [[Catullus]] as his four top poets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]], ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'', "Of Books".&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable figures who owned copies include [[Ben Jonson]] whose copy is held at the [[Houghton Library]], Harvard; and [[Thomas Jefferson]], who owned at least five Latin editions and English, Italian and French translations.&lt;ref name=TNY /&gt;

Lucretius has also had a marked influence upon modern philosophy, as perhaps the most complete expositor of Epicurean thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gillespie|Gillespie &amp; MacKenzie (2007)]], p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; His influence is especially notable in the work of the [[Spanish-American]] philosopher [[George Santayana]], who praised Lucretius{{em dash}}along with [[Dante]] and [[Goethe]]{{em dash}}in his book ''Three Philosophical Poets''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Santayana|Santayana (1922) [1910]]], pp. 19–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the historian and literary scholar [[Stephen Greenblatt]] wrote a [[popular history]] book about the poem, entitled ''[[The Swerve: How the World Became Modern]]''. In the work, Greenblatt argues that Poggio Bracciolini's discovery of ''De rerum natura'' reintroduced important ideas that sparked the [[Modernity|modern age]].&lt;ref name=TS&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/jan-june12/swerve_05-25.html |title='The Swerve': When an Ancient Text Reaches Out and Touches Us |archivedate=May 26, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526065810/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/jan-june12/swerve_05-25.html |date=May 25, 2012 |publisher=[[PBS]]|author=Brown, Jeffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AUTTCT&gt;[[#Garner|Garner (2011)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Br&gt;[[#Owchar|Owchar (2011)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The book was well-received, and later earned the 2012 [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] and the 2011 [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]].&lt;ref name=T2PPWGN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2012-General-Nonfiction |title=The 2012 Pulitzer Prize Winners: General Nonfiction |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509024435/http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2012-General-Nonfiction|archivedate=May 9, 2012 |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2011_nf_greenblatt.html |title=2011 National Book Award Winner, Nonfiction |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505020231/http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2011_nf_greenblatt.html|archivedate=May 5, 2012 |publisher=[[National Book Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Decoding Reality: The Universe as Quantum Information''''' is a popular [[science book]] by [[Vlatko Vedral]] published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2010. Vedral examines [[information theory]] and proposes [[information]] as the most fundamental building block of reality. He argues what a useful framework this is for viewing all natural and [[physical phenomena]]. In building out this framework the books touches upon the origin of information, the idea of [[entropy]], the roots of this thinking in [[thermodynamics]], the replication of DNA, development of [[social networks]], [[quantum]] behaviour at the micro and macro level, and the very role of [[indeterminism]] in the universe. The book finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The ideas address concepts related to the nature of [[particles]], time, [[determinism]], and of reality itself.

==Contents==

==="Creation Ex Nihilo: Something from Nothing"===
Vedral believes in the principle that information is physical. ''[[Creation ex nihilo]]'' comes from [[Catholic]] dogma, the idea being that God created the universe out of nothing. Vedral says that invoking a supernatural being as an explanation for creation does not explain reality because the supernatural being would have to come into existence itself too somehow presumably from nothing (or else from an infinite regression of supernatural beings), thus of course the reality can come from nothing without a supernatural being. [[Occam's razor]] principle favours the simplest explanation. Vedral believes information is the fundamental building block of reality as it occurs at the macro level (economics, human behaviour etc.) as well as the subatomic level. Vedral argues that information is the only candidate for such a building block that can explain its own existence as information generates additional information that needs to be compressed thus generating more information. 'Annihilation of everything' is a more fitting term than ''creation ex nihilo'' Vedral states, as compression of possibilities is the process of how new information is created.

==="Information for all Seasons"===
Vedral uses an [[Italo Calvino]] philosophical story about a [[tarot]]-like card game as the kernel for his metaphor of conscious life arriving ''[[in medias res]]'' to a pre-existing contextual reality. In this game the individual observers/players (Vedral suggests: quantum physics, thermodynamics, biology, sociology, economics, philosophy) lay down cards with ambiguous meanings as an attempt to communicate messages to deduce meaning out of the other players' interactions. The results (information) of previous rounds establish contextual rules for observers/players in subsequent rounds. The point of this game is not established until the last card has been played as later cards can change the meaning of previous events, as in the case of the quantum explanation for the [[photoelectric effect]] instantly disproving [[classical physics]]. Vedral points out that in our reality there is no last card.

==="Back to Basics: Bits and Pieces"===
[[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] or information content measured as the surprise value of a particular event, is essentially inversely proportional to the logarithm of the event's probability, i = log(1/p). [[Claude Shannon]]'s information theory arose from research at [[Bell labs]], building upon [[George Boole|George Boole's]] digital logic. As information theory predicts common and easily predicted words tend to become shorter for optimal communication channel efficiency while less common words tend to be longer for redundancy and [[error correction]]. Vedral compares the process of life to [[John von Neumann]]'s self replicating [[automata]]. These are enduring information carriers that will survive wear and tear of the individual by producing copies that can in turn go on to produce more copies.

==="Digital Romance: Life is a Four-Letter Word"===
Genetic code as an efficient digital information store, containing built in [[codon]] redundancy for error correction in transcription.

==="Murphy’s Law: I Knew this Would Happen to Me"===
Examines the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second law]] of thermodynamics and the process of information increasing entropy. [[Maxwell's Demon]] was thought to be a way around this inevitability, however such a demon would run out of information storage space and have to delete unwanted data thus having to do work to do so, increasing entropy.

==="Place Your Bets: In It to Win It"===
[[Blackjack]] as controlled risk taking using Shannon's information theory probability formulas. Casino as a ′cool′ financial entropy source and the gambler as a ′hot′ financial source, once again the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second law]] of thermodynamics means the flow is almost always from hot to cold in the long run. For managed risk spread bets widely and in high risk high reward investments (assuming a known probability), this is the Log optimal portfolio approach.

==="Social Informatics: Get Connected or Die Tryin’"===
[[Six degrees of separation]] means well connected people tend to be more successful as their social networks expose them to more chances to make choices they want. [[Thomas Schelling|Schelling]] precommitment as strategy in social and self-control, for example burning your bridges by buying gym membership to help motivated self win over lazy self. [[Mutual information]] resulting in [[phase transitions]] in social and political demography as well as physical systems, like water freezing into ice at a particular critical temperature or magnetic fields spontaneously aligning in certain atoms when cooling from a molten state.

==="Quantum Schmuntum: Lights, Camera, Action!"===
Vedral examines the basis of [[quantum information]], the [[qubit]], and examines [[one-time pad]] quantum cryptography as the most secure form of [[encryption]] because of its uncomputability. [[Quantum entanglement]] demonstrates the importance of mutual information in defining outcomes in a reality.

==="Surfing the Waves: Hyper-Fast Computers"===
[[Quantum computers]] offer a search advantage over classical computers by searching many database elements at once as a result of quantum [[Quantum superposition|superpositions]]. A sufficiently advanced quantum computer would break current encryption methods by factorizing large numbers several orders of magnitude faster than any existing classical computer. Any computable problem may be expressed as a general quantum search algorithm although classical computers may have an advantage over quantum search when using more efficient tailored classical [[algorithms]]. The issue with quantum computers is that a measurement must be made to determine if the problem is solved which collapses the superposition. Vedral points out that unintentional interaction with the environment can be mitigated with redundancy, and this would be necessary if we were to scale up current quantum computers to achieve greater utility, i.e. to utilize 10 qubits have a 100 atom quantum system so that if one atom decoheres a consensus will still be held by the other 9 for the state of the same qubit.

==="Children of the Aimless Chance: Randomness versus Determinism"===
[[Randomness]] is key to generating new sources of surprise in a reality. Compression of these new sources to discard unimportant information is the [[deterministic]] element and organising principle.

==="Sand Reckoning: Whose Information is It, Anyway?"===
The information content of the universe as measured in [[bit]]s or [[qubits]]. Vedral uses the initial effort of [[Archimedes]] of Syracuse in calculating the [[The Sand Reckoner|amount of sand]] that could theoretically fit inside the universe and compares it to a modern-day attempt to calculate the bit content of the universe. Vedral however sees this content as ultimately limitless as possibly maximum entropy is never reached as compression of complexity is an open ended process and random events will continue to occur. As Vedral sees information as the ultimate building block of physical reality, he speculates that information originating at any scale can force outcomes in all other scales to abide where mutual information is shared. For example, a human performed macro-level scientific test in search of a behaviour in a quantum particle could set parameters for that type of particle in the future when subjected to a similar test.

==="Destruction ab Toto: Nothing from Something"===
The information basis for ''creation ex nihilo''. According to [[John von Neumann]], starting trivially from an [[empty set]] of numbers an [[Infinity|infinite]] sequence of numbers can [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] their way out. An empty set creates the number 1 by observing an empty set within itself which is enough of a basis for distinguishability. It creates the number 2 by observing an empty set within the second empty set and the number 1, and so on. Vedral sees this not as creation but as [[data compression]], as every event of a reality breaks the [[symmetry]] of the pre-existing formlessness. Science is the process of describing a large amount of observed phenomena in a compressed programmatic way to predict future outcomes, and in this process of data compression science creates new information by eliminating all contrary possibilities to explain those phenomena.

==Synopsis==
The book explains the world as being made up of information. The Universe and its workings are the ebb and flow of information. We are all transient patterns of information, passing on the recipe for our basic forms to future generations using a four-letter [[Digital data|digital]] code called [[DNA]]. In this engaging and mind-stretching account, Vlatko Vedral considers some of the deepest questions about the Universe and considers the implications of interpreting it in terms of information. He explains the nature of information, the idea of entropy, and the roots of this thinking in [[thermodynamics]]. He describes the bizarre effects of quantum behaviour - effects such as '[[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]]', which [[Einstein]] called 'spooky action at a distance' and explores cutting edge work on the harnessing quantum effects in hyperfast [[quantum computers]], and how recent evidence suggests that the weirdness of the quantum world, once thought limited to the tiniest scales, may reach into the macro world. Vedral finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The answers he considers are exhilarating, drawing upon the work of distinguished physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] and his concept of “[[it from bit]]”. The ideas challenge our concept of the nature of particles, of time, of determinism, and of reality itself.

The scientific, educational, and charitable mission of Dryad is to promote the availability of data underlying findings in the scientific literature for research and educational reuse.

The vision of Dryad is a scholarly communication system in which learned societies, publishers, institutions of research and education, funding bodies and other stakeholders collaboratively sustain and promote the preservation and reuse of data underlying the scholarly literature.

Dryad aims to allow researchers to validate published findings, explore new analysis methodologies, re-purpose data for research questions unanticipated by the original authors, and perform synthetic studies such as formal meta-analyses.  For many publications, existing data repositories do not capture the whole data package. As a result, many important datasets are not being preserved and are no longer available, or usable, at the time that they are sought by later investigators.&lt;ref&gt;Vision, T.J. (2010) Open Data and the Social Contract of Scientific Publishing. BioScience 60(5):330-330. {{doi|10.1525/bio.2010.60.5.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dryad serves as a repository for tables, spreadsheets, flat files, and all other kinds of published data for which specialized repositories do not already exist.  Optimally, authors submit data to Dryad in conjunction with article publication, so that links to the data can be included in the published article.  All data files in Dryad are associated with a published article, and are made available for reuse under the terms of a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons Zero]] waiver.

Dryad is also a non-profit membership organization registered in the US, providing a forum for all stakeholders to set priorities for the repository, participate in planning, and share knowledge and coordinate action around data policies.

Dryad is listed in the [[Registry of Research Data Repositories]] re3data.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dryad Entry in re3data.org|url=http://service.re3data.org/repository/r3d100000044|website=www.re3data.org|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dryad enables authors, journals, societies and publishers to facilitate data archiving at the time of publication, when the data are readily available.  Data in Dryad receives a permanent, unique [[Digital object identifier]] (DOI), which can be included in the published article so that readers are able to access the data.   Authors can archive data in Dryad and be assured of its preservation, while satisfying journals' and research funding agencies' mandates to disseminate their research outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Data Archiving. Michael C. Whitlock, Mark A. McPeek, Mark D. Rausher, Loren Rieseberg and Allen J. Moore, The American Naturalist, Vol. 175, No. 2 (February 2010), pp. 145-146 {{doi|10.1086/650340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors submit data to Dryad either when the associated article is under review or has been accepted for publication.  The choice depends on whether the journal includes data within the scope of peer reviewer.  Authors may also submit data after an article has been published.

Data submission is facilitated by journals sending notices of new manuscripts to Dryad.  This saves authors from having to re-enter the bibliographic details when they upload their data files.

Dryad curators review submitted data files and perform quality control on metadata descriptions before inclusion of new content in the repository. Dryad’s metadata approach emphasizes simplicity and interoperability, supported by a [[Dublin Core]] metadata [[application profile]]. The [http://cci.drexel.edu/mrc/ Metadata Research Center] now at the [http://cci.drexel.edu College of Computing and Informatics, Drexel University], serves as Dryad’s central curation hub, with curation activity also taking place via the non-profit in North Carolina. &lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, J., White, H., C, Carrier, C. and Scherle, R. (2009). A Metadata Best Practice for a Scientific Data Repository. Journal of Library Metadata, 9:3, 194—212. {{doi|10.1080/19386380903405090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dryad coordinates data submission to specialized repositories where in order to (a) lower user burden by streamlining the submission workflow and (b) allow Dryad and specialized repositories to exchange identifiers and other metadata in order to enable cross-referencing of the different data products associated with a given publication.  The first two handshaking partners are TreeBASE and [[GenBank]], which Dryad's partner journals have previously identified as required points of deposition for phylogenetic tree data and DNA sequences, respectively.

==Governance, history and funding==

Dryad is governed by a twelve-member [[Board of Directors]], elected by its Members. Members may be independent journals, societies, publishers, research and educational institutions, libraries, funders, or other organizations that support Dryad's mission. The organization coordinates data sharing policies and promotes the long-term sustainability of the repository.

Dryad began charging submission fees in September 2013.  Dryad is a nonprofit organization that provides long-term access to its contents at no cost to researchers, educators or students, irrespective of nationality or institutional affiliation. Dryad is able to provide free access to data due to financial support from members and data submitters. Dryad’s submission fees are designed to sustain its core functions by recovering the basic costs of curating and preserving data.

Dryad emerged from a [[National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent)]] workshop entitled "Digital data preservation, sharing, and discovery: Challenges for Small Science Communities in the Digital Era" in May 2007.  Initial funding for Dryad was provided by the [[National Science Foundation]] to the [[National Evolutionary Synthesis Center]] and other partners in the US.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708122322/http://datadryad.org/dryaduk DryadUK] was a [[Jisc]]-funded project run from the [[British Library]] and the [[University of Oxford]], in partnership with NESCent, the [[Digital Curation Centre]], and Charles Beagrie Ltd.  The project led to a UK mirror of the Dryad repository based at the British Library.  The project also improved the tools available for the publication and citation of data, expanded the disciplinary range of participating journals, and further developed the business framework for an international organization dedicated to long-term data preservation.

Dryad is a member of the Data Observation Network for Earth ([[DataONE]]).

==Software==
Dryad is built upon the open source [[DSpace]] repository software, developed by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Many customizations have been integrated into the main DSpace codebase; customizations specific to Dryad are maintained in the open source Dryad code repository.

'''Dunstan Baby Language''' is a theory about infantile vocal reflexes as signals, in humans.   The theory is that across cultures and linguistic groups there are five sounds, each with a meaning, that are used by [[infants]] before the [[language acquisition]] period. The hypothesis was developed by Australian former [[mezzo-soprano]], Priscilla Dunstan, and has been featured on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPXsoZ_F0SA Dunstan on The Oprah Winfrey Show]&lt;/ref&gt; Dunstan's theory has not been scientifically validated.

==Dunstan's theory==
Between 0–3 months, infants make what Dunstan calls ''sound reflexes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dunstanbaby.co.uk/cms/index.php?page=us-faqs Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dunstan, we all have reflexes, like sneezes, hiccups, and burps, that all have a recognizable pattern when sound is added to the reflex. There are other reflexes that all babies experience, and when sound is added to these, a distinct, preemptive "cry" will occur before the infant breaks into what Dunstan calls the hysterical [[cry]]. Dunstan states that these preemptive cries can indicate what the infant requires (e.g., ''food'', ''comfort'', ''sleep'', etc.), and they escalate to the hysterical cry if they are not answered. As the infant matures past 3 months in [[Communication|vocalization]], the sound reflexes become replaced with more elaborate [[babbling]].

===Words (sound reflexes)===
According to Dunstan, the five universal words (or ''sound reflexes'') used by infants are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/tows/slide/200611/20061113/slide_20061113_350_102.jhtml Five Universal Words of Dunstan Baby Language as Posted on Oprah.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Neh (I'm hungry)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Neh''" to communicate its hunger. The sound is produced when the sucking reflex is triggered, and the tongue is pushed up on the roof of the mouth.
* '''Owh (I'm sleepy)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Owh''" to communicate that they are tired.  The sound is produced much like an audible [[yawn]].
* '''Heh (I'm experiencing discomfort)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Heh''" to communicate [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], discomfort, or perhaps that it needs a fresh diaper. The sound is produced by a response to a skin reflex, such as feeling sweat or itchiness in the bum.
* '''Eairh (I have lower gas)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Eairh''" to communicate they have [[flatulence]] or an upset stomach. The sound is produced when trapped air from a belch is unable to release and travels to the stomach where the muscles of the intestines tighten to force the air bubble out.  Often, this sound will indicate that a bowel movement is in progress, and the infant will bend its knees, bringing the legs toward the torso. This leg movement assists in the ongoing process.
* '''Eh (I need to be burped)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Eh''" to communicate that it needs to be burped. The sound is produced when a large bubble of trapped air is caught in the chest, and the reflex is trying to release this out of the mouth.

Dunstan states that she has a [[photographic memory]] for sounds and that this, combined with her years in the [[opera]] and her experience as a mother, allowed her to recognize certain sounds in the human voice. A [[DVD]] set called ''The Dunstan Baby Language'' was released by Dunstan in November 2006. The two-disc set covered the five universal words of the language, methods of learning how to recognize the vocalizations and sounds, numerous examples of baby cries from around the world to "tune your ear," and live demonstrations of newborn mother groups experimenting with the language.

==Criticism==
Linguistics experts point out that Dunstan's hypothesis has not been subjected to rigorous testing or academic scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/01162007/entertainment/health/hey_baby__look_whos_talking_health_skip_card.htm Hey Baby, Look Who's Talking]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dunstan company had, at one time, developed a [[clinical trial]] plan with [[Brown University]] researchers to test its claims, but abandoned it for [[Opinion poll|consumer surveys]] and small-group observations in order "to hasten the development of a system that could be used by parents," skipping rigorous testing to go straight to market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/182567 "Dare I Trust My Intuition?"], Mary Carmichael, ''[[Newsweek]]'', 31 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iben Browning''' (January 9, 1918 &amp;ndash; July 18, 1991) was an American business consultant, author, and "self-proclaimed [[climatologist]]."&lt;ref name="Farley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farley|first1=John E.|title=Earthquake Fears, Predictions, and Preparations in Mid-America|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 2}} He is most notable for having made various failed predictions of [[disaster]]s involving [[climate]], [[volcano]]es, [[earthquake]]s, and government collapse.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;{{rp|p. 11}}

==Life and career==
Browning was born in [[Edna, Texas]], grew up in [[Jackson County, Texas]], and graduated from [[Southwest Texas State Teachers College]] in 1937, majoring in both math and physics.  During World War II, he served in the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]].  Subsequently, he earned an M.A. at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1947, and then his doctorate (Ph.D.) the following year at the same school.  His doctorate was in zoology, with minors in genetics and bacteriology.

Browning worked in various scientific fields, including artificial intelligence and bio-engineering, and eventually became interested in long-term weather forecasting and climate changes.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He believed that climate fluctuations are caused by changes in the amount of particulate matter in the atmosphere mostly from volcanic activity.  He believed that volcanic activity can be triggered by land tidal forces caused by the Moon, Earth's elliptical orbit of the Sun, and the alignment of these three bodies.  His climate predictions assumed that the dust thrown into the atmosphere by those eruptions reflects sunlight, which results in climatic cooling.  Browning believed that climatic changes, especially cooling, are associated with increased troubles in human society, including famine, revolutions, and war.&lt;ref&gt;Winkless, Nels III and Browning, Iben. ''Climate and the Affairs of Men'', Fraser Publishing, 1975.  {{ISBN|0061295507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After founding ''The Browning Newsletter'' in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;[https://browningclimate.com/about/ https://browningclimate.com/about/]&lt;/ref&gt; Browning described his climatic theories and findings in ''Climate and the Affairs of Men'' (1975), which he co-authored with Nels Winkless III. At that time, he believed that Earth had been through a long warm period and was moving into a dangerous cooling phase.  He also declared that he had not detected any effect of human activity on the climate.

Browning received notoriety for his erroneous [[earthquake prediction#Browning|prediction]] that a major [[earthquake]] would occur on the [[New Madrid Fault]] around December 2 and 3, 1990. This prediction had no scientific legitimacy,&lt;ref name="Farley"/&gt;{{rp|p. 3}} and was largely ignored by credentialed seismologists, who thought it would give the prediction undeserved attention if they had debunked it in public.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;{{rp|p. 21}} In spite of this it was widely reported in the national media, which promoted fear, anxiety, and hysteria&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;{{rp|p. 3}} among residents of the Mississippi Valley. No earthquake occurred in that area on those dates. A study done by the USGS to understand the causes of the earthquake scare described Browning's methodology as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{citation

}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Browning wrote four books, held 90 patents, and served as a [[climatologist]] and business consultant to [[Paine Webber]] in various scientific and engineering fields.  He was married to the former Florence Pinto and had one daughter, Evelyn Browning-Garriss.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.desmogblog.com/evelyn-browning-garriss https://www.desmogblog.com/evelyn-browning-garriss]&lt;/ref&gt; who succeeded him as editor of 'The Browning Newsletter'.  He lived his later years in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] and died at his home there on July 18, 1991 from a heart attack at the age of 73.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DA1F38F933A15754C0A967958260 obituary], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 20, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Death Index&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. World War II Army Enlistment Records&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Science''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''scientia'', meaning "knowledge") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [[knowledge]] in the form of testable [[Explanation|explanations]] and [[predictions]] about the universe.

[[Modern science]] is typically divided into three major [[Branches of science|branches]] that consist of the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] (e.g. [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]]), which study [[nature]] in the broadest sense; the [[social sciences]] (e.g. [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]]) which study people and societies; and the [[formal sciences]] (e.g. [[mathematics]], [[Formal logic|logic]], [[theoretical computer science]]), which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement, however, on the formal sciences being a science as they do not rely on [[empirical evidence]]. Disciplines that use science, such as engineering and medicine, are described as [[applied sciences]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3410">'''Informal mathematics''', also called '''naïve mathematics''', has historically been the predominant form of [[mathematics]] at most times and in most cultures, and is the subject of modern [[ethnomathematics|ethno-cultural studies of mathematics]]. The philosopher [[Imre Lakatos]] in his ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]'' aimed to sharpen the formulation of informal mathematics, by reconstructing its role in nineteenth century mathematical debates and concept formation, opposing the predominant assumptions of [[mathematical formalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos, ''Proofs and Refutations'' (1976), especially the Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informality may not discern between statements given by ''[[inductive reasoning]]'' (as in [[approximation]]s which are deemed "correct" merely because they are useful), and statements derived by ''[[deductive reasoning]]''.

==Terminology==

''Informal mathematics'' means any informal mathematical practices, as used in everyday life, or by aboriginal or ancient peoples, without historical or geographical limitation. Modern mathematics, exceptionally from that point of view, emphasizes formal and strict [[mathematical proof|proofs]] of all statements from given [[axiom]]s. This can usefully be called therefore ''formal mathematics''. Informal practices are usually understood intuitively and justified with examples—there are no axioms. This is of direct interest in [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]]: it casts light on the perceptions and agreements of other cultures.  It is also of interest in [[developmental psychology]] as it reflects a naïve understanding of the relationships between numbers and things. Another term used for informal mathematics is '''folk mathematics''', which is ambiguous; the [[mathematical folklore]] article is dedicated to the usage of that term among professional mathematicians.

The field of [[naïve physics]] is concerned with similar understandings of physics. People use mathematics and physics in everyday life, without really understanding (or caring) how mathematical and physical ideas were historically derived and justified.

==History==
There has long been a standard account of the development of [[geometry]] in [[ancient Egypt]], followed by [[Greek mathematics]] and the emergence of deductive logic. The modern sense of the term ''mathematics'', as meaning only those systems justified with reference to axioms, is however an [[anachronism]] if read back into history. Several ancient societies built impressive mathematical systems and carried out complex calculations based on proofless [[heuristic]]s and practical approaches. Mathematical facts were accepted on a [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] basis. [[Empirical method]]s, as in science, provided the justification for a given technique. Commerce, [[engineering]], [[calendar]] creation and the prediction of [[eclipse]]s and [[stellar progression]] were practiced by ancient cultures on at least three continents. N.C. Ghosh included Informal Mathematics in the list of Folk Mathematics.

==History==

The Information Technology Park was completed in April 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cankavre.org.np/aboutus.php|publisher=CANKavre.org.np|title=CAN Kavre, Nepal|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a total investment of [[Nepalese Rupees|NRs]]. 270 million (~ {{To USD|270|Nepal|round=yes}} million USD). The initiation of the Park was formally done by an American company IBM but it left after nine months.&lt;ref name="nepalnews" /&gt; Javra Software Company from the [[Netherlands]] had also started work but it too left, stating technical reasons and shifted to [[Kathmandu]]. By July 2014, it has not come into operation, as a result of which the [[Government of Nepal]] is missing millions of rupees in [[revenue]]. The government has formed a department named the Department of Information Technology for the socio-economic transformation to form a developed country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infodev.com.np/doit/index.php/frontend/detail/1|title=Department of Information Technology (सुचना प्रविधि बिभाग)|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doit.gov.np/newsite/index.php/frontend/detail/2|title=Department of Information Technology|publisher=Doit.gov.np|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and objectives==

The IT Park was established under the [[Ministry of Industry (Nepal)|Ministry of Industry]], for the development and promotion of information technology and services in the country. It has been said to be providing employment opportunities to about 15,000 technicians after the full range of operations of the IT Park.&lt;ref name="myrepublica" /&gt; It has aimed to provide government services&lt;ref name="doit" /&gt; by maximizing the use of information and technology.

==Land and distribution==

The Park has been distributed within the area of 235 Ropanis ({{convert|12|hectare|m2}}) consisting of a commercial building, an administrative building, four residential buildings and a security building built by investing [[Nepalese Rupees|NRs]]. 500 million (~ {{To USD|500|Nepal|round=yes}} million USD).&lt;ref name="nepalnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepalnews.com/archive/2013/feb/feb07/news07.php|title=Kavre's IT park fails to come into operation even after 17 yrs|date=7 February 2013|publisher=Nepalnews.com|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3687">'''Insulin potentiation therapy (IPT)''' is an unproven [[alternative cancer treatment]] using [[insulin]] as an [[Adjunctive therapy|adjunct]] to [[low-dose chemotherapy]].&lt;ref name="pmid35260992"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Ayre SG, Perez Garcia y Bellon D, Perez Garcia D|title = Insulin potentiation therapy: a new concept in the management of chronic degenerative disease|journal = Med. Hypotheses|volume = 20|issue = 2|pages = 199–210|year = 1986|pmid = 3526099|doi = 10.1016/0306-9877(86)90126-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Quackwatch]], "Insulin Potentiation Therapy (IPT) is one of several unproven, dangerous treatments that is promoted by a small group of practitioners without trustworthy evidence that it works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/ipt.html |title = Why You Should Stay Away from Insulin Potentiation |last1=Baratz |first1=Robert |date=10 March 2007 |publisher=Quackwatch |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was developed by Donato Perez Garcia, MD in 1930.  Originally, Garcia targeted [[syphilis]], and later tried the treatment for chronic degenerative diseases and some types of cancer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Insulin potentiation therapy|url = http://www.cam-cancer.org/CAM-Summaries/Dietary-approaches/Insulin-potentiation-therapy/%28merge%29|website = CAM-Cancer|accessdate = 2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
Generally, a dose of insulin is injected into a vein, followed by a low dose of chemotherapy drugs when the insulin has been absorbed.  The chemotherapy dose is usually 10% to 25% of the proven dose.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Then sugar water is injected to stop the [[hypoglycemia]] (low blood sugar) caused by the insulin injection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Efficacy ==
IPT has not been proven to work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What cancer care providers need to know about CAM: the CAM-Cancer project|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/fct.12017|journal = Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies|access-date = 2015-04-29|last = Wider|first = Barbara|date = 17 May 2013|publisher = Wiley|pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Long-term outcomes, such as survival, have never been published.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Four individual [[case studies]], one small, uncontrolled clinical trial and one small prospective, [[randomized controlled trial]] have shown temporary reductions in the size of tumors for some patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Adverse effects ==
The immediate risk is [[hypoglycemia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of lower than normal doses of chemotherapy can cause [[drug resistance]], which could make future treatment at standard, proven doses ineffective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For some cancers, especially breast and colon cancers, insulin may promote tumor growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
Two main ideas about how it might work have been proposed.  The first idea is that insulin makes cells more permeable, so that the chemotherapy drugs are absorbed faster into cells.  The other idea is that insulin might cause the cells to start dividing, which makes them more susceptible to destruction of many [[Cytotoxic drug|cytotoxic]] chemotherapy drugs.

==Cost==
Costs run up to US $2,000 per treatment session.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Multiple sessions are normal.  Patients often pay the full cost out of pocket, because it is an unproven therapy that is not covered by health insurance.

'''''Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts''''' is a 1979 book by [[Sociology of science|sociologists of science]] [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Steve Woolgar]].

This influential book in the field of [[science studies]] presents an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] study of [[Roger Guillemin]]'s scientific laboratory at the [[Salk Institute]]. It advances a number of observations regarding how scientific work is conducted, including descriptions of the complex relationship between the routine lab practices performed by scientists, the publication of papers, scientific prestige, research finances and other elements of laboratory life.

The book is considered to be one of the most influential works in the laboratory studies tradition within [[Science and Technology Studies]]. It is inspired but not entirely dependent on the [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] approach.  In turn, it served as the inspiration for [[Actor-Network Theory]] (or ANT); many of ANT's core concepts (like transcription, inscription, translation, and the deployment of networks) are present in ''Laboratory Life''.

==Introduction and Methodology==
Latour and Woolgar state that their work "concerns the way in which the daily activities of working scientists lead to the construction of scientific facts" (40).  ''Laboratory Life'' therefore stands in opposition to the study of scandalous moments in which the so-called "normal" operation of science was disrupted by external forces.  In contrast, Latour and Woolgar give an account of a how scientific facts are produced in a laboratory ''[[in situ]]'', or as it happens.

==An Anthropologist Visits the Laboratory==
The initial [[methodology]] of ''Laboratory Life'' involves an "[[anthropology|anthropological]] strangeness" (40) in which the laboratory is a [[tribe]] foreign to the researcher.  The study of the lab begins with a semi-fictionalized account of an ignorant observer who knows nothing of laboratories or scientists.  In this account, Latour and Woolgar "bracket" (44) their previous knowledge of scientific practice and [[irony|ironic]]ally ask seemingly-nonsensical questions about observed practices in the laboratory, such as "Are the heated debates in front of the blackboard part of some [[gambling]] contest?"  In the asking and answering of these questions, the observer's understanding of laboratory practices is gradually refined, leading to a strong focus on the significance of paper [[document]]s.

The observer soon recognizes that all the scientists and technicians in the lab [[writing|write]] in some fashion, and that few activities in the lab are not connected to some sort of [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] or [[inscription]]. The foreign observer describes the laboratory as "strange tribe" of "compulsive and [[mania|manic]] writers ... who spend the greatest part of their day coding, marking, altering, correcting, reading, and writing" (48-9).  Large and expensive laboratory equipment (such as [[bioassay]]s or [[mass spectrometer]]s) are interpreted as "inscription device[s]" that have the sole purpose of "transform[ing] a material substance into a figure or [[diagram]]" (51).  In this way, the observer works to organize and systematize the laboratory such that it "began to take on the appearance of a system of literary inscription" (52).

Having concluded that the "production of papers" for publication in a [[scientific journal]] is the primary focus of a laboratory, the observer next aims to "consider papers as objects in much the same way as [[manufactured goods]]" (71).  This involves asking how papers are produced, what their [[constituent element]]s (or [[raw material]]s) are, and why these papers are so important.  First, the authors recognize that in papers, "some statements appeared more [[fact]]-like than others" (76).  From this observation, a five-element [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] of [[facticity]] is constructed, which spans from type 5 statements which are taken for granted to type 1 statements which are unqualified speculations, with various intermediate levels in between.  The conclusion reached is that statements in a laboratory routinely travel up and down this continuum, and the main purpose of a laboratory is to take statements of one level of facticity and transform them to another level.

However, Latour and Woolgar recognize that this semi-fictionalized account of an ignorant observer aiming to systematize the alien laboratory has several problems.  While the observer's rich descriptions of activity in the lab are taken as accurate, the observer has not established that the interpretation of this data in terms of literary inscription is exhaustive or the only way in which laboratory life can be analyzed.  In the authors' words, the observer's account is not "immune from all possibility of future qualification" (88).

==The Construction of a Fact: The Case of TRF(H)==
The next chapter aims at giving a precise account of the way in which this process operates with respect to a single scientific fact: the [[peptide]] [[thyrotropin-releasing factor|TRF]](H).  This historical account, which Latour and Woolgar admit is, like all histories, a "necessarily literary [[fiction]]" (107), has the ostensible purpose of qualifying the initial account given by the observer.  To this end, the chapter focuses on the specific way in which TRF(H) was constructed as a fact, describing how one scientist, Guillemin, "redefine[d] the TRF subspecialty solely in terms of determining the structure of the substance" (119).  As [[molecular sequencing|sequencing]] TRF(H) required far more sophisticated equipment and techniques than merely determining its physiological effects, Guillemin raised the [[cost of entry]] to this field and cut his potential competitors by three-fourths.

The authors next claim that the fact regarding TRF(H)'s structure progressed by decreases in the number of "'logically' possible alternatives" (146).  However, Latour and Woolgar critique the explanation that "[[logic]]" or "[[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]" is a satisfactory and complete explanation for the specific way in which a scientific fact is constructed.  Instead, as their historical account of TRF(H) shows, the "list of possible alternatives by which we can evaluate the logic of a deduction is sociologically (rather than logically) determined" (136).  Specifically, the material, technical, and human resources of a laboratory affected what kinds of challenges and counter-facts could be constructed and formulated, leading Latour and Woolgar to later conclude that "the set of statements considered too costly to modify constitute what is referred to as reality" (243).

In the previous section, Latour and Woolgar used a semi-fictional observer to describe the laboratory as a literary system in which mere statements are turned into facts and vice versa.  The most sound and established facts were those statements which could be divorced from their contingent circumstances.  The authors next aim to interrogate how this process operates on a very small and specific scale by looking at how this process operated with respect to the molecule TRF(H), whose molecular structure went through various stages of facticity both in and out of the laboratory Latour studied.  In this section, Latour and Woolgar aim to "specify the precise time and place in the process of fact construction when a statement became transformed into a fact and hence freed from the circumstances of its production" (105).

Instead of trying to construct a "precise chronology" of what "really happened," in the field, they aim to demonstrate how "a hard fact can be sociologically [[deconstruction|deconstructed]]" (107) by showing how it emerged in what they call a network.  A ''network'' is "a set of positions within which an object such as TRF has meaning" (107), and they recognize that TRF only has meaning within certain networks.  For example, outside of the network of post-1960s endocrinology, TRF is "an unremarkable white powder" (108), which leads to the claim that a "well-established fact loses its meaning when divorced from its context" (110).  Latour and Woolgar stress that "to say that TRF is constructed is not to deny its solidity as a fact.  Rather, it is to emphasize how, where, and why it was created" (127).

==The Microprocessing of Facts==

This chapter turns back from grander historical accounts to the micro details of laboratory life. Through analysis of the conversations and discussions between scientists at the lab, it shows that the grander notion of science as a debate of contrasting ideas influences actual scientists only through social mechanisms. Instead of attempting to do their studies more carefully to be sure they get the right answer, scientists appear to only use as much care as they think will be necessary to defeat the counterarguments of their detractors and get the acclamation they desire for their work.

It also notes that the stories scientists tell about the history of their field often omit social and institutional factors in favor of "moment of discovery" narratives. For example, one scientist tells this story:

:Slovik proposed an assay but his assay did not work everywhere; people could not repeat it; some could, some could not. Then one day Slovik ''got the idea'' that it could be related to the selenium content in the water: they checked to see where the assay worked; and indeed, Slovik's idea was right, it worked wherever the selenium content of water was high. (169)

This story is contrasted with another story based on interviews with the participants: The University of California required that graduate students get credits in a field totally unrelated to their own. Sara, one of Slovik's students, fulfilled this requirement by taking selenium studies, since it had a vague relation to her major. Graduate students had a tradition of informal seminars where they discussed these unrelated classes. At one meeting, Sara presented a paper on the effects of Selenium on cancer and noted that someone on campus proposed that the geographical distribution of selenium content in water might correlate with the geographical distribution of cancer rates. Slovik was at the meeting and thought that this might explain the geographical difference in his assay working. He phoned a colleague to tell him the idea and ask him to test the selenium in the water.

One story says merely that Slovik "got the idea"—the other notes that institutions (the University, grad student meetings) and other people (Sara, the colleague) provided key pieces of the inspiration.

The chapter closes by arguing that scientists do not simply use their inscription devices to discover already-existing entities. Instead, they project new entities out of the analysis of their inscriptions. Statements to the effect that "it's amazing they were able to discover it" only make sense when one ignores the arduous process to construct the discovery out of the inscriptions available. Similarly, justifications that the discovery is valid because it works well outside the laboratory are fallacious. Any claims as to whether a new substance like TRF works are only valid in a laboratory context (or its extension) -- the only way one can know that the substance is actually TRF (and thus that TRF is working) is through laboratory analysis. However, the authors stress that they are not relativists—they simply believe that the social causes of statements should be investigated.

==Cycles of Credit==

Scientists frequently explain their choice of field by referring to curves of interest and development, as in "[[peptide]] chemistry [is] tapering off ... but now ... this is the future, molecular biology, and I knew that this lab would move faster to this new area" (191). Desire for credit appears to only be a secondary phenomenon; instead a kind of "credibility capital" seems to be the driving motive. In a case study, they show one scientist sequentially choosing a school, a field, a professor to study under, a specialty to get expertise in, and a research institution to work at, by maximizing and reinvesting this credibility (i.e. ability to do science), despite not having received much in the way of credit (e.g. awards, recognition).

Four examples: (a) X threatens to fire Ray if his assay fails, (b) a number of scientists flood into a field with theories after a successful experiment then leave when new evidence disproves their theories, (c) Y supports the results of "a big shot in his field" when others question them in order to receive invitations to meetings from the big shot where Y can meet new people, (d) K dismisses some of L's results on the grounds that "good people" won't believe them unless the level of noise is reduced (as opposed to K thinking them unreliable himself).

The credibility of a scientist and their results is largely seen as identical. "For a working scientist, the most vital question is not 'Did I repay my debt in the form of recognition because of the good paper he wrote?' but 'Is he reliable enough to be believed? Can I trust him/his claim? Is he going to provide me with hard facts?'" (202) CVs are the major way this credibility is proven and career trajectories are the story of its use. Technicians and minor leaguers, by contrast, do not accumulate capital but instead are paid a "salary" by major leaguers.

The preface to the second edition (1986) reads:
:''"The most substantial change to the first edition is the addition of an extended [https://books.google.com/books?id=XTcjm0flPdYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false postscript] in which we set out some of the reactions to the book's first publication in the light of developments in the social study of science since 1979. The postscript also explains the omission of the term "social" from this edition's new subtitle."''
So ''social construction'' becomes just ''construction of scientific facts''. This change indicates a shift from [[social constructivism]] to [[Actor-network theory]], which leaves more room for the non-social or 'natural' (albeit in a non-naturalistic / non-essentialist sense).

'''Los Angeles Science Teachers Network''' is a professional development network for [[science education]] by science teachers for science teachers committed to creating the most engaging hands-on curriculum possible through [[inquiry-based learning]] and [[scientific literacy]].

==History==
The first meeting was held in [[Lisa Ellen Niver]]'s home in September 2009. In October 2013, the professional development network had its fifteenth session. Over seventy teachers and forty schools have been involved to date. In ''[[Westside Today]]'', information about teaching, science and LASTN was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Advisory Council==
Several teachers formed the core group and served as advisors to Niver over the first three years: Susan Bagdasarian, Sasha Moore, Joseph Rose and Judy Weiskopf. Niver was frequently asked about teaching science, she has been quoted in Parenting.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.parenting.com/gallery/everyday-ways-sneak-learning |title      =Everyday Ways to Sneak in Learning |work     =Parenting.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PBS]].org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  https://www.pbs.org/parents/education/science/tips/weather-science-lessons/ |title      =Weather Science Lessons |work      = PBS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Green Living Arizona'' (in print),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.greenlivingaz.com/2012/05/08/5528/ |title      =Science vs. Nutrition the GMO debate |work      =Green Living Magazine Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Huffington Post''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url        =  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/14/back-to-school-divorce-teachers_n_1761147.html?ir=Divorce#slide=1376638 |title      =Back to School 2012: Teachers Reveal Divorced Parents Biggest Mistakes |work     =  Huffington Post | date=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on National television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqZqdq7Al24 |title      =Career Day |work     =National Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        = http://www.sciencebuddies.org/blog/2012/08/success-story-science-fair-projects-with-real-world-impact.php |title      =  Success Story: Science Fair Projects with Real-World Impact |work      =Science Buddies}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Niver is on sabbatical with [[We Said Go Travel]], Susan Bagdasarian has been the director of the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lisa-niver-rajna/0/871/6a3f |title      =LASTN |work     =LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.linkedin.com/company/3148346?trk=tyah |title      =LASTN company |work     =LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4326">'''MDRC''' is a nonprofit, nonpartisan education and social policy research organization based in New York City and Oakland, CA. MDRC mounts large-scale demonstrations and uses randomized controlled trials to measure the effects of social and educational policy initiatives. MDRC is led by President Gordon Berlin and Senior Vice Presidents Jesús Amadeo and Robert Ivry.

== History ==
In 1974 the Ford Foundation and six government agencies together created the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation. Its purpose was to implement and document the results of new programs intended to help the poor.&lt;ref name=Manpower&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohler|first=Scott|title=Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation |url=http://cspcs.sanford.duke.edu/sites/default/files/descriptive/manpower_demonstration_research_corporation.pdf |publisher=Center for Strategic Philanthropy and Civil Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s and 1990s, it became well known for its evaluations of state welfare-to-work programs.&lt;ref name=Manpower /&gt;  It formally adopted "MDRC" as its registered corporate identity in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About MDRC: MDRC History|url=http://www.mdrc.org/about/about-mdrc-history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
MDRC evaluates and pilot-tests programs in six main areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solutions We're Working On|url=http://www.mdrc.org/solutions-were-working|work=MDRC website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preschool through twelfth-grade education
* Higher education
* Disconnected youth
* Work and income security
* Families with children
* Health and disability

== Notable accomplishments ==
MDRC helped pioneer the use of [[random assignment]] to test social programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bornstein|first=David|title=Social Change's Age of Enlightenment|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/social-changes-age-of-enlightenment/|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Its evaluations of [[Workfare|welfare work programs]] influenced the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reform]] of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mead|first=Lawrence|title=Research and Welfare Reform|journal=NYU Department of Politics|date=July 8, 2004|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/papers/source/mead_rwr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s and 2000s, MDRC’s evaluation of the Career Academies high school reform model, which showed impacts on participants’ earnings eight years after graduation, influenced the expansion of the model around the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoye|first=J.D.|author2=David Stern|title=The Career Academy Story: A Case Study of How Research Can Move Policy and Practice|journal=Education Week|date=September 10, 2008|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2008/09/10/03hoye.h28.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   MDRC was the intermediary for the first [[social impact bond]] demonstration in the United States, a project to reduce [[recidivism]] among 16- to 18-year-olds incarcerated at [[Rikers Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chen|first=David|title=Goldman to Invest in City Jail Program, Profiting if Recidivism Falls Sharply|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/nyregion/goldman-to-invest-in-new-york-city-jail-program.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Eduardo (July 28, 2015).

'''''Material World''''' was a weekly science magazine programme on [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast on a Thursday afternoon. The programme's regular presenter was [[Quentin Cooper]], with contributions from scientists researching areas under discussion in each programme.

==History==
The programme began as ''The Material World'' in April 1998.  It was presented by [[Trevor Phillips]], a chemistry graduate of [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]]. In September 2000 Phillips was told that he could no longer work at the BBC due to his close links with the Labour Party, which broke BBC rules of impartiality. He was one of the few regular black broadcasters on Radio 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/sep/24/uk.labour1| title=BBC bans Trevor Phillips for political link| newspaper=[[The Guardian]]| date=24 September 2000| first=Kamal| last=Ahmed| author-link=Kamal Ahmed (journalist) |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was presented by Quentin Cooper from 2000 to its end in 2013.

Material World was one of the BBC's main conduits for up-to-date scientific news, along with ''[[Frontiers (radio programme)|Frontiers]]'', ''[[Science in Action – BBC World Service Radio|Science in Action]]'', and ''[[Bang Goes the Theory]]''.

From 5 April 2010 the programme was repeated on a Monday evening at 21.00, in the former slot of ''[[Costing the Earth]]''. For a short time, when programmes on [[BBC Radio 5 Live|5 Live]] began [[Streaming media|webstreaming]] with video, ''Material World'' was also [[webcast]].

On 14 June 2013 it was announced that the show was to be cancelled, to be replaced by a new show, ''Inside Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/posts/Introducing-Inside-Science |title = Introducing Inside Science |last = Bakaya |first = Mohit |date = 14 June 2013 |accessdate= 20 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last programme presented by Quentin Cooper was broadcast on 20 June 2013 with the final episode airing a week later on 27 June 2013, presented by Gareth Mitchell.

==Structure==
A typical episode programme covered three or four topics, giving each 7-10 minutes. For many years the programme was divided into two sections of fifteen minutes on separate topics.{{fact|date=September 2015}} It took the form of interviewing a guest scientist or engineer.  Cooper often ended the programme with a terrible scientific [[pun]].

Many past programmes are available for online listening via the programme's website. Some sequential sets of programmes were made in collaboration with the [[Open University]].

The '''mdx mouse''' is a popular model for studying [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] (DMD).

The mdx mouse has a point mutation in its DMD gene, changing the [[amino acid]] coding for a glutamine to STOP codon. This causes the muscle [[Cell (biology)|cells]] to [[Translation (biology)|produce]] a small, nonfunctional [[dystrophin]] protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parentprojectmd.org/site/PageServer?pagename=Advance_research_strategies_animalmodels|title=Animal Models - Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy|website=www.parentprojectmd.org|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the mouse has a mild form of DMD where there is increased muscle damage and weakness.

He is regarded as one of the founders of modern [[ethology]], the study of animal behavior.

In 1951, he published ''The Study of Instinct'', an influential book on animal behaviour.
In the 1960s, he collaborated with filmmaker [[Hugh Falkus]] on a series of wildlife films, including ''The Riddle of the [[Rook (bird)|Rook]]'' (1972) and ''Signals for Survival'' (1969), which won the Italia prize in that year and the American blue ribbon in 1971.

== Education and early life ==
Born in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, he was one of five children of Dirk Cornelis Tinbergen and his wife Jeannette van Eek. His brother, [[Jan Tinbergen]], won the first [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1969/press.html | title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1969 | publisher=Nobelprize.org | year=1969 | accessdate=27 January 2014 | author=Lundberg, Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the only siblings to each win a Nobel Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/|title=Nobel Prize Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another brother, [[Luuk Tinbergen]] was also a noted biologist.

Tinbergen's interest in nature manifested itself when he was young. He studied [[biology]] at [[Leiden University]] and was a prisoner of war during [[World War II]]. Tinbergen's experience as a prisoner of the Nazis led to some friction with longtime intellectual collaborator [[Konrad Lorenz]], and it was several years before the two reconciled.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Nikolaas_Tinbergen.aspx | title=Encyclopedia.com Nikolaas Tinbergen | publisher=Encyclopedia.com | accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Tinbergen moved to England, where he taught at the [[University of Oxford]] and was a fellow first at [[Merton College, Oxford]] and later at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"/&gt; Several of his graduate students went on to become prominent biologists including [[Richard Dawkins]],&lt;ref name=dawkinsphd/&gt; [[Marian Dawkins]],&lt;ref name=stamphd/&gt; [[Desmond Morris]],&lt;ref name=Beale/&gt; [[Iain Douglas-Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daston|first1=Lorraine|last2=Mitman|first2=Gregg|title=Thinking with Animals: New Perspectives on Anthropomorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaX_7w_gZwsC&amp;pg=PT193|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50377-8|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Sinclair (biologist)|Tony Sinclair]].&lt;ref name=serengeti&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinclair |first=Anthony |date=2012 |title=Serengeti Story: Life and Science in the World's Greatest Wildlife Region |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=33 |isbn=9780199645527 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and career==

=== The Study of Instinct ===
[[File:Tinbergen good figure wiki2.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 1. Tinbergen's hierarchical model. Modified from ''The Study of Instinct'' (1951).]]

In 1951 Tinbergen's ''The Study of Instinct'' was published. Behavioural ecologists and evolutionary biologists still recognise the contribution this book offered the field of [[behavioural science]] studies. ''The Study of Instinct'' summarises Tinbergen's ideas on innate behavioural reactions in animals and the adaptiveness and evolutionary aspects of these behaviours. By behaviour, he means the total movements made by the intact animal; innate behaviour is that which is not changed by the learning process. The major question of the book is the role of internal and external stimuli in controlling the expression of behaviour.&lt;ref name="Hinde, R. A. 1956"&gt;Hinde, R. A. ''Ethological Models and the Concept of 'Drive'''. British Journal of the Philosophy of Science, 6, 321–331 (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, he was interested in explaining 'spontaneous' behaviours: those that occurred in their complete form the first time they were performed and that seemed resistant to the effects of learning.  He explains how behaviour can be considered a combination of these spontaneous behaviour patterns and as set series of reactions to particular stimuli. Behaviour is a reaction in that to a certain extent it is reliant on external stimuli, however it is also spontaneous since it is also dependent upon internal causal factors.&lt;ref name="Hinde, R. A. 1956"/&gt;

His model for how certain behavioural reactions are provoked was based on work by [[Konrad Lorenz]]. Lorenz postulated that for each instinctive act there is a specific energy which builds up in a reservoir in the brain.  In this model, Lorenz envisioned a reservoir with a spring valve at its base that an appropriate [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] could act on, much like a weight on a scale pan pulling against a spring and releasing the reservoir of energy, an action which would lead an animal to express the desired behaviour.&lt;ref name="Hinde, R. A. 1956"/&gt;

Tinbergen added complexity to this model, a model now known as Tinbergen's hierarchical model. He suggested that motivational impulses build up in nervous centres in the brain which are held in check by blocks. The blocks are removed by an innate releasing mechanism that allows the energy to flow to the next centre (each centre containing a block that needs to be removed) in a cascade until the behaviour is expressed. Tinbergen's model shows multiple levels of complexity and that related behaviours are grouped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tinbergen, Nikolaas | year=1951 | title=The Study of Instinct | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=nnn–mmm}}{{page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is in his experiments with foraging [[honey bees]]. He showed that honey bees show curiosity for yellow and blue paper models of flowers, and suggested that these were visual stimuli causing the buildup of energy in one specific centre. However, the bees rarely landed on the model flowers unless the proper odour was also applied. In this case, the chemical stimuli of the odour allowed the next link in the chain to be released, encouraging the bee to land. The final step was for the bee to insert its mouthparts into the flower and initiate suckling. Tinbergen envisioned this as concluding the reaction set for honey bee feeding behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tinbergen, Nikolaas | year=1951 | title=The Study of Instinct | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=nnn–mmm}}{{page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nobel Prize ===
In 1973 Tinbergen, along with [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Karl von Frisch]], were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/&lt;/ref&gt; The award recognised their studies on genetically programmed behaviour patterns, their origins, maturation and their elicitation by key stimuli. In his Nobel Lecture, Tinbergen addressed the somewhat unconventional decision of the Nobel Foundation to award the prize for Physiology or Medicine to three men who had until recently been regarded as "mere animal watchers". Tinbergen stated that their revival of the "watching and wondering" approach to studying behaviour could indeed contribute to the relief of human suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, N. Ethology and stress diseases. Physiology Or Medicine: 1971–1980 19711980, 113 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies performed by the trio on fish, insects and birds laid the foundation for further studies on the importance of specific experiences during critical periods of normal development, as well as the effects of abnormal psychosocial situations in mammals. At the time, these discoveries were stated to have caused "a breakthrough in the understanding of the mechanisms behind various symptoms of psychiatric disease, such as anguish, compulsive obsession, stereotypic behaviour and catatonic posture".&lt;ref&gt;Zetterström, R. The Nobel Prize for the introduction of ethology, or animal behaviour, as a new research field: possible implications for child development and behaviour: Nobel prizes of importance to Paediatrics. Acta Paediatrica 96, 1105–1108 (2007).

&lt;/ref&gt; Tinbergen’s contribution to these studies included the testing of the hypotheses of Lorenz/von Frisch by means of "comprehensive, careful, and ingenious experiments"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/presentation-speech.html |date=1973  |first=Börje |last=Cronholm |title=Award Ceremony Speech |publisher=Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his work on supernormal stimuli. The work of Tinbergen during this time was also regarded as having possible implications for further research in child development and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Zetterström, R. The Nobel Prize for the introduction of ethology, or animal behaviour, as a new research field: possible implications for child development and behaviour: Nobel prizes of importance to Paediatrics. Acta Paediatrica 96, 1105–1108 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also caused some intrigue by dedicating a large part of his acceptance speech to [[F. Matthias Alexander|FM Alexander]], originator of the [[Alexander technique]], a method which investigates postural reflexes and responses in human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/tinbergen-lecture.pdf|title = Nikolaas Tinbergen Nobel Lecture Ethology and Stress Diseases|date = 12 December 1973|access-date = |publisher = NobelPrize.org|last = Tinbergen|first = Nikolaas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other awards and honours===
In 1950 Tinbergen became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00003350 |title=Niko Tinbergen (1907–1988) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1962|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1962]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; He was also awarded the Godman-Salvin Medal in 1969 by the British Ornithologists' Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bou.org.uk/about-the-bou/administration-and-people/medals-and-awards/|title=Medals and awards "  British Ornithologists' Union|publisher=bou.org.uk|access-date=27 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331172205/https://www.bou.org.uk/about-the-bou/administration-and-people/medals-and-awards/|archivedate=31 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 received the Swammderdam Medal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gngh.uva.nl/onderscheidingen/swammerdam-medaille/swammerdam-medaille.html|title=Swammerdam medaille – GNGH – Universiteit van Amsterdam|last=Amsterdam|first=Universiteit van|website=gngh.uva.nl|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilhelm Bölsche Medal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life of David Lack: Father of Evolutionary Ecology|last=Anderson|first=Ted|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=0199922659|location=Oxford|pages=185|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from the Genootschap ter bervordering van Natuur-, Genees- en Heelkunde of the University of Amsterdam and the Kosmos-Gesellschaft der Naturfreunde respectively).

=== Approach to animal behaviour ===
{{main article|Tinbergen's four questions}}

Tinbergen described four questions he believed should be asked of any animal behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;Diagram on [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Nesse-Tinbergen4Q.PDF The Four Areas of Biology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further Diagrams on [http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/inhalt.html The Four Areas of Biology (Documents No. 5, 6 and 7 in English)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lorenz | first1 = K. | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1937.tb01401.x | title = Biologische Fragestellung in der Tierpsychologie | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 1 | pages = 24–32 | year = 1937}} (in English: Biological Questions in Animal Psychology).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = N. | authorlink = Nikolaas Tinbergen| title = On aims and methods of Ethology | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1963.tb01161.x | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 410–433 | year = 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were:

# [[Causality|Causation]] (mechanism): what are the stimuli that elicit the response, and how has it been modified by recent [[learning]]? How do behaviour and psyche "function" on the molecular, physiological, neuro-ethological, cognitive and social level, and what do the relations between the levels look like? (compare: [[Nicolai Hartmann]]: "The laws about the levels of complexity")
# [[Developmental biology|Development]] ([[ontogeny]]): how does the behaviour change with age, and what early experiences are necessary for the behaviour to be shown? Which developmental steps (the ontogenesis follows an "inner plan") ''and'' which environmental factors play when / which role? (compare: [[Recapitulation theory]])
# Function ([[adaptation]]): how does the [[behaviour]] impact on the animal's chances of survival and reproduction?
# [[Evolution]] ([[phylogeny]]): how does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related [[species]], and how might it have arisen through the process of phylogeny? Why did structural associations (behaviour can be seen as a "time space structure") evolve in this manner and not otherwise?*

In [[ethology]] and [[sociobiology]], causation and ontogeny are summarised as the "proximate mechanisms", while [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]] and [[phylogeny]] are the "ultimate mechanisms". They are still considered as the cornerstone of modern ethology, sociobiology and [[transdisciplinarity]] in Human Sciences.

=== Supernormal stimulus ===
A major body of Tinbergen's research focused on what he termed the [[supernormal stimulus]]. This was the concept that one could build an artificial object which was a stronger stimulus or releaser for an instinct than the object for which the instinct originally evolved.  He constructed plaster eggs to see which a bird preferred to sit on, finding that they would select those that were larger, had more defined markings, or more saturated colour—and a dayglo-bright one with black polka dots would be selected over the bird's own pale, dappled eggs.

Tinbergen found that territorial male [[three-spined stickleback]] (a small freshwater fish) would attack a wooden fish model more vigorously than a real male if its underside was redder. He constructed cardboard dummy butterflies with more defined markings that male butterflies would try to mate with in preference to real females. The superstimulus, by its exaggerations, clearly delineated what characteristics were eliciting the instinctual response.

Among the modern works calling attention to Tinbergen's classic work is [[Deirdre Barrett]]'s 2010 book, ''[[Supernormal Stimuli]]''.

=== Autism ===
Tinbergen applied his observational methods to the problems of [[autism spectrum|autistic]] children. He recommended a "[[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]]" in which parents hold their autistic children for long periods of time while attempting to establish eye contact, even when a child resists the embrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Tinbergen N, Tinbergen EA |title= Autistic Children: New Hope for a Cure |publisher= [[Routledge]] |year=1986 |edition= new |isbn=0-04-157011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his interpretations of autistic behaviour, and the holding therapy that he recommended, lacked scientific support&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bishop | first1 = D.

== Personal life ==
Tinbergen was a member of the advisory committee to the [[Anti-Concorde Project]]{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and was also an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supernormal Stimuli: How Primal Urges Overran Their Evolutionary Purpose|year=2010|publisher=W.

Wartime atrocities, however, had highlighted the absence of a deity for him while both sides invoked one aligned with themselves, and this turned him into a militant atheist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tinbergen married Elisabeth Rutten and they had five children. Later in life he suffered [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and feared he might, like his brother Luuk, commit suicide. He was treated by his friend, whose ideas he had greatly influenced, [[John Bowlby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Der Horst | first1 = F. C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1943">'''Particle mass analyser''' is a measurement technique for classifying [[aerosol]] particles according to their mass-to-charge ratio.

Techniques exist for classifying (selecting) aerosol particles in the sub 1,000&amp;nbsp;nm range according to [[electrical mobility]] using devices such as differential mobility analysers.

==Electrical mobility==
In electrical mobility measurement, aerosol particles are classified according to their aerodynamic drag-charge ratio. If the particle is non-spherical, the electrical-mobility diameter will not correspond to any measurable physical dimensions of the particle. (For a spherical particle, the electrical-mobility diameter will correspond to physically measurable diameter.)

==Centrifugal particle mass analyzer==
An alternative technique classifies particles according to their [[mass-to-charge ratio]], using opposing electrical and [[centrifugal force]]s. This allows the classifier to select particles of a specified mass-to-charge ratio independent of particle shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehara|title=Novel method to classify aerosol particles according to their mass-to-charge ratio - Aerosol particle mass analyser|journal=Journal of Aerosol Science|date=March 1996|volume=27|issue=2|page=217|doi=10.1016/0021-8502(95)00562-5|ref=1|display-authors=etal|bibcode=1996JAerS..27..217E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16515">The '''philosophy of technology''' is a sub-field of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of [[technology]] and its social effects.

Philosophical discussion of questions relating to technology (or its Greek ancestor ''[[techne]]'') dates back to the very dawn of [[Western philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Franssen et al." /&gt;  The phrase "philosophy of technology" was first used in the late 19th century by German-born philosopher and geographer [[Ernst Kapp]], who published a book titled "Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik".&lt;ref name="Marquit 1995"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marquit|first1=Erwin|title=Philosophy of Technology|url=http://www.tc.umn.edu/~marqu002/techphil.html|accessdate=25 September 2015|date=1995}} Section 2, paragraph 10.  Published in vol. 13 of the ''Encyclopedia of Applied Physics'' (entry “Technology, Philosophy of”), pp. 417–29. VCH Publishers, Weinheim, Germany, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kapp 1877" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Greek philosophy ===
The western term 'technology' comes from the Greek term ''[[techne]]'' (τέχνη) (art, or craft knowledge) and philosophical views on technology can be traced to the very roots of [[Western philosophy]]. A common theme in the Greek view of ''techne'' is that it arises as an imitation of nature (for example, weaving developed out of watching spiders). Greek philosophers such as [[Heraclitus]] and [[Democritus]] endorsed this view.&lt;ref name="Franssen et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Franssen |first1=Maarten |last2=Lokhorst |first2=Gert-Jan |last3=van de Poel |first3=Ibo |title=Philosophy of Technology |work=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=Spring 2010 |first4=Edward N., Ed. |last4=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/technology/ |accessdate=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]], [[Aristotle]] agreed that this imitation was often the case, but also argued that ''techne'' can go beyond nature and complete "what nature cannot bring to a finish."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Physics II.8, 199a15&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle also argued that nature (''physis'') and ''techne'' are ontologically distinct because natural things have an inner principle of generation and motion, as well as an inner teleological final cause. While ''techne'' is shaped by an outside cause and an outside ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' (goal or end) which shapes it.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Physics II&lt;/ref&gt; Natural things strive for some end and reproduce themselves, while ''techne'' does not. In [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], the world is depicted as being the work of a divine craftsman ([[Demiurge]]) who created the world in accordance with [[platonic forms|eternal forms]] as an artisan makes things using blueprints. Moreover, Plato argues in the [[Laws]], that what a craftsman does is imitate this divine craftsman.

=== Middle ages to 19th century ===
[[File:Francis Bacon, Viscount St Alban from NPG (2).jpg|thumb|right|Sir Francis Bacon]]
During the period of the Roman empire and late antiquity authors produced practical works such as [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De Architectura]]'' (1st century BC) and [[Georgius Agricola|Agricola]]'s ''[[De re metallica|De Re Metallica]]'' (1556). Medieval [[Scholastic philosophy]] generally upheld the traditional view of technology as imitation of nature. During the Renaissance, [[Francis Bacon]] became one of the first modern authors to reflect on the impact of technology on society. In his utopian work ''[[New Atlantis]]'' (1627), Bacon put forth an optimistic worldview in which a fictional institution ([[Salomon's House]]) uses [[natural philosophy]] and technology to extend man's power over nature - for the betterment of society, through works which improve living conditions. The goal of this fictional foundation is "...the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== 19th century ===

The native German philosopher and geographer [[Ernst Kapp]], who was based in [[Texas]], published the fundamental book "Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik" in 1877.&lt;ref name="Kapp 1877"&gt;* [[Ernst Kapp]]: ''Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik. Zur Entstehungsgeschichte der Cultur aus neuen Gesichtspunkten'' (Braunschweig/Brunswick 1877, Reprint Düsseldorf 1978, Engl. Translation Chicago 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Kapp was deeply inspired by the philosophy of [[Hegel]] and regarded technique as a projection of human organs. In the European context, Kapp is referred to as the founder of the philosophy of technology.

Another, more materialistic position on technology which became very influential in the 20th-century philosophy of technology was centered on the ideas of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Karl Marx]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== 20th century to present ===

Five early prominent 20th-century philosophers to directly address the effects of modern technology on humanity were [[John Dewey]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Günther Anders]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]. They all saw technology as central to modern life, although Heidegger, Anders,&lt;ref&gt;# The Outdatedness of Human Beings 1. On the Soul in the Era of the Second Industrial Revolution. 1956 # The Outdatedness of Human Beings 2. On the Destruction of Life in the Era of the Third Industrial Revolution.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Human Condition'', 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; and Marcuse were more ambivalent and critical than Dewey. The problem for Heidegger was the hidden nature of technology's essence, ''[[Gestell]]'' or ''Enframing'' which posed for humans what he called its greatest danger and thus its greatest possibility. Heidegger's major work on technology is found in ''[[The Question Concerning Technology]]''.

Contemporary philosophers with an interest in technology include [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Albert Borgmann]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], [[Langdon Winner]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Avital Ronell]], [[Brian Holmes]],  [[Don Ihde]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[Paul Levinson]], [[Ernesto Mayz Vallenilla]], [[Carl Mitcham]], [[Leo Marx]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Paul Virilio]], [[Günter Ropohl]], [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]], [[Richard Sennett]], [[:pt:Álvaro Vieira Pinto|Álvaro Vieira Pinto]] and [[George Grant (philosopher)|George Grant]].

While a number of important individual works were published in the second half of the twentieth century, [[Paul Durbin]] has identified two books published at the turn of the century as marking the development of the philosophy of technology as an academic subdiscipline with canonical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v7n1/intro.html Techné Vol 7 No 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Those were ''Technology and the Good Life'' (2000), edited by [[Eric Higgs (philosopher)|Eric Higgs]], Andrew Light, and [[David Strong]] and ''American Philosophy of Technology'' (2001) by [[Hans Achterhuis]]. Several collected volumes with topics in philosophy of technology have come out over the past decade and the journals ''[[Techné: Research in Philosophy and Technology|Techne: Research in Philosophy and Technology]]'' (the journal of the [[Society for Philosophy and Technology]], published by the [[Philosophy Documentation Center]]) and ''Philosophy &amp; Technology'' ([[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]) publish exclusively works in philosophy of technology. Philosophers of technology reflect broadly and work in the area and include interest on diverse topics of geoengineering, internet data and privacy, our understandings of internet cats, technological function and epistemology of technology, computer ethics, biotechnology and its implications, transcendence in space, and technological ethics more broadly.

=== Technology and neutrality ===

[[Technological determinism]] is the idea that "features of technology [determines] its use and the role of a progressive society was to adapt to [and benefit from] technological change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Lelia|title=Technoculture|date=2001|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest, Australia|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative perspective would be social determinism which looks upon society being at fault for the "development and deployment"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Lelia|title=Technoculture|date=2001|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest, Australia|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; of technologies. [[Lelia Green]] used recent gun massacres such as the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur Massacre]] and the [[Dunblane Massacre]] to selectively show technological determinism and [[social determinism]]. According to Green, a technology can be thought of as a neutral entity only when the sociocultural context and issues circulating the specific technology are removed. It will be then visible to us that there lies a relationship of social groups and power provided through the possession of technologies.

The '''Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science''' ('''RDFRS''' or '''RDF''') is a division of [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI) founded by British biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] in 2006 to promote scientific literacy and secularism.

Originally a non-profit based in Washington, D.C., the organization merged with CFI in 2016.

==History==
After Richard Dawkins’ success with the book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', he created the foundation with its headquarters in the United States to work toward a world in which religion no longer interferes with the advance of science and in which people use their critical thinking skills to evaluate theist claims about the nature of reality.

Dawkins complained of the difficulty he faced in gaining tax-free status, which he attributes to the secular nature of the organization. In contrast to the presumption by officials that religious organizations benefit humanity without evidence (for instance [[Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption]]), he points to a letter he received from the British Charity Commission requesting evidence for the claim that the advancement of science is connected to the public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |year=2009 |publisher=[[Bantam Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-593-06173-2 |oclc= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theist author Marion Ledwig suggests that the foundation may have been set up as an atheist counterpart to the [[John Templeton Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God's Rational Warriors |year=2008 |first=Marion |last=Ledwig |publisher=Ontos-Verlag |isbn=978-3-938793-87-9 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization which Dawkins has publicly criticized, especially in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', for corrupting science. In a [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk prior to writing ''The God Delusion'', Dawkins had called for the need for an "anti-Templeton" to step up, saying that if his books sold better, he would take the initiative himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism.html Dawkins 2002 TED talk] accessed 2010-04-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins describes his foundation’s purpose this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;“Critical thinking is the real saviour of humankind. My foundation promotes respect for people who hold critical thinking as a cherished personal value and use it in day-to-day life. The logical counter to religious extremism is people who rely on evidence to make decisions. Yet the voice of secular people is maligned in this country. Forty-five percent of Americans think you have to believe in God to be moral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/section-5-views-on-religion-the-bible-evolution-and-social-issues/|title = PewResearchCenter|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular voices are considered immoral. They are not listened to on that basis. We must counter this baseless hostility to allow the contributions of secular people in vital national debates to count. Making secular views and people welcome in politics and policy-making will advance human safety, security, health, achievement, prosperity and most of all, ''science''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://richarddawkins.net/aboutus/|title = Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The organization began accepting members in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://richarddawkins.net/join/#|title = Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among its activities, RDFRS finances research into the psychology of belief and religion, finances scientific education programs and materials, and publicizes and supports [[secularism|secular]] charitable organisations.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/pages/mission |title=Our Mission |accessdate=2006-11-17 |work=richarddawkins.net |publisher=The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation has been granted charitable status in the United Kingdom and status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit [[Private foundation (United States)|private operating foundation]] in the United States. RDFRS financed research on the [[psychology of religion|psychology of belief and religion]], financed scientific education programs and materials, and publicised and supported [[charitable organisation]]s that are [[secularity|secular]] in nature. The foundation also offers [[humanism|humanist]], [[rationalism|rationalist]], and [[science|scientific]] materials through its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richarddawkins.net/foundation,ourMission |title=Our Mission |accessdate=17 November 2006 |publisher=The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061117150429/http://www.richarddawkins.net/foundation,ourMission |archivedate =17 November 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins has said the "trend toward theocratic thinking in the United States is a danger not only for America but for the entire world."&lt;ref name="RDFfaircloth" /&gt;  Connected to this concern, Dawkins invited [[Sean Faircloth]] to serve as opening speaker on Dawkins's 2011 US book tour. Faircloth is author of the book ''Attack of the Theocrats, How the Religious Right Harms Us All and What We Can Do About It''. The Richard Dawkins Foundation (United States branch) later hired Faircloth, who has ten years experience as a state legislator, as Director of Strategy and Policy.&lt;ref name="RDFfaircloth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/643044-sean-faircloth-joins-rdfrs-us-as-director-of-strategy-and-policy |title=Sean Faircloth joins RDFRS (US) as Director of Strategy and Policy |accessdate=1 October 2011 |publisher=The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006003447/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/643044-sean-faircloth-joins-rdfrs-us-as-director-of-strategy-and-policy |archivedate=4 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|2=Next time somebody tells you something that sounds important, think to yourself: 'Is this the kind of thing that people probably know because of evidence? Or is it the kind of thing that people only believe because of tradition, authority or revelation?' And, next time somebody tells you that something is true, why not say to them: 'What kind of evidence is there for that?' And if they can't give you a good answer, I hope you'll think very carefully before you believe a word they say.

==History==
Over the years, Science Week Ireland has grown from a small pilot initiative to a large promotional and event engine to its current identity as a recognised vehicle for regional activity supported by a national promotional campaign.&lt;ref name="oak1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahlstrom|first1=Dick|title=Science Week: From small acorn to giant oak tree . . .|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sponsored/science-week-from-small-acorn-to-giant-oak-tree-1.2403471|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The first Science Week in Ireland was held in 1996.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; It was organised by Forfás on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation under the name 'Information Technology and Science Week'. The week aimed to raise general awareness of the benefits of science and information technology to people, young and old throughout society. In 1997 it was renamed as Science Week. Professional bodies, voluntary groups, colleges, businesses and the public sector combined to organise 50 events countrywide.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; Events included conferences, lectures, interactive exhibitions, debates, and competitions for primary school students. 

SFI took over Science Week from the Forfás Discover Science and Engineering programme in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New legislation to focus scientific research on turning good ideas into good jobs|url=https://www.irishbuildingmagazine.ie/2012/12/12/new-legislation-to-focus-scientific-research-on-turning-good-ideas-into-good-jobs|publisher=Irish Building Magazine|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Week continued to grow and develop over the following years into what it represents today, a week-long&lt;ref name="sfi ie1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Week|url=http://www.sfi.ie/engagement/science-week/|website=sfi.ie|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebration of STEM public engagement, enhancing the public’s interest in STEM and enabling them to see the relevance of STEM to their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Foundation Ireland Discover Programme Call 2017|url=http://www.sfi.ie/funding/funding-calls/sfi-discover-programme/1.-SFI-Discover-Programme-Call-2017-FINAL.pdf|website=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3891">A '''science [[attaché]]''' (also known as a '''scientific attaché''' or a '''technical attaché''') is a member of a [[diplomatic mission]], usually an [[embassy]]. A science attaché traditionally had three primary functions: advise the [[ambassador]] on scientific and technical matters, report scientific and technological events, and represent his or her country in scientific and technical matters to foreign scientific and technical [[National academy|academies]], industry, and government bodies.

A science attaché also helped forge formal ties between domestic and foreign scientists and researchers and acted as a catalyst for scientific exchange initiatives.&lt;ref name=Loftness&gt;Robert L. Loftness, ''Why Science Attachés?'', 80 The Scientific Monthly 124 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt;  The non-advising roles of the science attaché seem somewhat less important in the age of the internet and the truly international scientific community it has helped create.

==Historical functions==
The role of science attachés of the United States was first outlined in 1950 in a report entitled ''Science and Foreign Relations'', issued by the [[United States State Department]].&lt;ref name=Loftness/&gt;  It listed the primary duties of science attachés as:&lt;ref name=Berkner&gt;''Science and Foreign Relations'', Department of State Pub. 3860, Lloyd V. Berkner, ed. (1950)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Reporting on significant scientific and technological developments.
# Assistance in the exchange of scientific information
# Assistance in the exchange of scientific persons
# Assistance in the procurement of scientific apparatus, chemicals, and biologicals
# Cooperation with all United States groups abroad having programs with scientific and technological aspects
# General representations of United States science
# Scientific and technical advice to the Embassy staff
# Arrangements for collaborative research projects between the United States and foreign scientists
# General promotion of better understanding between the United States and foreign science.

==Modern trends==
The modern trend seems to be to emphasize the advisory role of the science attaché over the facilitation of scientific and technical exchanges. As recently as 1998, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] called for the appointment of more science-savvy diplomats to the State Department to improve the quality of the scientific advice available to foreign policymakers. The panel also emphasized the need to encourage general foreign service staff to acquire scientific skills.&lt;ref name=Science&gt;''Panel Calls for Science-Savvy Diplomats'', 281 Science 1937 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

While there has been more emphasis on the advisory role, science attachés could still play a role in facilitating exchanges and collaborations by helping scientists from their home country understand the host nation’s science culture and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linkov|first=Igor|author2=Benjamin Trump |author3=Elisa Tatham |author4=Sankar Basu |author5=Mihail C. Roco |title=Diplomacy for Science Two Generations Later|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=2014-03-13|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2014/diplomacy-for-science-two-generations-later}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, being appointed science attaché was viewed as the "kiss of death" for advancement within the foreign service.&lt;ref name=Science/&gt;  However, with the growing importance of scientific issues such as [[global warming]], [[Globalization and disease|global infectious diseases]], and [[bioterrorism]] to foreign policymaking and diplomacy, this perception may be changing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5955">In [[science]], '''priority''' is the credit given to the individual or group of individuals who first made the discovery or propose the theory. Fame and honours usually go to the first person or group to publish a new finding, even if several researchers arrived at the same conclusion independently and at the same time. Thus between two or more independent discoverers, the first to make formal publication is the legitimate winner. Hence, the tradition is often referred to as the '''priority rule''', the procedure of which is nicely summed up in a phrase "[[publish or perish]]", because there are no second prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strevens M|year=2003 |title= The Role of the Priority Rule in Science| journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=55–79| pmid= |pmc= |jstor=3655792}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a way, the race to be first inspires risk-taking that can lead to scientific breakthroughs which is beneficial to the society (such as discovery of [[malaria|malaria transmission]], [[DNA]], [[HIV]], etc.); on the other hand, it can create an unhealthy competition, thus, becoming detrimental to scientific progress.&lt;ref name=fang&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fang FC, Casadevall A|year=2012 |title= Reforming science: structural reforms | journal=Infect Immun|volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=897–901 |pmid= 22184420| pmc=3294664|doi= 10.1128/IAI.06184-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priority disputes==
Priority becomes a difficult issue usually in the context of priority disputes, where the priority for a given theory, understanding, or discovery comes into question. In most cases historians of science disdain retrospective priority disputes as enterprises which generally lack understanding about the nature of scientific change and usually involve gross misreadings of the past to support the idea of a long-lost priority claim. Historian and biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] once remarked that "debates about the priority of ideas are usually among the most misdirected in the history of science."&lt;ref&gt;Gould SJ (1977). ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny''. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Feynman]] told [[Freeman Dyson]] that he avoided priority disputes by "Always giv[ing] the bastards more credit than they deserve." Dyson remarked that he also follows this rule, and that this practice is "remarkably effective for avoiding quarrels and making friends." &lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, 2011, "The Dramatic Picture of Richard Feynman, " New York Review of Books, July 14, 2011. Reprinted in {{ISBN|9781590178546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

The priority rule came into existence before or as soon as modern scientific methods were established. For example, the earliest documented controversy was a bitter claim between [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in the 17th century about priority in the invention of [[calculus]]. This particular incidence clearly shows human biases and prejudice. It has become unanimously accepted that both the mathematicians independently developed calculus. Since then priority has caused a number of historical maladies in the history of science.&lt;ref name=fang/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| vauthors= Fang FC, Casadevall A|title=Intense Competition among Scientists Has Gotten out of Hand|date=25 July 2012| url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=intense-competition-among-scientists-gotten-out-of-hand |work= Scientific American |publisher= Scientific American, a Division of Nature America, Inc.|accessdate= 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the cases of scientists who have since achieved incredible levels of popularity, such as [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Albert Einstein]], priority questions are often rooted in taking too seriously the myth of the "[[Heroic theory of invention and scientific development|lone genius]]" which is often cultivated around such quasi-mythic figures (see [[Great Man theory]] and [[Whig history]]). In an attempt to laud such scientists as visionaries, the context in which they worked is often neglected by popularizers, making it appear as if they worked without assistance or without reference to other work, something which is rarely the case.

A '''scientific theory''' is an explanation of an aspect of the [[nature|natural]] world that can be [[reproducibility|repeatedly tested]] and verified in accordance with the [[scientific method]], using accepted [[protocol (science)|protocols]] of [[observation]], measurement, and evaluation of results. Where possible, theories are tested under controlled conditions in an [[experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=2 |title=Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences|National Academies Press]] |year=1999 |edition=2nd |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Structure of Scientific Theories in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structure-scientific-theories/ |title=The Structure of Scientific Theories |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In circumstances not amenable to experimental testing, theories are evaluated through principles of [[abductive reasoning]]. Established scientific theories have withstood rigorous scrutiny and embody scientific [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name=Schafersman&gt;{{cite web |last=Schafersman |first=Steven D. |title=An Introduction to Science |url=http://www.geo.sunysb.edu/esp/files/scientific-method.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the term ''scientific theory'' (often contracted to ''theory'' for brevity) as used in the [[Branches of science|disciplines of science]] is significantly different from the common [[vernacular]] usage of ''theory''.&lt;ref name="NAS2008"/&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Per NAS 2008: "The formal scientific definition of theory is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence."&lt;/ref&gt; In everyday speech, ''theory'' can imply an explanation that represents an unsubstantiated and speculative [[conjecture|guess]],&lt;ref name="NAS2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalacademies.org/evolution/TheoryOrFact.html |title=Is Evolution a Theory or a Fact? |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in science it describes an explanation that has been tested and widely accepted as valid. These different usages are comparable to the opposing usages of ''[[prediction in science|prediction]]'' in science versus common speech, where it denotes a mere hope.

The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain and its simplicity. As additional [[scientific evidence]] is gathered, a scientific theory may be modified and ultimately rejected if it cannot be made to fit the new findings; in such circumstances, a more accurate theory is then required. That doesn’t mean that all theories can be fundamentally changed (for example, well established foundational scientific theories such as evolution, heliocentric theory, cell theory, theory of plate tectonics etc). In certain cases, the less-accurate unmodified scientific theory can still be treated as a theory if it is useful (due to its sheer simplicity) as an approximation under specific conditions. A case in point is [[Newton's laws of motion]], which can serve as an approximation to [[special relativity]] at velocities that are small relative to the speed of light.

Scientific theories are [[testability|testable]] and make [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] [[prediction in science|predictions]].&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt; They describe the causes of a particular natural phenomenon and are used to explain and predict aspects of the physical [[universe]] or specific areas of inquiry (for example, electricity, chemistry, and astronomy). Scientists use theories to further scientific knowledge, as well as to facilitate advances in [[technology]] or [[medicine]].

As with other forms of scientific knowledge, scientific theories are both [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Andersen, Hanne; Hepburn, Brian |title=Scientific Method |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year=2015 |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/scientific-method/}}&lt;/ref&gt; aiming for [[predictive power|predictive]] and [[explanatory power]].

The [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] wrote that "...facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts."&lt;ref&gt;[[The Devil in Dover|The Devil in Dover, p. 98]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[Albert Einstein]] described two types of scientific theories: "Constructive theories" and "principle theories". Constructive theories are constructive models for phenomena: for example, [[kinetic energy]]. Principle theories are empirical generalisations such as Newton's laws of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/einstein-philscience/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Don A.|last=Howard|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=23 June 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Essential criteria===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Typically for any theory to be accepted within most academia there is one simple criterion.  The essential criterion is that the theory must be observable and repeatable.  The aforementioned criterion is essential to prevent fraud and perpetuate science itself. [[Image:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|300px|The tectonic plates of the world were mapped in the second half of the 20th century. Plate tectonic theory successfully explains numerous observations about the Earth, including the distribution of earthquakes, mountains, continents, and oceans.]]

The defining characteristic of all scientific knowledge, including theories, is the ability to make [[falsifiable]] or testable [[Predictive power|predictions]]. The relevance and specificity of those predictions determine how potentially useful the theory is. A would-be theory that makes no observable predictions is not a scientific theory at all. Predictions not sufficiently specific to be tested are similarly not useful. In both cases, the term "theory" is not applicable.

A body of descriptions of [[knowledge]] can be called a theory if it fulfills the following criteria:
* It makes [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry (such as [[mechanics]]).
* It is well-supported by many independent strands of evidence, rather than a single foundation.
* It is consistent with preexisting experimental results and at least as accurate in its predictions as are any preexisting theories.

These qualities are certainly true of such established theories as [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[plate tectonics]], the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]], etc.

===Other criteria===

In addition, scientists prefer to work with a theory that meets the following qualities:
* It can be subjected to minor adaptations to account for new data that do not fit it perfectly, as they are discovered, thus increasing its predictive capability over time.{{cn|date=September 2017}}
* It is among the most parsimonious explanations, economical in the use of proposed entities or explanatory steps as per [[Occam's razor]]. This is because for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives, because one can always burden failing explanations with [[ad hoc hypotheses|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]] to prevent them from being falsified; therefore, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more [[test method|testable]].&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"&gt;{{cite book |origyear=2004 |year=2010 |author=Alan Baker |chapter=Simplicity |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ |publisher=Stanford University |place=California |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2008 |vauthors=Courtney A, Courtney M |title=Comments Regarding "On the Nature Of Science" |url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0812/0812.4932.pdf |journal=Physics in Canada |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=7–8|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)"&gt;Elliott Sober, Let's Razor Occam's Razor, pp. 73–93, from Dudley Knowles (ed.) Explanation and Its Limits, Cambridge University Press (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions from scientific organizations===
The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] defines scientific theories as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The formal scientific definition of theory is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics)...One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=11 National Academy of Sciences] (2008), ''Science, Evolution, and Creationism.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than "just a theory". It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that the term ''theory'' would not be appropriate for describing untested but intricate hypotheses or even [[Scientific modelling|scientific models.]]

==Formation==
[[File:RobertHookeMicrographia1665.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.60|The first observation of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], by [[Robert Hooke]], using an early [[microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooke, Robert (1635–1703). [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?id=HistSciTech.HookeMicro ''Micrographia''], Observation XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the development of [[cell theory]].]]
The [[scientific method]] involves the proposal and testing of [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], by deriving [[predictions]] from the hypotheses about the results of future experiments, then performing those experiments to see whether the predictions are valid. This provides evidence either for or against the hypothesis. When enough experimental results have been gathered in a particular area of inquiry, scientists may propose an explanatory framework that accounts for as many of these as possible. This explanation is also tested, and if it fulfills the necessary criteria (see above), then the explanation becomes a theory. This can take many years, as it can be difficult or complicated to gather sufficient evidence.

Once all of the criteria have been met, it will be widely accepted by scientists (see [[scientific consensus]]) as the best available explanation of at least some phenomena. It will have made predictions of phenomena that previous theories could not explain or could not predict accurately, and it will have resisted attempts at falsification. The strength of the evidence is evaluated by the scientific community, and the most important experiments will have been replicated by multiple independent groups.

Theories do not have to be perfectly accurate to be scientifically useful. For example, the predictions made by [[classical mechanics]] are known to be inaccurate in the relatistivic realm, but they are almost exactly correct at the comparatively low velocities of common human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Misner, Charles W.; Thorne, Kip S.; Wheeler, John Archibald (1973). ''Gravitation,'' p. 1049. New York: W. H.Freeman and Company. {{ISBN|0-7167-0344-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[chemistry]], there are many [[acid-base theories]] providing highly divergent explanations of the underlying nature of acidic and basic compounds, but they are very useful for predicting their chemical behavior.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Arrhenius-Ostwald|Acid–base reaction]].&lt;/ref&gt; Like all knowledge in science, no theory can ever be completely [[certain]], since it is possible that future experiments might conflict with the theory's predictions.&lt;ref name=Project2061&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project2061.org/publications/sfaa/online/chap1.htm|title=Chapter 1: The Nature of Science|website=www.project2061.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, theories supported by the scientific consensus have the highest level of certainty of any scientific knowledge; for example, that all objects are subject to [[gravity]] or that life on Earth [[Evolution|evolved]] from a [[Last universal ancestor|common ancestor]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Common descent]] and [[Evidence for common descent]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Acceptance of a theory does not require that all of its major predictions be tested, if it is already supported by sufficiently strong evidence. For example, certain tests may be unfeasible or technically difficult. As a result, theories may make predictions that have not yet been confirmed or proven incorrect; in this case, the predicted results may be described informally with the term "theoretical". These predictions can be tested at a later time, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to the revision or rejection of the theory.

==Modification and improvement==
If experimental results contrary to a theory's predictions are observed, scientists first evaluate whether the experimental design was sound, and if so they confirm the results by independent [[Reproducibility|replication]]. A search for potential improvements to the theory then begins. Solutions may require minor or major changes to the theory, or none at all if a satisfactory explanation is found within the theory's existing framework.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the article on the [[discovery of Neptune]]; the discovery was based on an apparent violation of the orbit of [[Uranus]] as predicted by Newtonian mechanics. This explanation did not require any modification of the theory, but rather modification of the hypothesis that there were only seven planets in the Solar System.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, as successive modifications build on top of each other, theories consistently improve and greater predictive accuracy is achieved. Since each new version of a theory (or a completely new theory) must have more predictive and explanatory power than the last, scientific knowledge consistently becomes more accurate over time.

If modifications to the theory or other explanations seem to be insufficient to account for the new results, then a new theory may be required. Since scientific knowledge is usually durable, this occurs much less commonly than modification.&lt;ref name=Project2061/&gt; Furthermore, until such a theory is proposed and accepted, the previous theory will be retained. This is because it is still the best available explanation for many other phenomena, as verified by its predictive power in other contexts. For example, it has been known since 1859 that the observed [[perihelion precession of Mercury]] violates Newtonian mechanics,&lt;ref&gt;U. Le Verrier (1859), (in French), [https://archive.org/stream/comptesrendusheb49acad#page/378/mode/2up "Lettre de M. Le Verrier à M. Faye sur la théorie de Mercure et sur le mouvement du périhélie de cette planète"], Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences (Paris), vol. 49 (1859), pp. 379–83.&lt;/ref&gt; but the theory remained the best explanation available until [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] was supported by sufficient evidence. Also, while new theories may be proposed by a single person or by many, the cycle of modifications eventually incorporates contributions from many different scientists.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the modern theory of evolution (the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]{{dn|date=November 2017}}) incorporates significant contributions from [[R. A. Fisher]], [[Ernst Mayr]], [[J. B. S. Haldane]], and many others.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the changes, the accepted theory will explain more phenomena and have greater predictive power (if it did not, the changes would not be adopted); this new explanation will then be open to further replacement or modification. If a theory does not require modification despite repeated tests, this implies that the theory is very accurate. This also means that accepted theories continue to accumulate evidence over time, and the length of time that a theory (or any of its principles) remains accepted often indicates the strength of its supporting evidence.

===Unification===
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|200px|In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[electron]]s of an atom occupy [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] around the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. This image shows the orbitals of a [[hydrogen]] atom (''s'', ''p'', ''d'') at three different energy levels (1, 2, 3). Brighter areas correspond to higher probability density.]]

In some cases, two or more theories may be replaced by a single theory that explains the previous theories as approximations or special cases, analogous to the way a theory is a unifying explanation for many confirmed hypotheses; this is referred to as ''unification'' of theories.&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;Weinberg S (1993). ''Dreams of a Final Theory: The Scientist's Search for the Ultimate Laws of Nature.''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] are now known to be two aspects of the same phenomenon, referred to as [[electromagnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J. C., &amp; Thompson, J. J. (1892). [https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYcAAAAMAAJ A treatise on electricity and magnetism]. Clarendon Press series. Oxford: Clarendon.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the predictions of different theories appear to contradict each other, this is also resolved by either further evidence or unification. For example, physical theories in the 19th century implied that the [[Sun]] could not have been burning long enough to allow certain geological changes as well as the [[evolution]] of life. This was resolved by the discovery of [[nuclear fusion]], the main energy source of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/fusion/#1|title=How the Sun Shines|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contradictions can also be explained as the result of theories approximating more fundamental (non-contradictory) phenomena. For example, [[atomic theory]] is an approximation of [[quantum mechanics]]. Current theories describe three separate [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental phenomena]] of which all other theories are approximations;&lt;ref&gt;The [[strong force]], the [[electroweak force]], and [[gravity]]. The electroweak force is the unification of [[electromagnetism]] and the [[weak force]]. All observed causal interactions are understood to take place through one or more of these three mechanisms, although most systems are far too complicated to account for these except through the successive approximations offered by other theories.&lt;/ref&gt; the potential unification of these is sometimes called the [[Theory of Everything]].&lt;ref name=Weinberg/&gt;

===Example: Relativity===

In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published the principle of [[special relativity]], which soon became a theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]] (1905) "[http://www.pro-physik.de/Phy/pdfs/ger_890_921.pdf ''Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229162203/http://www.pro-physik.de/Phy/pdfs/ger_890_921.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }}", ''Annalen der Physik'' 17: 891; English translation [http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/ On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies] by [[George Barker Jeffery]] and Wilfrid Perrett (1923); Another English translation [[s:On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies|On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]] by [[Megh Nad Saha]] (1920).&lt;/ref&gt; Special relativity predicted the alignment of the Newtonian principle of [[Galilean invariance]], also termed ''Galilean relativity'', with the electromagnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwarz | first1 = John H | date = Mar 1998 | title = Recent developments in superstring theory | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 6| pages = 2750–57 | pmid = 9501161 | pmc=19640 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC19640/figure/F1 | doi=10.1073/pnas.95.6.2750| bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.2750S }}&lt;/ref&gt; By omitting from special relativity the [[luminiferous aether]], Einstein stated that [[time dilation]] and [[length contraction]] measured in an object in relative motion is [[inertia]]l—that is, the object exhibits constant [[velocity]], which is [[scalar (physics)|speed]] with [[vector (physics)|direction]], when measured by its observer. He thereby duplicated the [[Lorentz transformation]] and the [[Lorentz contraction]] that had been hypothesized to resolve experimental riddles and inserted into electrodynamic theory as dynamical consequences of the aether's properties. An elegant theory, special relativity yielded its own consequences,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tests of special relativity]]. Also, for example: Sidney Coleman, Sheldon L. Glashow, ''Cosmic Ray and Neutrino Tests of Special Relativity'', Phys. Lett. B405 (1997) 249–52, found here [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9703240]. An overview can be found [http://www.edu-observatory.org/physics-faq/Relativity/SR/experiments.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[mass–energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy transforming into one another]] and the resolution of the paradox that an excitation of the electromagnetic field could be viewed in one reference frame as electricity, but in another as magnetism.

Einstein sought to generalize the invariance principle to all reference frames, whether inertial or accelerating.&lt;ref name=Torrettipp289-90/&gt; Rejecting Newtonian gravitation—a [[central force]] [[action at a distance|acting instantly at a distance]]—Einstein presumed a gravitational field. In 1907, Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] implied that a free fall within a uniform gravitational field is equivalent to [[inertial]] motion.&lt;ref name=Torrettipp289-90&gt;Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=Newtownian+Relativity+Equivalence#v=twopage pp. 289–90].&lt;/ref&gt; By extending special relativity's effects into three dimensions, [[general relativity]] extended length contraction into [[space contraction]], conceiving of 4D space-time as the gravitational field that alters geometrically and sets all local objects' pathways.  Even massless energy exerts gravitational motion on local objects by "curving" the geometrical "surface" of 4D space-time. Yet unless the energy is vast, its relativistic effects of contracting space and slowing time are negligible when merely predicting motion. Although general relativity is embraced as the more explanatory theory via ''[[scientific realism]]'', Newton's theory remains successful as merely a predictive theory via ''[[instrumentalism]]''. To calculate trajectories, engineers and NASA still uses Newton's equations, which are simpler to operate.&lt;ref name=Project2061/&gt;

==Theories and laws==
{{see also|Scientific law}}
Both scientific laws and scientific theories are produced from the scientific method through the formation and testing of hypotheses, and can predict the behavior of the natural world. Both are typically well-supported by observations and/or experimental evidence.&lt;ref name=Matson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.kennesaw.edu/~rmatson/3380theory.html|title=Scientific Laws and Theories|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientific laws are descriptive accounts of how nature will behave under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;See the article on [[Physical law]], for example.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific theories are broader in scope, and give overarching explanations of how nature works and why it exhibits certain characteristics. Theories are supported by evidence from many different sources, and may contain one or several laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work|title=Definitions of Fact, Theory, and Law in Scientific Work|date=16 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common misconception is that scientific theories are rudimentary ideas that will eventually graduate into scientific laws when enough data and evidence have been accumulated. A theory does not change into a scientific law with the accumulation of new or better evidence. A theory will always remain a theory; a law will always remain a law.&lt;ref name=Matson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evolution.mbdojo.com/theory.html|title=Harding (1999).|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McComas2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. McComas|title=The Language of Science Education: An Expanded Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts in Science Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXzGBAAAQBAJ|date=30 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-497-0|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both theories and laws could potentially be falsified by countervailing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistry101/a/lawtheory.htm|title=What's the Difference Between a Scientific Hypothesis, Theory and Law?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories and laws are also distinct from [[hypothesis|hypotheses]]. Unlike hypotheses, theories and laws may be simply referred to as [[scientific fact]].&lt;ref name=gouldfact&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further examples are here [http://nationalacademies.org/evolution/TheoryOrFact.html], and in the article on [[Evolution as fact and theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in science, theories are different from facts even when they are well supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/evolution/education/theory-fact|title=Essay|website=ncse.com|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[evolution]] is both a [[Evolution as fact and theory|theory and a fact]].&lt;ref name="NAS2008"/&gt;

==About theories==

===Theories as axioms===
The [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] thought of scientific theories as statements in a [[formal language]]. First-order logic is an example of a formal language. The logical positivists envisaged a similar scientific language. In addition to scientific theories, the language also included observation sentences ("the sun rises in the east"), definitions, and mathematical statements. The phenomena explained by the theories, if they could not be directly observed by the senses (for example, [[atom]]s and [[radio waves]]), were treated as theoretical concepts. In this view, theories function as [[axioms]]: predicted observations are derived from the theories much like [[theorems]] are derived in [[Euclidean geometry]]. However, the predictions are then tested against reality to verify the theories, and the "axioms" can be revised as a direct result.

The phrase "[[received view of theories|the received view of theories]]" is used to describe this approach. Terms commonly associated with it are "[[linguistic]]" (because theories are components of a language) and "[[syntactic]]" (because a language has rules about how symbols can be strung together). Problems in defining this kind of language precisely, e.g., are objects seen in microscopes observed or are they theoretical objects, led to the effective demise of logical positivism in the 1970s.

===Theories as models===
{{main article|Scientific model}}

The [[semantic view of theories]], which identifies scientific theories with [[scientific model|models]] rather than [[proposition]]s, has replaced the received view as the dominant position in theory formulation in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suppe |first1=Frederick |year=1998 |title=Understanding Scientific Theories: An Assessment of Developments, 1969–1998 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=67 |pages=S102–S115 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/Suppe_2000.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/392812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halvorson |first1=Hans |year=2012 |title=What Scientific Theories Could Not Be |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=183–206 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/halvorson2012.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/664745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frigg |first1=Roman |year=2006 |title=Scientific Representation and the Semantic View of Theories |journal=Theoria |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=183–206 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2926/1/Scientific_Representation.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A model is a logical framework intended to represent reality (a "model of reality"), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country.&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian (1983). ''Representing and Intervening. Introductory Topics in the Philosophy of Natural Science''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Box, George E.P. &amp; Draper, N.R. (1987). ''Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces.'' Wiley. p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Perihelio.svg|thumb|right|[[Apsidal precession|Precession]] of the [[perihelion]] of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (exaggerated). The deviation in Mercury's position from the Newtonian prediction is about 43 [[Second of arc|arc-seconds]] (about two-thirds of 1/60 of a [[Degree (angle)|degree]]) per century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lorenzo Iorio|title=On the possibility of measuring the solar oblateness and some relativistic effects from planetary ranging|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20047155|year=2005|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=433|pages=385–93|arxiv=gr-qc/0406041|bibcode=2005A&amp;A...433..385I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myles Standish, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that fulfill the necessary criteria (see [[Scientific theory#Characteristics of theories|above]]). One can use language to describe a model; however, the theory is the model (or a collection of similar models), and not the description of the model. A model of the solar system, for example, might consist of abstract objects that represent the sun and the planets. These objects have associated properties, e.g., positions, velocities, and masses. The model parameters, e.g., Newton's Law of Gravitation, determine how the positions and velocities change with time. This model can then be tested to see whether it accurately predicts future observations; astronomers can verify that the positions of the model's objects over time match the actual positions of the planets. For most planets, the Newtonian model's predictions are accurate; for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], it is slightly inaccurate and the model of [[general relativity]] must be used instead.

The word "[[semantic]]" refers to the way that a model represents the real world. The representation (literally, "re-presentation") describes particular aspects of a phenomenon or the manner of interaction among a set of phenomena. For instance, a scale model of a house or of a solar system is clearly not an actual house or an actual solar system; the aspects of an actual house or an actual solar system represented in a scale model are, only in certain limited ways, representative of the actual entity. A scale model of a house is not a house; but to someone who wants to ''learn about'' houses, analogous to a scientist who wants to understand reality, a sufficiently detailed scale model may suffice.

====Differences between theory and model====
{{main article|Conceptual model}}
Several commentators&lt;ref&gt;For example, Reese &amp; Overto (1970); Lerner (1998); also Lerner &amp; Teti (2005), in the context of modeling human behavior.&lt;/ref&gt; have stated that the distinguishing characteristic of theories is that they are explanatory as well as descriptive, while models are only descriptive (although still predictive in a more limited sense). Philosopher [[Stephen Pepper]] also distinguished between theories and models, and said in 1948 that general models and theories are predicated on a "root" metaphor that constrains how scientists theorize and model a phenomenon and thus arrive at testable hypotheses.

Engineering practice makes a distinction between "mathematical models" and "physical models"; the cost of fabricating a physical model can be minimized by first creating a mathematical model using a computer software package, such as a [[computer aided design]] tool. The component parts are each themselves modelled, and the fabrication tolerances are specified. An [[exploded view drawing]] is used to lay out the fabrication sequence. Simulation packages for displaying each of the subassemblies allow the parts to be rotated, magnified, in realistic detail. Software packages for creating the bill of materials for construction allows subcontractors to specialize in assembly processes, which spreads the cost of manufacturing machinery among multiple customers. See: [[Computer-aided engineering]], [[Computer-aided manufacturing]], and [[3D printing]]

===Assumptions in formulating theories===
An assumption (or [[axiom]]) is a statement that is accepted without evidence. For example, assumptions can be used as premises in a logical argument. [[Isaac Asimov]] described assumptions as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...it is incorrect to speak of an assumption as either true or false, since there is no way of proving it to be either (If there were, it would no longer be an assumption). It is better to consider assumptions as either useful or useless, depending on whether deductions made from them corresponded to reality...Since we must start somewhere, we must have assumptions, but at least let us have as few assumptions as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Asimov, ''Understanding Physics'' (1966) pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Certain assumptions are necessary for all empirical claims (e.g. the assumption that [[reality]] exists). However, theories do not generally make assumptions in the conventional sense (statements accepted without evidence). While assumptions are often incorporated during the formation of new theories, these are either supported by evidence (such as from previously existing theories) or the evidence is produced in the course of validating the theory. This may be as simple as observing that the theory makes accurate predictions, which is evidence that any assumptions made at the outset are correct or approximately correct under the conditions tested.

Conventional assumptions, without evidence, may be used if the theory is only intended to apply when the assumption is valid (or approximately valid). For example, the [[special theory of relativity]] assumes an [[inertial frame of reference]]. The theory makes accurate predictions when the assumption is valid, and does not make accurate predictions when the assumption is not valid. Such assumptions are often the point with which older theories are succeeded by new ones (the [[general theory of relativity]] works in non-inertial reference frames as well).

The term "assumption" is actually broader than its standard use, etymologically speaking. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and online Wiktionary indicate its Latin source as ''assumere'' ("accept, to take to oneself, adopt, usurp"), which is a conjunction of ''ad-'' ("to, towards, at") and ''sumere'' (to take). The root survives, with shifted meanings, in the Italian ''assumere'' and Spanish ''sumir''. The first sense of "assume" in the OED is "to take unto (oneself), receive, accept, adopt". The term was originally employed in religious contexts as in "to receive up into heaven", especially "the reception of the Virgin Mary into heaven, with body preserved from corruption", (1297 CE) but it was also simply used to refer to "receive into association" or "adopt into partnership". Moreover, other senses of assumere included (i) "investing oneself with (an attribute)", (ii) "to undertake" (especially in Law), (iii) "to take to oneself in appearance only, to pretend to possess", and (iv) "to suppose a thing to be" (all senses from OED entry on "assume"; the OED entry for "assumption" is almost perfectly symmetrical in senses). Thus, "assumption" connotes other associations than the contemporary standard sense of "that which is assumed or taken for granted; a supposition, postulate" (only the 11th of 12 senses of "assumption", and the 10th of 11 senses of "assume").

==Descriptions==

===From philosophers of science===
[[Karl Popper]] described the characteristics of a scientific theory as follows:&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;[[Karl Popper|Popper, Karl]] (1963), ''Conjectures and Refutations'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, UK. Reprinted in [[Theodore Schick]] (ed., 2000), ''Readings in the Philosophy of Science'', Mayfield Publishing Company, Mountain View, Calif.&lt;/ref&gt;
# It is easy to obtain confirmations, or verifications, for nearly every theory—if we look for confirmations.
# Confirmations should count only if they are the result of risky predictions; that is to say, if, unenlightened by the theory in question, we should have expected an event which was incompatible with the theory—an event which would have refuted the theory.
# Every "good" scientific theory is a prohibition: it forbids certain things to happen. The more a theory forbids, the better it is.
# A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is non-scientific. Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory (as people often think) but a vice.
# Every genuine test of a theory is an attempt to falsify it, or to refute it. Testability is falsifiability; but there are degrees of testability: some theories are more testable, more exposed to refutation, than others; they take, as it were, greater risks.
# Confirming evidence should not count except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory; and this means that it can be presented as a serious but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory. (I now speak in such cases of "corroborating evidence".)
# Some genuinely testable theories, when found to be false, might still be upheld by their admirers—for example by introducing post hoc (after the fact) some [http://www.hu.mtu.edu/~tlockha/h3700hemp2.htm auxiliary hypothesis] or assumption, or by reinterpreting the theory post hoc in such a way that it escapes refutation. Such a procedure is always possible, but it rescues the theory from refutation only at the price of destroying, or at least lowering, its scientific status, by [[tampering with evidence]]. The temptation to tamper can be minimized by first taking the time to write down the testing protocol before embarking on the scientific work.

Popper summarized these statements by saying that the central criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its "falsifiability, or refutability, or testability".&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt; Echoing this, [[Stephen Hawking]] states, "A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements: It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations." He also discusses the "unprovable but falsifiable" nature of theories, which is a necessary consequence of inductive logic, and that "you can disprove a theory by finding even a single observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hawking, Stephen | title= A Brief History of Time | publisher=[[Bantam Books]] | year=1988 | isbn=0-553-38016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several philosophers and historians of science have, however, argued that Popper's definition of theory as a set of falsifiable statements is wrong&lt;ref&gt;Hempel.

Quine, W.V.O 1952 "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" reprinted in ''From a Logical Point of View''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; because, as [[Philip Kitcher]] has pointed out, if one took a strictly Popperian view of "theory", observations of Uranus when first discovered in 1781 would have "falsified" Newton's celestial mechanics. Rather, people suggested that another planet influenced Uranus' orbit—and this prediction was indeed eventually confirmed.

Kitcher agrees with Popper that "There is surely something right in the idea that a science can succeed only if it can fail."&lt;ref name=Kitcher&gt;Philip Kitcher 1982 ''Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism'', pp. 45–48. Cambridge: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; He also says that scientific theories include statements that cannot be falsified, and that good theories must also be creative. He insists we view scientific theories as an "elaborate collection of statements", some of which are not falsifiable, while others—those he calls "auxiliary hypotheses", are.

According to Kitcher, good scientific theories must have three features:&lt;ref name=Kitcher/&gt;
# Unity: "A science should be unified…. Good theories consist of just one problem-solving strategy, or a small family of problem-solving strategies, that can be applied to a wide range of problems."
# [[Fecundity]]: "A great scientific theory, like Newton's, opens up new areas of research…. Because a theory presents a new way of looking at the world, it can lead us to ask new questions, and so to embark on new and fruitful lines of inquiry…. Typically, a flourishing science is incomplete. At any time, it raises more questions than it can currently answer. But incompleteness is not vice. On the contrary, incompleteness is the mother of fecundity…. A good theory should be productive; it should raise new questions and presume those questions can be answered without giving up its problem-solving strategies."
# [http://www.hu.mtu.edu/~tlockha/h3700hemp2.htm Auxiliary hypotheses] that are independently testable: "An auxiliary hypothesis ought to be testable independently of the particular problem it is introduced to solve, independently of the theory it is designed to save." (For example, the evidence for the existence of Neptune is independent of the anomalies in Uranus's orbit.)

Like other definitions of theories, including Popper's, Kitcher makes it clear that a theory must include statements that have observational consequences. But, like the observation of irregularities in the orbit of Uranus, falsification is only one possible consequence of observation. The production of new hypotheses is another possible and equally important result.

===Analogies and metaphors===
The concept of a scientific theory has also been described using analogies and metaphors. For instance, the logical empiricist [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] likened the structure of a scientific theory to a "complex spatial network:"

&lt;blockquote&gt; Its terms are represented by the knots, while the threads connecting the latter correspond, in part, to the definitions and, in part, to the fundamental and derivative hypotheses included in the theory. The whole system floats, as it were, above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by the rules of interpretation. These might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation. By virtue of these interpretive connections, the network can function as a scientific theory: From certain observational data, we may ascend, via an interpretive string, to some point in the theoretical network, thence proceed, via definitions and hypotheses, to other points, from which another interpretive string permits a descent to the plane of observation.&lt;ref&gt;Hempel CG 1952. ''Fundamentals of Concept Formation in Empirical Science.'' (Volume 2, #7 of ''Foundations of the Unity of Science. Toward an International Encyclopedia of Unified Science''). University of Chicago Press, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Michael Polanyi]] made an analogy between a theory and a map:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A theory is something other than myself. It may be set out on paper as a system of rules, and it is the more truly a theory the more completely it can be put down in such terms. Mathematical theory reaches the highest perfection in this respect. But even a geographical map fully embodies in itself a set of strict rules for finding one's way through a region of otherwise uncharted experience. Indeed, all theory may be regarded as a kind of map extended over space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi M. 1958. ''Personal Knowledge. Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A scientific theory can also be thought of as a book that captures the fundamental information about the world, a book that must be researched, written, and shared. In 1623, [[Galileo Galilei]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Philosophy [i.e. physics] is written in this grand book—I mean the universe—which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth.&lt;ref&gt;Galileo Galilei, ''The Assayer'', as translated by [[Stillman Drake]] (1957), ''Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo'' pp. 237–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book metaphor could also be applied in the following passage, by the contemporary philosopher of science [[Ian Hacking]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I myself prefer an Argentine fantasy. God did not write a Book of Nature of the sort that the old Europeans imagined. He wrote a Borgesian library, each book of which is as brief as possible, yet each book of which is inconsistent with every other. No book is redundant. For every book there is some humanly accessible bit of Nature such that that book, and no other, makes possible the comprehension, prediction and influencing of what is going on…Leibniz said that God chose a world which maximized the variety of phenomena while choosing the simplest laws. Exactly so: but the best way to maximize phenomena and have simplest laws is to have the laws inconsistent with each other, each applying to this or that but none applying to all.&lt;ref&gt;Hacking I. 1983. ''Representing and Intervening.'' Cambridge University Press, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In physics==
In [[physics]], the term ''theory'' is generally used for a mathematical framework—derived from a small set of basic [[postulates]] (usually symmetries—like equality of locations in space or in time, or identity of electrons, etc.)—that is capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category of physical systems. A good example is [[classical electromagnetism]], which encompasses results derived from [[gauge symmetry]] (sometimes called [[gauge invariance]]) in a form of a few equations called [[Maxwell's equations]]. The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed "laws of electromagnetism," reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them. Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations. Many of these hypotheses are already considered to be adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested. An example of the latter might be the [[radiation reaction force]]. As of 2009, its effects on the periodic motion of charges are detectable in [[synchrotron]]s, but only as ''averaged'' effects over time. Some researchers are now considering experiments that could observe these effects at the instantaneous level (i.e. not averaged over time).&lt;ref&gt;Koga J and Yamagiwa M (2006). [http://epsppd.epfl.ch/Roma/pdf/P1_031.pdf Radiation reaction effects in ultrahigh irradiance laser pulse interactions with multiple electrons.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PHPAEN000013000011113106000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes&amp;ref=no ]{{dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Note that many fields of inquiry do not have specific named theories, e.g. [[developmental biology]]. Scientific knowledge outside a named theory can still have a high level of certainty, depending on the amount of evidence supporting it. Also note that since theories draw evidence from many different fields, the categorization is not absolute.

{{Sociology}}
'''Social construction of technology''' (also referred to as '''SCOT''') is a theory within the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]]. Advocates of SCOT—that is, [[Social constructionism|social constructivists]]—argue that technology does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapes technology. They also argue that the ways a technology is used cannot be understood without understanding how that technology is embedded in its social context. SCOT is a response to [[technological determinism]] and is sometimes known as technological constructivism.

SCOT draws on work done in the constructivist school of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], and its subtopics include [[actor-network theory]]  (a branch of the [[sociology of science and technology]]) and historical analysis of sociotechnical systems, such as the work of historian [[Thomas P. Hughes]]. Its empirical methods are an adaptation of the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR), which outlines a method of analysis to demonstrate the ways in which scientific findings are socially constructed (see [[strong program]]). Leading adherents of SCOT include [[Wiebe Bijker]] and [[Trevor Pinch]].

SCOT holds that those who seek to understand the reasons for acceptance or rejection of a technology should look to the social world. It is not enough, according to SCOT, to explain a technology's success by saying that it is "the best"—researchers must look at how the criteria of being "the best" is defined and what groups and stakeholders participate in defining it. In particular, they must ask who defines the technical criteria success is measured by, why technical criteria are defined this way, and who is included or excluded.  Pinch and Bijker argue that technological determinism is a myth that results when one looks backwards and believes that the path taken to the present was the only possible path.

SCOT is not only a theory, but also a methodology: it formalizes the steps and principles to follow when one wants to analyze the causes of technological failures or successes.

==Legacy of the Strong Programme in the sociology of science==

At the point of its conception, the SCOT approach was partly motivated by the ideas of the [[strong programme]] in the sociology of science (Bloor 1973). In their seminal article, Pinch and Bijker refer to the ''Principle of Symmetry'' as the most influential tenet of the Sociology of Science, which should be applied in historical and sociological investigations of technology as well. It is strongly connected to Bloor's theory of social causation.

===Symmetry===

The ''Principle of Symmetry'' holds that in explaining the origins of scientific beliefs, that is, assessing the success and failure of models, theories, or experiments, the historian/sociologist should deploy the same ''kind'' of explanation in the cases of success as in cases of failure. When investigating beliefs, researchers should be impartial to the (''[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]'' attributed) truth or falsehood of those beliefs, and the explanations should be unbiased. The strong programme adopts a position of relativism or neutralism regarding the arguments that social actors put forward for the acceptance/rejection of any technology.  All arguments (social, cultural, political, economic, as well as technical) are to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;Palacios, EM García, et al. "Introdução aos estudos CTS (Ciência, Tecnologia e Sociedade)." Cadernos de Ibero America (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The symmetry principle addresses the problem that the historian is tempted to explain the success of successful theories by referring to their "objective truth", or inherent "technical superiority", whereas s/he is more likely to put forward sociological explanations (citing political influence or economic reasons) only in the case of failures. For example, having experienced the obvious success of the chain-driven bicycle for decades, it is tempting to attribute its success to its "advanced technology" compared to the "primitiveness" of the [[Penny farthing|Penny Farthing]], but if we look closely and symmetrically at their history (as Pinch and Bijker do), we can see that at the beginning bicycles were valued according to quite different standards than nowadays. The early adopters (predominantly young, well-to-do gentlemen) valued the speed, the thrill, and the spectacularity of the Penny Farthing – in contrast to the security and stability of the chain-driven [[History of the bicycle|Safety Bicycle]]. Many other social factors (e.g., the contemporary state of urbanism and transport, women's clothing habits and feminism) have influenced and changed the relative valuations of bicycle models.

A weak reading of the ''Principle of Symmetry'' points out that there often are many competing theories or technologies, which all have the potential to provide slightly different solutions to similar problems. In these cases, sociological factors tip the balance between them: that's why we should pay equal attention to them.

A strong, social constructivist reading would add that even the emergence of the questions or problems to be solved are governed by social determinations, so the Principle of Symmetry is applicable even to the apparently purely technical issues.

== Core concepts ==

The following concepts and 'stages' of SCOT are adapted from the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR).&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, Trevor J. and Wiebe E. Bijker.  "The Social Construction of Facts and Artefacts: Or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology Might Benefit Each Other."  ''Social Studies of Science'' 14 (August 1984): 399-441.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretative flexibility===
''Interpretative flexibility'' means that each technological artifact has different meanings and interpretations for various groups. Bijker and Pinch show that the air tire of the bicycle meant a more convenient mode of transportation for some people, whereas it meant technical nuisances, traction problems and ugly [[aesthetics]] to others. In racing air tires lent to greater speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/bijker2.pdf | title=The Social Constructions of Technological Systems | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | editor1=Wiebe E. Bijker | editor2= Thomas P. Hughes |editor3=Trevor Pinch |year=1987|isbn=0-262-02262-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alternative interpretations generate different ''problems'' to be solved. How should aesthetics, convenience, and speed be prioritized? What is the "best" tradeoff between traction and speed?

====Relevant social groups====
The most basic relevant groups are the ''users'' and the ''producers'' of the technological artifact, but most often many subgroups can be delineated – users with different socioeconomic status, competing producers, etc. Sometimes there are relevant groups who are neither users, nor producers of the technology, for example, journalists, politicians, and civil organizations. [[Trevor Pinch]] has argued that the salespeople of technology should also be included in the study of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinch|first=Trevor|title=How Users Matter: The Co-Construction of Users and Technology|year=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-15107-3|pages=247–269|authorlink=Trevor Pinch|editor=Nelly Oudshoorn and Trevor Pinch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The groups can be distinguished based on their shared or diverging interpretations of the technology in question.

====Design flexibility====
Just as technologies have different meanings in different social groups, there are always multiple ways of constructing technologies. A particular design is only a single point in the large field of technical possibilities, reflecting the interpretations of certain relevant groups.

====Problems and conflicts====
The different interpretations often give rise to conflicts between criteria that are hard to resolve technologically (e.g., in the case of the bicycle, one such problem was how a woman could ride the bicycle in a skirt while still adhering to standards of decency), or conflicts between the relevant groups (the "Anti-cyclists" lobbied for the banning of the bicycles). Different groups in different societies construct different problems, leading to different designs.

The first stage of the SCOT research methodology is to reconstruct the alternative interpretations of the technology, analyze the problems and conflicts these interpretations give rise to, and connect them to the design features of the technological artifacts. The relations between groups, problems, and designs can be visualized in diagrams.

===Closure&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Closure]] --&gt;===
Over time, as technologies are developed, the interpretative and design flexibility collapse through closure mechanisms. Two examples of closure mechanisms:

#'''Rhetorical closure''': When social groups ''see'' the problem as being solved, the need for alternative designs diminishes. This is often the result of advertising.
#'''Redefinition of the problem''': A design standing in the focus of conflicts can be stabilized by using it to solve a different, new problem, which ends up being solved by this very design. As an example, the aesthetic and technical problems of the air tire diminished, as the technology advanced to the stage where air tire bikes started to win the bike races. Tires were still considered cumbersome and ugly, but they provided a solution to the "speed problem", and this overrode previous concerns.

Closure is not permanent.  New social groups may form and reintroduce interpretative flexibility, causing a new round of debate or conflict about a technology. (For instance, in the 1890s automobiles were seen as the "green" alternative, a cleaner environmentally-friendly technology, to horse-powered vehicles; by the 1960s, new social groups had introduced new interpretations about the environmental effects of the automobile, eliciting the opposite conclusion.)

The second stage of the SCOT methodology is to show how closure is achieved.

===Relating the content of the technological artifact to the wider sociopolitical milieu===
This is the third stage of the SCOT methodology, but the seminal article of Pinch and Bijker does not proceed to this stage. Many other historians and sociologists of technology nevertheless do. For example, Paul N. Edwards shows in his book "The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America | publisher=The MIT Press | author=Paul N. Edwards | year=1997 | isbn=978-0262550284 | series=Inside Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; the strong relations between the political discourse of the Cold War and the computer designs of this era.

==Criticism==
In 1993, [[Langdon Winner]] published an influential critique of SCOT entitled "Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|title=Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology|journal=Science, Technology, and Human Values|date=Summer 1993|volume=18|issue=3|pages=362–378|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/openingblackbox.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, he argues that social constructivism is an overly narrow research program. He identifies the following specific limitations in social constructivism:
# It explains how technologies arise, but ignores the consequences of the technologies after the fact. This results in a sociology that says nothing about how such technologies matter in the broader context.
# It examines social groups and interests that contribute to the construction of technology, but ignores those who have no voice in the process, yet are affected by it. Likewise, when documenting technological contingencies and choices, it fails to account for those options that never made it to the table. According to Winner, this results in conservative and elitist sociology.
# It is superficial in that it focuses on how the immediate needs, interests, problems and solutions of chosen social groups influence technological choice, but disregards any possible deeper cultural, intellectual or economic origins of social choices concerning technology.
# It actively avoids taking any kind of moral stance or passing judgment on the relative merits of the alternative interpretations of a technology. This indifference makes it unhelpful in addressing important debates about the place of technology in human affairs.
Other critics include [[Stewart Russell]] with his letter in the journal "[[Social Studies of Science]]" titled "The Social Construction of Artifacts: A Response to Pinch and Bijker".

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''social effects of evolutionary thought''' have been considerable.  As the scientific explanation of life's diversity has developed, it has often displaced alternative, sometimes very widely held, explanations. Because the theory of [[evolution]] includes an explanation of humanity's origins, it has had a profound impact on human [[society|societies]]. Some have vigorously denied acceptance of the scientific explanation due to its perceived religious implications (e.g. its implied rejection of the [[special creation]] of humans presumably described in the [[Bible]]). This has led to a vigorous conflict between [[creation and evolution in public education]], primarily in the United States.

==Evolution and ethics==
The theory of evolution by natural selection has also been adopted as a foundation for various ethical and social systems, such as [[social Darwinism]], an idea that preceded the publication of &lt;cite&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/cite&gt;, popular in the 19th century, which holds that "the [[survival of the fittest]]" (a phrase coined in 1851 by Herbert Spencer, 6 years before Darwin published his theory of evolution) explains and justifies differences in wealth and success among societies and people. A similar interpretation was one created by Darwin's cousin, [[Francis Galton]], known as [[eugenics]], which claimed that human civilization was subverting natural selection by allowing the less bright and less healthy to survive and out-breed the more smart and more healthy.

Later advocates of this theory suggested radical and often coercive social measures in an attempt to "correct" this imbalance. [[Thomas Huxley]] spent much time demonstrating through a series of thought experiments that it would not only be immoral, but impossible,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2940 Evolution and Ethics by Thomas Henry Huxley]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and others have argued that social Darwinism is based on misconceptions of evolutionary theory, and many ethicists regard it as a case of the [[is-ought problem]]. After the atrocities of [[the Holocaust]] became linked with eugenics, it greatly fell out of favor with public and scientific opinion, though it was never universally accepted by either, and at no point in Nazi literature is Charles Darwin or the scientific theory of evolution mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/darwin_nazism.htm The fallacious nature of [[reductio ad Hitlerum]] arguments by anti-evolutionists.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=January 2015}}

In his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] argues that Nazism was largely a continuation of [[Christian anti-Semitism]]. Jim Walker compiled a list of 129 quotes from [[Mein Kampf]] in which Hitler described himself as a Christian, or mentioned God, Jesus or a biblical passage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitler.htm Webpage containing 129 Mein Kampf quotes relating to his Christianity]&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=January 2015}} argue that six million of the people killed during the Holocaust were killed because of their religion (Judaism) not their race, "strength," or any reason with an obvious link to the mechanism of Darwinian evolution. Hitler often used Christian beliefs like, "Jews killed Jesus," to justify his anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitlerchristian.htm Religion and Hitler - a history]&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that humans share ancestors with other animals has also affected how some people view the relationship between humans and other species. Many proponents of [[animal rights]] hold that if animals and humans are of the same nature, then rights cannot be distinct to humans.

Charles Darwin, in fact, &lt;!-- himself was an abolitionist who --&gt; considered "[[sympathy]]" to be one of the most important [[Ethics|moral virtues]] — and that it was, indeed, a product of natural selection and a trait beneficial to social animals (including [[homo sapiens|humans]]). Darwin further argued that the most "sympathetic" societies would consequently be the most "successful." He also stated that our sympathy should be extended to "all sentient beings":

{{quote|As man advances in civilization, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unknown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races. If, indeed, such men are separated from him by great differences in appearance or habits, experience unfortunately shows us how long it is, before we look at them as our fellow-creatures. ... This virtue, one of the noblest with which man is endowed, seems to arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming more tender and more widely diffused, until they are extended to all sentient beings. As soon as this virtue is honored and practiced by some few men, it spreads through instruction and example to the young, and eventually becomes incorporated in public opinion.|source=Charles Darwin; ''The Descent of Man'', 1871}}

===Thomas Huxley: Evolution and Ethics===
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=May 2009}}
{{Essay-like|date=September 2013}}
[[Thomas Huxley]], ''Darwin's Bulldog'', spent much of his book [[Evolution and Ethics]] debunking Social Darwinism, piece by piece. The following is a summary of his arguments in the ''Prolegomena'', the most detailed and comprehensive of the two sections devoted to it. It should be noted that Huxley is here attempting to disprove the science behind Social Darwinism; as such, the moral arguments only come in later in the essay.

Consider a garden. Without constant upkeep, it would return to the ''state of nature'', even the very walls surrounding it crumbling in sufficient time, but by constant diligence of the gardener, may be maintained in a ''state of art''. This "state of art" is not permanent: It is instead the replacement of natural selection by artificial selection through the human energy expended in maintaining it.

This artificial selection is, however, part of natural selection: It is the action upon a set of species by the human species by way of the human species expending energy through evolved intelligence on its choice of selection. It is thus no less natural than, for example, a predator expending energy through evolved instinct on preferentially hunting a certain prey species. The presence of humans may change the dynamic, but in a perfectly natural way. Hence, it is part of the ''cosmic process'', that is natural laws, even though the "histological process" may remove many aspects of the "struggle for existence" that is a key part of the natural laws that apply to biology, from its preferred plant species by substituting human work for work done by the species itself.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Not only is the state of nature hostile to the state of art of the garden; but the principle of the horticultural process, by which the latter is created and maintained, is antithetic to that of the cosmic process. The characteristic feature of the latter is the intense and unceasing competition of the struggle for existence. The characteristic of the former is the elimination of that struggle, by the removal of the conditions which give rise to it. The tendency of the cosmic process is to bring about the adjustment of the forms of plant life to the current conditions; the tendency of the horticultural process is the adjustment of the conditions to the needs of the forms of plant life which the gardener desires to raise.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nature uses unrestricted breeding to let hundreds compete for the natural resources that would only support one, and uses frost and drought to kill off the weak and unlucky, requiring not just strength, but "flexibility and good fortune." However, a gardener restricts multiplication, gives each plant sufficient space and nourishment,  protects from frost and drought&amp;mdash;and, in every other way, attempts to modify the conditions to benefit the forms that most nearly approach the result he desires. However, though the gardener's actions may have circumvented natural selection, he can still improve the species, should he find them wanting, through selective breeding. The struggle for existence is not actually required for improvement: only heritability, variation, and some form of selective pressure.

Can we then apply this to humans? Let's see how far we can take the analogy with respect to colonization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose a shipload of English colonists sent to form a settlement, in such a country as Tasmania was in the middle of the last century. On landing, they find themselves in the midst of a state of nature, widely different from that left behind them in everything but the most general physical conditions. The common plants, the common birds and quadrupeds, are as totally distinct as the men from anything to be seen on the side of the globe from which they come. The colonists proceed to put an end to this state of things over as large an area as they desire to occupy.  They clear away the native vegetation, extirpate or drive out the animal population, so far as may be necessary, and take measures to defend themselves from the re-immigration of either. In their place, they introduce English grain and fruit trees; English dogs, sheep, cattle, horses; and English men; in fact, they set up a new Flora and Fauna and a new variety of mankind, within the old state of nature. Their farms and pastures represent a garden on a great scale, and themselves the gardeners who have to keep it up, in watchful antagonism to the old regime. Considered as a whole, the colony is a composite unit introduced into the old state of nature; and, thenceforward, a competitor in the struggle for existence, to conquer or be vanquished.

Under the conditions supposed, there is no doubt of the result, if the work of the colonists be carried out energetically and with intelligent combination of all their forces. On the other hand, if they are slothful, stupid, and careless; or if they waste their energies in contests with one another, the chances are that the old state of nature will have the best of it. The native savage will destroy the immigrant civilized man; of the English animals and plants some will be extirpated by their indigenous rivals, others will pass into the feral state and themselves become components of the state of nature. In a few decades, all other traces of the settlement will have vanished.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, as yet we lack an organized gardener. Let us imagine an idealized one: an administrative authority of intelligence and foresight as much greater than men as men are to their livestock. The unwanted native species - men, animals, or plants - are all weeded out and destroyed. Those to replace them are chosen with a view to his ideal of the colony, just as a gardener tries to create through his selection his ideal garden. And, finally, to ensure that no struggle for existence between the colonists interferes with the struggle against nature, he provides them with sufficient food, housing, and so on. "With every step of this progress in civilization, the colonists would become more and more independent of the state of nature; more and more, their lives would be conditioned by a state of art. In order to attain his ends, the administrator would have to avail himself of the courage, industry, and co-operative intelligence of the settlers; and it is plain that the interest of the community would be best served by increasing the proportion of persons who possess such qualities, and diminishing that of persons devoid of them. In other words, by selection directed towards an ideal."

However, though this might create a paradise where every aspect of nature works to support its colonists, problems arise: "as soon as the colonists began to multiply, the administrator would have to face the tendency to the reintroduction of the cosmic struggle into his artificial fabric, in consequence of the competition, not merely for the commodities, but for the means of existence. When the colony reached the limit of possible expansion, the surplus population must be disposed of somehow; or the fierce struggle for existence must recommence and destroy that peace, which is the fundamental condition of the maintenance of the state of art against the state of nature.

If the administrator is guided purely by scientific considerations, he would work to restrict the population by removing "the hopelessly diseased, the infirm aged, the weak or deformed in body or in mind, and the excess of infants born," just as a "gardener pulls up defective and superfluous plants, or the breeder
destroys undesirable cattle. Only the strong and the healthy, carefully matched, with a view to the progeny best adapted to the purposes of the administrator, would be permitted to perpetuate their kind."

And so we have reached Social Darwinism. However, we do not have an idealized administrator:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the more thoroughgoing of the multitudinous attempts to apply the principles of cosmic evolution, or what are supposed to be such, to social and political problems, which have appeared of late years, a considerable proportion appear to me to be based upon the notion that human society is competent to furnish, from its own resources, an administrator of the kind I have imagined. The pigeons, in short, are to be their own [[Sir John Sebright]]. A despotic government, whether individual or collective, is to be endowed with the preternatural intelligence, and with what, I am afraid, many will consider the preternatural ruthlessness, required for the purpose of carrying out the principle of improvement by selection, with the somewhat drastic thoroughness upon which the success of the method depends.  Experience certainly does not justify us in limiting the ruthlessness of individual "saviors of society"; and, on the well-known grounds of the aphorism which denies both body and soul to corporations, it seems probable (indeed the belief is not without support in history) that a collective despotism, a mob got to believe in its own divine right by demagogic missionaries, would be capable of more thorough work in this direction than any single tyrant, puffed up with the same illusion, has ever achieved.  But intelligence is another affair. The fact that "saviors of society" take to that trade is evidence enough that they have none to spare. And such as they possess is generally sold to the capitalists of physical force on whose resources they depend. However, I doubt whether even the keenest judge of character, if he had before him a hundred boys and girls under fourteen, could pick out, with the least chance of success, those who should be kept, as certain to be serviceable members of the polity, and those who should be chloroformed, as equally sure to be stupid, idle, or vicious. The "points" of a good or of a bad citizen are really far harder to discern than those of a puppy or a short-horn calf; many do not show themselves before the practical difficulties of life stimulate manhood to full exertion. And by that time the mischief is done. The evil stock, if it be one, has had time to multiply, and selection is nullified.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, humans are not cattle, nor flowers: the organization of human society is kept together by
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...bonds of such a singular character, that the attempt to perfect society after his fashion would run serious risk of loosening them. They do not even correspond to social insects such as bees: With bees, "The members of the society are each organically predestined to the performance of one particular class of functions only. If they were endowed with desires, each could desire to perform none but those offices for which its organization specially fits it; and which, in view of the good of the whole, it is proper it should do. Among mankind, on the contrary, there is no such predestination to a sharply defined place in the social organism. However much men may differ in the quality of their intellects, the intensity of their passions, and the delicacy of their sensations, it cannot be said that one is fitted by his organization to be an agricultural laborer and nothing else, and another to be a landowner and nothing else. Moreover, with all their enormous differences in natural endowment, men agree in one thing, and that is their innate desire to enjoy the pleasures and to escape the pains of life; and, in short, to do nothing but that which it pleases them to do, without the least reference to the welfare of the society into which they are born, checked only by sympathy, familial and social bonds, and fear of the judgment of ones fellow man. "Every forward step of social progress brings men into closer relations with their fellows, and increases the importance of the pleasures and pains derived from sympathy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In short, he describes a creation of morality.

Since morality is what keeps the desire for selfishness in check, it is necessary to the propagation of society, with one requirement: the punishment of wrongdoers being necessary for the continuation of society, self-restraint must not be taken so far that wrongdoers may act unrestrained: Without the protection of society against them, "The followers of the "golden rule" may indulge in hopes of heaven, but they must reckon with the certainty that other people will be masters of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley credits Hartley (Observations on Man (1749), vol. ii p. 281.) for not only having "...laid the foundations but built up much of the superstructure of a true theory of the Evolution of the intellectual and moral faculties and for having realized that the creation of civilization will in itself create ethics, if not in an evolutionary context." as well as [[Adam Smith]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley sums up this section of his argument against Social Darwinism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have further shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the horticulturist and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part in the evolution of society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huxley finishes with a series of short, further evidences against Social Darwinism, including:

* Historical evidences against: Consider the vast changes of society between the Tudor and the Victorian eras; however, human nature, as evidenced by their writing, remains the same. "In my belief, the innate qualities, physical, intellectual, and moral, of our nation have remained substantially the same for the last four or five centuries. If the struggle for existence has affected us to any serious extent (and I doubt it) it has been, indirectly, through our military and industrial wars with other nations."
* Whether some qualities are virtues or vices depends on circumstance: "The benevolence and open-handed generosity which adorn a rich man, may make a pauper of a poor one; the energy and courage to which the successful soldier owes his rise, the cool and daring subtlety to which the great financier owes his fortune, may very easily, under unfavorable conditions, lead their possessors to the gallows, or to the hulks. Moreover, it is fairly probable that the children of a "failure" will receive from their other parent just that little modification of character which makes all the difference. I sometimes wonder whether people, who talk so freely about extirpating the unfit, ever dispassionately consider their own history. Surely, one must be very "fit," indeed, not to know of an occasion, or perhaps two, in one's life, when it would have been only too easy to qualify for a place among the "unfit.""

&lt;!--Have skipped the struggle for means of enjoyment argument, as it is almost impossible to summarize--&gt;

==Evolution and religion==
{{See also|History of evolutionary thought}}

Before Darwin's argument and presentation of the evidence for evolution, Western [[religion]]s generally discounted or condemned any claims that diversity of life is the result of an evolutionary process, as did most scientists in the English scientific establishment. However, evolution was accepted by some religious groups such as the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church and the liberal [[Anglican]] theologians who went on to publish ''[[Essays and Reviews]]''. as well as by many scientists in [[France]] and [[Scotland]] and some in [[England]], notably [[Robert Edmund Grant]]. Literal or authoritative interpretations of [[sacred text|Scripture]] hold that a [[God|supreme being]] directly created humans and other animals as separate ''[[Created kind]]s'', which to some means species. This view is commonly referred to as [[creationism]]. From the 1920s to the present in the US, there has been a strong religious backlash to the teaching of evolution theory, particularly by conservative [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]]. They have expressed concerns about the effects of the teaching of evolution on society and their faith (see [[Creation-evolution controversy]]).

In response to the wide scientific acceptance of the theory of evolution, many religions have formally or informally synthesized the scientific and religious viewpoints. Several important 20th century scientists ([[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]]) whose work confirmed Darwin's theory, were also [[Christianity|Christians]] who saw no incompatibility between their experimental and theoretical confirmations of evolution and their faith. Some religions have adopted a [[Evolutionary creationism|theistic evolution]] viewpoint, where God provides a [[divine spark]] that ignited the process of evolution and (or), where God has guided evolution in one way or another.

===Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church===

{{main|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]], beginning in 1950 with [[Pope Pius XII]]'s encyclical [[Humani generis|Humani Generis]], took up a neutral position with regard to evolution. "The Church does not forbid that...research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 22, 1996, address to the [[Pontifical Academy of Science]], [[Pope John Paul II]] updated the Church's position, recognizing that Evolution is "more than a hypothesis" - "In his encyclical Humani Generis, my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation... Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP961022.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic views on Evolution===

Classical figures have not discussed the subject as it has only come up in the 19th century. Contemporaries have come up with several distinct stances. One stance is that adaptation, or evolution on a micro scale, is accepted within a species, but cross-species evolution, that is evolution from one species into another species, is not as the human beginning is considered to be miraculous. However, this traditional thought would not conflict with the view that human-like beings could have been created around the same time as human beings, which, in this view, would explain the fossil records that look human but are not. Another stance is that since evolution is the simplest explanation it is the most reasonable to accept under the condition that it is not random but occurs only with the permission of God every step of the way. One particular argument that supports the idea that evolution is possible is the one stating that in that the stages of human development in evolution are akin to the distinct stages of development acknowledged in the Koran.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The final stance completely rejects cross-species evolution across all organisms, but approves of adaptation (micro evolution).

===Jewish views on evolution===

==Evolutionary theory and the political left==
{{Undue weight section|date=September 2011}}

Many important political figures on the left have never publicized their views on [[biology]], and so their opinions of evolutionary theory are unknown. To some extent, [[Marxist]]s are the exception. [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] supported Darwin's evolutionary theory. Marx even sent Darwin a copy of his book ''[[Das Kapital]]'', though Darwin never wrote back to him. Karl Marx's work was based on a material view of the world that showed natural causes and effects for all aspects of human society and economy. He recognized that Darwin's work provided a similar material explanation for all of nature, thus supporting Marx's worldview.

In 1861 Karl Marx wrote to his friend Ferdinand Lassalle, "Darwin’s work is most important and suits my purpose in that it provides a basis in natural science for the historical class struggle. ... Despite all shortcomings, it is here that, for the first time, 'teleology' in natural science is not only dealt a mortal blow but its rational meaning is empirically explained."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marx &amp; Engels Collected Works|volume=41|pages=246-247|chapter=Letter to F. Lassalle in Berlin. London, 16 January 1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most later Marxists agreed with this view, but some – particularly those in the early [[Soviet Union]] – believed that evolutionary theory conflicted with their economic and social ideals. As a result, they came to support [[Lamarckism]] instead – the idea that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring. This led to the practice of [[Lysenkoism]], which caused agricultural problems.

In his book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] argued that co-operation and mutual aid are as important in the evolution of the species as competition and mutual strife, if not more so.

On the contemporary moderate left, some authors such as [[Peter Singer]] (in his book, ''[[A Darwinian Left]]'') support Darwinism but reach different political and economic lessons than more conservative observers. Richard Dawkins' book, ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', has a chapter, "Nice guys finish first," that attempts to explain the role of altruism and cooperation in evolution and how social animals not only cannot survive without such traits, but how evolution will create them. Dawkins explains that when an animal sacrifices itself or uses its resources for the survival of other members of the same species, its genes, present on the other animals, survive. For example, if a mother dies to save three of its pups, one and a half copies (on average) of its genes will survive, because there is a 50% chance of a particular gene being present in its offspring. Dawkins also made a documentary of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzeCn02l_Rw Nice guys finish first]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the documentary, Dawkins added that chapter as a way of overcoming modern day misinterpretations of the concept of ''survival of the fittest''.

==Evolution in relation to Social Darwinism and Imperialism==

"[[Social Darwinism]]" is a derogatory term associated with the 19th century [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] theory developed by [[British Whig Party|Whig]] philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]]. It is associated with evolutionary theory but now widely regarded as unwarranted. Social Darwinism was later expanded by others into ideas about "[[survival of the fittest]]" in commerce and human societies as a whole, and led to claims that [[social inequality]], [[sexism]], [[racism]] and [[imperialism]] were justified.&lt;ref&gt;On the history of [[eugenics]] and evolution, see {{cite book|authorlink=Daniel Kevles |first=D |last=Kevles |year=1998 |title=In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity |publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-44557-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these ideas contradict [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s own views, and contemporary scientists and philosophers consider these ideas to be neither mandated by evolutionary theory nor supported by data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] strongly disagreed with attempts by Herbert Spencer and others to extrapolate evolutionary ideas to all possible subjects; see {{cite book|authorlink=Mary Midgley|first=M|last=Midgley|year=2004|title=The Myths we Live By|publisher=Routledge|page=62|isbn=978-0-415-34077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Allhoff F |title=Evolutionary ethics from Darwin to Moore |journal=History and philosophy of the life sciences |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=51–79 |year=2003 |pmid=15293515 |doi=10.1080/03919710312331272945 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gowaty, Patricia Adair |title=Feminism and evolutionary biology: boundaries, intersections, and frontiers |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |location=London |year=1997 |isbn=0-412-07361-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Darwinism is further linked with [[nationalism]] and imperialism.&lt;ref name="Marvin Perry"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perry |first1=Marvin |last2=Chase |first2=Myrna |last3=Jacob |first3=Margaret |last4=Jacob |first4=James |last5=Daly |first5=Jonathan W. |last6=Von Laue |first6=Theodore H. |year=2014 |title=Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jy5BBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA634&amp;lpg=PA634 |volume=Volume II: Since 1600 |edition=11th |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |pages=634–635 |isbn=978-1-305-09142-9 |lccn=2014943347 |oclc=898154349 |quote=The most extreme ideological expression of nationalism and imperialism was Social Darwinism. In the popular mind, the concepts of evolution justified the exploitation by the 'superior races' of 'lesser breeds without the law.'

Social Darwinists vigorously advocated empires, saying that strong nations—by definition, those that were successful at expanding industry and empire—would survive and others would not. To these elitists, all white peoples were more fit than nonwhites to prevail in the struggle for dominance. Even among Europeans, some nations were deemed more fit than others for the competition. Usually, Social Darwinists thought their own nation the best, an attitude that sparked their competitive enthusiasm. ...In the nineteenth century, in contrast to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Europeans, except for missionaries, rarely adopted the customs or learned the languages of local people. They had little sense that other cultures and other peoples deserved respect. Many Westerners believed that it was their Christian duty to set an example and to educate others. Missionaries were the first to meet and learn about many peoples and the first to develop writing for those without a written language.

'''São Carlos''' (Saint Charles, in English, {{IPA-pt|sɐ̃w̃ ˈkaʁlus}}; named after [[Charles Borromeo|Saint Charles Borromeo]]) is a city of 246,088&lt;ref name="IBGE" /&gt; inhabitants ([[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]/2017) in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. It is located at {{coord|22|01|04|S|47|53|27|W|}}, at about 230&amp;nbsp;km from the city of [[São Paulo]].

==History==
The region started to be settled in the end of the 18th century, with the opening of a road that led to the gold mines in [[Cuiabá]] and [[Goiás]]. Leaving from [[Piracicaba]], passing through [[Rio Claro, São Paulo|Rio Claro]], the hills, fields and by typical vegetations of the Brazilian countryside, settlers established in the region. São Carlos' history started in 1831, when the "Pinhal" (Pines) allotment was demarcated.

On the city's foundation date, November 4, 1857, the population resided in some houses around the chapel and the inhabitants were mostly Arruda Botelho's family heirs, who were the first owners of the "Pinhal" alloments. Between 1831 and 1857 the pioneer coffee farms were formed, starting the first economic activity in the city. The coffee crops came to the "Pinhal" farm in 1840 and spread throughout the fertile lands around, becoming the main export item. The city foundation is credited to [[Antônio Carlos de Arruda Botelho, Count of Pinhal]], an influent farmer and entrepreneur.

São Carlos was elevated to [[village]] in 1865, when a "Câmara", or ruling chamber, was created. In 1874, the village had 6,897 inhabitants, as a humble highlight of its fast growth and regional importance. It became a [[city]] in 1880 and in 1886, with a population of 16,104, its urban structure was settled.

The city arises on the coffee crops expansion context, which is relevant to the last two decades of the 19th century and to the first two of the 20th century. The arrival of the railway in 1884 provided an efficient system to transport the [[Coffee production in Brazil|coffee production]] to the [[Port of Santos|Santos harbor]] and boosted the economy of the region. The railway also contributed to the political and economic consolidation of the central area of the city.

When slavery ended, government created incentives to bring in immigrants. São Carlos had already received German nationals brought by the Count of Pinhal in 1876. Between 1880 and 1904, the city was one of the most important immigration centers in São Paulo state, the majority of them being [[Italian Brazilians|Italians]] - specifically, [[Northern Italy|Northern Italians]]. They worked in coffee plantations and in manufacturing factories, as well as trading activities.

In the beginning of the 20th century, countless cultural societies developed social activities aiming to promote literacy. Vittorio Emanuele Society in 1900 and [[Dante Alighieri]] in 1902 were but a few of them. The Italian presence was so significant that during the first half of the 20th century, the Italian government had a consulate branch in São Carlos.

With the [[Wall Street crash of 1929]], coffee production went through a crisis, which made many immigrants leave rural areas for factories, wood artifact production, pottery, and construction.

Farmers had already applied the profits obtained with coffee in the constitution of several types of companies in São Carlos: banks, electricity, cable cars, telephones, water pumps, sewers, theaters, hospitals and schools.  This established a foundation for industrialization in the city. With the arrival of immigrants from other urban centers from the 1930s - 1940s, their expertise was used to consolidate industrialization as the main economic activity in the city. Its peak years were the 1950s, when São Carlos became a manufacturing center, with relevant industrial expression in São Paulo state.

The industrial sector also developed through workshops that incorporated the coffee industry. The manufacture of processing machinery, shoes, fertilizers, hardware, furniture, pasta, cigars, as well as activities such as tailory, breweries, foundries, sawmills, weaving, pottery and pencil production expanded the economy of São Carlos in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 1960s, with the expansion of refrigeration, new factories of machinery and tractors arrived. Numerous small- and medium-sized companies which provided products and services were also established.

In the second half of the 20th century, the city received a boost of technological and higher educational development when in 1953 the Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, or the Engineering School of the [[University of São Paulo]], was created. In the 1970s, the [[Federal University of São Carlos]] was launched.

==Geography==

São Carlos is located on the geographic center of the São Paulo state, approximately {{convert|231|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[São Paulo|city of São Paulo]]. The city is the center of a [[Microregion of São Carlos|microregion]] with 308,777 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census of the IBGE - Synopsis - Table 761|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/cd/cd2010sp.asp?o=3&amp;i=P|publisher=IBGE.gov.br|accessdate=22 July 2011|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its altitude is over 856 m, offering a mild altitude climate. Most of the year the city is windy, sunny and with mild temperatures at night. For this reason the city is nicknamed "''Cidade do Clima''" (Weather City) and celebrates once a year an event called "''Festa do Clima''", or "Weather Festival".

The city has a total area of 1.141&amp;nbsp;km², which includes two districts to the north (''Santa Eudóxia'' and ''Água Vermelha''), one district to the west (''Bela Vista São-carlense''), and one district to the east (''Vila Nery'').

==Economy==
The city has an active industrial profile with important national and international industries and certain agricultural importance, backed by technologies developed by [[Embrapa]], owner of two research complexes in the city. Due to its increasing number of high technology industries, the city has been proclaimed "The National Capital of Technology" by Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]] in 2011.

The city hosts several locally-grown technology-based companies, such as Opto Eletrônicos, and factories of multinational corporations such as [[Faber Castell]], [[Electrolux]], [[Husqvarna AB|Husqvarna]], [[Tecumseh Products Company|Tecumseh]] and the Brazilian plant of [[Volkswagen]] [[engine]]s, and national corporations such as [[TAM Linhas Aéreas|TAM MRO - Technology Center]], [[Toalhas São Carlos]], [[Tapetes São Carlos]], [[Papel São Carlos]], [[Prominas Brasil]] and [[Latina (industry)|Latina]].

The economic basis of São Carlos is the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]]. Commerce and services corresponds to 65.9% of the city's GDP. Industry is also relevant. With 32.3% of the economy, the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] has a bigger participation than the state of São Paulo's average. The [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] corresponds to 1.7% of the GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal Profile at SEADE|url=http://www.seade.gov.br/produtos/perfil/perfilMunEstado.php|publisher=SEADE.gov.br|accessdate=12 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823080724/http://www.seade.gov.br/produtos/perfil/perfilMunEstado.php|archivedate=23 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

São Carlos is home to two [[University of São Paulo|Universidade de São Paulo]] campuses and the  [[Federal University of São Carlos|Universidade Federal de São Carlos]] (UFSCar), two of the most important higher learning centers in Brazil. Moreover, another minor and private university, [[Centro Universitário Central Paulista]] (UNICEP), is also based in São Carlos, and community colleges like [[SENAI]], [[Industrial Social Services|SESI]], [[Serviço Social do Comércio|SESC]], [[Serviço Nacional de Aprendizagem Comercial|SENAC]] and the ''Escola Técnica Estadual Paulino Botelho''. This has turned São Carlos into a university-oriented town, with an abundance of student-focused commercial establishments. It is also known for its student parties.

São Carlos' cultural life is marked by a young audience that enjoys musical concerts of Brazilian contemporary alternative artists that usually include the city in their tours. Also, São Carlos has 3 theaters and 7 commercial movie-theaters rooms.

There are two important events celebrated every year in the city, the ''Climate Party'', which happens in April and has a traditional ''Orchid Exposition'' which features a craftwork fair and several food barracks. An [[Oktobertech]] fest is held yearly along with the [[São Carlos High Tech Fair]] (Fealtec).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20815">'''Technological innovations''' have occurred throughout history and rapidly increased over the modern age. New technologies are developed and co-exist with the old before supplanting them. Transport offers several examples; from sailing to steam ships to automobiles replacing horse-based transportation. '''Technological transitions''' (TT) describe how these technological innovations occur and are incorporated into society.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J., to be published 2012. Environmental Governance. Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the technological developments TT considers wider societal changes such as “user practices, regulation, industrial networks (supply, production, distribution), infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture”.&lt;ref name="Geels"&gt;Geels, F. W., 2002. Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case study. Research Policy 31 pp. 257-1273&lt;/ref&gt; For a technology to have use, it must be linked to social structures human agency and organisations to fulfil a specific need.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; Hughes&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, T.P., 1987. The evolution of large technological systems. In: Bijker, W.E., Hughes, T.P., Pinch, T. (Eds.), The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology. Cambridge (MA): MIT Press. pp. 51-82&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the ‘seamless web’ where physical artefacts, organisations, scientific communities, and social practices combine. A technological system includes technical and non-technical aspects, and it a major shift in the socio-technical configurations (involving at least one new technology) is when a technological transition occurs.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, J., 1993. ‘Configurations: Crystallizing Contingency’, The International Journal of Human Factors in Manufacturing, 3, pp. 15-36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Work on technological transitions draws on a number of fields including [[history of science]], technology studies, and [[evolutionary economics]].&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; The focus of evolutionary economics is on economic change, but as a driver of this [[technological change]] has been considered in the literature.&lt;ref name="Geels_a"&gt;Geels, F.W., 2005. Technological transitions and system innovations. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph [[Schumpeter]], in his classic ''Theory of Economic Development''&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, T., 1934. The theory of economic development: an inquiry into profits, capital, credit, interest, and the business cycle. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; placed the emphasis on non-economic forces as the driver for growth. The human actor, the entrepreneur is seen as the cause of economic development which occurs as a cyclical process.  [[Schumpeter]] proposed that radical innovations were the catalyst for Kondratiev cycles.

===Long wave theory===
The Russian economist Kondratiev&lt;ref&gt;Kondratiev, N., 1925. Major Economic Cycles. Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that economic growth operated in boom and bust cycles of approximately 50 year periods. These cycles were characterised by periods of expansion, stagnation and recession. The period of expansion is associated with the introduction of a new technology, e.g. steam power or the microprocessor. At the time of publication, [[Kondratiev]] had considered that two cycles had occurred in the nineteenth century and third was beginning at the turn of the twentieth. Modern writers, such as Freeman and Perez&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, C. and Perez, C., 1988. Structural crisis of adjustment, business cycles and investment behaviour in Dosi et al Technical Change and Economic Theory. London: Frances Pinter. pp. 38-66.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined five cycles in the modern age:

* [[The Industrial Revolution]] (1770–1830)
* Victorian Prosperity: Age of steam and Rail (1830–1880)
* The Age of Steel (1880–1930)
* Oil, Mass Production and the Consumer Society (1930–1980)
* The Information Age (1980-?)

Freeman and Perez&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; proposed that each cycle consists of pervasive technologies, their production and economic structures that support them. Termed ‘techno-economic paradigms’, they suggest that the shift from one paradigm to another is the result of emergent new technologies. 

Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|recent economic crisis]], authors such as Moody and Nogrady&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J.B., and Nogrady, B., 2011. The Sixth Wave: How to Succeed in a Resource-Limited World. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that a new cycle is emerging from the old, centred on the use of sustainable technologies in a resource depleted world.

===Technological paradigms, trajectories and regimes===
[[Thomas Kuhn]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. Chicago; London : University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; described how a paradigm shift is a wholesale shift in the basic understanding of a scientific theory. Examples in science include the change of thought from miasma to germ theory as a cause of disease.  Building on this work, [[Giovanni Dosi]]&lt;ref&gt;Dosi, G., 1982. Technological paradigms and technological trajectories. Research Policy 11 (3) pp. 147-162.&lt;/ref&gt; developed the concept of ’technical paradigms’ and ‘technological trajectories’.  In considering how engineers work, the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem, a definition of what the problems and solutions are. It charts the idea of specific progress. By identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change. The pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory.  In similar fashion, Nelson and Winter (,&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1977. In search of useful theory of innovation. Research Policy 6 (1) pp. 36-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press.&lt;/ref&gt;)defined the concept of the ‘technological regime’ which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve. The work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour. This places boundaries and also trajectories (direction) to those boundaries.

==Multi-level perspective on technological transitions==
In analysing (historic) cases of technological transitions researchers from the systems in transition branch of transitions research have used a multi-level perspective (MLP) as a heuristic model to understand changes in socio-technical systems. (&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rip"&gt;Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone
(eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus,Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;Kemp, R., Schot, J. and Hoogma, R., 1998. Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: The approach of strategic niche management. Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management. 10 (2), pp. 175-198&lt;/ref&gt;)  [[Innovation system]] approaches traditionally focus on the production side. A socio-technical approach combines the science and technology in devising a production, with the application of the technology in fulfilling a societal function.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F. W., 2004. From sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. Insights about dynamics and change from sociology and institutional theory. Research Policy 33 (6-7) pp. 897–920&lt;/ref&gt; Linking the two domains are the distribution, infrastructure and markets of the product. This approach considers a transition to be multi-dimensional as technology is only one aspect. 

The MLP proposes three analytical levels: the niche, regime and landscape. 

'''Niche''' (Micro-level)
Radical innovations occur at the niche level. These act as ‘safe havens’ for fledgling technologies to develop, largely free from market pressures which occur at the regime level.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp" /&gt; The US Military has acted as niche for major twentieth century technologies such as the aircraft, radio and the internet. More recently, California’s Silicon Valley has provided an arena for [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] focused technologies to emerge. Some innovations will challenge the existing regime while others fail. 

'''Regime''' (Meso-level)
The socio-technical regime, as defined by Geels,&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; includes a web of inter-linking actors across different social groups and communities following a set of rules.  In effect, the established practices of a given system. Seven dimensions have been identified in the socio-technical regime: technology, user practices and application, the symbolic meaning of technology, infrastructure, policy and techno-scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; Change does occur at the regime level but it is normally slow and incremental unlike the radical change at the niche level. The actors who constitute the existing regime are set to gain from perpetuating the incumbent technology at the expense of the new. This is known as ‘lock-in’.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;

'''Landscape''' (Macro-level)
Exogenous to the previous levels is the socio-technical landscape.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; A broad range of factors are contained here, such as economic pressures, cultural values, social trends, wars and environmental issues. Change occurs at an even slower rate than at the regime level. 

A transition is said to happen when a regime shift has occurred. This is the result of the interplay between the three levels.  Regimes are relatively inert and resistant to change being structured to incremental innovation following established trajectories.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W., 2010. Ontologies, socio-technical transitions (to sustainability), and the multi-level perspective. Research Policy 39 pp. 495-510&lt;/ref&gt; As such, transitions are difficult to achieve. The current regime is typically suffering internal issues. Pressure from the landscape level may cause ‘cracks’ or ‘windows of opportunity’ through which innovations at the niche level may initially co-exist with the established technology before achieving ascendency. Once the technology has fully embedded into society the transition is said to be completed.&lt;ref name="Genus"&gt;Genus , A., and Coles, A-M., 2008. Rethinking the multi-level perspective of technological transitions. Research Policy. 37 (9) pp. 1436-1445&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case study===
The MLP has been used in describing a range of historic transitions in socio-technical regimes for mobility, sanitation, food, lighting and so on.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, A., Vob, J.P., and Grin, J., 2010. Innovation studies and sustainability transitions: The allure of the multi-level perspective and its challenges. Research Policy. 39 pp. 435-448&lt;/ref&gt; While early research focused on historical transitions, a second strand of research was more focused on transitions to sustainable technologies in key sectors such as transport, energy and housing.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

Geels &lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; presented three historical transitions on system innovation relating to modes of transportation. The technological transition from sailing ships to steamships in the UK will be summarised and shown in the context of a wider system innovation. 

Great Britain was the world’s leading naval power in the nineteenth century, and led the way in the transition from sail to steam.  At first, the introduction of steam technology co-existed with the current regime. Steam tugs assisted sail ships into port and hybrid steam / sail ships appeared. Landscape developments create the necessity for improvements in the technology. A demand for trans-Atlantic emigration was prompted by the Irish potato famine, European political instability and the lure of gold in California. The requirement for such arduous journeys had prompted a wealth of innovations at the niche level in steamship-development. From the late 1880s, as steamship technology improved and costs dropped, the new technology was widely diffused and a new regime established. The changes go beyond a technological transition as it involved new ship management and fleet management practices, new supporting infrastructures and new functionalities.

==Transition paths==
The nature of transitions varies and the differing qualities result in multiple pathways occurring. Geels and Schot &lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W. and Schot, J.W., 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417&lt;/ref&gt; defined five transition paths:

* Reproduction: Ongoing change occurring in the regime level.
* Transformation:  A socio-technical regime that changes without the emergence of a monopolising technology.
* Technological substitution: An incumbent technology is replaced by a radical innovation resulting in a new socio-technical regime. 
* De-alignment and Re-alignment: Weaknesses in the regime sees the advent of competing new technologies leading to a dominant model. (E.g. the automobile replacing the horse as the primary means of land transport).
* Re-configuration: When multiple, interlinked technologies are replaced by a similarly linked alternative set.

==Characteristics of technological transitions==
Six characteristics of technological transitions have been identified.,&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F., Monaghan, A., Eames, M. and Steward, F. , 2008. The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy: a report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London: DEFRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Transitions are co-evolutionary and multi-dimensional''
Technological developments occur intertwined with societal needs, wants and uses. A technology is adopted and diffused based on this interplay between innovation and societal requirements. Co-evolution has different aspects. As well as the co-evolution of technology and society, aspects between science, technology, users and culture have been considered.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;
 
''Multi-actors are involved''
Scientific and engineering communities are central to the development of a technology, but a wide range of actors are involved in a transition. This can include organisations, policy-makers, government, NGOs, special interest groups and others.

''Transitions occur at multiple levels''
As shown in the MLP transitions occur through the interplay of processes at different levels. 

''Transitions are a long-term process''
Complete system-change takes time and can be decades in the making. Case studies show them to be between 40 and 90 years.&lt;ref name="Genus" /&gt;

''Transitions are radical''
For a true transition to occur the technology has to be a radical innovation.  

''Change is Non-linear''
The rate of change will vary over time. For example, the pace of change may be slow at the gestation period (at the niche level) but much more rapid when a breakthrough is occurring.

==Diffusion: transition phases==
Diffusion of an innovation is the concept of how it is picked up by society, at what rate and why. Everett (1962).The diffusion of a technological innovation into society can be considered in distinct phases.&lt;ref name="Rotmans"&gt;Rotmans, J., Kemp, R. and van Asselt, M. 2001. More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy. Foresight, 3 (1) pp. 15-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-development is the gestation period where the new technology has yet to make an impact. Take-off is when the process of a system shift is beginning. A breakthrough is occurring when fundamental changes are occurring in existing structures through the interplay of economic, social and cultural forces. Once the rate of change has decreased and a new balance is achieved, stabilization is said to have occurred. A full transition involves an overhaul of existing rules and change of beliefs which takes time, typically spanning at least a generation.&lt;ref name="Rotmans" /&gt; This process can be speeded-up through seismic, unforeseen events such as war or economic strife. 

Geels&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; proposed a similar four phased approach which draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) developed by Dutch scholars. Phases one sees the emergence of a novelty, born from the existing regime. Development then occurs in the niche level at phase two.  As before, breakthrough then occurs at phase three. In the parlance of the MLP the new technology, having been developed at the niche level, is in competition with the established regime. To breakthrough and achieve wide diffusion, external factors – ‘windows of opportunity’ are required.

==Windows of opportunity==
A number of possible circumstances can act as windows of opportunity for the diffusion of new technologies: 

* Internal technical problems in the existing regime. Those that cannot be solved by refinement of existing technologies act as a driver for the new.
* Problems external to the system. Such ‘problems’ are often determined by pressure groups and require wider societal or political backing. An example is environmental concerns.
* Changing user preferences. Opportunities are presented if existing technologies cannot meet user needs.
* Strategic advantage. Competition with rivals may necessitate innovation
* Complimentary technology. The availability of which may enable a breakthrough

Alongside external influences, internal drivers catalyse diffusion.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; These include economic factors such as the price performance ration. Socio-technical perspectives focus on the links between disparate social and technological elements.&lt;ref name="Rip" /&gt; Following the breakthrough, the final phases see the new technology supersede the old.

==Societal relevance==
The study of technological transitions has an impact beyond academic interest. The transitions referred to in the literature may relate to historic processes, such as the transportation transitions studied by Geels, but system changes are required to achieve a safe transition to a low carbon-economy. (&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;). Current structural problems are apparent in a range of sectors.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;  Dependency on oil is problematic in the energy sector due to availability, access and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Transportation is a major user of energy causing significant emission of GHGs.  Food production will need to keep pace with an ever-growing world population while overcoming challenges presented by global warming and transportation issues. Incremental change has provided some improvements but a more radical transition is required to achieve a more sustainable future. 

Developed from the work on technological transitions is the field of transition management. Within this is an attempt to shape the direction of change complex socio-technical systems to more sustainable patterns.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; Whereas work on technological transitions is largely based on historic processes, proponents of transition management seek to actively steer transitions in progress.

==Criticisms==
Genus and Coles&lt;ref name="Genus" /&gt; outlined a number of criticisms against the analysis of technological transitions, in particular when using the MLP. Empirical research on technological transitions occurring now has been limited, with the focus on historic transitions. Depending on the perspective on transition case studies they could be presented as having occurred on a different transition path to what was shown. For example, the bicycle could be considered an intermediate transport technology between the horse and the car. Judged from shorter different time-frame this could appear a transition in its own right. Determining the nature of a transition is problematic; when it started and ended, or whether one occurred in the sense of a radical innovation displacing an existing socio-technical regime. The perception of time casts doubt on whether a transition has occurred. If viewed over a long enough period even inert regimes may demonstrate radical change in the end. The MLP has also been criticised by scholars studying sustainability transitions using Social Practice Theories.&lt;ref&gt;Shove E, Walker G, 2007, "CAUTION! Transitions ahead: politics, practice, and sustainable transition management" Environment and Planning A 39(4) 763-770&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuopio Science Park''' is a [[university]] related [[research park]] located in [[Kuopio]], [[Finland]]. The name is not as such used in marketing purposes.

'''Technology Centre Teknia Ltd. (Teknia)''', which is the central enterprise service organisation, is used as the marketing brand of the whole area - hence the lack of logo for Kuopio Science Park. Teknia has been the fastest growing Technology Park in Finland for the new millennium.

Teknia was acquired in spring 2008 by Technopolis plc for total cost of 18,1 million euros (67 million euros debts included).

==Synopsis==
The essays in the book fall into three general categories, dealing with ancient civilizations and certain unscientific theories regarding them, occult-related subjects, and pseudoscience in general. Anecdotes from history and de Camp's travels to some of the locales he writes about pepper the narrative.

The first eight chapters fall into the first category. Discussions of [[Troy#Troy I–V|Bronze Age Troy]] and the ancient Sudanese civilization of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] counter romantic speculations with a resume of what is known of them from historical sources and archaeological investigations. In contrast, the section on [[King Arthur]], of whom little factual information has been established, puts to rest unverified notions regarding him by tracing the development and elaboration of his legend down through the ages. The chapter on the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] debunks [[Diffusionism|diffusionist]] theories seeking the origin of their culture in Old World civilizations rather than from indigenous factors. Later sections about [[Teotihuacan]] and the [[Toltec]]s serve more as general introductions to these cultures. There is also a brief discussion of the ''Tour Magne'', a Roman ruin in [[Nîmes]], France, and a chapter on myths that discounts them as reliable reportage of prehistoric events.

Chapters in the second category include discussions of memories of previous lives supposedly recovered via hypnosis, the [[Kabbalah]], lives of famous charlatans claiming to have been magicians, such as [[Cagliostro]] and [[Aleister Crowley]], the hoax perpetrated by [[Léo Taxil]] and others that purported to expose [[Freemasonry]] as devil worship, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]], the development of occultist cultism around [[Mount Shasta]] in Northern California (demonstrated to have a literary basis), and the origins of the mystic trance, with rational explanations for the visions experienced. A satirical chapter of advice on how to set one's self up as a prophet rounds out the section.

An account of the early history of [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Fundamentalist]] movement to prohibit the teaching of [[evolution]] in schools leads off the third category. There is also a biography of [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] politician [[Ignatius Donnelly]] focusing on his speculations regarding [[Atlantis]] and like matters, and then a speculative chapter regarding future languages, essentially a didactic piece on language change with application to science fictional treatments of time-travel. It leads into a discussion of nonscientific claims about the "fourth dimension" in general. This part of the book also includes reviews of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s ''[[Worlds in Collision]]'' and [[Erich von Däniken]]'s ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', both of which de Camp discounts.

==Reception==
Critical reviews of the book were generally positive. Writing in the wake of its release, [[Thomas Easton|Tom Easton]] observed in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact]]'' that "[i]f you know L. Sprague de Camp's work at all, you know what to expect ... He's always readable and entertaining, as he sticks his thumbs into gaping holes of fact and logic ... He's full of the straight dope (though he often doesn't go into things as deeply as I would like)." He urged readers to "buy the book."&lt;ref name=easton/&gt; Michael Schuyler, writing for ''[[Library Journal]]'', took a more neutral stance, judging only that "[m]ost of these mysteries have been well documented elsewhere, and De Camp [sic] presents no revelations."&lt;ref name=schuyler&gt;Schuyler, Michael. "Science and Technology. De Camp. L. Sprague. The Ragged Edge of Science" (review), in ''Library Journal'', v. 105, no. 20, November 15, 1980, p. 2423.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also reviewed by [[Darrell Schweitzer]] in ''Science Fiction Review'' v. 10, issue 1 (Spring, 1981), p.&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;ref name="ISFDb"/&gt;

More recently, an exhaustive review from 2007 sums up the book as "a very pleasant and readable collection of essays, an excellent and classical example of skeptical writing and debunkery of various kinds of pseudoscientific and paranormal nonsense." The reviewer notes de Camp's "accessible, down-to-earth style," humor, and story-telling expertise, as well as "somewhat conservative opinions ... which occasionally show in his writing." Its conclusion is "[o]verall I highly recommend this book."&lt;ref name=illadvised/&gt;

'''''Under the Sea Wind: A Naturalist's Picture of Ocean Life''''' (1941) is the first book written by the American [[marine biologist]] [[Rachel Carson]]. It was published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1941, when it received very good reviews but sold poorly. After the great success of a sequel ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'' (Oxford, 1951), it was reissued by [[Oxford University Press]]; that edition was an alternate [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] selection and became another bestseller. It is recognised today as one of the "definitive works of American nature writing,"&lt;ref name="Bryson"&gt;Bryson, Michael A. ''Visions of the Land: Science, Literature, and the American Environment from the Era of Exploration to the Age of Ecology''. University of Virginia Press, 2002, p. 144. {{ISBN|0-8139-2107-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is in print as one of the [[Penguin Nature Classics]].

==Description==
''Under the Sea Wind'' describes the behaviour of fish and seabirds accurately, but in story form, often using the scientific names of species as character names.  Carson's stated goal in doing so was "to make the sea and its life as vivid a reality for those who may read the book as it has become for me during the past decade."&lt;ref name="Quaratiello"&gt;Quaratiello, Arlene.  ''Rachel Carson: A Biography''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2004, pp. 26–27.  {{ISBN|0-313-32388-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first of her characters is introduced this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With the dusk a strange bird came to the island from its nesting grounds on the outer banks.  Its wings were pure black, and from tip to tip their spread was more than the length of a man's arm.  It flew steadily and without haste across the sound, its progress as measured and as meaningful as that of the shadows which little by little were dulling the bright water path.  The bird was called Rynchops, the black skimmer.''&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;Carson, Rachel. ''Under the Sea-Wind''. Penguin Nature Classics edition (1996), pp. 4–5. {{ISBN|0-14-025380-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The middle section of the book follows the life-story of [[Scomber]], the mackerel, while the last part describes pond creatures such as eels and ducks.  A glossary at the end of the book provides additional detail.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, pp. 273–304.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
The style of Carson's writing makes the book suitable for children as well as adults, and the appeal is enhanced with illustrations, originally by Howard Frech, and replaced in 1991 with illustrations by [[Robert W. Hines]].  Carson acknowledged the influence of nature-novelist [[Henry Williamson]] on her writing style,&lt;ref&gt;Quaratiello, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; but uses her scientific expertise to ground ''Under the Sea Wind'' in scientifically accurate detail on each animal's appearance, diet and behaviour.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;Stewart, Frank. ''A Natural History of Nature Writing''. Island Press, 1995, p. 170. {{ISBN|1-55963-279-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''William Phelps Ornithological Collection,''' also known as the Phelps Ornithological Museum, is a museum of [[Natural science|natural sciences]] dedicated to the study, exhibition and preservation of the [[Bird|birds]] of [[Venezuela]] and the rest of Latin America. The collection is located east of Caracas and in the geographic center of [[Metropolitan Region of Caracas|Greater Caracas]], in the heart of the [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande district]]. The William Phelps ornithological collection is the most important in [[Latin America]] and it is also the most important private collection in the world in its research area.&lt;ref name=":282"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H. PHELPS JR.|last=VUILLEUMIER|first=FRANCOIS|date=1990|journal=Department of Ornithology, The American Museum of Natural Histor|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In this private museum one will find important Phelps family study books, as well as 8000 scientific volumes in the library,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|author=Marcos Kirschstein y José Daniel Ramos|title=El bulevar de Sabana Grande esconde un misterio de ochenta años|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/videos/cultura/bulevar-sabana-grande-esconde-misterio-ochenta-anos_69876|date=2018-01-29|accessdate=2018-05-29|work=El Nacional|location=|page=|number=|Apellido 2=}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 83,000 anatomical specimens, more than 80,000 skins, etc.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;  For the year 1990, it was said that the William Phelps Ornithological Collection contained more than 76,300 skins and a small number of anatomical specimens, in the Gran Sabana Building of [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande]]. The Phelps library in 1990 already had 6,000 books, 800 journals and 5,500 reprints, mostly from natural sciences.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;
 
== History ==

The ornithological collection was born in 1938, although it did not have its own headquarters on the [[Boulevard of Sabana Grande]] until 1949. At the beginning of 2018, it celebrated its 80th anniversary in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the passing of time, the collection has been growing&lt;ref name=":282" /&gt; and still has great international scientific relevance. In 2005, an investigation was carried out on "plumage differences in four subspecies of golden warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in [[Venezuela]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.neotropicalbirdclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/C23-Restall.pdf|title=On plumage differences in four subspecies of Golden-crowned Warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in Venezuela|last=Restall|first=Robin|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Gustavo|date=2005|journal=Cotinga|number=23|pages=33–36|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=|last3=Lentino|first3=Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Importance ===
The Phelps Foundation has been recognized worldwide for its scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fundacionwhphelps.org/web/nosotros/|title=Nosotros – Colección Ornitológica Phelps|website=fundacionwhphelps.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1937, this foundation has dedicated to the study of the distribution of birds in Venezuela as well as to the dissemination of ornithology in Venezuela. Since 1949, it has expanded globally in its mission to discover, interpret and disseminate information about ornithology through a program of scientific research, education and dissemination in the natural sciences. The Foundation has had an important global trajectory for which it is recognized and is a regional compulsory study resource on tropical birds for experts who want to know more about this area. This museum has historically been connected to the American Museum of Natural History, thanks to the work of Billy Phelps.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H. PHELPS JR.|last=VUILLEUMIER|first=FRANCOIS|date=1990|journal=Department of Ornithology, The American Museum of Natural Histor|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ornithological collection has also been expanded thanks to the research carried out with Armando Dugand from [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.bdigital.unal.edu.co/33067/1/32820-121526-1-PB.pdf|title=AVES DE LA RIBERA COLOMBIANA DEL RIO NEGRO (FRONTERA DE COLOMBIA Y VENEZUELA)|last=Dugand|first=Armando|last2=Phelps|first2=William|authorlink2=|date=1948|journal=Libro|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the funds to carry out these investigations were collected by the Phelps Foundation.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

=== Research ===
In March and April 1977, the Phelps Ornithological Collection, with the collaboration of the Venezuelan-Brazilian Border Commission, Demarcador de Limites, carried out a collection of birds at Cerro Urutaní (62 ° 05'W, 3 ° 40'N), which is a low altitude tepui on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border in the Sierra Pacaraima. A total of 511 specimens of birds were collected between 1150 and 1280 meters high s.n.m., representing 78 different species. Gilberto Pérez Chinchilla, Manuel Castro and Dickerman prepared the copies of the collection. A full report on these birds was published in the international press and was published in the Bulletin of the "American Museum of Natural History", [[New York City|New York]]. It was necessary to work in conjunction with the Boundary Directorate of [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/Phelps%20%26%20Dickerman%201980.pdf|title=CUATRO SUBESPECIES NUEVAS DE AVES (FURNARIIDAE, FORMICARIIDAE) DE LA REGION DE PANTEPUI, ESTADO BOLIVAR Y TERRITORIO AMAZONAS, VENEZUELA|last=Phelps|first=William|last2=Robert|first2=Dickerman|date=1980|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Venezolana de Ciencias Naturales|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Woman in Science'''''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/womaninsciencew00zahmgoog#page/n0/mode/2up Woman in Science, by H. J. Mozans (MIT Press, 1974)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a book written by [[H. J. Mozans]] (a pseudonym for John Augustine Zahm) in 1913. It is an account of women who have contributed to the sciences, up to the time when it was published.

==Themes==
The comprehensive theme that is depicted throughout ''Woman in Science'' is that of women's biological capacity. It is asserted that women being less prominent than men in science is due to the lack of educational and career opportunities available rather than, the biological aspects of brain size or structure. In addition, the book encompasses the many developments of science throughout history. The main objective of the author/book was for women to become more involved and gain a respected position in the scientific field, in addition to increasing educational and career opportunities for women interested in science. It was one of the first collaborations of women's contributions to the scientific community, and it "explored the barriers to women's participation in science."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Has_Feminism_Changed_Science.html?id=Fb232LIFk80C ''Has Feminism Changed Science?''], by [[Londa Schiebinger]], Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}, p 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
{{quote|
"H. J. Mozans, in his Woman in Science, gives us a most comprehensive survey of the scientific activity and attainments of women. Primarily inspired to his investigation by extensive travels in Greece and Italy, the author begins with the learned women of ancient Greece-Hypatia, Sappho, and Aspasea, and of somewhat less widespread fame, Gorgo, Andromeda, and Corinna-and passes on from them to the women of ancient Rome, the women of the Middle Ages, when education was largely confined to monasteries, the women of the renaissance, and the women of subsequent and modern times. He shows during each of these epochs the advantages and opportunities offered to women in each country, and indicates where their achievements were least, and where greatest. He very conclusively proves that where opportunity was great, achievement was likewise great, and vice versa. "In every department of natural knowledge," he states, "when not inhibited by her environment, woman has been the colleague and the emulatress, if not the peer, of the most illustrious men who have contributed to the increase and diffusion of human learning." He analyzes most carefully the biologic capacity of women for scientific pursuits, coming to the conclusion that the reputed difference in intelligence between men and women is due not to difference in brain size or structure or innate power of intellect, but to education and opportunity. He then goes carefully through the historical development of each science, beginning with mathematics, going on through astronomy, physics, chemistry, the natural sciences, medicine, and surgery, archaeology,and invention, and shows the instances, extent and value of woman's contributions to each science. He concludes with the prediction that increasing education and opportunity for women will bring about ever-increasing participation in the advancement of science."&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Woman in Science. Pp. xi, 452. Price, $2.50. New York: MOZANS, D. Appleton and Company, 1913. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1012286?seq=1&lt;/ref&gt;|Nellie Seeds Nearing, wife of [[Scott Nearing]]}}

PREFACE
{{quote|
"Only then did the magnitude and the difficulty of my self-imposed task begin to dawn upon me. I saw that it would be impossible, if I were to do justice to the subject, to compass in a single volume anything like an adequate account of the contributions of women to the advancement of general knowledge. I accordingly resolved to restrict my theme and confine myself to an attempt to show what an important role women have played in the development of those branches of knowledge in which they are usually thought to have had but little part".}}
{{quote|
"The subject of my book thus, by a process of elimination, narrowed its scope to woman’s achievements in science. Many works in various languages had been written on what women had accomplished in art, literature, and state-craft, and there was, therefore, no special call for a new volume on any of these topics. But, with the exception of a few brief monographs in German, French and Italian, and an occasional magazine article here and there, practically nothing had been written about woman in science. The time, then, seemed opportune for entering upon a field that had thus far been almost completely neglected; and, although I soon discovered that the labor involved would be far greater than I had anticipated, I never lost sight of the work which had its virtual inception in the peerless sanctuary of Pallas Athena in the 'City of the Violet Crown.'"{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}}}
