      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37065">The '''analytic–synthetic distinction''' (also called the '''analytic–synthetic dichotomy''') is a [[Semantics|semantic]] distinction, used primarily in [[philosophy]] to distinguish propositions (in particular, statements that are affirmative subject–predicate judgments) into two types: '''analytic propositions''' and '''synthetic propositions'''. Analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.&lt;ref name=Rey/&gt; However, philosophers have used the terms in very different ways. Furthermore, philosophers have debated whether there is a legitimate distinction.

==Kant==
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

===Conceptual containment===
The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] uses the terms "analytic" and "synthetic" to divide propositions into two types. Kant introduces the analytic–synthetic distinction in the Introduction to his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781/1998, A6–7/B10–11). There, he restricts his attention to statements that are affirmative [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]-[[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] judgments and defines "analytic proposition" and "synthetic proposition" as follows:
* '''analytic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept
* '''synthetic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is '''not''' contained in its subject concept but related

Examples of analytic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:
* "All bachelors are unmarried."
* "All triangles have three sides."

Kant's own example is:
* "All bodies are extended," that is, occupy space. (A7/B11)

Each of these statements is an affirmative subject-predicate judgment, and, in each, the predicate concept is ''contained'' within the subject concept. The concept "bachelor" contains the concept "unmarried"; the concept "unmarried" is part of the definition of the concept "bachelor". Likewise, for "triangle" and "has three sides", and so on.

Examples of synthetic propositions, on Kant's definition, include:
* "All bachelors are alone."
* "All creatures with hearts have kidneys."

Kant's own example is:
* "All bodies are heavy", that is, they experience a gravitational force. (A7/B11)

As with the previous examples classified as analytic propositions, each of these new statements is an affirmative subject–predicate judgment. However, in none of these cases does the subject concept contain the predicate concept. The concept "bachelor" does not contain the concept "alone"; "alone" is not a part of the ''definition'' of "bachelor". The same is true for "creatures with hearts" and "have kidneys"; even if every creature with a heart also has kidneys, the concept "creature with a heart" does not contain the concept "has kidneys".

===Kant's version and the ''a priori''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''a posteriori'' distinction===
{{main|A priori and a posteriori}}
In the Introduction to the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Kant contrasts his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions with another distinction, the distinction between [[a priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] and [[Empirical evidence|''a posteriori'']] propositions. He defines these terms as follows:
* '''''a priori''''' '''proposition''': a proposition whose justification does ''not'' rely upon experience. Moreover, the proposition can be validated by experience, but is not grounded in experience. Therefore, it is logically necessary.
* '''''a posteriori''''' '''proposition''': a proposition whose justification does rely upon experience. The proposition is validated by, and grounded in, experience. Therefore, it is logically contingent.

Examples of ''a priori'' propositions include:
* "All bachelors are unmarried."
* "7 + 5 = 12."

The justification of these propositions does not depend upon experience: one need not consult experience to determine whether all bachelors are unmarried, nor whether {{nowrap|1=7 + 5 = 12}}. (Of course, as Kant would grant, experience is required to understand the concepts "bachelor", "unmarried", "7", "+" and so forth. However, the ''a priori'' / ''a posteriori'' distinction as employed here by Kant refers not to the ''origins'' of the concepts but to the ''justification'' of the propositions. Once we have the concepts, experience is no longer necessary.)

Examples of ''a posteriori'' propositions include:
* "All bachelors are unhappy."
* "Tables exist."

Both of these propositions are ''a posteriori'': any justification of them would require one's experience.

The analytic/synthetic distinction and the ''a priori'' / ''a posteriori'' distinction together yield four types of propositions:
# analytic ''a priori''
# synthetic ''a priori''
# analytic ''a posteriori''
# synthetic ''a posteriori''

Kant posits the third type as obviously self-contradictory.  Ruling it out, he discusses only the remaining three types as components of his epistemological framework{{mdash}}each, for brevity's sake, becoming, respectively, "analytic", "synthetic a priori", and "empirical" or "a posteriori" propositions. This triad will account for all propositions possible.

===The ease of knowing analytic propositions===
Part of Kant's argument in the Introduction to the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' involves arguing that there is no problem figuring out how knowledge of analytic propositions is possible. To know an analytic proposition, Kant argued, one need not consult experience. Instead, one needs merely to take the subject and "extract from it, in accordance with the principle of contradiction, the required predicate" (A7/B12). In analytic propositions, the predicate concept is contained in the subject concept. Thus, to know an analytic proposition is true, one need merely examine the concept of the subject. If one finds the predicate contained in the subject, the judgment is true.

Thus, for example, one need not consult experience to determine whether "All bachelors are unmarried" is true. One need merely examine the subject concept ("bachelors") and see if the predicate concept "unmarried" is contained in it. And in fact, it is: "unmarried" is part of the definition of "bachelor" and so is contained within it. Thus the proposition "All bachelors are unmarried" can be known to be true without consulting experience.

It follows from this, Kant argued, first: All analytic propositions are ''a priori''; there are no ''a posteriori'' analytic propositions. It follows, second: There is no problem understanding how we can know analytic propositions;  we can know them because we only need to consult our concepts in order to determine that they are true.

===The possibility of metaphysics===
After ruling out the possibility of analytic ''a posteriori'' propositions, and explaining how we can obtain knowledge of analytic ''a priori'' propositions, Kant also explains how we can obtain knowledge of synthetic ''a posteriori'' propositions. That leaves only the question of how knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions is possible. This question is exceedingly important, Kant maintains, because all important metaphysical knowledge is of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions. If it is impossible to determine which synthetic ''a priori'' propositions are true, he argues, then metaphysics as a discipline is impossible. The remainder of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' is devoted to examining whether and how knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions is possible.&lt;ref name=Langford1949&gt; See [[Cooper Harold Langford]] (1949)'s ostensive proof: {{cite journal|title= A Proof That Synthetic A Priori Propositions Exist|journal= The Journal of Philosophy|year= 1949 |volume= 46|number= 1| date= 1949-01-06|pages= 20–24 |jstor=2019526 |last1= Langford|first1= C. H.|authorlink1=Cooper Harold Langford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical positivists==

===Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition===
Over a hundred years later, a group of philosophers took interest in Kant and his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions: the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]].

Part of Kant's examination of the possibility of synthetic ''a priori'' knowledge involved the examination of mathematical propositions, such as
* "7 + 5 = 12." (B15–16)
* "The shortest distance between two points is a straight line." (B16–17)

Kant maintained that mathematical propositions such as these are synthetic ''a priori'' propositions, and that we know them. That they are synthetic, he thought, is obvious: the concept "equal to 12" is not contained within the concept "7 + 5";  and the concept "straight line" is not contained within the concept "the shortest distance between two points". From this, Kant concluded that we have knowledge of synthetic ''a priori'' propositions.

[[Gottlob Frege]]'s notion of analyticity included a number of logical properties and relations beyond containment: [[symmetry]], [[transitive relation|transitivity]], [[antonymy]], or [[negation]] and so on. He had a strong emphasis on formality, in particular formal definition, and also emphasized the idea of substitution of synonymous terms. "All bachelors are unmarried" can be expanded out with the formal definition of bachelor as "unmarried man" to form "All unmarried men are unmarried", which is recognizable as tautologous and therefore analytic from its logical form: any statement of the form "All ''X'' that are (''F'' and ''G'') are ''F''". Using this particular expanded idea of analyticity, Frege concluded that Kant's examples of arithmetical truths are analytical ''a priori'' truths and ''not'' synthetic ''a priori'' truths.

{{quote|1=Thanks to Frege's logical semantics, particularly his concept of analyticity, arithmetic truths like "7+5=12" are no longer synthetic ''a priori'' but analytical ''a priori'' truths in [[Carnap]]'s extended sense of "analytic".
Hence logical empiricists are not subject to Kant's criticism of Hume for throwing out mathematics along with metaphysics.&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt;}}

(Here "logical empiricist" is a synonym for "logical positivist".)

===The origin of the logical positivist's distinction===
The logical positivists agreed with Kant that we have knowledge of mathematical truths, and further that mathematical propositions are ''a priori''. However, they did not believe that any complex metaphysics, such as the type Kant supplied, are necessary to explain our knowledge of mathematical truths. Instead, the logical positivists maintained that our knowledge of judgments like "all bachelors are unmarried" and our knowledge of mathematics (and logic) are in the basic sense the same: all proceeded from our knowledge of the meanings of terms or the conventions of language.

{{quote|Since empiricism had always asserted that ''all'' knowledge is based on experience, this assertion had to include knowledge in mathematics. On the other hand, we believed that with respect to this problem the rationalists had been right in rejecting the old empiricist view that the truth of "&lt;nowiki&gt;2+2=4&lt;/nowiki&gt;" is contingent on the observation of facts, a view that would lead to the unacceptable consequence that an arithmetical statement might possibly be refuted tomorrow by new experiences. Our solution, based upon [[Wittgenstein]]'s conception, consisted in asserting the thesis of empiricism only for factual truth. By contrast, the truths of logic and mathematics are not in need of confirmation by observations, because they do not state anything about the world of facts, they hold for any possible combination of facts.&lt;ref name=Schlipp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;|Rudolf Carnap|Autobiography: §10: Semantics, p. 64}}

===Logical positivist definitions===
Thus the logical positivists drew a new distinction, and, inheriting the terms from Kant, named it the "analytic/synthetic distinction".&lt;ref name=Ebbs/&gt; They provided many different definitions, such as the following:
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition whose truth depends solely on the meaning of its terms
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition that is true (or false) by definition
# '''analytic proposition''': a proposition that is made true (or false) solely by the conventions of language

(While the logical positivists believed that the only necessarily true propositions were analytic, they did not define "analytic proposition" as "necessarily true proposition" or "proposition that is true in all possible worlds".)

Synthetic propositions were then defined as:
* '''synthetic proposition''': a proposition that is not analytic

These definitions applied to all propositions, regardless of whether they were of subject–predicate form. Thus, under these definitions, the proposition "It is raining or it is not raining" was classified as analytic, while for Kant it was analytic by virtue of its logical form. And the proposition "{{nowrap|1=7 + 5 = 12}}" was classified as analytic, while under Kant's definitions it was synthetic.

==Two-dimensionalism==
[[Two-dimensionalism]] is an approach to [[semantics]] in [[analytic philosophy]]. It is a theory of how to determine the [[sense and reference]] of a [[word]] and the [[truth-value]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. It is intended to resolve a puzzle that has plagued philosophy for some time, namely: How is it possible to discover empirically that a [[necessary truth]] is [[Truth|true]]? Two-dimensionalism provides an analysis of the semantics of words and sentences that makes sense of this possibility. The theory was first developed by [[Robert Stalnaker]], but it has been advocated by numerous philosophers since, including [[David Chalmers]] and [[Berit Brogaard]].

Any given sentence, for example, the words,
:"Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O"

is taken to express two distinct [[proposition]]s, often referred to as a ''primary intension'' and a ''secondary intension'', which together compose its [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].&lt;ref name=Chalmers/&gt;

The primary [[intension]] of a word or sentence is its [[sense and reference|sense]], i.e., is the idea or method by which we find its referent. The primary intension of "water" might be a description, such as ''watery stuff''. The thing picked out by the primary intension of "water" could have been otherwise. For example, on some other world where the inhabitants take "water" to mean ''watery stuff'', but, where the chemical make-up of watery stuff is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, it is not the case that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O for that world.

The ''secondary intension'' of "water" is whatever thing "water" happens to pick out in ''this'' world, whatever that world happens to be. So if we assign "water" the primary intension ''watery stuff'' then the secondary intension of "water" is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, since H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is ''watery stuff'' in this world. The secondary intension of "water" in our world is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in every world because unlike ''watery stuff'' it is impossible for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to be other than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. When considered according to its secondary intension, "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is true in every world.

If two-dimensionalism is workable it solves some very important problems in the philosophy of language. [[Saul Kripke]] has argued that "Water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O" is an example of the ''[[necessary truth|necessary]] [[a posteriori]]'', since we had to discover that water was H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but given that it is true, it cannot be false. It would be absurd to claim that something that is water is not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, for these are known to be ''identical''.

==Quine's criticisms==
{{See also|Willard Van Orman Quine#Rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction|Two Dogmas of Empiricism#Analyticity and circularity}}
[[Rudolf Carnap]] was a strong proponent of the distinction between what he called "internal questions", questions entertained within a "framework" (like a mathematical theory), and "external questions", questions posed outside any framework&amp;nbsp;– posed before the adoption of any framework.&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Murzi/&gt; The "internal" questions could be of two types: ''logical'' (or analytic, or logically true) and ''factual'' (empirical, that is, matters of observation interpreted using terms from a framework). The "external" questions were also of two types: those that were confused pseudo-questions ("one disguised in the form of a theoretical question") and those that could be re-interpreted as practical, pragmatic questions about whether a framework under consideration was "more or less expedient, fruitful, conducive to the aim for which the language is intended".&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt; The adjective "synthetic" was not used by Carnap in his 1950 work ''Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology''.&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt; Carnap did define a "synthetic truth" in his work ''[[Meaning and Necessity]]'': a sentence that is true, but not simply because "the semantical rules of the system suffice for establishing its truth".&lt;ref name=Carnap2/&gt;

The notion of a synthetic truth is of something that is true both because of what it means and because of the way the world is, whereas analytic truths are true in virtue of meaning alone. Thus, what Carnap calls internal ''factual'' statements (as opposed to internal ''logical'' statements) could be taken as being also synthetic truths because they require ''observations'', but some external statements also could be "synthetic" statements and Carnap would be doubtful about their status. The analytic–synthetic argument therefore is not identical with the [[internal–external distinction]].&lt;ref name=Yablo/&gt;

In 1951, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] published the essay "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" in which he argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is untenable.&lt;ref name=Dogmas/&gt; The argument at bottom is that there are no "analytic" truths, but all truths involve an empirical aspect. In the first paragraph, Quine takes the distinction to be the following:
* analytic propositions&amp;nbsp;– propositions grounded in meanings, independent of matters of fact.
* synthetic propositions&amp;nbsp;– propositions grounded in fact.

Quine's position denying the analytic-synthetic distinction is summarized as follows:
{{quote|It is obvious that truth in general depends on both language and extralinguistic fact. ... Thus one is tempted to suppose in general that the truth of a statement is somehow analyzable into a linguistic component and a factual component. Given this supposition, it next seems reasonable that in some statements the factual component should be null; and these are the analytic statements. But, for all its ''a priori'' reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith.&lt;ref name=Quine4/&gt;|Willard v. O. Quine|"Two Dogmas of Empiricism", p. 64}}

To summarize Quine's argument, the notion of an analytic proposition requires a notion of synonymy, but establishing synonymy inevitably leads to matters of fact&amp;nbsp;– synthetic propositions. Thus, there is no non-circular (and so no tenable) way to ground the notion of analytic propositions.

While Quine's rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction is widely known, the precise argument for the rejection and its status is highly debated in contemporary philosophy. However, some (for example, Boghossian&lt;ref name=Boghossian/&gt;) argue that Quine's rejection of the distinction is still widely accepted among philosophers, even if for poor reasons.

===Responses===
[[Paul Grice]] and [[P. F. Strawson]] criticized "Two Dogmas" in their 1956 article "In Defense of a Dogma".&lt;ref name=Defense/&gt; Among other things, they argue that Quine's [[skepticism]] about synonyms leads to a skepticism about meaning. If statements can have meanings, then it would make sense to ask "What does it mean?". If it makes sense to ask "What does it mean?", then synonymy can be defined as follows: Two sentences are synonymous if and only if the true answer of the question "What does it mean?" asked of one of them is the true answer to the same question asked of the other. They also draw the conclusion that discussion about correct or incorrect translations would be impossible given Quine's argument. Four years after Grice and Strawson published their paper, Quine's book ''[[Word and Object]]'' was released. In the book Quine presented his theory of [[indeterminacy of translation]].

In ''Speech Acts'', [[John Searle]] argues that from the difficulties encountered in trying to explicate analyticity by appeal to specific criteria, it does not follow that the notion itself is void.&lt;ref name=Searle/&gt; Considering the way which we would test any proposed list of criteria, which is by comparing their extension to the set of analytic statements, it would follow that any explication of what analyticity means presupposes that we already have at our disposal a working notion of analyticity.

In "'Two Dogmas' Revisited", [[Hilary Putnam]] argues that Quine is attacking two different notions:&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt;
{{quote|It seems to me there is as gross a distinction between 'All bachelors are unmarried' and 'There is a book on this table' as between any two things in this world, or at any rate, between any two linguistic expressions in the world;&lt;ref name=Putnam2/&gt;|Hilary Putnam|''Philosophical Papers'', p. 36}}

Analytic truth defined as a true statement derivable from a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] by putting synonyms for synonyms is near [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] account of analytic truth as a truth whose negation is a contradiction. Analytic truth defined as a truth confirmed no matter what, however, is closer to one of the traditional accounts of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. While the first four sections of Quine's paper concern analyticity, the last two concern a priority. Putnam considers the argument in the two last sections as independent of the first four, and at the same time as Putnam criticizes Quine, he also emphasizes his historical importance as the first top rank philosopher to both reject the notion of a priority and sketch a methodology without it.&lt;ref name=Putnam1/&gt;

[[Jerrold Katz]], a one-time associate of [[Noam Chomsky]], countered the arguments of "Two Dogmas" directly by trying to define analyticity non-circularly on the syntactical features of sentences.&lt;ref name=Linsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Katz1/&gt;

In ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 1 : The Dawn of Analysis'', [[Scott Soames]] has pointed out that Quine's circularity argument needs two of the logical positivists' central theses to be effective:&lt;ref name=Soames/&gt;

:All necessary (and all ''a priori'') truths are analytic

:Analyticity is needed to explain and legitimate necessity.

It is only when these two theses are accepted that Quine's argument holds. It is not a problem that the notion of necessity is presupposed by the notion of analyticity if necessity can be explained without analyticity. According to Soames, both theses were accepted by most philosophers when Quine published "Two Dogmas". Today, however, Soames holds both statements to be antiquated. He says: "Very few philosophers today would accept either [of these assertions], both of which now seem decidedly antique."&lt;ref name=Soames/&gt;

==Peikoff's criticisms==
Philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]], in his essay "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy",&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard, "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy" In ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology'' by Ayn Rand, Meridian Press, 1979, p 94 (first published in ''The Objectivist'' May 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; expands upon [[Ayn Rand]]'s analysis. He posits that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy presents men with the following choice: If your statement is proved, it says nothing about that which exists; if it is about existents, it cannot be proved. If it is demonstrated by logical argument, it represents a subjective convention; if it asserts a fact, logic cannot establish it. If you validate it by an appeal to the meanings of your ''concepts'', then it is cut off from reality; if you validate it by an appeal to your ''percepts'', then you cannot be certain of it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To Peikoff, the critical question is: What is included in the meaning of a concept?  He rejects the idea that some of the characteristics of a concept's referents are excluded from the concept.  Applying Rand's theory&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology,'' 2nd edition, Meridian (Penguin Books), 1990 (first published in ''The Objectivist,'' July 1966 - February 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;  that a concept is a "mental integration" of similar existents, treated as "units", he argues that concepts stand for and mean the actual existents, including all their characteristics, not just those used to pick out the referents or define the concept. He states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since a concept is an integration of units, it has no content or meaning apart from its units. The meaning of a concept consists of the units — the existents — which it integrates, including all the characteristics of these units.... The fact that certain characteristics are, at a given time, unknown to man, does not indicate that these characteristics are excluded from the entity — or from the concept.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, he argues that there is no valid distinction between "necessary" and "contingent" facts, and that all truths are learned and validated by the same process: the application of logic to perceptual data.  Associated with the analytic-synthetic dichotomy are a cluster of other divisions that Objectivism also regards as false and artificial, such as logical truth vs. factual truth, logically possible vs. empirically possible, and a priori vs. the a posteriori.

'''Apophatic theology''', also known as '''negative theology''',{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} is a form of [[theology|theological]] thinking and religious practice which attempts to [[Problem of religious language|approach God]], the Divine, by [[negation]], to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is [[God]].{{r|Bunnin_Yu|group=web}} It forms a pair together with [[cataphatic theology]], which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God ''is''.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}

The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of [[mysticism]], which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of [[Perception|ordinary perception]].{{sfn|Belzen|Geels|2003|p=84–87}}

==Etymology and definition==
"Apophatic", {{lang-grc|ἀπόφασις}} ([[adjective]]); from ἀπόφημι ''apophēmi'', meaning "to deny". From ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'': 
{{quote|apophatic (adj.) "involving a mention of something one feigns to deny; involving knowledge obtained by negation", 1850, from Latinized form of Greek ''apophatikos'', from apophasis "denial, negation", from apophanai "to speak off," from apo "off, away from" (see apo-) + phanai "to speak," related to pheme "voice," from PIE root *bha- (2) "to speak, tell, say."{{r|OED|group=web}}}}

''Via negativa'' or ''via negationis'' ([[Latin]]), "negative way" or "by way of denial".{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} The negative way forms a pair together with the ''[[kataphatic]]'' or positive way. According to Deirdre Carabine,
{{quote|Dionysius describes the kataphatic or affirmative way to the divine as the "way of speech": that we can come to some understanding of the Transcendent by attributing all the perfections of the created order to God as its source. In this sense, we can say "God is Love", "God is Beauty", "God is Good". The apophatic or negative way stresses God's absolute transcendence and unknowability in such a way that we cannot say anything about the divine essence because God is so totally beyond being. The dual concept of the immanence and transcendence of God can help us to understand the simultaneous truth of both "ways" to God: at the same time as God is immanent, God is also transcendent. At the same time as God is knowable, God is also unknowable. God cannot be thought of as one or the other only.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}}}

==Origins and development==
According to Fagenblat, "negative theology is as old as philosophy itself;" elements of it can be found in Plato's "unwritten doctrines," while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers. A tendency to apophatic thought can also be found in [[Philo of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}}

According to Carabine, "apophasis proper" in Greek thought starts with Neo-Platonism, with its speculations about the nature of the One, culminating in the works of Proclus.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} According to Carabine, there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} and Meredith even states that Philo "is the real founder of the apophatic tradition."{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} Yet, it was with [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Maximus the Confessor]],{{sfn|Berthold|1985|p=9}} whose writings shaped both [[Hesychasm]], the contemplative tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the mystical traditions of western Europe, that apophatic theology became a central element of Christian theology and contemplative practice.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

==Greek philosophy==
{{See also|Epoché|Pyrrhonism|Skepticism}}

===Pre-Socratic===
For the ancient Greeks, knowledge of the gods was essential for proper worship.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} Poets had an important responsibility in this regard, and a central question was how knowledge of the Divine forms can be attained.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Epiphany (feeling)|Epiphany]] played an essential role in attaining this knowledge.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Xenophanes]] (c. 570 – c. 475 BC) noted that the knowledge of the Divine forms is restrained by the human imagination, and Greek philosophers realized that this knowledge can only be mediated through myth and visual representations, which are culture-dependent.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}

According to [[Herodotus]] (484–425 BCE), [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] (between 750 and 650 BC) taught the Greek the knowledge of the Divine bodies of the Gods.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=51}} The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) describes in his ''[[Theogony]]'' the birth of the gods and creation of the world,{{r|ellopsos|group=web}} which became an "ur-text for programmatic, first-person [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanic]] narratives in Greek literature,"{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}{{refn|group=note|Hesiod's ''Theogony'' was highly referred in the time of [[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), and Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' shows a profound familiarity with Hesiod's ''Theogony''.{{sfn|Boys-Stones|Haubold|2009|p=xiviii}} See also Timaeus e39-e41.{{r|ellopsos|group=web}}}} but also "explores the necessary limitations placed on human access to the divine."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} According to Platt, the statement of the Muses who grant Hesiod knowledge of the Gods "actually accords better with the logic of apophatic religious thought."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Richard G. Geldard: "[M]ore than any other pre-Socratic thinker, Heraclitus embodies the apophatic method. He "unsaid" the myths of the Archaic tradition on his way to transforming the ideas of divinity through the divine Logos. It was a transformation affirmed by Plotinus 800 years later."{{sfn|Geldard|2000|p=23}}}}

[[Parmenides]] (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem ''On Nature'', gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. "The way of conviction" explores Being, true reality ("what-is"), which is "What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109-111}} "The way of opinion" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. His distinction between unchanging Truth and shifting opinion is reflected in Plato's [[allegory of the Cave]]. Together with the Biblical story of Moses's ascent of Mount Sinai, it is used by Gregory of Nyssa and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to give a Christian account of the ascent of the soul toward God.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=111-112}} Cook notes that Parmenides poem is a religious account of a mystical journey, akin to the [[mystery cults]],{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109}} giving a philosophical form to a religious outlook.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}} Cook further notes that the philosopher's task is to "attempt through 'negative' thinking to tear themselves loose from all that frustrates their pursuit of wisdom."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}}

===Plato===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377]]
[[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), "deciding for Parmenides against [[Heraclitus]]" and his theory of eternal change,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} had a strong influence on the development of apophatic thought.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

Plato further explored Parmenides's idea of timeless truth in his dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', which is a treatment of the [[Theory of Forms|eternal forms]], ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'', which are the real aims for knowledge.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The Theory of Forms is Plato's answer to the problem "how one unchanging reality or essential{{clarify|date=July 2017}} being can admit of many changing phenomena (and not just by dismissing them as being mere illusion)."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato argues that the "real objects of knowledge are not the changing objects of the senses, but the immutable Forms,"{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} stating that the ''[[Form of the Good]]''{{refn|group=note|Identified by various commentators with the Form of Unity.{{explain|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}}} is the highest object of knowledge.{{sfn|Kahn|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|See ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' 508d–e, 511b, 516b)}} His argument culminates in the [[Allegory of the Cave]], in which he argues that humans are like prisoners in a cave, who can only see shadows of the Real, the ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} Humans are to be educated to search for knowledge, by turning away from their bodily desires toward higher contemplation, culminating in an intellectual{{refn|group=note|As opposed to mere rationality.}} understanding or apprehension of the Forms, c.q. the "first principles of all knowledge."{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}

According to Cook, the ''Theory of Forms'' has a theological flavour, and had a strong influence on the ideas of his Neo-Platonist interpreters Proclus and Plotinus.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The pursuit of ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'' became a central element in the apophatic tradition,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} but nevertheless, according to Carabine "Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way."{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21}} Carabine warns not to read later Neo-Platonic and Christian understandings into Plato, and notes that Plato did not identify his Forms with "one transcendent source," an identification which his later interpreters made.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21-22}}

===Middle Platonism===
{{Main|Middle Platonism}}

[[Middle Platonism]] (1st century BCE - 3rd century CE){{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} further investigated Plato's "Unwritten Doctrines," which drew on [[Pythagoras]]' first principles of the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] and the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]] (matter).{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} Middle Platonism proposed a [[hierarchy of being]], with God as its first principle at its top, identifying it with Plato's ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} An influential proponent of Middle Platonism was [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]] (c.25 BCE–c. 50 CE), who employed Middle Platonic philosophy in his interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, and asserted a strong influence on early Christianity.{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} According to Craig D. Allert, "Philo made a monumental contribution to the creation of a vocabulary for use in negative statements about God."{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}} For Philo, God is undescribable, and he uses terms which emphasize God's transcendence.{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}}

===Neo-Platonism===
{{Main|Neo-Platonism}}

Neo-Platonism was a mystical or contemplative form of Platonism, which "developed outside the mainstream of Academic Platonism."{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} It started with the writings of Plotinus (204/5–270), and ended with the closing of the Platonic Academy by Emperor Justinian in 529 CE, when the pagan traditions were ousted.{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} It is a product of Hellenistic syncretism, which developed due to the crossover between Greek thought and the Jewish scriptures, and also gave birth to [[Gnosticism]].{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} Proclus was the last head of the Platonic Academy; his student Pseudo-Dinosysius had a far-stretching Neo-Platonic influence on Christianity and Christian mysticism.{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}}

====Plotinus====
[[File:Plotinus.jpg|thumb|left|Plotinus]]
[[Plotinus]] (204/5–270) was the founder of Neo-Platonism.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} In the [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonic philosophy]] of Plotinus and Proclus, the first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' is the first principle, from which everything else emanates.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} He took it from Plato's writings, identifying the Good of the ''Republic'', as the cause of the other Forms, with ''the One'' of the first hypothesis of the second part of the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' precedes the [[Theory of Forms|Forms]],{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} and "is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being."{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} From ''the One'' comes the [[Nous|Intellect]], which contains all the Forms.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} ''The One'' is the principle of Being, while the Forms are the principle of the essence of beings, and the intelligibility which can recognize them as such.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} Plotinus's third principle is Soul, the desire for objects external to the person. The highest satisfaction of desire is the contemplation of ''the One'',{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} which unites all existents "as a single, all-pervasive reality."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}}

''The One'' is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the "presence of the intellect in the human soul,"{{refn|group=note|Compare Korean Chon (Zen) master [[Jinul]]s "tracing back the radiance":&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''"Question: What is the mind of void and calm, numinous awareness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chinul: What has just asked me this question is precisely your mind of void and calm, numinous awareness. Why not trace back its radiance rather than search for it outside? For your benefit I will now point straight to your original mind so that you can awaken to it. Clear your minds and listen to my words."''{{r|Chinul|group=web}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also {{Citation | last =Buswell | first =Robert E. | year =1991 | title =Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen | publisher =University of Hawaii Press}}}} initiating an ascent of the soul by [[Abstraction#In philosophy|abstraction]] or "taking away," culminating in a [[Subitism|sudden appearance]] of ''the One''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=8}} In the ''[[Enneads]]'' Plotinus writes: 
{{quote|Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul [...] To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One.}}

Carabine notes that Plotinus' apophasis is not just a mental exercise, an acknowledgement of the unknowability of ''the One'', but a means to ''[[Ecstasy (philosophy)|extasis]]'' and an ascent to "the unapproachable light that is God."{{r|Carabine_interview|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho, investigating what are Plotinus' methods for reaching ''[[henosis]]'',{{refn|group=note|The Neoplatonic concept of ''henosis'' has precedents in the Greek [[mystery religions]]{{sfn|Angus|1975|p=52}} as well as parallels in [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Gregorios|2002}}}} concludes that "Plotinus' mystical teaching is made up of two practices only, namely philosophy and negative theology."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} According to Moore, Plotinus appeals to the "non-discursive, intuitive faculty of the soul," by "calling for a sort of prayer, an invocation of the deity, that will permit the soul to lift itself up to the unmediated, direct, and intimate contemplation of that which exceeds it (V.1.6)."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho further notes that "for Plotinus, mystical experience is irreducible to philosophical arguments."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} The argumentation about ''henosis'' is preceded by the actual experience of it, and can only be understood when ''henosis'' has been attained.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} Ho further notes that Plotinus's writings have a didactic flavour, aiming to "bring his own soul and ''the souls of others'' by way of [[Nous|Intellect]] to union with the One."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} As such, the ''Enneads'' as a spiritual or ascetic teaching device, akin to ''The Cloud of Unknowing'',{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20-21}} demonstrating the methods of philosophical and apophatic inquiry.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=26}} Ultimately, this leads to silence and the abandonment of all intellectual inquiry, leaving contemplation and unity.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=25-27}}

====Proclus====
[[Proclus]] (412-485) introduced the terminology which is being used in apophatic and cataphatic theology.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} He did this in the second book of his ''Platonic Theology'', arguing that Plato states that ''the One'' can be revealed "through analogy," and that "through negations [''dia ton apophaseon''] its transcendence over everything can be shown."{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} For Proclus, apophatic and cataphonic theology form a contemplatory pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from ''the One'', and cataphonic theology corresponding to the return to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} The analogies are affirmations which direct us toward ''the One'', while the negations underlie the confirmations, being closer to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} According to Luz, Proclus also attracted students from other faiths, including the Samaritan Marinus. Luz notes that "Marinus' Samaritan origins with its Abrahamic notion of a single [[Ineffability|ineffable]] [[Tetragrammaton|Name of God]] ({{Hebrew|יהוה}}) should also have been in many ways compatible with the school's ineffable and apophatic divine principle."{{sfn|Luz|2017|p=149}}

===Apostolic Age===
The [[Book of Revelation]] 8:1 mentions "the silence of the perpetual choir in heaven." According to Dan Merkur,
{{quote|The silence of the perpetual choir in heaven had mystical connotations, because silence attends the disappearance of plurality during experiences of mystical oneness. The term "silence" also alludes to the "still small voice" ([[1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Kings|19:12|HE|}}) whose [[theophany|revelation]] to [[Elijah]] on [[Mount Horeb]] rejected visionary imagery by affirming a negative theology.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=331}}{{refn|group=note|According to Michel Masson, Elijah's theophany is an "apophatic revelation," a mystical experience which is akin to ''nirvana'' and Böhme's ''Ungrund''."

===Early Church Fathers===
The [[Early Church Fathers]] were influenced by [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]]{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} (c. 25 BCE – c. 50 CE), who saw [[Moses]] as "the model of human virtue and Sinai as the archetype of man's ascent into the "luminous darkness" of God."{{sfn|Woloschak|2016}} His interpretation of Moses was followed by Clement of Alexandria, [[Origen]], the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor.{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}}

God's appearance to Moses in the [[burning bush]] was often elaborated on by the Early Church Fathers,{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}} especially [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c. 335 – c. 395),{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}} realizing the fundamental unknowability of God;{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Mayes|2016|p=117]}} an exegesis which continued in the medieval mystical tradition.{{sfn|Glasscoe|1992|p=57]}} Their response is that, although God is unknowable, Jesus as person can be followed, since "following Christ is the human way of seeing God."{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=221}}

[[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150 – c. 215) was an early proponent of apophatic theology.{{sfn|Hägg|2006}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} According to R.A. Baker, in Clement's writings the term ''theoria'' develops further from a mere intellectual "seeing" toward a spirutal form of contemplation.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} Clement's apophatic theology or philosophy is closely related to this kind of ''theoria'' and the "mystic vision of the soul."{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} For Clement, God is transcendent and immanent.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=89}} According to Baker, Clement's apophaticism is mainly driven by Biblical texts, but by the Platonic tradition.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-92}} His conception of an ineffable God is a synthesis of Plato and Philo, as seen from a Biblical perspective.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92}} According to Osborne, it is a synthesis in a Biblical framework; according to Baker, while the Platonic tradition accounts for the negative approach, the Biblical tradition accounts for the positive approach.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-93}} ''Theoria'' and abstraction is the means to conceive of this ineffable God; it is preceded by dispassion.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=98-103}}

According to [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240),
{{quote|[t]hat which is infinite is known only to itself.  This it is which gives some notion of God, while yet beyond all our conceptions{{spndash}}our very incapacity of fully grasping Him affords us the idea of what He really is.  He is presented to our minds in His transcendent greatness, as at once known and unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Apologeticus'', § 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saint [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (313-386), in his ''[[Catechesis|Catechetical]] [[Homily|Homilies]]'', states: 
{{quote|For we explain not what God is but candidly confess that we have not exact knowledge concerning Him.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430) defined God ''aliud, aliud valde'', meaning "other, completely other", in ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' 7.10.16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Mark |editor-last=Vessey |title=A Companion to Augustine |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U8JIm4U05I4C |accessdate=3 July 2016 |year=2012 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]] |id={{ISBN|1-405-15946-4}}|isbn=978-1-405-15946-3 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=wkuVBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=%22aliud,+aliud+valde%22%22%287.10.16%29%22+Confessions+%22other,+completely+other%22 107]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite===
Apophatic theology found its most influential expression in the works of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (late 5th to early 6th century), a student of [[Proclus]] (412-485), combining a Christian worldview with Neo-Platonic ideas.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berthold |first1=George C. |title="Introduction" to Maximus the Confessor.

Dionysius the Areopagite was a pseudonym, taken from [[Acts of the Apostles]] chapter 17, in which [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] gives a [[Areopagus sermon|missionary speech to the court of the Areopagus]] in Athens.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} In {{bibleref2|Acts|17:23|KJV|verse 23}} Paul makes a reference to an altar-inscription, dedicated to the [[Unknown God]], "a safety measure honoring foreign gods still unknown to the Hellenistic world."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} For Paul, Jesus Christ is this unknown God, and as a result of Paul's speech Dionysius the Areopagite converts to Christianity.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}} Yet, according to Stang, for Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite Athens is also the place of Neo-Platonic wisdom, and the term "unknown God" is a reversal of Paul's preaching toward an integration of Christianity with Neo-Platonism, and the union with the "unknown God."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}}

According to Corrigan and Harrington, "Dionysius' central concern is how a triune God, ... who is utterly unknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond even goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of creation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of their source."{{sfn|Corrigan|Harrington|2014}} Drawing on Neo-Platonism, Pseudo-Dionysius described humans [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|ascend to divinity]] as a process of purgation, illumination and union.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}} Another Neo-Platonic influence was his description of the cosmos as a series of hierarchies, which overcome the distance between God and humans.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}}

{{Main|Eastern Orthodox Church}}

In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] apophatic theology is taught as superior to cataphatic theology. The fourth-century [[Cappadocian Fathers]]{{refn|group=note|[[Basil the Great]] (330–379), who was bishop of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]]; Basil's younger brother [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c.332–395), who was bishop of [[Nyssa (Cappadocia)|Nyssa]]; and a close friend, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (329–389), who became [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Commentary on Song of Songs; Letter on the Soul; Letter on Ascesis and the Monastic Life|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4168|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} stated a belief in the existence of God, but an existence unlike that of everything else: everything else that exists was created, but the Creator [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] this existence, is uncreated. The [[essence]] of God is completely unknowable; mankind can know God only through His [[Energies of God|energies]].&lt;ref name="McGinn"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGinn |first=Bernard |chapter=4.

[[John of Damascus]] (c.675/676–749) employed negative theology when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal "not the nature, but the things around the nature."

[[Maximus the Confessor]] (580-622) took over Pseudo-Dionysius' ideas, and had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"/&gt; [[Gregory Palamas]] (1296–1359) formulated the definite theology of [[Hesychasm]], the Orthodox practices of [[contemplative prayer]] and [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], "deification."

Influential modern Eastern Orthodox theologians are [[Vladimir Lossky]], [[John Meyendorff]], [[John S. Romanides]] and [[Georges Florovsky]]. Lossky argues, based on his reading of Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology which is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed in the idea that [[mysticism]] is the expression of dogmatic theology ''par excellence''.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lossky, outside of directly revealed knowledge through [[Scripture]] and [[Sacred Tradition]], such as the Trinitarian nature of God, God in His essence is beyond the limits of what human beings (or even [[angel]]s) can understand. He is [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] in essence (''[[ousia]]''). Further knowledge must be sought in a direct experience of God or His [[Energies of God|indestructible energies]] through ''[[Christian contemplation|theoria]]'' (vision of God).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Lossky|Lossky, Vladimir]] (1997), ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'', Crestwood, N.Y.: [[SVS Press]], p. 81, {{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lossky (1997), ''The Vision of God'', Crestwood, N.Y.: SVS Press, pp. 36–40, {{ISBN|0-913836-19-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle Papanikolaou, in Eastern Christianity, God is [[Immanence|immanent]] in his [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] or existences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle Papanikolaou|Papanikolaou, Aristotle]] (2006), ''Being With God: Trinity, Apophaticism, and Divine–Human Communion'' (1st Edition), Notre Dame, Indiana:[[University of Notre Dame Press]], p. 2, {{ISBN|978-0-268-03830-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Christianity===
Negative theology has a place in the Western Christian tradition as well. The 9th-century theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]] wrote: 
{{quote|We do not know what God is. God Himself does not know what He is because He is not anything [i.e., "not any created thing"]. Literally God ''is not'', because He [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] [[being]].''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=Eriugena+%22We+do+not+know+what+God+is.+God+Himself+does+not+know+what+He+is+because+He+is+not+anything.+Literally+God+is+not%2C+because+He+transcends+being%22 Quote] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When he says "''He is not anything''" and "''God is not''", Scotus does not mean that there is no God, but that God cannot be said to exist in the way that creation exists, i.e. that God is uncreated. He is using apophatic language to emphasise that God is "other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Indick|first1=William|title=The Digital God.

Theologians like [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Saint John of the Cross]] (San Juan de la Cruz) exemplify some aspects of or tendencies towards the apophatic tradition in the West. The medieval work, ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and Saint John's ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]'' are particularly well known. In 1215 apophatism became the official position of the [[Catholic Church]], which, on the basis of [[Religious text#Christianity|Scripture]] and [[Sacred tradition|church tradition]], during the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] formulated the following [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]]:

According to Adrian Langdon,
{{quote|The distinction between univocal, equivocal, and analogous language and relations corresponds to the distinction between the ''via positiva'', via ''negativa'', and ''via eminentiae''.

According to ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', the ''Doctor Angelicus'' and the [[Scholasticism|scholastici]] declare [that] 
{{quote|God is not absolutely unknowable, and yet it is true that we cannot define Him adequately. But we can conceive and name Him in an "analogical way". The perfections manifested by creatures are in God, not merely nominally (''equivoce'') but really and positively, since He is their source. Yet, they are not in Him as they are in the creature, with a mere difference of degree, nor even with a mere specific or generic difference (''univoce''), for there is no common concept including the finite and the Infinite. They are really in Him in a supereminent manner (''eminenter'') which is wholly incommensurable with their mode of being in creatures.

[[C. S. Lewis]], in his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' (1947), advocates the use of negative theology when first thinking about God, in order to cleanse our minds of misconceptions. He goes on to say we must then refill our minds with the truth about God, untainted by mythology, bad [[analogies]] or false mind-pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brazier |first=P.

The mid-20th century Dutch philosopher [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], who is often associated with a neo-Calvinistic tradition, provides a philosophical foundation for understanding why we can never absolutely know God, and yet, paradoxically, truly know something of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friesen|first1=J. Glenn|title=The religious dialectic revisited|url=https://jgfriesen.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/revisited.pdf|website=jgfriesen.files|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dooyeweerd made a sharp distinction between theoretical and pre-theoretical attitudes of thought. Most of the discussion of knowledge of God presupposes theoretical knowledge, in which we reflect and try to define and discuss. Theoretical knowing, by its very nature, is never absolute, always depends on religious presuppositions, and cannot grasp either God or the law side. Pre-theoretical knowing, on the other hand, is intimate engagement, and exhibits a diverse range of aspects. Pre-theoretical intuition, on the other hand, can grasp at least the law side. Knowledge of God, as God wishes to reveal it, is pre-theoretical, immediate and intuitive, never theoretical in nature.&lt;ref name="VanDrunen"&gt;{{cite book |last=VanDrunen |first=David |title=Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms.

[[Ivan Illich]] (1926-2002), the historian and social critic, can be read as an apophatic theologian, according to a longtime collaborator, Lee Hoinacki, in a paper presented in memory of Illich, called "Why Philia?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pudel.uni-bremen.de/pdf/Hoinacki_Clar04_Philia_philia_en.pdf Hoinacki, Lee].&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
According to [[Deirdre Carabine]], negative theology has become a hot topic since the 1990s,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i, viii}} resulting from a broad effort in the 19 and 20th century to portray Plato as a mysticist, which revived the interest in Neoplatonism and negative theology.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i-ii}}

[[Karen Armstrong]], in her book ''[[The Case for God]]'' (2009), notices a recovery of apophatic theology in [[postmodern theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blackburn |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Blackburn |title=All quiet on the God front|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/04/case-for-god-karen-armstrong |date=4 July 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2017 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|Guardian News and Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maimonides-2.jpg|thumb|left|Maimonides]]

[[Maimonides]] (1135/1138-1204) was "the most influential medieval Jewish exponent of the ''via negativa''."{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} Maimonides, but also [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]], draw on [[Bahya ibn Paquda]],{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} who shows that our inability to describe God is related to the fact of His [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|absolute unity]]. God, as the entity which is "truly One" (האחד האמת), must be free of properties and is thus unlike anything else and [[Divine simplicity|indescribable]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} According to Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, Maimonides stated that "[God] is knowledge," and saw His Essence, Being and knowledge as completely one, "a perfect unity and not a composite at all."&lt;ref name="Wineberg"/&gt; Wineberg quotes Maimonides as stating
{{quote|This [form of unity] wherein G‑d’s knowledge and so on is one with G‑d Himself is beyond the capacity of the mouth to express, beyond the capacity of the ear to hear, and beyond the capacity of the heart of man to apprehend clearly.&lt;ref name="Wineberg"&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=7994 ''Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah Ch. 8]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' Maimonides stated:
{{quote|God's existence is absolute and it includes no composition and we comprehend only the fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false assumption to hold that He has any positive [[Abstraction|attribute]] [...] still less has He accidents (מקרה), which could be described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive attribute however, the negative attributes are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must believe [...] When we say of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is impossible; it is living &amp;mdash; it is not dead; [...] it is the first &amp;mdash; its existence is not due to any cause; it has power, wisdom, and will &amp;mdash; it is not feeble or ignorant; [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|He is One]] &amp;mdash; there are not more Gods than one [...] Every attribute predicated of God denotes either the quality of an action, or, when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself &amp;mdash; and not of His actions &amp;mdash; the [[negation]] of the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp.htm 1:58]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Fagenblat, it is only in the modern period that negative theology really gains importance in Jewish thought.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] (1903-1994) was a prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=2}} According to Leibowitz, a person's faith is his commitment to obey God, meaning God's commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person’s image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God's understanding is not man's understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, "God, Man and Nietzsche: A Startling Dialogue between Judaism and Modern Philosophers" (New York: iUniverse, 2008), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian parallels==
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|Shankara]]
There are interesting parallels in Indian thought, which developed largely separate from Western thought. Early [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical]] works which have apophatic themes include the [[Mukhya Upanishads|Principal Upanishads]] (800 BCE to the start of common era) and the [[Brahma Sutras]] (from 450 BCE and 200 CE). An expression of negative theology is found in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], where Brahman is described as "[[neti neti]]" or "neither this, nor that".&lt;ref&gt;Tharaud, Barry. Emerson for the Twenty-First Century: Global Perspectives on an American Icon. Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp, 2010. p. 453. {{ISBN|978-0-87413-091-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further use of apophatic theology is found in the Brahma Sutras, which state:{{Quote|Whenever we deny something unreal, it is in reference to something real.&lt;ref&gt;Verse III.2.22, Brahma-Sutra, Translated by Swami Gambhirananda.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buddhist philosophy]] has also strongly advocated the way of negation, beginning with the Buddha's own theory of [[anatta]] (not-[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]], not-self) which denies any truly existent and unchanging essence of a person. [[Madhyamaka]] is a Buddhist philosophical school founded by [[Nagarjuna]] (2nd-3rd century CE), which is based on a fourfold negation of all assertions and concepts and promotes the theory of emptiness ([[Śūnyatā|shunyata]]). Apophatic assertions are also an important feature of Mahayana sutras, especially the [[Prajnaparamita|prajñaparamita]] genre. These currents of negative theology are visible in all forms of Buddhism.

Apophatic movements in medieval [[Hindu philosophy]] are visible in the works of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] (8th century), a philosopher of [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dualism), and [[Bhartṛhari]] (5th century), a grammarian. While Shankara holds that the transcendent noumenon, [[Brahman]], is realized by the means of negation of every phenomenon including language, Bhartṛhari theorizes that language has both phenomenal and noumenal dimensions, the latter of which manifests Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward|Coward, Harold G.]] and Foshay, Toby. Derrida and Negative Theology. State University of New York, 1992. P. 21. {{ISBN|0-7914-0964-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Advaita, Brahman is defined as being [[Nirguna]] or without qualities. Anything imaginable or conceivable is not deemed to be the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, John.  Responses to One Hundred One Questions on Hinduism. Paulist Press, 1999. P. 75. {{ISBN|0-8091-3845-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taittiriya]] hymn speaks of Brahman as "one where the mind does not reach". Yet the Hindu scriptures often speak of Brahman's positive aspect. For instance, Brahman is often equated with bliss. These contradictory descriptions of Brahman are used to show that the attributes of Brahman are similar to ones experienced by mortals, but not the same. 

Negative theology also figures in the [[Buddhist]] and Hindu [[polemics]]. The arguments go something like this – Is Brahman an object of experience? If so, how do you convey this experience to others who have not had a similar experience? The only way possible is to relate this unique experience to common experiences while explicitly negating their sameness.

==Apophatic theology and atheism==
Even though the ''via negativa'' essentially rejects theological understanding in and of itself as a path to God, some have sought to make it into an intellectual exercise, by describing God only in terms of what God is not. One problem noted with this approach is that there seems to be no fixed basis on deciding what God is not, unless the Divine is understood as an abstract experience of full aliveness unique to each individual consciousness, and universally, the perfect goodness applicable to the whole field of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pondé|first1=Luiz Felipe|title=Crítica e profecia: a filosofia da religião em Dostoiévski |date=2003 |publisher=Editora 34 |location=São Paulo|pages=74–92|isbn=8573262842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apophatic theology is often accused of being a version of [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]], since it cannot say truly that God exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Kvanvig |editor-first=Jonathan |editor-link=Jonathan Kvanvig |year=2015 |chapter=7.

"Negative theology is a complement to, not the enemy of, positive theology".{{sfn|Bryson|2016|p=114}} Since religious experience—or consciousness of the holy or sacred, is not reducible to other kinds of human experience, an abstract understanding of religious experience cannot be used as evidence or proof that religious discourse or praxis can have no meaning or value.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lonergan|Lonergan, Bernard]] (1972), "Method in Theology", New York, N.Y.: Seabury Press, {{ISBN|0-8164-2204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In apophatic theology, the negation of theisms in the ''via negativa'' also requires the negation of their correlative atheisms if the dialectical method it employs is to maintain integrity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Buckley|Buckley, Michael J.]] (2004), "Denying and Disclosing God: The Ambiguous Progress of Modern Atheism", New Haven, C.T.: [[Yale University Press]], pp. 120ff, {{ISBN|0-30009384-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1622">A '''Basic Limiting Principle''' ('''B.L.P.''') is a general principle that limits our explanations [[Metaphysics|metaphysically]] or [[Epistemology|epistemologically]], and which normally goes unquestioned or even unnoticed in our everyday or scientific thinking. The term was introduced by the [[philosopher]] [[C. D. Broad]] in his 1949 paper "The Relevance of Psychical research to Philosophy":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are certain limiting principles which we unhesitatingly take for granted as the framework within which all our practical activities and our scientific theories are confined.  Some of these seem to be self-evident. Others are so overwhelmingly supported by all the empirical facts which fall within the range of ordinary experience and the scientific elaborations of it (including under this heading orthodox psychology) that it hardly enters our heads to question them. Let us call these Basic Limiting Principles."&lt;ref&gt;Broad (1949)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Broad offers nine examples of B.L.P.s, including the principle that there can be no backward causation, that there can be no action at a distance, and that one cannot perceive physical events or material things directly, unmediated by sensations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2533">The concept of '''canon''' is very broad; in a general sense it refers to being a rule or a body of rules.

There are definitions that state it as: “the body of rules, principles, or standards accepted as axiomatic and universally binding in a field of study or art”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/canon |title=Define Canon|publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|date= |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be related to such topics as literary canons or the canons of rhetoric, which is a topic within itself that describes the rules of giving a speech. There are five key principles, and when grouped together, are the principles set for giving speeches as seen with regard to [[Rhetoric]]. This is one such example of how the term canon is used in regard to rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;WordNet 3.1. retrieved 2011-12-03 from: [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=canon&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o8=1&amp;o1=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o9=&amp;o6=&amp;o3=&amp;o4=&amp;h= Canon Search Word.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.C Sayers (1915–1916) established a system of canons of classification Sayers, W.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49217">The '''Dormant Commerce Clause''', or '''Negative Commerce Clause''', in [[American constitutional law]], is a [[legal doctrine]] that courts in the [[United States]] have inferred from the [[Commerce Clause]] in [[Article I of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the [[US Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Norman. "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=700173 Why Congress May Not Overrule the Dormant Commerce Clause]", 53 UCLA L. Rev. 153 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The Dormant Commerce Clause is used to prohibit state legislation that discriminates against interstate or international commerce.

For example, it is lawful for [[Michigan]] to require food labels that specifically identify certain animal parts, if they are present in the product, because the state law applies to food produced in Michigan as well as food imported from other states and foreign countries; the state law would violate the Commerce Clause if it applied only to imported food or if it was otherwise found to favor domestic over imported products. Likewise, [[California]] law requires milk sold to contain a certain percentage of milk solids that federal law does not require, which is allowed under the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine because California's stricter requirements apply equally to California-produced milk and imported milk and so does not discriminate against or inappropriately burden interstate commerce.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Food and Agriculture – Milk Standards "[https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/ahfss/Milk_and_Dairy_Food_Safety/Milk_Standards.html]".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the doctrine==
The idea that regulation of interstate commerce may to some extent be an exclusive Federal power was discussed even before adoption of the Constitution, but the framers did not use the word "dormant". On September 15, 1787, the [[Framers of the Constitution]] debated in [[Philadelphia]] whether to guarantee states the ability to lay duties of [[tonnage]] without Congressional interference so that the states could finance the clearing of [[harbors]] and the building of [[lighthouses]].&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"&gt;2 M. Farrand, [http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_10_3s2.html Records of the Federal Convention of 1787], p. 625 (1937) (1787-09-15).&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Madison]] believed that the mere existence of the Commerce Clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage: "He was more and more convinced that the regulation of Commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority."&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

[[Roger Sherman]] disagreed: "The power of the United States to regulate trade being supreme can control interferences of the State regulations when such interferences happen; so that there is no danger to be apprehended from a concurrent jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"/&gt; Sherman saw the commerce power as similar to the tax power, the latter being one of the [[concurrent powers]] shared by the federal and state governments.  Ultimately, the [[Philadelphia Convention]] decided upon the present language about duties of tonnage in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article I, Section 10]], which says: "No state shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of tonnage ..."&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

The word "dormant," in connection with the Commerce Clause, originated in [[dicta]] of Chief Justice [[John Marshall]]. For example, in the case of ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', {{ussc|22|1|1824}}, he wrote that the power to regulate interstate commerce "can never be exercised by the people themselves, but must be placed in the hands of agents, or lie dormant." Concurring Justice [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]] was even more emphatic that the Constitution is "altogether in favor of the exclusive grants to Congress of power over commerce."

Later, in the case of ''[[Willson v. Black-Bird Creek Marsh Co.]]'', {{ussc|27|245|1829}}, Marshall wrote: "We do not think that the [state] act empowering the Black Bird Creek Marsh Company to place a dam across the creek, can, under all the circumstances of the case, be considered as repugnant to the power to regulate commerce in its dormant state, or as being in conflict with any law passed on the subject."

If Marshall was suggesting that the power over interstate commerce is an [[exclusive federal power]], the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine eventually developed very differently: it treats regulation that does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce as a concurrent power, rather than an exclusive federal power, and it treats regulation that does so as an exclusive federal power. Thus, the modern doctrine says that congressional power over interstate commerce is somewhat exclusive but "not absolutely exclusive".&lt;ref&gt;Pommersheim, Frank.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=DbNdwTo2ENEC&amp;pg=PA41Broken Landscape : Indians, Indian Tribes, and the Constitution: Indians, Indian Tribes, and the Constitution], p. 41 (Oxford University Press 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The approach began in the 1851 case of ''[[Cooley v. Board of Wardens]]'', in which Justice [[Benjamin R. Curtis]] wrote for the Court: "Either absolutely to affirm, or deny that the nature of this [commerce] power requires exclusive legislation by Congress, is to lose sight of the nature of the subjects of this power, and to assert concerning all of them, what is really applicable but to a part."&lt;ref name=Cooley&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=53&amp;page=299 Cooley v. Board of Wardens], 53 U.S. 299 (1851).&lt;/ref&gt;  The first clear holding of the Supreme Court striking down a state law under the Dormant Commerce Clause came in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Reading Railroad v. Pennsylvania, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=82&amp;invol=232 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 232 (1873)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of the doctrine==
Justice Anthony Kennedy has written that: "The central rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism, laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the Constitution was designed to prevent."&lt;ref&gt;C&amp;A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, N.Y., 511 U.S. 383 (1994) (quoting The Federalist No. 22, pp.&amp;nbsp;143&amp;ndash;145 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton);  Madison, Vices of the Political System of the United States, in 2 Writings of James Madison 362&amp;ndash;363 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)).&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to determine whether a law violates a so-called "dormant" aspect of the Commerce Clause, the court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce. In this context, "discrimination" simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.

Thus, in a dormant Commerce Clause case, a court is initially concerned with whether the law facially discriminates against out-of-state actors or has the effect of favoring in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests. Discriminatory laws motivated by "simple economic protectionism" are subject to a "virtually per se rule of invalidity", ''[[City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey]]'' 437 U.S. 617 (1978), ''[[Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison, Wisconsin]]'', 340 U.S. 349 (1951), ''[[Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm.]]'', 432 U.S. 333 (1977) which can only be overcome by a showing that the State has no other means to advance a legitimate local purpose, ''[[Maine v. Taylor]]'', 477 U.S. 131(1986). See also ''[[Brown-Forman Distillers v. New York State Liquor Authority]]'', {{ussc|476|573|1986}}.

On the other hand, when a law is "directed to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental" (United Haulers Association, Inc.), that is, where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade, the Court has adopted a much more flexible approach, the general contours of which were outlined in ''[[Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.]]'', 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970) and ''[[City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey]]'', 437 U.S. at 624.   If the law is not outright or intentionally discriminatory or protectionist, but still has some impact on interstate commerce, the court will evaluate the law using a balancing test. The Court determines whether the interstate burden imposed by a law outweighs the local benefits. If such is the case, the law is usually deemed unconstitutional.  See ''[[Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|397|137|1970}}. In the Pike case, the Court explained that a state regulation having only "incidental" effects on interstate commerce "will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits".  397 U.S. at 142, 90 S.Ct. at 847.  When weighing burdens against benefits, a court should consider both "the nature of the local interest involved, and ... whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities".  Id.  Thus regulation designed to implement public health and safety, or serve other legitimate state interests, but impact interstate commerce as an incident to that purpose, are subject to a test akin to the rational basis test, a minimum level of scrutiny. See ''[[Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc.]]'' In USA Recycling, Inc. v. Town of Babylon, 66 F.3d 1272, 1281 (C.A.2 (N.Y.), 1995), the court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the state activity constitutes "regulation" of interstate commerce, then the court must proceed to a second inquiry: whether the activity  regulates evenhandedly with only "incidental" effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate commerce.  As we use the term here, "discrimination" simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.  The party challenging the validity of a state statute or municipal ordinance bears the burden of showing that it discriminates against, or places some burden on, interstate commerce.  ''[[Hughes v. Oklahoma]]'', 441 U.S. 322, 336, 99 S.Ct. 1727, 1736, 60 L.Ed.2d 250 (1979).  If discrimination is established, the burden shifts to the state or local government to show that the local benefits of the statute outweigh its discriminatory effects, and that the state or municipality lacked a nondiscriminatory alternative that could have adequately protected the relevant local interests.  If the challenging party cannot show that the statute is discriminatory, then it must demonstrate that the statute places a burden on interstate commerce that "is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits."  ''[[Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.]]'', 449 U.S. 456, 471(1981) (quoting Pike, 397 U.S. at 142, 90 S.Ct. at 847).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==State taxation==
Over the years, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the language of the Commerce Clause contains a further, negative command prohibiting certain state taxation even when Congress has failed to legislate on the subject. Examples of such cases are ''[[Quill Corp. v. North Dakota]]'', 504 U.S. 298 (1992); ''[[Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota]]'', 358 U.S. 450, 458 (1959) and ''[[H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond]]'', 336 U.S. 525 (1949).

More recently, in the 2015 case of ''[[Comptroller of Treasury of MD. v. Wynne]]'',&lt;ref name=Wynne&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-485_o7jp.pdf Comptroller of Treasury of MD. v. Wynne] (No. 13-485, May 18, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the Court addressed Maryland's unusual practice of taxing personal income earned in Maryland, and taxing personal income of its citizens earned outside Maryland, ''without'' any tax credit for income tax paid to other states.  The Court held this sort of double-taxation to be a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.&lt;ref name=Wynne /&gt;  The Court faulted Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s criticism of the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine by saying that he failed to "explain why, under his interpretation of the Constitution, the Import-Export Clause 
would not lead to the same result that we reach under the dormant Commerce Clause".&lt;ref name=Wynne /&gt;

Application of the dormant commerce clause to state taxation is another manifestation of the Court's holdings that the Commerce Clause prevents a State from retreating into economic isolation or jeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as a whole, as it would do if it were free to place burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear. The Court's taxation decisions thus "reflected a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic [[Balkanization]] that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the [[Articles of Confederation]]." ''[[Wardair Canada, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue]]'', 477 U.S. 1 (1986); ''[[Hughes v. Oklahoma]]'', 441 U.S. 322 (1979); ''[[Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Jefferson Lines, Inc.]]'', 514 U.S. 175 (1995).

===Formalistic approach===
As with the Court's application of the dormant commerce clause to discriminatory regulation, the pre-[[New Deal]] Court attempted to apply a [[Commerce Clause#Dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence|formalistic approach]] to state taxation alleged to interfere with interstate commerce.  The history is described in ''[[Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Jefferson Lines, Inc.]]'', 514 U.S. 175 (1995):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The command has been stated more easily than its object has been attained, however, and the Court's understanding of the dormant Commerce Clause has taken some turns.   In its early stages, the Court held the view that interstate commerce was wholly immune from state taxation "in any form", "even though the same amount of tax should be laid on (intrastate) commerce".  This position gave way in time to a less uncompromising but formal approach, according to which, for example, the Court would invalidate a state tax levied on gross receipts from interstate commerce, or upon the "freight carried" in interstate commerce, but would allow a tax merely measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce as long as the tax was formally imposed upon franchises,  or "'in lieu of all taxes upon (the taxpayer's) property,'" Dissenting from this formal approach in 1927, Justice Stone remarked that it was "too mechanical, too uncertain in its application, and too remote from actualities, to be of value." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Decline of formalism===
Accompanying the revolution in approach in the Court's Congressional powers jurisprudence, the New Deal Court began to change its approach to state taxation as well. The Jefferson Lines decision continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1938, the old formalism began to give way with Justice Stone's opinion in ''[[Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue]]'', 303 U.S. 250, which examined New Mexico's franchise tax, measured by gross receipts, as applied to receipts from out-of-state advertisers in a journal produced by taxpayers in New Mexico but circulated both inside and outside the State.   Although the assessment could have been sustained solely on prior precedent, Justice Stone added a dash of the pragmatism that, with a brief interlude, has since become our aspiration in this quarter of the law.  ... The Court explained that "[i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business."  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the transition period, some taxes were upheld based on a careful review of the actual economic impact of the tax, and other taxes were reviewed based on the kind of tax involved, whether the tax had a nefarious impact on commerce or not.  Under this formalistic approach, a tax might be struck down, and then re-passed with exactly the same economic incidence, but under another name, and then withstand review.

The absurdity of this approach was made manifest in the two Railway Express cases.  In the first, a tax imposed by the [[U.S. state|state]] of Virginia on [[United States|American]] business concerns operating within the state was struck down because it was a business privilege tax imposed on the privilege of doing business in interstate commerce. But then, in the second, Virginia revised the wording of its statute to impose a "franchise tax" on "intangible property" in the form of "going concern" value as measured by gross receipts.

The Court upheld the reworded statute as not violative of the prohibition on privilege taxes, even though the impact of the old tax and new were essentially identical. There was no real economic difference between the statutes in Railway Express I and Railway Express II. The Court long since had recognized that interstate commerce may be made to pay its way. Yet under the Spector rule, the economic realities in Railway Express I became irrelevant. The Spector rule (against privilege taxes) had come to operate only as a rule of draftsmanship, and served only to distract the courts and parties from their inquiry into whether the challenged tax produced results forbidden by the Commerce Clause.

The death knell of formalism occurred in ''[[Complete Auto Transit, Inc v. Brady]]'', 430 U.S. 274 (1977), [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=430&amp;invol=274] which approved a Mississippi privilege tax upon a Michigan company engaged in the business of shipping automobiles to Mississippi dealers.  The Court there explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Appellant's attack is based solely on decisions of this Court holding that a tax on the "privilege" of engaging in an activity in the State may not be applied to an activity that is part of interstate commerce. See, e. g., ''[[Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor]]'', 340 U.S. 602 (1951); ''[[Freeman v. Hewit]]'', 329 U.S. 249 (1946). This rule looks only to the fact that the incidence of the tax is the "privilege of doing business"; it deems irrelevant any consideration of the practical effect of the tax. The rule reflects an underlying philosophy that interstate commerce should enjoy a sort of "free trade" immunity from state taxation. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Complete Auto Transit is the last in a line of cases that gradually rejected a per se approach to state taxation challenges under the commerce clause.  In overruling prior decisions which struck down privilege taxes per se, the Court noted the following, in what has become a central component of commerce clause state taxation jurisprudence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We note again that no claim is made that the activity is not sufficiently connected to the State to justify a tax, or that the tax is not fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer, or that the tax discriminates against interstate commerce, or that the tax is not fairly apportioned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These four factors, nexus, relationship to benefits, discrimination, and apportionment, have come to be regarded as the four Complete Auto Transit factors applied repeatedly in subsequent cases.  Complete Auto Transit must be recognized as the culmination of the Court's emerging commerce clause approach, not just in taxation, but in all of its aspects.  Application of Complete Auto Transit to State taxation remains a highly technical and specialized venture, requiring the application of commerce clause principles to an understanding of specialized tax law.&lt;!--   How does a federal court decide whether a tax is "fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer", and what deference should the court show to state legislative determinations?  How does the Court determine whether a tax which is facially non-discriminatory should be upheld or struck down?  What level of nexus is required, and how does one determine that a tax is fairly apportioned.  All of these issues belong in an article on the law of local taxation.--&gt;

==Taxation of international commerce==
In addition to satisfying the four-prong test in ''Complete Auto Transit'', the Supreme Court has held state taxes which burden international commerce cannot create a substantial risk of multiple taxations and must not prevent the federal government from "speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments". ''Japan Lines, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles'', 441 U.S. 434 (1979).

In ''Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc. v. Iowa Dept. of Revenue and Finance'', 505 U.S. 71 (1992), the Supreme Court considered a case in which Iowa taxed dividends from foreign subsidiaries, without allowing a credit for taxes paid to foreign governments, but not dividends from domestic subsidiaries operating outside Iowa. This differential treatment arose from Iowa's adoption of the definition of "net income" used by the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. For federal income tax purposes, dividends from domestic subsidiaries are allowed to be exempted from the parent corporations income to avoid double taxation. The Iowa Supreme Court rejected a Commerce Clause claim because Kraft failed to show "that Iowa businesses receive a commercial advantage over foreign commerce due to Iowa's taxing scheme." Considering an Equal Protection Clause challenge, the Iowa Supreme Court held that the use of the federal government's definitions of income were convenient for the state and was "rationally related to the goal of administrative efficiency". The Supreme Court rejected the notion that administrative convenience was a sufficient defense for subjecting foreign commerce to a higher tax burden than interstate commerce. The Supreme Court held that "a State's preference for domestic commerce over foreign commerce is inconsistent with the Commerce Clause even if the State's own economy is not a direct beneficiary of the discrimination."

==Local processing requirements==
Discrimination in the flow of interstate commerce has arisen in a variety of contexts. A line of important cases has dealt with local processing requirements.  Under the local processing requirement, a municipality seeks to force the local processing of raw materials before they are shipped in interstate commerce.

===No local processing preference===
The basic idea of the local processing ordinance was to provide favored access to local processors of locally produced raw materials.  Examples of Supreme Court decisions in this vein are set out in its Carbone decision.  They include ''[[Minnesota v. Barber]]'', 136 U.S. 313, (1890) (striking down a Minnesota statute that required any meat sold within the State, whether originating within or without the State, to be examined by an inspector within the State);  ''[[Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel]]'', 278 U.S. 1 (1928) (striking down a Louisiana statute that forbade shrimp to be exported unless the heads and hulls had first been removed within the State);  ''[[Johnson v. Haydel]]'', 278 U.S. 16 (1928) (striking down analogous Louisiana statute for oysters);  ''[[Toomer v. Witsell]]'', 334 U.S. 385 (1948) (striking down South Carolina statute that required shrimp fishermen to unload, pack, and stamp their catch before shipping it to another State);  ''[[Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.]]'', supra  (striking down Arizona statute that required all Arizona-grown cantaloupes to be packaged within the State prior to export);  ''[[South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke]]'', 467 U.S. 82 (1984) (striking down an Alaska regulation that required all Alaska timber to be processed within the State prior to export).   The Court has defined "protectionist" state legislation as "regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors". ''New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach'', 486 U.S. 269, 273&amp;ndash;74 (1988).

===Carbone: local processing law benefiting private entity===
{{Main|C&amp;A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, New York}}

In the 1980s, spurred by [[RCRA]]'s emphasis on comprehensive local planning, many states and municipalities sought to promote investment in more costly disposal technologies, such as [[waste-to-energy]] incinerators, state-of-the-art landfills, composting and recycling.   Some states and localities sought to promote private investment in these costly technologies by guaranteeing a longterm supply of customers.  See Phillip Weinberg, Congress, the Courts, and Solid Waste Transport:  Good Fences Don't Always Make Good Neighbors, 25 Envtl. L. 57 (1995); Atlantic Coast Demolition &amp; Recycling, Inc., 112 F.3d 652, 657 (3d Cir. 1997).  For about a decade, the use of regulation to channel private commerce to designated private disposal sites was greatly restricted as the result of the Carbone decision discussed below.

Flow control laws typically came in various designs.   One common theme was the decision to fund local infrastructure by guaranteeing a minimum volume of business for privately constructed landfills, incinerators, composters or other costly disposal sites.    In some locales, choice of the flow control device was driven by state bonding laws, or municipal finance concerns.    If a county or other municipality issued general obligation bonds for construction of a costly incinerator, for example, state laws might require a special approval process.  If approval could be obtained, the bonds themselves would be counted against governmental credit limitations, or might impact the governmental body's credit rating: in either instance the ability to bond for other purposes might be impaired.  But by guaranteeing customers for a privately constructed and financed facility, a private entity could issue its own bonds, privately, on the strength of the public's waste assurance.

The private character of flow control regimens can thus be explained in part by the desire to utilize particular kinds of public financing devices.  It can also be explained by significant encouragement at the national level, in national legislation as well as in federal executive policy to achieve environmental objectives utilizing private resources.    Ironically, these public-private efforts often took the form of local processing requirements which ultimately ran afoul of the commerce clause.

The Town of Clarkstown had decided that it wanted to promote waste assurance through a local private transfer station.  The transfer station would process waste and then forward the waste to the disposal site designated by the Town.    The ordinance had the following features:

Waste hauling in the Town of Clarkstown was accomplished by private haulers, subject to local regulation.  The scheme had the following aspects: (A) The Town promoted the financing of a privately owned transfer station through a waste assurance agreement with the private company.     Thus the designated facility was a private company. (B) The Town of Clarkstown forced private haulers to bring their solid waste for local processing at the designated transfer station, even if the ultimate destination of solid waste was an out-of-state disposal site. (C) The primary rationale for forcing in-state waste into the designated private transfer station was financial; it was seen as a device to raise revenue to finance the transfer station.

The Town of Clarkstown's ordinance was designed and written right in the teeth of the long line of Supreme Court cases which had historically struck down local processing requirements. In short, it was as if the authors of the ordinance had gone to a treatise on the commerce clause and intentionally chosen a device which had been traditionally prohibited. A long line of Supreme Court case law had struck down local processing requirements when applied to goods or services in interstate commerce.  As the Court in Carbone wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We consider a so-called flow control ordinance, which requires all solid waste to be processed at a designated transfer station before leaving the municipality.   The avowed purpose of the ordinance is to retain the processing fees charged at the transfer station to amortize the cost of the facility. Because it attains this goal by depriving competitors, including out-of-state firms, of access to a local market, we hold that the flow control ordinance violates the Commerce Clause.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court plainly regarded the decision as a relatively unremarkable decision, not a bold stroke.  As the Court wrote: "The case decided today, while perhaps a small new chapter in that course of decisions, rests nevertheless upon well-settled principles of our Commerce Clause jurisprudence."  And, the Court made it plain, that the problem with Clarkstown's ordinance was that it created a local processing requirement protective of a local private processing company:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this light, the flow control ordinance is just one more instance of local processing requirements that we long have held invalid ... The essential vice in laws of this sort is that they bar the import of the processing service. Out-of-state meat inspectors, or shrimp hullers, or milk pasteurizers, are deprived of access to local demand for their services.  Put another way, the offending local laws hoard a local resource&amp;mdash;be it meat, shrimp, or milk&amp;mdash;for the benefit of local businesses that treat it. 511 U.S. at 392&amp;ndash;393.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United Haulers: local processing law benefiting public entity===
{{main|United Haulers Association v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority}}

The Court's 2007 decision in ''[[United Haulers Association v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority]]'' starkly illustrates the difference in result when the Court finds that local regulation is not discriminatory.  The Court dealt with a flow control regimen quite similar to that considered in Carbone.   The "only salient difference is that the laws at issue here require haulers to bring waste to facilities owned and operated by a state-created public benefit corporation."  The Court decided that the balancing test should apply, because the regulatory scheme favored the government owned facility, but treated all private facilities equally.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Compelling reasons justify treating these laws differently from laws favoring particular private businesses over their competitors. "Conceptually, of course, any notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities." ''[[General Motors Corp. v. Tracy]]'', 519 U.S. 278 (1997). But States and municipalities are not private businesses&amp;mdash;far from it. Unlike private enterprise, government is vested with the responsibility of protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens. See ''[[Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts]]'', 471 U.S. 724 (1985) ... These important responsibilities set state and local government apart from a typical private business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court's United Haulers decision demonstrates an understanding of the regulatory justifications for flow control starkly missing in the Carbone decision:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By the 1980s, the Counties confronted what they could credibly call a solid waste " 'crisis.' "... Many local landfills were operating without permits and in violation of state regulations. Sixteen were ordered to close and remediate the surrounding environment, costing the public tens of millions of dollars. These environmental problems culminated in a federal clean-up action against a landfill in Oneida County; the defendants in that case named over local businesses and several municipalities and school districts as third-party defendants The "crisis" extended beyond health and safety concerns. The Counties had an uneasy relationship with local waste management companies, enduring price fixing, pervasive overcharging, and the influence of organized crime. Dramatic price hikes were not uncommon: In 1986, for example, a county contractor doubled its waste disposal rate on six weeks' notice&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court would not interfere with local government's efforts to solve an important public and safety problem.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The contrary approach of treating public and private entities the same under the dormant Commerce Clause would lead to unprecedented and unbounded interference by the courts with state and local government. The dormant Commerce Clause is not a roving license for federal courts to decide what activities are appropriate for state and local government to undertake, and what activities must be the province of private market competition. In this case, the citizens of Oneida and Herkimer Counties have chosen the government to provide waste management services, with a limited role for the private sector in arranging for transport of waste from the curb to the public facilities. The citizens could have left the entire matter for the private sector, in which case any regulation they undertook could not discriminate against interstate commerce. But it was also open to them to vest responsibility for the matter with their government, and to adopt flow control ordinances to support the government effort. It is not the office of the Commerce Clause to control the decision of the voters on whether government or the private sector should provide waste management services. "The Commerce Clause significantly limits the ability of States and localities to regulate or otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce, but it does not elevate free trade above all other values."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Health and safety regulation==
The history of commerce clause jurisprudence evidences a distinct difference in approach where the state is seeking to exercise its public health and safety powers, on the one hand, as opposed to attempting to regulate the flow of commerce. The exact dividing line between the two interests, the right of states to exercise regulatory control over their public health and safety, and the interest of the national government in unfettered interstate commerce is not always easy to discern.  One Court has written as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not surprisingly, the Court's effort to preserve a national market has, on numerous occasions, come into conflict with the states' traditional power to "legislat[e] on all subjects relating to the health, life, and safety of their citizens."  ''[[Huron Portland Cement Co. v. City of Detroit]]'', 362 U.S. 440, 443 (1960).  On these occasions, the Supreme Court has "struggled (to put it nicely) to develop a set of rules by which we may preserve a national market without needlessly intruding upon the States' police powers, each exercise of which no doubt has some effect on the commerce of the Nation."  ''[[Camps Newfound/Owatonna v. Town of Harrison]]'', 520 U.S. 564, 596 (1997) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing ''[[Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson Lines]]'', 514 U.S. 175, 180&amp;ndash;83 (1995));  see generally [[Boris I. Bittker]], Regulation of Interstate and Foreign Commerce § 6.01[A], at 6&amp;ndash;5 ("[T]he boundaries of the [State's] off-limits area are, and always have been, enveloped in a haze."). Those rules are "simply stated, if not simply applied."  Camps Newfound/Owatonna, 520 U.S. at 596 (Scalia, J., dissenting).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A frequently cited example of the deference afforded to the powers of state and local government may be found in ''[[Exxon Corp. v. Maryland]]'', 437 U.S. 117 (1978), where the State of Maryland barred producers of petroleum products from operating retail service stations in the state. It is difficult to imagine a regimen which might have greater impact on the way in which markets are organized.  Yet, the Court found the legislation constitutionally permitted: "The fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not, by itself establish a claim of discrimination against interstate commerce," the Court wrote.  The "Clause protects interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations."

Similarly, in ''[[Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.]]'', 449 U.S. 456 (1981) the Court upheld a state law that banned nonreturnable milk containers made of plastic but permitted other nonreturnable milk containers.  The Court found that the existence of a burden on out-of-state plastic industry was not 'clearly excessive' in comparison to the state's interest in promoting conservation.  And the court continued:

In Exxon, the Court stressed that the Commerce Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations.  A nondiscriminatory regulation serving substantial state purpose is not invalid simply because it causes some business to shift from a predominantly out-of-state industry to a predominantly in-state industry.  Only if the burden on interstate commerce clearly outweighs the State's legitimate purpose does such a regulation violate the commerce clause.  When a state statute regarding safety matters applies equally to interstate and intrastate commerce, the courts are generally reluctant to invalidate it even if it may have some impact on interstate commerce.  In ''[[Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines]]'' 359 U.S. 520, 524 (1959), the United States Supreme Court stated: 'These safety measures carry a strong presumption of validity when challenged in court.  If there are alternative ways of solving a problem, we do not sit to determine which of them is best suited to achieve a valid state objective.   Policy decisions are for the state legislature, absent federal entry into the field.  Unless we can conclude on the whole record that "the total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from interferences which seriously impede it"  we must uphold the statute.

==Exceptions==
There are two notable exceptions to the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine that can permit state laws or actions that otherwise violate the Dormant Commerce Clause to survive court challenges.

===Congressional authorization===
The first exception occurs when Congress has legislated on the matter. See ''[[Western &amp; Southern Life Ins. v. State Board of California]]'', {{ussc|451|648|1981}}. In this case the Dormant Commerce Clause is no longer "dormant" and the issue is a Commerce Clause issue, requiring a determination of whether Congress has approved, preempted, or left untouched the state law at issue.

===Market participation exception===
The second exception is "[[market participation exception]]". This occurs when the state is acting "in the market", like a business or customer, rather than as a "market regulator".&lt;ref&gt;''[[South-Central Timber Dev., Inc. v. Wunnicke]]'', 467 U.S. 82, 87 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when a state is contracting for the construction of a building or selling maps to state parks, rather than passing laws governing construction or dictating the price of state park maps, it is acting "in the market".  Like any other business in such cases, a state may favor or shun certain customers or suppliers.

The Supreme Court introduced the market participant doctrine in  ''[[Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.]]'', 426 U.S. 794 (1976), which upheld a Maryland program that offered bounties to scrap processors to destroy abandoned automobile hulks. See also ''[[Wisconsin Dep't of Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relations v. Gould Inc.]]'', 475 U.S. 282, 289 (1986); ''[[Reeves, Inc. v. Stake]]'', 447 U.S. 429, 437 (1980).  Because Maryland required out-of-state processors, but not in-state processors, to submit burdensome documentation to claim their bounties, the state effectively favored in-state processors over out-of-state processors. The Court held that because the state was merely attaching conditions to its expenditure of state funds, the Maryland program affected the market no differently than if Maryland were a private company bidding up the price of auto hulks.  Because the state was not "regulating" the market, its economic activity was not subject to the anti-discrimination principles underlying the dormant Commerce Clause&amp;mdash;and the state could impose different paperwork burdens on out-of-state processors. "Nothing in the purposes animating the Commerce Clause prohibits a State, in the absence of congressional action, from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others."

Another important case is ''[[White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc.]]'', in which the Supreme Court held that the City of Boston could require its building contractors to hire at least fifty percent of their workforce from among Boston residents.  460 U.S. at 214&amp;ndash;15. Because all of the employees covered by that mandate were "in a substantial if informal sense, 'working for the city,' " Boston was considered to be simply favoring its own residents through the expenditures of municipal funds.  The Supreme Court stated, "when a state or local government enters the market as a participant it is not subject to the restraints of the Commerce Clause." Id. at 208.  Nothing in the Constitution precludes a local government from hiring a local company precisely because it is local.

Other important cases enunciating the market participation exception principle are ''[[Reeves, Inc. v. Stake]]'', {{ussc|447|429|1980}} and ''[[South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke]]'', {{ussc|467|82|1984}}. The ''Reeves'' case outlines the market participation exception test. In this case state-run cement co-ops were allowed to make restrictive rules (e.g. rules not to sell out-of-state). Here, this government-sponsored business was acting restrictively like an individually owned business and this action was held to be constitutional. ''South-Central Timber'' is important because it limits the market exception. ''South-Central Timber'' holds that the market-participant doctrine is limited in allowing a State to impose burdens on commerce within the market in which it is a participant, but allows it to go no further. The State may not impose conditions that have a substantial regulatory effect outside of that particular market.

The "market participation exception" to the dormant Commerce Clause does not give states unlimited authority to favor local interests, because limits from other laws and Constitutional limits still apply.  In ''[[United Building &amp; Construction Trades Council v. Camden]]'', {{ussc|465|208|1984}}, the city of [[Camden, New Jersey]] had passed an ordinance requiring that at least forty percent of the employees of contractors and subcontractors on city projects be Camden residents. The Supreme Court found that while the law was not infirm because of the Dormant Commerce Clause, it violated the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] of [[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article IV]] of the Constitution. Justice Rehnquist's opinion distinguishes the market-participant doctrine from the privileges and immunities doctrine.  Similarly, Congress has the power itself under the Commerce Clause to regulate and sanction states acting as "market participants", but it lacks power to legislate in ways that violate Article IV.

In the 21st century, the dormant Commerce Clause has been a frequent legal issue in cases arising under state laws regulating some aspects of Internet activity. Because of the interstate, and often international, nature of Internet communications, state laws addressing internet-related subjects such as [[spam (electronic)|spam]], online sales or online pornography can often trigger Dormant Commerce Clause issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldsmith |first=Jack L. |authorlink= |author2=Sykes, Alan O. |year=2001 |title=The Internet and the Dormant Commerce Clause |journal=Yale Law Journal |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=785&amp;ndash;828 |doi=10.2307/797608 |jstor= 797608|quote= |publisher=The Yale Law Journal Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the doctrine==
A "negative" or "dormant" component to the Commerce Clause has been the subject of scholarly discussion for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;FELIX FRANKFURTER, THE COMMERCE CLAUSE UNDER MARSHALL, TANEY AND WAITE 12 (1937) (describing absence of comment during drafting and ratification of Constitution regarding possible negative implications of Commerce Clause); Albert S. Abel, The Commerce Clause in the Constitutional Convention and in Contemporary Comment, 25 Minn. L. Rev. 432, 493 (1941) (arguing that historical evidence "supports the view that, as to the restricted field which was deemed at the time to constitute regulation of commerce, the grant of power to the federal government presupposed the withdrawal of authority ''pari passu'' from the states.").&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Supreme Court Justices [[Antonin Scalia]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tyler Pipe Industries v. Department of Revenue]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=483&amp;invol=232 483 U.S. 232] (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Huddleston]]'', 507 U.S. 60(1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (concurring in enforcement of dormant Commerce Clause on stare decisis grounds)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clarence Thomas]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[United Haulers Assn. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth.]]'', [http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/05-1345_All.pdf 550 U.S. ___] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; have rejected the notion of a Dormant Commerce Clause.  They believe that such a doctrine is inconsistent with an [[Originalism|originalist]] interpretation of the Constitution—so much so that they believe the doctrine is a "judicial fraud".&lt;ref name=Wynne /&gt;

A number of earlier Supreme Court justices also expressed dissatisfaction with the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine.  For example, [[Roger Taney|Chief Justice Taney]] said this in 1847:&lt;ref&gt;License Cases (Thurlow v. Massachusetts; Fletcher v. Rhode Island; Peirce v. New Hampshire), [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=46&amp;invol=504 46 U.S. 504 (1847)].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it was intended to forbid the States from making any regulations of commerce, it is difficult to account for the omission to prohibit it, when that prohibition has been so carefully and distinctly inserted in relation to other powers ... [T]he legislation of Congress and the States has conformed to this construction from the foundation of the government ... The decisions of this court will also, in my opinion, when carefully examined, be found to sanction the construction I am maintaining.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, that statement by Taney in 1847 was before the doctrine morphed in the 1851 case of ''[[Cooley v. Board of Wardens]]'', in which Justice [[Benjamin R. Curtis]] wrote for the Court that the Commerce Clause does not always require "exclusive legislation by Congress".&lt;ref name=Cooley /&gt;

==Puerto Rico==
In ''Trailer Marine Transport Corp. v. Rivera Vázquez'', 977 F.2d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1992), the [[First Circuit]] held that the dormant Commerce Clause applies to [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/977/1/305484/ 977 F.2d 1: Trailer Marine Transport Corp., Plaintiff, Appellee, v. Carmen M. Rivera Vazquez, Etc., et al., Defendants, Appellants]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{English grammar}}
A '''double negative''' is a grammatical construction occurring when two forms of [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]] are used in the same sentence. '''Multiple negation''' is the more general term referring to the occurrence of more than one negative in a [[clause]]. In some languages, double negatives cancel one another and produce an affirmative; in other languages, doubled negatives intensify the negation. Languages where multiple negatives affirm each other are said to have '''negative concord''' or '''emphatic negation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wouden|first1=Ton van der|title=Negative Contexts: Collocation, Polarity and Multiple Negation|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134773336|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d72GAgAAQBAJ&amp;&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and some  dialects of [[English language|English]], such as [[African-American Vernacular English]], are examples of negative-concord languages,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} while [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]] do not have negative concord. It is cross-linguistically observed that negative-concord languages are more common than those without.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Languages without negative concord typically have [[negative polarity]] items that are used in place of additional negatives when another negating word already occurs.  Examples are "ever", "anything" and "anyone" in the sentence "I haven't ever owed anything to anyone" (cf. "I have&lt;u&gt;''n't''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;''never''&lt;/u&gt; owed &lt;u&gt;''nothing''&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;''no one''&lt;/u&gt;" in negative-concord dialects of English, and "&lt;u&gt;''Nunca''&lt;/u&gt; devi &lt;u&gt;''nada''&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;''ninguém''&lt;/u&gt;" in Portuguese, lit. "Never have I owed nothing to no one", or "&lt;u&gt;''Non''&lt;/u&gt; ho &lt;u&gt;''mai''&lt;/u&gt; dovuto &lt;u&gt;''nulla''&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;''nessuno''&lt;/u&gt;" in Italian).  Note that negative polarity can be triggered not only by direct negatives such as "not" or "never", but also by words such as "doubt" or "hardly" ("I doubt he has ever owed anything to anyone" or "He has hardly ever owed anything to anyone").

Stylistically, in English, double negatives can sometimes be used for affirmation (e.g. "I'm not feeling not good"), an  [[understatement]] of the positive ("I'm feeling good").  The rhetorical term for this is [[litotes]].

==English==
===Two negatives resolving to a positive===
When two negatives are used in one independent clause, in standard English the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative:{{rp|see the Robert Lowth citation below}} this is known as [[litotes]]. However, depending on how such a sentence is constructed, in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence. For this reason, it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one's speech is lost. A double negative intensifier does not necessarily require the prescribed steps, and can easily be ascertained by the mood or intonation of the speaker.
* ''There isn't no other way.''

vs.
* ''There isn't no other way!''

These two sentences would be different in how they are communicated by speech. Any assumption would be correct, and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out; thereby rendering the sentence's meaning ambiguous. Since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative, the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence. In light of punctuation, the second sentence can be viewed as the intensifier; and the former being a statement thus an admonishment.
&lt;!-- The following is a clever anecdote but not directly relevant --&gt;
&lt;!-- The context-dependent nature of this rhetorical device in English is illustrated in a well-known linguistic anecdote. Oxford philosopher of language [[J. L. Austin]] gave a lecture in which he noted that there are many languages wherein a double negative makes a positive, but none in which a double positive makes a negative.  From the audience, Columbia philosopher [[Sidney Morgenbesser]] replied, "Yeah, yeah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001314.html|title=IF P, SO WHY NOT Q?|work=Language Log|author=[[Mark Liberman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

In [[standard written English|Standard English]], two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive. This rule was observed as early as 1762, when Bishop [[Robert Lowth]] wrote ''A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical Notes''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last = Fromkin|first = Victoria |author2=Rodman, Robert |author3=Hyams, Nina|title = An Introduction to Language, Seventh Edition|publisher = Heinle|year = 2002|page = 15|isbn = 0-15-508481-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, "I do not disagree" could mean "I certainly agree",  "I agree", "I sort of agree", "I don't understand your point of view", "I have no opinion", and so on; it is a form of "[[weasel word]]s". Further statements are necessary to resolve which particular meaning was intended.

This is opposed to the single negative "I do not agree", which typically means "I disagree". However,  the statement "I do not completely disagree" is a similar double negative to "I do not disagree" but needs little or no clarification.

With the meaning "I completely agree", Lowth would have been referring to [[litotes]] wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out. However, the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work, which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished. Because of this ambiguity, double negatives are frequently employed when making [[back-handed compliments]]. The phrase "Mr. Jones was not incompetent." will seldom mean "Mr. Jones was very competent" since the speaker would have found a more flattering way to say so. Instead, some kind of problem is implied, though Mr. Jones possesses basic competence at his tasks.

===Two or more negatives resolving to a negative===
[[File:friar-canterbury-tales.jpg|thumb|right|The Friar from the [[Ellesmere Chaucer|Ellesmere Manuscript]] of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]’s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'']]
Discussing English grammar, the term "double negative" is often&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition. Op. cit. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/double+negative Merriam-Webster Online]. Accessed 29 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; though not universally&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/double+negative The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language], 4th ed. Houghton Mifflin Co, 2009. Accessed 29 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/double-negative |title=double negative |work=Memidex/WordNet Dictionary |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied to the [[Standard English|non-standard]] use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation.

Double negatives are usually associated with regional and ethnical dialects such as [[Southern American English]], [[African American Vernacular English]], and various British regional dialects. Indeed, they were used in [[Middle English]]. Historically, [[Chaucer]] made extensive use of double, triple, and even quadruple negatives in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. About the Friar, he writes "Ther nas no man no wher so vertuous" ("There never was no man nowhere so virtuous"). About the Knight, "He nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde / In all his lyf unto no maner wight" ("He never yet no vileness didn't say / In all his life to no manner of man").

Following the [[battle of Marston Moor]], [[Oliver Cromwell]] quoted his nephew's dying words in a letter to the boy's father [[Valentine Walton]]: "A little after, he said one thing lay upon his spirit. I asked him what it was. He told me it was that God had not suffered him to be no more the executioner of His enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Cromwell Lord Protector'', at 129, Primus, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-917657-90-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=088_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=God+had+not+suffered+him&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IL07T6XbOqG90AG75pmqCw&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=God%20had%20not%20suffered%20him&amp;f=false John Forster], ''Statesmen of the Commonwealth of England with a Treatise on the Popular Progress in English History'', pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this particular letter has often been reprinted, it is frequently changed to read "not ... to be any more" instead.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Whereas some double negatives may resolve to a positive, in some dialects others resolve to intensify the negative clause within a sentence. For example:
* ''I didn't go nowhere today.
* ''I'm not hungry no more.
* ''You don't know nothing.
* ''There was never no more laziness at work than before.

In contrast, some double negatives become positives:
* ''I didn't '''not''' go to the park today.
* ''We can't '''not''' go to sleep!

The key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives. If a verb is present between the two, the latter negative becomes an intensifier which does not negate the former.  In the first example, the verb ''to go'' separates the two negatives; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb.  Indeed, the word 'nowhere' is thus being used as an [[adverb]] and does not negate the argument of the sentence. One interesting thing to note is that double negatives such as ''I don't want to know no more'' contrasts with Romance languages such as French in ''Je ne veux pas savoir.'' &lt;ref&gt;See the article regarding Romance languages explaining this form of double negation.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception is when the second negative is stressed, as in ''I'm not doing {{em|nothing}}; I'm thinking.''  A sentence can otherwise usually only become positive through consecutive uses of negatives, such as those prescribed in the later examples, where a clause is void of a verb and lacks an adverb to intensify it.  Two of them also use emphasis to make the meaning clearer. The last example is a popular example of a double negative that resolves to a positive. This is because the verb 'to doubt' has no intensifier which effectively resolves a sentence to a positive. Had we added an adverb thus:
* ''I have no doubt never this sentence is false.''

Then what happens is that the verb ''to doubt'' becomes intensified, which indeed deduces that the sentence is indeed false since nothing was resolved to a positive. The same applies to the third example, where the adverb 'more' merges with the prefix ''no-'' to become a negative word, which when combined with the sentence's former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb ''hungry''. Where people think that the sentence ''I'm not hungry no more'' resolves to a positive is where the latter negative ''no'' becomes an adjective which only describes its suffix counterpart ''more'' which effectively becomes a noun, instead of an adverb. This is a valid argument since adjectives do indeed describe the nature of a noun; yet some fail to take into account that the phrase ''no more'' is only an adverb and simply serves as an intensifier. Another argument used to support the position double negatives aren't acceptable is a mathematical analogy: negating a negative number results in a positive one; e.g., {{nowrap|1=− −2 = +2}}; therefore, it is argued, ''I did not go nowhere'' resolves to ''I went somewhere''.

Other forms of double negatives, which are popular to this day and do strictly enhance the negative rather than destroying it, are described thus:

:''I'm not entirely familiar with [[Nihilism]] nor [[Existentialism]].''

Philosophies aside, this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what isn't to be. Opponents of double negatives would have preferred ''I'm not entirely familiar with [[Nihilism]] or [[Existentialism]]''; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence. This form of double negative along with others described are standard ways of intensifying as well as enhancing a negative. The use of 'nor' to emphasise the negative clause is still popular today, and has been popular in the past through works of Shakespeare and Milton:

:''Nor did they not perceive the evil plight''
:''In which they were'' ~ [[John Milton]] - [[Paradise Lost]]

:''I never was, nor never will be'' ~ [[William Shakespeare]] - [[Richard III]]

To the common reader the negatives herein do not cancel each other out but simply emphasizes the negative clause.

Up to the 18th century, double negatives were used to emphasize negation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.american.edu/cas/tesol/resources/upload/Kirby_Philippa.pdf Philippa Kirby], ''Double and Multiple Negatives, p. 2''&lt;/ref&gt; "Prescriptive grammarians" recorded and codified a shift away from the double negative in the 1700s. Double negatives continue to be spoken by those of Vernacular English, such as those of Appalachian English and African American Vernacular English.&lt;ref&gt;''p. 4''&lt;/ref&gt; To such speakers, they view double negatives as emphasizing the negative rather than cancelling out the negatives. Researchers have studied African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and trace its origins back to colonial English.&lt;ref&gt;''p. 5''&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that double negatives were present in colonial English, and thus presumably English as a whole, and were acceptable at that time. English after the 18th century was changed to become more logical and double negatives became seen as canceling each other as in mathematics. The use of double negatives became associated with being uneducated and illogical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/02/grammar-myths-3/], ''Oxford Dictionaries Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Essay towards a practical English Grammar'' of 1711, [[James Greenwood (grammarian)|James Greenwood]] first recorded the rule: "Two Negatives, or two Adverbs of Denying do in English affirm".{{sfn|Kallel|2011|p=131}}  [[Robert Lowth]] stated in his grammar textbook ''A Short Introduction to English Grammar'' (1762) that "two negatives in English destroy one another, or are equivalent to an affirmative".{{sfn|Kallel|2011|p=131}}  Grammarians have assumed that Latin was the model for Lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord, as Latin does not feature it.  Data indicates, however, that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in Standard English by the time of Lowth's grammar, and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism, which was well established by the time it appeared.{{sfn|Kallel|2011|pp=130–131}}

===In film and television===
[[file:I wont not use no double negatives.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Bart Simpson]] attempting his exercise of double negatives in the [[Simpsons]] episode [[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]]]
Double negatives have been employed in various films and television shows. In the film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the [[chimney sweep]] Bert employs a double negative when he says, "If you don't want to go nowhere..." Another is used by the bandits in the "[[stinking badges|Stinking Badges]]" scene of [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'': "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges!".

More recently, the British television show ''[[EastEnders]]'' has received some publicity over the [[Estuary English|Estuary]] accent of character [[Dot Branning]], who speaks with double and triple negatives ("I ain't never heard of no licence.").{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. In the [[Harry Enfield]] sketch "Mr Cholmondley-Warner's Guide to the Working-Class", a stereotypical Cockney employs a septuple-negative: "Inside toilet? I ain't never not heard of one of them nor I ain't nor nothing."

In music, double negatives can be employed to similar effect (as in [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Another Brick in the Wall]]", in which schoolchildren chant "We don't need no education / We don't need no thought control") or used to establish a frank and informal tone (as in [[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]").

==Germanic languages==
Double negation is uncommon in other [[West Germanic languages]]. A notable exception is [[Afrikaans]], where it is mandatory (for example, "He cannot speak Afrikaans" becomes ''Hy kan nie Afrikaans praat nie'', "He cannot Afrikaans speak not"). Dialectal Dutch, French and [[Khoisan languages|San]] have been suggested as possible origins for this trait. Its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as in these examples provided by Bruce Donaldson:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&amp;q=double+negative#v=onepage&amp;q=Ek%20het%20nie%20geweet%20dat%20hy%20sou%20kom%20nie&amp;f=false |title=''A Grammar of Afrikaans'', Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, p. 404 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ek het '''nie''' geweet dat hy sou kom '''nie'''''. ("I did not know that he would be coming.")
* ''Ek het geweet dat hy '''nie''' sou kom '''nie'''''. ("I knew that he would not be coming.")
* ''Hy sal '''nie''' kom '''nie''', want hy is siek''. ("He will not be coming because he is sick.")
* ''Dit is '''nie''' so moeilik om Afrikaans te leer '''nie'''''. ("It is not so difficult to learn Afrikaans.")

Another point of view is that this construction is not really an example of a "double negative" but simply a grammatical template for negation.  The second ''nie'' cannot be understood as a noun or adverb (as can, e.g., ''pas'' in French), and cannot be substituted by any part of speech other than itself with the sentence remaining grammatical.  It is a grammatical particle with no independent meaning that happens to be spelled and pronounced the same as the embedded ''nie'', meaning "not", through historical accident.

The second ''nie'' is used if and only if the sentence or phrase doesn't already end with ''nie'' or another negating adverb.
* ''Ek sien jou '''nie'''''. ("I don't see you")
* ''Ek sien jou '''nooit'''''. ("I never see you")

Afrikaans shares with English the property that two negatives make a positive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} For example,
* ''Ek stem '''nie''' met jou saam '''nie'''''. ("I don't agree with you." )
* ''Ek stem '''nie''' '''nié''' met jou saam '''nie'''''. ("I don't ''not'' agree with you," i.e., I agree with you.)

While double negation is still found in the [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian dialects]] of west [[Flanders]] (e.g., ''Ik ne willen da nie doen'', "I do not want to do that") and in some villages in the central Netherlands such as [[Garderen]], it takes a different form than that found in Afrikaans. In [[Belgian Dutch]] dialects, however, there are still some widely used expressions like ''nooit niet'' ("never not") for "never".

Similar to some dialectal English, [[Austro-Bavarian language|Bavarian]] employs both single and double negation, with the latter denoting special emphasis. For example, compare the Bavarian ''Des hob i no nia ned g'hört'' ("This have I yet never not heard") with the standard German "Das habe ich noch nie gehört". The German emphatic "niemals!" (roughly "never ever") corresponds to Bavarian "(går) nia ned" or even "nie nicht" in Standard German pronunciation.

Another exception is [[Yiddish]]. Due to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] influence, the double (and sometimes even triple) negative is quite common.

A few examples would be:
* איך האב '''קיינמאל''' '''נישט''' געזאגט ("I '''never''' '''didn't''' say")
* איך האב נישט '''קיין''' מורא פאר '''קיינעם''' '''ניט''' "I have '''no''' fear of '''no one not'''")
* It is common to add נישט ("not") after the Yiddish word גארנישט ("nothing"), i.e. איך האב גארנישט נישט געזאגט ("I have said nothing")

==Latin and Romance languages==
While in Latin a second negative word appearing along with ''non'' turns the meaning into a positive one: ''ullus'' means "any", ''nullus'' means "no", ''non...nullus'' (''nonnullus'') means "some". In the same way, ''umquam'' means "ever", ''numquam'' means "never", ''non...numquam'' (''nonnumquam'') means "sometimes", in many Romance languages a second term indicated a negative is required.

[[French grammar#Negation|In French]], the usual way to express negation is to employ two negatives, e.g. ''ne [verb] pas'', ''ne [verb] plus'', or ''ne [verb] jamais'', as in the sentences "Je ne sais pas" ("I do not know"), "Il n'y a plus de baguettes" ("There aren't any more baguettes"), and "On ne sait jamais" ("one never knows"). The second term was originally an emphatic; ''pas'', for example, derives from the Latin ''passus'', meaning "step", so that French ''Je ne marche pas'' and Catalan ''No camino pas'' originally meant "I will not walk a single step." This initial usage spread so thoroughly that it became a necessary element of any negation in the modern French language&lt;ref&gt;There are literary cases in which "ne" can be used without "pas"; many of these are traditional phrases stemming from a time before the emphatic became an essential part of negation.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, in fact, in contemporary French, the original actual negative ''ne'' is mostly left away in favour of ''pas'', as in ''Je sais pas'' "I don't know". In [[Northern Catalan]], ''no'' may be omitted in colloquial language, and [[Occitan language|Occitan]], which uses ''non'' only as a short answer to questions. In [[Venetian language|Venetian]], the double negation ''no ... mìa'' can likewise lose the first particle and rely only on the second: ''magno mìa'' ("I eat not") and ''vegno mìa'' ("I come not"). These exemplify [[Jespersen's cycle]].

[[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] languages usually employ doubled negative [[correlative]]s. Portuguese ''Não vejo nada'', Romanian ''Nu văd nimic'' and Italian ''Non vedo niente''&lt;ref&gt;In Italian a simple–negative phrase, ''Non vedo alcunché'' ("I don't see anything"), is also possible.&lt;/ref&gt; ("I do not see nothing") are used to express "No, I do not see anything". In Italian, a second following negative particle ''non'' turns the phrase into a positive one, but with a slightly different meaning. For instance, while both ''Voglio mangiare'' ("I want to eat") and ''Non voglio non mangiare'' ("I don't want not to eat") mean "I want to eat", the latter phrase more precisely means "I'd prefer to eat".

Other Romance languages employ double negatives less regularly. In [[Asturian language|Asturian]], an extra negative particle is used with negative adverbs: ''Yo nunca nun lu viera'' ("I had not never seen him") means "I have never seen him" and ''A mi tampoco nun me presta'' ("I neither do not like it") means "I do not like it either". Standard Catalan and Galician also used to possess a tendency to double ''no'' with other negatives, so ''Jo tampoc no l'he vista'' or ''Eu tampouco non a vira'', respectively ("I neither have not seen her") meant "I have not seen her either". That practice is dying out.

In 1974, Italy held [[Italian_divorce_referendum,_1974#Confusion_about_voting_methods|a referendum]] on whether to repeal a recent law that allowed divorce.  Voters were said to have been confused in that in order to support divorce, they needed to vote 'no' on the referendum which was worded so that 'yes' would support repeal.  And to reframe the fundamental underlying issue as being support/non-support of the continuation of marriage, then the vote was structured as a triple negative (with divorce as the negation of the continuation of marriage being the first negative).  This referendum was defeated, and without this confusion, it was said that it would have been defeated more decisively.

==Welsh==
In spoken [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the word '''ddim''' (not) often occurs with a prefixed or [[Consonant mutation|mutated]] verb form that is negative in meaning: ''Dydy hi ddim yma'' (word-for-word, "Not-is she not here") expresses "She is not here" and ''Chaiff Aled ddim mynd'' (word-for-word, "Not-will-get Aled not go") expresses "Aled is not allowed to go".

Negative correlatives can also occur with already negative verb forms. In literary Welsh, the mutated verb form is caused by an initial negative particle, '''ni''' or '''nid'''.  The particle is usually omitted in speech but the mutation remains: ''[Ni] wyddai neb'' (word-for-word, "[Not] not-knew nobody") means "Nobody knew" and ''[Ni] chaiff Aled fawr o bres'' (word-for-word, "[Not] not-will-get Aled lots of money") means "Aled will not get much money". This is not usually regarded as three negative markers, however, because the negative mutation is really just an effect of the initial particle on the following word.&lt;ref&gt;

==Greek==
===Ancient Greek===
Doubled negatives are perfectly correct in [[Ancient Greek]].  With few exceptions, a simple negative (οὐ or μή) following another negative (for example, οὐδείς, ''no one'') results in an affirmation: οὐδείς οὐκ ἔπασχε τι ("No one was not suffering") means more simply "Everyone was suffering". Meanwhile, a compound negative following a negative strengthens the negation: μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ("Do not permit no one to raise an uproar") means "Let not a single one among them raise an uproar".

Those constructions apply only when the negatives all refer to the same word or expression. Otherwise, the negatives simply work independently of one another: οὐ διὰ τὸ μὴ ἀκοντίζειν οὐκ ἔβαλον αὐτόν means "It was not on account of their not throwing that they did not hit him", and one should not blame them for not trying.

===Modern Greek===
In [[Modern Greek]], negative concord is standard and more commonly used. For example, the sentence 'You (pl.) will not find anything' can be said in two ways: 'Δε θα βρείτε τίποτα' ('Not will find nothing') is more common than 'Δε θα βρείτε κάτι' ('Not will find something'). It depends simply on the mood of the speaker, and the latter being is considered slightly more polite. An exception to that rule is the (archaic) pronoun ουδείς, also meaning "no one", which does not allow negation of the verb that it governs.

==Slavic languages==
In [[Slavic languages]] other than [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]], multiple negatives are grammatically correct ways to express negation, and a single negative is often incorrect. In complex sentences, every part that could be grammatically negated should be negative. For example, in the [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], ''Ni(t)ko nikad(a) nigd(j)e ništa nije uradio'' ("Nobody never did not do nothing nowhere") means "Nobody has ever done anything, anywhere", and ''Nikad nisam tamo išao/išla'' ("Never I did not go there") means "I have never been there". In Czech it is also common to use  three or more negations. For example, ''Nikdy jsem nikde nikoho neviděl'' ("I have not never seen no one nowhere"). In Russian, "I know nothing" is я ничего не знаю (''ya nichevo nye znayu''), lit. "I nothing don't know."

A single negation, while syntactically correct, may result in a very unusual meaning or make no sense at all. Saying "I saw nobody" in [[Polish language|Polish]] (''Widziałem nikogo'') instead of the more usual "I did not see nobody" (''Nikogo nie widziałem'') might mean "I saw an instance of nobody" or "I saw Mr. Nobody" but it would not have its plain English meaning. Likewise, in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], saying "I do not know anyone" (''{{lang|sl|Ne poznam kogarkoli}}'') in place of "I do not know no one" (''{{lang|sl|Ne poznam nikogar}}'') has the connotation "I do not know just ''anyone''": I know someone important or special.

==Baltic languages==
As with most [[synthetic language|synthetic]] ''[[centum-satem isogloss|satem]]'' languages double negative is mandatory{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Furthermore, all verbs and [[indefinite pronoun]]s in a given statement must be negated, so it could be said that multiple negative is mandatory in Latvian.

For instance, a statement "I have '''not''' &lt;u&gt;ever&lt;/u&gt; owed &lt;u&gt;anything&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;" would be rendered as ''es '''ne'''kad '''ne'''vienam '''ne'''ko '''ne'''esmu bijis parādā''. The only alternative would be using a negating [[subordinate clause]] and [[subjunctive]] in the [[main clause]], which could be approximated in English as "there has '''not''' &lt;u&gt;ever&lt;/u&gt; been an instance that I would have owed &lt;u&gt;anything&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;" ('''''nav''' bijis tā, ka es &lt;u&gt;kādreiz&lt;/u&gt; būtu &lt;u&gt;kādam&lt;/u&gt; bijis &lt;u&gt;kaut ko&lt;/u&gt; parādā''), where negative pronouns (''nekad, neviens, nekas'') are replaced by [[indefinite pronoun]]s (''kādreiz, kāds, kaut kas'') more in line with the English "ever, any" indefinite pronoun structures.

==Uralic languages==
Double or multiple negatives are grammatically required in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] with negative pronouns: ''Nincs semmim'' (word for word: "[doesn't-exists] [nothing-of-mine]", and translates literally as "I do not have nothing") means "I do not have anything". Negative pronouns are constructed by means of adding the prefixes ''se-,'' ''sem-,'' and ''sen-'' to interrogative pronouns.

Something superficially resembling double negation is required also in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which uses the [[auxiliary verb]] ''ei'' to express negation. Negative pronouns are constructed by adding one of the suffixes ''-an,'' ''-än,'' ''-kaan,'' or ''-kään'' to interrogative pronouns: ''Kukaan ei soittanut minulle'' means "No one called me". These suffices are, however, never used alone, but always in connection with ''ei''. This phenomenon is commonplace in Finnish, where many words have alternatives that are required in negative expressions, for example ''edes'' for ''jopa'' ("even"), as in ''jopa niin paljon'' meaning "even so much", and ''ei edes niin paljoa'' meaning "not even so much".

==Turkish==

Negative verb forms are grammatically required in [[Turkish grammar|Turkish]] phrases with negative pronouns or adverbs that impart a negative meaning on the whole phrase. For example, ''Hiçbir şeyim yok'' (literally, word for word, "Not-one thing-of-mine exists-not") means "I don't have anything". Likewise, ''Asla memnun değilim'' (literally, "Never satisfied not-I-am") means "I'm never satisfied".

==Japanese==
Japanese employs [[litotes]] to phrase ideas in a more indirect and polite manner. Thus, one can indicate necessity by emphasizing that not doing something would not be proper. For instance, しなければならない (''shinakereba naranai'', "must") literally means "not doing [it] would not be proper". しなければいけません (''shinakereba ikemasen'', also "must") similarly means "not doing [it] cannot go forward".

Of course, indirectness can also be employed to put an edge on one's rudeness as well. "He has studied Japanese, so he should be able to write kanji" can be phrased 彼は日本語を勉強したから漢字で書けないわけがありません (''kare wa nihongo o benkyō shita kara kanji de kakenai wake ga arimasen''), there is a rather harsher idea: "As he has studied Japanese, the reasoning that he cannot write Kanji does not exist".

==Chinese==
[[Mandarin Chinese]] also employs [[litotes]] in a like manner. One common construction is '''不'''得'''不''' ([[Hanyu Pinyin|Pinyin]]: ''[[wikt:bùdébù|bùdébù]]'', "cannot not"), which is used to express (or feign) a necessity more regretful and polite than that expressed by 必须 (''[[wikt:bìxū|bìxū]]'', "must"). Compared with "我必须走" (''Wǒ bìxū zǒu'', "I must go"), "我'''不'''得'''不'''走" (''Wǒ bùdébù zǒu'', "I cannot not go") tries to emphasize that the situation is out of the speaker's hands and that the speaker has no choice in the matter: "Unfortunately, I have got to go". Similarly, "'''没有'''人'''不'''知道" (''Méiyǒu rén bù zhīdào'', "There is '''not''' a person who does '''not''' know") is a more emphatic way to express "Everyone knows".

Double negatives nearly always resolve to a positive meaning even in colloquial speech, while triple negatives resolve to a negative meaning. For example, "我'''不'''相信'''没'''人'''不'''来" (''Wǒ bù xiāngxìn méi rén bù lái'', "I do '''not''' believe '''no''' one will '''not''' come") means "I do not think everyone will come". However, triple or multiple negatives are considered obscure and are typically avoided.

==History of languages==
[[File:Jespersen's cycle.svg|thumb|250px|An illustration of Jespersen's cycle in French]]
{{main|Jespersen's Cycle}}
Many languages, including all living Germanic languages, French, Welsh and some Berber and Arabic dialects, have gone through a process known as [[Jespersen's cycle]], where an original negative particle is replaced by another, passing through an intermediate stage employing two particles (e.g. [[Old French]] ''jeo ne dis'' → Modern Standard French ''je ne dis pas'' → Modern Colloquial French ''je dis pas'' "I don't say").

In many cases, the original sense of the new negative particle is not negative ''per se'' (thus in French ''pas'' "step", originally "not a step" = "not a bit"), but in Germanic languages, such as English and German the intermediate stage was a case of double negation, as the current negatives ''not'' and ''nicht'' in these languages originally meant "nothing": e.g. [[Old English]] ''ic ne seah'' "I didn't see" &gt;&gt; [[Middle English]] ''I ne saugh nawiht'', lit. "I didn't see nothing" &gt;&gt; [[Early Modern English]] ''I saw not''.&lt;ref&gt;Kastovsky, Dieter. 1991. Historical English syntax. p. 452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelderen, Elly. 2006. ''A history of the English language''. p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar development to a [[circumfix]] from double negation can be seen in non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages, too: for example, in [[Maltese language|Maltese]], ''kiel'' "he ate" is negated as ''ma kielx'' "he did not eat", where the verb is preceded by a negative particle ''ma''- "not" and followed by the particle -''x'', which was originally a shortened form of ''xejn'' "nothing" - thus, "he didn't eat nothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/language/maltesegrammar.htm#ver |title=Grazio Falzon.

In [[optics]], '''Fermat's principle''' or the '''principle of least time''', named after French mathematician [[Pierre de Fermat]], is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.  This principle is sometimes taken as the definition of a ray of light.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schuster]], ''An Introduction to the Theory of Optics'', London: Edward Arnold, 1904 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC03146755&amp;id=X0AcBd-bcCwC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=fermat%27s-principle online].&lt;/ref&gt; However, this version of the principle is not general; a more modern statement of the principle is that rays of light traverse the path of stationary optical length with respect to variations of the path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a ray of light prefers the path such that there are other paths, arbitrarily nearby on either side, along which the ray would take almost exactly the same time to traverse.

Fermat's principle can be used to describe the properties of light rays [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] off mirrors, [[refraction|refracted]] through different media, or undergoing [[total internal reflection]]. It follows mathematically from [[Huygens' principle]] (at the limit of small [[wavelength]]). Fermat's text ''Analyse des réfractions'' exploits the technique of [[adequality]] to derive [[Snell's law]] of [[refraction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[law of reflection]].

Fermat's principle has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] and it is the basis of [[Hamiltonian optics]].

==Modern version==
The time T a point of the electromagnetic wave needs to cover a path between the points '''A''' and '''B''' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;T=\int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \frac{c}{v} \frac{ds}{dt}\, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, ''ds'' an infinitesimal displacement along the ray, ''v'' = ''ds''/''dt'' the speed of light in a medium and ''n'' = ''c''/''v'' the [[refractive index]] of that medium, &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the starting time (the wave front is in '''A'''), &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is the arrival time at '''B'''. The optical path length of a ray from a point '''A''' to a point '''B''' is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;S=\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

and it is related to the travel time by ''S'' = ''cT''. The optical path length is a purely geometrical quantity since time is not considered in its calculation. An [[extremum]] in the light travel time between two points '''A''' and '''B''' is equivalent to an extremum of the optical path length between those two points. The historical form proposed by Fermat is incomplete. A complete modern statement of the variational Fermat principle is that {{quote|the optical length of the path followed by light between two fixed points, '''A''' and '''B''', is an extremum. The optical length is defined as the physical length multiplied by the refractive index of the material."&lt;ref&gt;R. Marques, F. Martin, and M. Sorolla. Metamaterials with Negative Parameters. Wiley, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the context of [[calculus of variations]] this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n \, ds =0 &lt;/math&gt;

In general, the refractive index is a [[scalar field]] of position in space, that is, &lt;math&gt;n=n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[euclidean space]]. Assuming now that light has a component that travels along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis, the path of a light ray may be parametrized as &lt;math&gt;s=\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;nds=n \frac{\sqrt{dx_1^2+dx_2^2+dx_3^2}}{dx_3}dx_3=n \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2} \ dx_3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_k=dx_k/dx_3&lt;/math&gt;. The principle of Fermat can now be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right) \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2}\, dx_3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} L\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_1\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)\, dx_3=0&lt;/math&gt;

which has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] but in which ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; takes the role of time in [[classical mechanics]]. Function &lt;math&gt;L\left(x_1,x_2,\dot{x}_1,\dot{x}_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the optical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] from which the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian (as in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]) formulations of geometrical optics may be derived.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==

Classically, Fermat's principle can be considered as a mathematical consequence of [[Huygens' principle]]. Indeed, of all secondary waves (along all possible paths) the waves with the extremal (stationary) paths contribute most due to constructive interference. Suppose that light waves propagate from A to B by all possible routes AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, unrestricted initially by rules of geometrical or physical optics. The various optical paths AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; will vary by amounts greatly in excess of one wavelength, and so the waves arriving at B will have a large range of phases and will tend to interfere destructively. But if there is a shortest route AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the optical path varies smoothly through it, then a considerable number of neighboring routes close to AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will have optical paths differing from AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by second-order amounts only and will therefore interfere constructively. Waves along and close to this shortest route will thus dominate and AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will be the route along which the light is seen to travel.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Lipson, Stephen G. Lipson, Henry Lipson, ''Optical Physics 4th Edition'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-49345-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermat's principle is the main principle of [[quantum electrodynamics]] which states that any particle (e.g. a photon or an electron) propagates over all available, unobstructed paths and that the interference, or superposition, of its wavefunction over all those paths at the point of observation gives the probability of detecting the particle at this point. Thus, because the extremal paths (shortest, longest, or stationary) cannot be completely canceled out, they contribute most to this interference. In humans, for example, Fermat's principle can be demonstrated in a situation when a lifeguard has to find the fastest way to traverse both beach and water in order to reach a drowning swimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nautil.us/blog/to-save-drowning-people-ask-yourself-what-would-light-do | title=To Save Drowning People, Ask Yourself "What Would Light Do?" | author=Aatish Bhatia | date=24 March 2014 | publisher=Nautilus | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been tested in studies with ants, in which the ants' nest is on one end of a container and food is on the opposite end, but the ants choose to follow the path of least time, rather than the most direct path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://phys.org/news/2013-04-ants-fermat-principle.html | title=Ants follow Fermat's principle of least time | author=Lisa Zyga | date=1 April 2013 | publisher=Phys.org | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[classic mechanics]] of [[wave]]s, Fermat's principle follows from the [[extremum principle of mechanics]] (see [[variational principle]]).

==History==
[[Euclid]], c. 320 BCE in his [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics%201/EuclidCatoptrics.1.html Catoptrics] (on [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.19/Catoptrics.19.html mirrors], including [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.30/Catoptrics.30.html spherical mirrors]) and Optics, laid the foundations for reflection, which was repeated by [[Ptolemy]], and then in his more detailed books that have surfaced, [[Hero of Alexandria]] (Heron) (c. 60) described the principle of reflection, which stated that a ray of light that goes from point A to point B, suffering any number of reflections on flat mirrors in the same medium, has a smaller path length than any nearby path.&lt;ref&gt;History of Geometric Optics/Richard Fitzpatrick&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), expanded the principle to both reflection and refraction, and expressed an early version of the principle of least time. His experiments were based on earlier works on refraction carried out by the Greek scientist [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlos Mihas (2005). [http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf Use of History in Developing ideas of refraction, lenses and rainbow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032208/http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}, Demokritus University, Thrace, Greece.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pierre de Fermat2.png|thumb|140px|Pierre de Fermat]]
The generalized principle of least time in its modern form was stated by Fermat in a letter dated January 1, 1662, to [[Cureau de la Chambre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Sean Mahoney]], ''The Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat, 1601-1665'', 2nd edition (Princeton University Press, 1994), p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; It was met with objections by [[Claude Clerselier]] in May 1662, an expert in optics and leading spokesman for the Cartesians at the time. Amongst his objections, Clerselier states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... The principle which you take as the basis for your proof, namely that Nature always acts by using the simplest and shortest paths, is merely a moral, and not a physical one.  It is not, and cannot be, the cause of any effect in Nature.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The original French, from Mahoney, is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Le principe que vous prenez pour fondement de votre démonstration, à savoir que la nature agit toujours par les voies les plus courtes et les plus simples, n’est qu’un principe moral et non point physique, qui n’est point et qui ne peut être la cause d’aucun effet de la nature.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Fermat's principle does not hold standing alone, we now know it can be derived from earlier principles such as [[Huygens' principle]].

Historically, Fermat's principle has served as a guiding principle in the formulation of physical laws with the use of variational calculus (see [[Principle of least action]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7500">A '''first principle''' is a basic, foundational, self-evident [[proposition]] or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. In [[philosophy]], first principles are taught by [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelians]], and nuanced versions of first principles are referred to as [[postulate]]s by [[Kantian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Bourke, ''Ethics'', (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1966), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mathematics]], first principles are referred to as [[axiom]]s or postulates. In physics and other sciences, theoretical work is said to be from first principles, or ''[[ab initio]]'', if it starts directly at the level of established science and does not make assumptions such as empirical model and parameter fitting.

==In formal logic==
In a formal [[logical system]], that is, a set of [[proposition]]s that are consistent with one another, it is [[Logical possibility|possible]] that some of the statements can be deduced from other statements. For example, in the [[syllogism]], ''"All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates is mortal"'' the last claim can be deduced from the first two.

A first principle is an [[Axiom#Mathematical logic#Logical axioms|axiom]] that cannot be deduced from any other within that system. The classic example is that of [[Euclid's Elements]]; its hundreds of geometric propositions can be deduced from a set of definitions, postulates, and common notions: all three types constitute first principles.

==Philosophy in general==
In philosophy "first principles" are also commonly referred to as ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' terms and arguments, which are contrasted to ''[[a posteriori]]'' terms, reasoning or arguments, in that the former are simply assumed and exist prior to the reasoning process and the latter are deduced or inferred after the initial reasoning process. First principles are generally treated in the realm of philosophy known as [[epistemology]], but are an important factor in any [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation.  

In philosophy "first principles" are often somewhat synonymous with ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'', datum and [[axiomatic reasoning]].

==Aristotle's contribution==
[[Terence Irwin]] writes:
{{quote|When Aristotle explains in general terms what he tries to do in his philosophical works, he says he is looking for "first principles" (or "origins"; archai):
:In every systematic inquiry (methodos) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements. It is clear, then, that in the science of nature as elsewhere, we should try first to determine questions about the first principles. The naturally proper direction of our road is from things better known and clearer to us, to things that are clearer and better known by nature; for the things known to us are not the same as the things known unconditionally (haplôs). Hence it is necessary for us to progress, following this procedure, from the things that are less clear by nature, but clearer to us, towards things that are clearer and better known by nature. (Phys. 184a10–21)
The connection between knowledge and first principles is not axiomatic as expressed in Aristotle's account of a first principle (in one sense) as "the first basis from which a thing is known" (Met. 1013a14–15). The search for first principles is not peculiar to philosophy; philosophy shares this aim with biological, meteorological, and historical inquiries, among others. But Aristotle's references to first principles in this opening passage of the Physics and at the start of other philosophical inquiries imply that it is a primary task of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;

==Descartes==
Profoundly influenced by [[Euclid]], [[Descartes]] was a [[rationalist]] who invented the [[foundationalist]] system of philosophy. He used the ''method of doubt'', now called [[Cartesian doubt]], to systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt, until he was left with what he saw as purely indubitable truths. Using these self-evident propositions as his axioms, or foundations, he went on to deduce his entire body of knowledge from them. The foundations are also called ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truths. His most famous proposition is "Je pense, donc je suis." (''I think, therefore I am'', or ''[[Cogito ergo sum]]'')

Descartes describes the concept of a first principle in the following excerpt from the preface to the ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644):
{{quote|I should have desired, in the first place, to explain in it what philosophy is, by commencing with the most common matters, as, for example, that the word philosophy signifies the study of wisdom, and that by wisdom is to be understood not merely prudence in the management of affairs, but a perfect knowledge of all that man can know, as well for the conduct of his life as for the preservation of his health and the discovery of all the arts, and that knowledge to subserve these ends must necessarily be deduced from first causes; so that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly called [284] philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of those first causes which are called Principles. Now these principles must possess two conditions: in the first place, they must be so clear and evident that the human mind, when it attentively considers them, cannot doubt of their truth; in the second place, the knowledge of other things must be so dependent on them as that though the principles themselves may indeed be known apart from what depends on them, the latter cannot nevertheless be known apart from the former. It will accordingly be necessary thereafter to endeavor so to deduce from those principles the knowledge of the things that depend on them, as that there may be nothing in the whole series of deductions which is not perfectly manifest.&lt;ref&gt;VOL I, Principles, Preface to the French edition. Author’s letter to the translator of the book which may here serve as a preface, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==In physics==
In [[physics]], a calculation is said to be ''from first principles'', or ''[[ab initio]]'', if it starts directly at the level of established laws of physics and does not make assumptions such as empirical [[Physical model|model]] and [[Curve fitting|fitting]] parameters.

For example, calculation of [[electronic structure]] using [[Schrödinger's equation]] within a set of approximations that do not include fitting the model to experimental data is an [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''ab initio'' approach]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8874">[[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|Visual representation of the Pythagorean theorem. Under the proposal the shape seen here would be drawn at vast size on the Siberian tundra using pine trees and fields of wheat.]]
'''Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal''' is an idea attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] for a method to signal extraterrestrial beings by constructing an immense [[right triangle]] and three squares on the surface of the Earth. The shapes would be a symbolical representation of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], large enough to be seen from the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]].

Although credited in numerous sources as originating with Gauss, with exact details of the proposal set out, the specificity of detail, and even whether Gauss made the proposal, have been called into question. Many of the earliest sources do not actually name Gauss as the originator, instead crediting a "German Astronomer" or using other nonspecific descriptors, and in some cases naming a different author entirely. The details of the proposal also change significantly upon different retellings. Nevertheless, Gauss's writings reveal a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]], and that he did, at the least, propose using amplified light using a [[Heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], his own 1818 invention, to signal supposed inhabitants of the Moon.

==Proposal==

==Attribution==
The specificity of the proposal's details as it appears in most later sources—even its attribution to Gauss—is called into question in [[University of Notre Dame]] Professor Michael J. Crowe's 1986 book, ''The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900'', in which he surveys the origins of the Gauss proposal and observes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of this proposal&amp;nbsp;... can be traced through two dozen or more pluralist writings reaching back to the first half of the nineteenth century. When this is done, however, it turns out that the story exists in almost as many forms as its retellings. Furthermore, these versions share one characteristic: Never is reference supplied to where in the writings of Gauss&amp;nbsp;... the [proposal] appear[s]!&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some early sources explored by Crowe for the attribution and form of Gauss's proposal include Austrian astronomer, [[Joseph Johann Littrow]]'s statement in ''Wunder des Himmels'' that "one of our most distinguished geometers"&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; proposed that a geometric figure "for example the well known so-called square of the hypotenuse, be laid out on a large scale, say on a particular broad plain of the earth".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; and Patrick Scott's ''Love in the Moon'', in which a "learned man" is described as proposing a signal formed by a "great plantation of tree" in the form of "47th Proposition of Euclid" in "the great African dessert {{sic}}".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; In ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'' it was written that a Russian savant had proposed to "communicate with the moon by cutting a large figure of the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid on the plains of Siberia, which, he said, any fool would understand".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

In the writings of astronomers [[Asaph Hall]] and of [[Norman Lockyer]], each refer separately to a "German Astronomer" who proposed the method of contact be by "fire signals" from Siberia. Writing in 1902, [[Simon Newcomb]] placed the origin of a Siberian triangle "several hundred miles in extent" not with Gauss, but at the feet of German astronomer [[Franz Xaver von Zach]]. In lectures presented by [[François Arago]] at the [[Paris Observatory]], he named Siberia as the location of an extraterrestrial signaling project advanced by an unnamed "German geometer",&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; but that the signaling method was to be through the use of mirrors, rather than any large symbol drawn upon the Earth.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Despite this version's departure from a geometric figure, the appearance of mirrors as a signaling device has a connection with Gauss's background. Gauss invented the [[Heliotrope (instrument)|Heliotrope]] in 1818,&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight in a manner allowing a {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} square mirror to be seen {{convert|8|mi|km}} away even in sunny weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New American encyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-lDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=1872|editors=George Ripley &amp; Charles A. Dana|volume=IX|publisher=D. Appleton|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss wrote of the heliotrope's potential as a celestial signaling device in a March 25, 1822 letter to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]], by which he reveals a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]]: "With 100 separate mirrors, each of 16 square feet, used conjointly, one would be able to send good heliotrope-light to the moon&amp;nbsp;.... This would be a discovery even greater than that of America, if we could get in touch with our neighbors on the moon."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Finally, in the October 1826 issue of the ''[[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]'' an unnamed author wrote that in a conversation with [[Franz von Gruithuisen]], Gauss stated words to the effect that "the plan of erecting a geometrical figure on the plains of Siberia corresponded with his opinion, because, according to his view a correspondence with the inhabitants of the moon could only be begun by means of such mathematical contemplations and ideas, which we and they have in common."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Crowe concluded in sum that his review of earliest sources failed to confirm the detail of the proposal and Gauss as its author, but that his origination of the idea was not unlikely given the existing evidence.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4637">According to the '''growing block universe theory of time''' (or the '''growing block view'''), the past and present exist and the future does not exist. The present is an objective property, to be compared with a moving spotlight. By the passage of time more of the world comes into being; therefore, the block universe is said to be growing. The growth of the block is supposed to happen in the present, a very thin slice of [[spacetime]], where more of spacetime is continually coming into being.

The growing block view is an alternative to both [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] (according to which past, present, and future all exist) and [[presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]] (according to which only the present exists). It is held to be closer to [[common sense|common-sense]] intuitions than the alternatives. [[C. D. Broad]] was a proponent of the theory (1923). Some modern defenders are [[Michael Tooley]] (in 1997) and [[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]] (in 2004).

==Criticism==
Recently several philosophers, David Braddon-Mitchell (2004), Craig Bourne and [[Trenton Merricks]] have noted that if the growing block view is correct then we have to conclude that we do not know whether now is now. (The first occurrence of "now" is an [[indexical]] and the second occurrence of "now" is the [[objective tensed property]]. Their observation implies the following sentence: "This part of spacetime has the property of being present".)

Take [[Socrates]] discussing, in the past, with [[Gorgias]], and at the same time thinking that the discussion is occurring now. According to the growing block view, [[Grammatical tense|tense]] is a real property of the world so his thought is about now, the objective present. He thinks, tenselessly, that his thought is occurring on the edge of being.  But we know he is wrong because he is in the past; he does not know that now is now. But how can we be sure we are not in the same position? There is nothing special with Socrates. Therefore, we do not know whether now is now.

However, some{{who|date=October 2017}} have argued that there is an ontological distinction between the past and the present. For instance, Forrest (2004) argues that although there exists a past, it is lifeless and inactive. Consciousness, as well as the flow of time, is not active within the past and can only occur at the boundary of the block universe in which the present exists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8778">The '''hypothetico-deductive model''' or  '''method''' is a proposed description of [[scientific method]]. According to it, [[scientific inquiry]] proceeds by formulating a [[hypothesis]] in a form that can be [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]], using a test on observable data where the outcome is not yet known. A test outcome that could have and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis.  A test outcome that could have, but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory.  It is then proposed to compare the explanatory value of competing hypotheses by testing how stringently they are corroborated by their predictions.

==Example==
{{main|Scientific method}}
One example of an algorithmic statement of the hypothetico-deductive method is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003) ''Theory and Reality'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="padding-left:1.25em;text-indent:-1.25em"&gt;
:'''''1'''''. Use your experience: Consider the problem and try to make sense of it. Gather data and look for previous explanations. If this is a new problem to you, then move to step&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''.
:'''''2'''''. Form a conjecture ([[hypothesis]]): When nothing else is yet known, try to state an explanation, to someone else, or to your notebook.
:'''''3'''''. Deduce predictions from the hypothesis: if you assume&amp;nbsp;'''''2''''' is true, what consequences follow?
:'''''4'''''. Test (or [[experiment]]): Look for evidence (observations) that conflict with these predictions in order to disprove&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''. It is a logical error to seek&amp;nbsp;'''''3''''' directly as proof of&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''. This [[formal fallacy]] is called ''[[affirming the consequent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taleb|2007}} e.g., p. 58, devotes his chapter 5 to ''the error of confirmation''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

One possible sequence in this model would be '''''1''''', '''''2''''', '''''3''''', '''''4'''''. If the outcome of '''''4''''' holds, and '''''3''''' is not yet disproven, you may continue with '''''3''''', '''''4''''', '''''1''''', and so forth; but if the outcome of '''''4''''' shows '''''3''''' to be false, you will have to go back to '''''2''''' and try to invent a '''''new 2''''', deduce a '''''new 3''''', look for '''''4''''', and so forth.

Note that this method can never absolutely '''verify''' (prove the truth of) '''''2'''''. It can only '''[[Falsifiability|falsify]]''' '''''2'''''.&lt;ref&gt;"I believe that we do not know anything for certain, but everything probably." —[[Christiaan Huygens]], Letter to Pierre Perrault, 'Sur la préface de M. Perrault de son traité del'Origine des fontaines' [1763], ''Oeuvres Complétes de Christiaan Huygens'' (1897), Vol. '''7''', 298. Quoted in Jacques Roger, ''The Life Sciences in Eighteenth-Century French Thought'', ed. Keith R. Benson and trans. Robert Ellrich (1997), 163. Quotation selected by {{harvnb|Bynum|Porter|2005|p=317}} Huygens 317#4.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is what Einstein meant when he said, "No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong."&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Alice Calaprice (ed. 2005) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton University Press and Hebrew University of Jerusalem, {{ISBN|0-691-12074-9}} p. 291. Calaprice denotes this not as an exact quotation, but as a paraphrase of a translation of A. Einstein's "Induction and Deduction". ''Collected Papers of Albert Einstein'' '''7''' Document 28. Volume 7 is ''The Berlin Years: Writings, 1918-1921''. A. Einstein; M. Janssen, R. Schulmann, et al., eds.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Discussion==
Additionally, as pointed out by [[Carl Hempel]] (1905–1997), this simple view of the scientific method is incomplete; a conjecture can also incorporate probabilities, e.g., the drug is effective about 70% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Murzi, Mauro (2001, 2008), "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hempel.htm Carl Gustav Hempel (1905—1997)]", ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Murzi used the term relative frequency rather than probability.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tests, in this case, must be repeated to substantiate the conjecture (in particular, the probabilities). In this and other cases, we can quantify a probability for our confidence in the conjecture itself and then apply a [[Bayesian analysis]], with each experimental result shifting the probability either up or down. [[Bayes' theorem]] shows that the probability will never reach exactly 0 or 100% (no absolute certainty in either direction), but it can still get very close to either extreme. See also [[confirmation holism]].

Qualification of corroborating evidence is sometimes raised as philosophically problematic. The [[raven paradox]] is a famous example. The hypothesis that 'all ravens are black' would appear to be corroborated by observations of only black ravens. However, 'all ravens are black' is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to 'all non-black things are non-ravens' (this is the [[contraposition]] form of the original implication). 'This is a green tree' is an observation of a non-black thing that is a non-raven and therefore corroborates 'all non-black things are non-ravens'. It appears to follow that the observation 'this is a green tree' is corroborating evidence for the hypothesis 'all ravens are black'.  Attempted resolutions may distinguish:
* non-falsifying observations as to strong, moderate, or weak corroborations
* investigations that do or do not provide a potentially falsifying test of the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[John N.W. Watkins]] (1984), ''Science and Skepticism'', p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence contrary to a hypothesis is itself philosophically problematic. Such evidence is called a [[falsifiability|falsification]] of the hypothesis. However, under the theory of [[confirmation holism]] it is always possible to save a given hypothesis from falsification. This is so because any falsifying observation is embedded in a theoretical background, which can be modified in order to save the hypothesis.  Popper acknowledged this but maintained that a critical approach respecting methodological rules that avoided such ''immunizing stratagems'' is conducive to the progress of science.&lt;ref&gt;Karl R. Popper (1979, Rev. ed.), ''Objective Knowledge'', pp. 30, 360.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] claims the model ignores [[underdetermination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/07/03/what-is-science/ |author=Sean Carroll |title=What is Science?}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''The hypothetico-deductive model (or approach) versus other research models'''

The hypothetico-deductive approach contrasts with other research models such as the inductive approach or grounded theory. In the data percolation methodology, 
the hypothetico-deductive approach is included in a paradigm of pragmatism by which four types of relations between the variables can exist: descriptive, of influence, longitudinal or causal. The variables are classified in two groups, structural and functional, a classification that drives the formulation of hypotheses and the statistical tests to be performed on the data so as to increase the efficiency of the research. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Mesly |first= Olivier | date= 2015 |title= Creating Models in Psychological Research | location= United States | publisher= Springer Psychology  |pages= 126  |ISBN = 978-3-319-15752-8}}

[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Plato]], one of the first philosophers to discuss ideas in detail. Aristotle claims that many of Plato's views were [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] in origin.]]
In [[philosophy]], '''ideas''' are usually taken as [[mental representation]]al images of some [[object (philosophy)|object]]. Ideas can also be [[abstraction|abstract]] [[concept]]s that do not present as mental images.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Audi|editor1-first=Robert|title=Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-40224-7|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[philosophers]] have considered ideas to be a fundamental [[ontological]] [[category of being]]. The capacity to [[creativity|create]] and [[understanding|understand]] the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of [[human|human beings]]. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious [[introspection|reflection]], for example, when we talk about the ''idea'' of a person or a place. A new or original idea can often lead to [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeytimes.com/ideas/312/What_is_an_Idea/ |title=What is an Idea? |year=2011 |work=AeyTimes Idea Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''idea'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἰδέα|ἰδέα]] ''idea'' "form, pattern," from the root of ἰδεῖν ''idein'', "to see." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/idea |title=Definition of ''idea'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innate and adventitious ideas==
{{Main|Innate idea}}
One view on the nature of ideas is that there exist some ideas (called ''innate ideas'') which are so general and abstract that they could not have arisen as a representation of an object of our [[perception]] but rather were in some sense always present. These are distinguished from ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas/ adventitious ideas]'' which are images or concepts which are accompanied by the judgment that they are caused or occasioned by an external object.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"/&gt;

Another view holds that we only discover ideas in the same way that we discover the real world, from personal experiences. The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from [[nurture]] (life experiences) is known as ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate"). Most of the confusions in the way ideas arise is at least in part due to the use of the term "idea" to cover both the representation perceptics and the object of conceptual thought. This can be always illustrated in terms of the scientific doctrines of [[innate idea]]s, "[[abstract object|concrete ideas]] versus [[abstraction|abstract ideas]]", as well as "simple ideas versus complex ideas".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-02-894950-1}} {{ISBN|978-0-02-894950-5}} Vol 4: 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Plato===
{{main|Theory of Forms}}
[[Plato]] in [[Ancient Greece]] was one of the earliest philosophers to provide a detailed discussion of ideas and of the thinking process (it must be noted that in Plato's Greek the word ''idea'' carries a rather different sense from our modern English term). Plato argued in dialogues such as the ''Phaedo'', ''Symposium'', ''Republic'', and ''Timaeus'' that there is a realm of ideas or forms (''eidei''), which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas, and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge, for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties, ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are. Consequently, Plato seems to assert forcefully that material things can only be the objects of opinion; real knowledge can only be had of unchanging ideas. Furthermore, ideas for Plato appear to serve as universals; consider the following passage from the ''Republic'':
{{quote|
"We both assert that there are," I said, "and distinguish in speech, many fair things, many good things, and so on for each kind of thing."

"Yes, so we do."

"And we also assert that there is a fair itself, a good itself, and so on for all things that we set down as many. Now, again, we refer to them as one ''idea'' of each as though the ''idea'' were one; and we address it as that which really ''is''."

"That's so."

"And, moreover, we say that the former are seen, but not intellected, while the ''ideas'' are intellected but not seen."|Plato|Bk. VI 507b-c}}

===René Descartes===
[[Descartes]] often wrote of the meaning of ''idea'' as an image or representation, often but not necessarily "in the mind", which was well known in the [[vernacular]]. Despite that Descartes is usually credited with the invention of the non-Platonic use of the term, he at first followed this vernacular use.&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' he says, "Some of my thoughts are like images of things, and it is to these alone that the name 'idea' properly belongs." He sometimes maintained that ideas were [[innate idea|innate]] &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 196–198&lt;/ref&gt; and uses of the term ''idea'' diverge from the original primary scholastic use. He provides multiple non-equivalent definitions of the term, uses it to refer to as many as six distinct kinds of entities, and divides ''ideas'' inconsistently into various genetic categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas Descartes's Ideas]&lt;/ref&gt; For him knowledge took the form of ideas and philosophical investigation is the deep consideration of these entities.

===John Locke===
In striking contrast to Plato's use of idea &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 487–503&lt;/ref&gt; is that of [[John Locke]]. In his Introduction to [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], Locke defines ''idea'' as "that term which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm, notion, species, or whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking; and I could not avoid frequently using it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |wslink=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding/Introduction |section=Introduction |first=John |last=Locke |at=§ What Idea stands for.|year=1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he regarded the book necessary to examine our own abilities and see what objects our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. In his philosophy other outstanding figures followed in his footsteps — Hume and Kant in the 18th century, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in the 19th century, and [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Karl Popper]] in the 20th century. Locke always believed in ''good sense'' — not pushing things to extremes and on taking fully into account the plain facts of the matter. He considered his common-sense ideas "good-tempered, moderate, and down-to-earth."

As John Locke studied humans in his work “An Essay Concerning Human Understanding” he continually referenced Descartes for ideas as he asked this fundamental question: “When we are concerned with something about which we have no certain knowledge, what rules or standards should guide how confident we allow ourselves to be that our opinions are right?” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding." (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions.&lt;/ref&gt; A simpler way of putting it is how do humans know ideas, and what are the different types of ideas. An idea to Locke “can simply mean some sort of brute experience.” &lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, John R. Starting with Mill. Continuum, 2010. Starting With. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true &amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344063&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that there are “No innate principles in the mind.”.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding" (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he concludes that “our ideas are all experiential in nature.” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; An experience can either be a sensation or a reflection: “consider whether there are any innate ideas in the mind before any are brought in by the impression from sensation or reflection.” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, an idea was an  experience in which the human mind apprehended something.

In a Lockean view, there are really two types of ideas: complex and simple. Simple ideas  are the building blocks for much more complex ideas, and “While the mind is wholly passive in the reception of simple ideas, it is very active in the building of complex ideas…” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct= true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex ideas, therefore, can either be modes, substances, or relations. Modes are when ideas are combined in order to convey new information. For instance, David Banach &lt;ref&gt;Banach, David. "Locke on Ideas." Locke on Ideas. St. Anselm College, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; gives the example of beauty as a mode. He says that it is the combination of color and form. Substances, however, is different. Substances are certain objects, that can either be dogs, cats, or tables. And relations represent the relationship between two or more ideas.  In this way, Locke did, in fact, answer his own questions about ideas and humans.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume|Hume]] differs from Locke by limiting ''idea'' to the more or less vague mental reconstructions of perceptions, the perceptual process being described as an "impression." &lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Idea |volume=14 |pages=280–281 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 74–90&lt;/ref&gt; Hume shared with Locke the basic empiricist premise that it is only from life experiences (whether their own or others') that humans' knowledge of the existence of anything outside of themselves can be ultimately derived, that they shall carry on doing what they are prompted to do by their emotional drives of varying kinds. In choosing the means to those ends, they shall follow their accustomed associations of ideas.&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; Hume has contended and defended the notion that "reason alone is merely the 'slave of the passions'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#inmo |title=Hume's Moral Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David: A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects. (1739–40)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Printing4 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|left|thumb|135px|"Modern Book Printing" from the [[Walk of Ideas]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] defines an ''idea'' as opposed to a ''[[Concept#A priori concepts|concept]]''. "Regulative ideas" are ideals that one must tend towards, but by definition may not be completely realized. [[Liberty]], according to Kant, is an idea. The [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of the rational and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] is opposed to the [[determinism]] of the [[empirical]] subject.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 305–324&lt;/ref&gt; Kant felt that it is precisely in knowing its limits that philosophy exists. The business of philosophy he thought was not to give rules, but to analyze the private judgements of good common sense.&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;

===Rudolf Steiner===
Whereas Kant declares limits to knowledge ("we can never know the thing in itself"), in his [[epistemological]] work, [[Rudolf Steiner]] sees ''ideas'' as "objects of experience" which the mind apprehends, much as the eye apprehends light. In ''[[Goethean Science]]'' (1883), he declares, "Thinking ... is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colors and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas." He holds this to be the premise upon which [[Goethe]] made his natural-scientific observations.

===Wilhelm Wundt===
[[Wundt]] widens the term from Kant's usage to include ''conscious representation of some object or process of the external world''. In so doing, he includes not only ideas of [[memory]] and [[imagination]], but also [[perceptual]] processes, whereas other [[psychologist]]s confine the term to the first two groups.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; One of Wundt's main concerns was to investigate conscious processes in their own context by [[experiment]] and [[introspection]]. He regarded both of these as ''exact methods'', interrelated in that experimentation created optimal conditions for introspection. Where the experimental method failed, he turned to other ''objectively valuable aids'', specifically to ''those products of cultural communal life which lead one to infer particular mental motives. Outstanding among these are speech, myth, and social custom.'' Wundt designed the basic mental activity [[apperception]] — a unifying function which should be understood as an activity of the will. Many aspects of his empirical physiological psychology are used today. One is his principles of mutually enhanced contrasts and of [[assimilation (philosophy)|assimilation]] and dissimilation (i.e. in color and form perception and his advocacy of ''objective'' methods of expression and of recording results, especially in language. Another is the principle of heterogony of ends — that multiply motivated acts lead to unintended side effects which in turn become motives for new actions.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 8: 349–351&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Sanders Peirce===
[[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] published the first full statement of [[pragmatism]] in his important works "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) and "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877).&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Sanders Peirce#Pragmatism|Peirce's pragmatism]]&lt;/ref&gt; In "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" he proposed that a ''clear idea'' (in his study he uses [[concept]] and ''idea'' as synonymic) is defined as one, when it is apprehended such as it will be recognized wherever it is met, and no other will be mistaken for it. If it fails of this clearness, it is said to be obscure. He argued that to understand an idea clearly we should ask ourselves what difference its application would make to our evaluation of a proposed solution to the problem at hand. [[Pragmatism]] (a term he appropriated for use in this context), he defended, was a method for ascertaining the meaning of terms (as a theory of meaning). The originality of his ideas is in their rejection of what was accepted as a view and understanding of knowledge by scientists for some 250 years, i.e. that, he pointed, knowledge was an impersonal fact. Peirce contended that we acquire knowledge as ''participants'', not as ''spectators''. He felt "the real", sooner or later, is information acquired through ideas and knowledge with the application of logical reasoning would finally result in. He also published many papers on logic in relation to ''ideas''.

===G. F. Stout and J. M. Baldwin===
[[George Stout|G. F. Stout]] and [[James Mark Baldwin|J. M. Baldwin]], in the ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', define ''idea'' as "the reproduction with a more or less adequate [[image]], of an object not actually present to the senses."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Baldwin/Dictionary Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that an idea and a perception are by various authorities contrasted in various ways. "Difference in degree of intensity", "comparative absence of bodily movement on the part of the subject", "comparative dependence on mental activity", are suggested by psychologists as characteristic of an idea as compared with a [[perception]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

It should be observed that an idea, in the narrower and generally accepted sense of a mental reproduction, is frequently composite. That is, as in the example given above of the idea of a chair, a great many objects, differing materially in detail, all call a single idea. When a man, for example, has obtained an idea of chairs in general by comparison with which he can say "This is a chair, that is a stool", he has what is known as an "abstract idea" distinct from the reproduction in his mind of any particular chair (see [[abstraction]]). Furthermore, a complex idea may not have any corresponding physical object, though its particular constituent elements may severally be the reproductions of actual perceptions. Thus the idea of a [[centaur]] is a complex mental picture composed of the ideas of [[man]] and [[horse]], that of a [[mermaid]] of a [[woman]] and a [[fish]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==In anthropology and the social sciences==
[[Diffusion (anthropology)|Diffusion]] studies explore the spread of ideas from culture to culture. Some anthropological theories hold that all cultures imitate ideas from one or a few original cultures, the Adam of the Bible, or several cultural circles that overlap. Evolutionary diffusion theory holds that cultures are influenced by one another but that similar ideas can be developed in isolation.

In the mid-20th century, social scientists began to study how and why ideas spread from one person or culture to another.  [[Everett Rogers]] pioneered [[diffusion of innovations]] studies, using research to prove factors in adoption and profiles of adopters of ideas. In 1976, in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] suggested applying biological [[evolution]]ary theories to the spread of ideas. He coined the term ''[[meme]]'' to describe an abstract unit of [[Selection (biology)|selection]], equivalent to the [[gene]] in [[evolutionary biology]].

==Semantics==

===Samuel Johnson===
[[James Boswell]] recorded [[Samuel Johnson]]'s opinion about ideas. Johnson claimed that they are [[mental image]]s or internal visual pictures. As such, they have no relation to words or the concepts which are designated by verbal names.

{{Quotation|He was particularly indignant against the almost universal use of the word ''idea'' in the sense of ''notion'' or ''opinion'' when it is clear that ''idea'' can only signify something of which an image can be formed in the mind. We may have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of a mountain, a tree, a building; but we cannot surely have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of an ''argument'' or ''proposition''. Yet we hear the sages of the law 'delivering their ''ideas'' upon the question under consideration;' and the first speakers in parliament 'entirely coinciding with the ''idea'' which has been ably stated by an honourable member;' — or 'reprobating an ''idea'' unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free country.' Johnson called this 'modern cant.'|Boswell's [[Life of Johnson]]|Tuesday, 23 September 1777}}

==Relationship of ideas to modern legal time- and scope-limited monopolies==
{{main|Intellectual property|Idea-expression divide}}

===Relationship between ideas and patents===

====On susceptibility to exclusive property====
{{Quotation|It has been pretended by some, (and in England especially,) that inventors have a natural and exclusive right to their inventions, and not merely for their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs. But while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even a hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance.

By a universal law, indeed, whatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed an exclusive and stable property.

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He, who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at my mine, receives light without darkening me.

Those ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and personal act but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8Article 1, Section 8] (Electronic resources from the University of Chicago Press Books Division)&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Thomas Jefferson]], letter to [[Isaac V. McPherson|Isaac McPherson]], 13 August 1813}}

To protect the cause of invention and innovation, the legal constructions of Copyrights and Patents were established. [[Patent]] law regulates various aspects related to the functional manifestation of inventions based on new ideas or incremental improvements to existing ones. Thus, patents have a direct relationship to ideas.

===Relationship between ideas and copyrights===

[[File:Crystal Clear app ktip.svg|thumb|150px|A picture of a [[Incandescent light bulb|lightbulb]] is often used to represent a person having a ''bright'' ''idea''.]]
In some cases, authors can be granted limited [[legal]] monopolies on the manner in which certain works are expressed. This is known colloquially as [[copyright]], although the term [[intellectual property]] is used mistakenly in place of ''copyright''. Copyright law regulating the aforementioned monopolies generally does not cover the actual ideas. The law does not bestow the legal status of [[property]] upon ideas per se. Instead, laws purport to regulate events related to the usage, copying, production, sale and other forms of exploitation of the fundamental expression of a work, that may or may not carry ideas. Copyright law is fundamentally different from [[patent]] law in this respect: patents do grant monopolies on ideas (more on this below).

A [[copyright]] is meant to regulate some aspects of the usage of expressions of a work, ''not'' an idea. Thus, copyrights have a negative relationship to ideas.

Work means a tangible medium of expression. It may be an original or derivative work of art, be it literary, dramatic, musical recitation, artistic, related to sound recording, etc. In (at least) countries adhering to the Berne Convention, copyright automatically starts covering the work upon the original creation and fixation thereof, without any extra steps. While creation usually involves an idea, the idea in itself does not suffice for the purposes of claiming copyright.&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"&gt;[http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/02/15/protecting-ideas-can-ideas-be-protected-or-patented/id=48009/ Protecting Ideas: Can Ideas Be Protected or Patented?] – article by [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/author/gene-quinn-2/ Gene Quinn] at [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/ Ipwatchdog], February 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright protection extends to a description, explanation, or illustration of an idea or system, assuming that the requirements of copyright law are met. Copyright in such a case protects the particular literary or pictorial expression chosen by the author. But it gives the copyright owner no exclusive rights concerning the idea, method or system involved. ''CIT : [https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ31.pdf US Copyright Office], circular 31 reviewed: 01 ⁄ 2012 P&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''In the case of copyright law, it is the work that realizes the idea that is protected (i.e. a document), and it is the act of recording that work that fixes copyright in the item itself.'' – CIT : [https://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/protect/p21_protecting_ideas The UK Copyright Service], Issued: 17th May 2007, Last amended: 17th May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''(…) there is likely to be an infringement of copyright if the way the information is expressed in the copyrighted work used without the permission of the copyright owner and no exception to infringement applies to the use.

&lt;ref&gt;''Intellectual property consists of products, work or processes that you have created and which give you a competitive advantage. There are 3 subcategories : '''Industrial property''' : inventions (patents), trademarks, industrial designs, new varieties of plants and geographic indications of origin '''Artistic work''' protected by copyright: original literary and artistic works, music, television broadcasting, software, databases, architectural designs, advertising creations and multimedia '''Commercial strategies''' : trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality agreements, or rapid production.'' – CIT : [https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/start-grow/intellectual-property-rights/index_en.htm Intellectual property rights], [https://europa.eu/ European Union], Updated 22/01/2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship of ideas to confidentiality agreements===
Confidentiality and [[nondisclosure agreements]] are legal instruments that assist corporations and individuals in keeping ideas from escaping to the general public. Generally, these instruments are covered by contract law.

{{rquote|right|The fundamental error of modern times lies in the fact that the '''yawning abyss of quality in the difference between God and man''' has been removed. The result in dogmatic theology is a mockery of God ...|[[Søren Kierkegaard]]|''Journals'', November 20, 1847&lt;ref name="Journals1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |others=translated by Alexander Dru |title=Journals of Søren Kierkegaard |publisher=Oxford |date=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;

The '''infinite qualitative distinction''' ({{lang-da|den uendelige kvalitative forskel}}; {{lang-de|unendliche qualitative Unterschied}}), sometimes translated as '''infinite qualitative difference''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Søren |last=Kierkegaard |title=Training in Christianity, and the Edifying discourse which 'accompanied' it |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T9BXAAAAYAAJ |date=1941 |others=Transl. by [[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=T9BXAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22the+infinite+qualitative+difference+between+God+and+man%22 139 ("the infinite qualitative difference between God and man")]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept coined by the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. The distinction emphasizes the very different attributes of finite and temporal men and the infinite and eternal qualities of a supreme being. This concept fits into the [[apophatic theology#20th_century|apophatic theology]] tradition and therefore is fundamentally at odds with theological theories which posit a supreme being able to be fully understood by man. The theologian [[Karl Barth]] made the concept of infinite qualitative distinction a cornerstone of his theology.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, 2006, pp. 225-227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
For Kierkegaard, direct communication with God is impossible, as the idea of God and man are infinitely different. He argues that indirect communication with God is the only way of communication. For example, in [[Christian]] belief, the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] posits that [[Jesus Christ]] is God incarnate. The infinite qualitative distinction is opposed to rational theology in the sense that, whereas the latter argues one can prove empirically Jesus is God incarnate, the former argues that [[empirical evidence]] is ultimately insufficient in making that conclusion. The paradoxical nature of the Incarnation, that God is embodied in a man, is offensive to reason, and can only be comprehended indirectly, through [[faith]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorrien, Gary. ''The Barthian revolt in modern theology''. Westminster Press, 1999. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barth's book ''[[The Epistle to the Romans (Barth)|The Epistle to the Romans]]'' also emphasizes such a gulf. In the preface to the Second Edition of his commentary, Barth writes, "if I have a system, it is limited to a recognition of what Kierkegaard called the 'infinite qualitative distinction' between time and eternity, and to my regarding this as possessing negative as well as positive significance: 'God is in heaven, and thou art on earth'. The relation between such a God and such a man, and the relation between such a man and such a God, is for me the theme of the Bible and the essence of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Barth |authorlink=Karl Barth |title=The Epistle to the Romans |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dCEDzQhI4R4C&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1968 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=3OrYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22if+I+have+a+system,+it+is+limited+to+a+recognition+of+what+Kierkegaard+called+the+'+infinite+qualitative+distinction+'+between+time+and+eternity,+and+to+my+regarding+this+as+possessing+negative+as+well+as+positive+significance%22 1933] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19500294-6 |id={{ISBN|978-0-195-00294-2}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=dCEDzQhI4R4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22if+I+have+a+system,+it+is+limited+to+a+recognition+of+what+Kierkegaard+called+the+'+infinite+qualitative+distinction+'+between+time+and+eternity,+and+to+my+regarding+this+as+possessing+negative+as+well+as+positive+significance%22 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard doesn't believe God is so objective toward human beings but rather that he is the absolute subjective being. He put it this way in 1846: {{Quotation|The subjective thinker is a dialectician dealing with the existential, and he has the passion of thought requisite for holding fast to the qualitative disjunction. But on the other hand, if the qualitative is applied in empty isolation, if it is applied to the individual in an altogether abstract fashion, one may risk saying something infinitely decisive and be quite correct in what one says, and yet, ludicrously enough, say nothing at all. Hence it is a psychologically noteworthy phenomenon, that the absolute disjunction may be used quite disingenuously, precisely for the purpose of evasion. When the death-penalty is affixed to every crime, it ends in no crime being punished at all.  So also in the case of the injunction. Applied abstractly it becomes an unpronounceable mute letter, or if pronounced, it says nothing. The subjective thinker has the absolute disjunction ready to hand; therefore, as an essential existential moment he holds it fast with a thinker’s passion, but he holds it as a last decisive resort, to prevent everything from being reduced to merely quantitative differences. He holds it in reserve, but does not apply it so as by recurring to it abstractly to inhibit existence. Hence the subjective thinker adds to his equipment aesthetic and ethical passion, which gives him the necessary concreteness. All existential problems are passionate problems, for when existence is interpenetrated with reflection it generates passion.

== Global version ==

Suppose a system is represented as

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\mathbf{x}} = f \left(\mathbf x \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of variables, with

: &lt;math&gt; f \left( \mathbf 0 \right) = \mathbf 0. &lt;/math&gt;

If a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;  (negative semidefinite),

then the set of [[accumulation point]]s of any trajectory is contained in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; is the union of complete trajectories contained entirely in the set &lt;math&gt; \{\mathbf x : \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. 

If we additionally have that the function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   for all  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; V( \mathbf 0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and if &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; contains no trajectory of the system except the trivial trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t) = \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the origin is [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is radially unbounded, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt; V(\mathbf x) \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;, as     &lt;math&gt; \Vert \mathbf x \Vert \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;

then the origin is globally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Local version ==

If 
: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   when  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;

hold only for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x &lt;/math&gt; in some neighborhood &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of the origin, and the set

: &lt;math&gt; \{ \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \} \bigcap D &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectories of the system besides the trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t)=\mathbf 0, t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the local version of the invariance principle states that the origin is locally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Relation to Lyapunov theory ==

If &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} ( \mathbf x) &lt;/math&gt; is [[negative definite]], the global asymptotic stability of the origin is a consequence of [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. The invariance principle gives a criterion for asymptotic stability in the case when &lt;math&gt;\dot{V} ( \mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]].

== Example: the pendulum with friction ==

This section will apply the invariance principle to establish the local [[asymptotic stability]] of a simple system, the pendulum with friction. This system can be modeled with the differential equation {{ref|nd1}}

:&lt;math&gt; m l \ddot{\theta} = - m g \sin \theta - k l \dot{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle the pendulum makes with the vertical normal, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the pendulum, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the pendulum,  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction coefficient]], and [[standard gravity|''g'']] is acceleration due to gravity.

This, in turn, can be written as the system of equations

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_1 = x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_2 = -\frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 - \frac{k}{m} x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Using the invariance principle, it can be shown that all trajectories which begin in a ball of certain size around the origin &lt;math&gt;x_1 = x_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; asymptotically converge to the origin. We define &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; V(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} (1 - \cos x_1) + \frac{1}{2} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; is simply the scaled energy of the system {{ref|nd2}} Clearly, &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2) &lt;/math&gt; is [[positive definite]] in an open ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; around the origin. Computing the derivative,

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 \dot{x}_1 + x_2 \dot{x}_2 =  - \frac{k}{m} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Observe that &lt;math&gt;V(0) = \dot{V}(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If it were true that &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we could conclude that every trajectory approaches the origin by [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. Unfortunately, &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]]. However, the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

which is simply the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | x_2 = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectory of the system, except the trivial trajectory '''x''' = '''0'''. Indeed, if at some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;, then because 
&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; away from the origin, &lt;math&gt; \sin x_1 \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the trajectory will not stay in the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

All the conditions of the local version of the invariance principle are satisfied, and we can conclude that every trajectory that begins in some neighborhood of the origin will converge to the origin as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt; {{ref|tw1}}.

== History ==
The general result was independently discovered by [[Joseph P. LaSalle|J.P. LaSalle]] (then at [[Research Institute for Advanced Studies|RIAS]]) and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|N.N. Krasovskii]], who published in 1960 and 1959 respectively. While [[Joseph P. LaSalle|LaSalle]] was the first author in the West to publish the general theorem in 1960, a special case of the theorem was in communicated in 1952 by Barbashin and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]], followed by a publication of the general result in 1959 by [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]] {{ref|vid}}.

'''Logic models''' are hypothesized descriptions of the chain of causes and effects (see [[Causality]]) leading to an outcome of interest (e.g. prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, annual traffic collision, etc). While they can be in a narrative form, logic model usually take form in a graphical depiction of the "if-then" (causal) relationships between the various elements leading to the outcome. However, the logic model is more than the graphical depiction: it is also the theories, scientific evidences, assumptions and beliefs that support it and the various processes behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Renger R |date=2002|title=A Three-Step Approach to Teaching Logic Models |journal=The American Journal of Evaluation |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=493–503 |doi=10.1016/s1098-2140(02)00230-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Frechtling_2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frechtling|first=Joy A. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Logic Models|date=2015 |work=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|pages=299–305|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-097086-8.10549-5|isbn=978-0-08-097087-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the logic model ==

===Program planning===
One of the most important uses of the logic model is for program planning. It is suggested to use the logic model to focus on the intended outcomes of a particular program. The guiding questions change from "what is being done?" to "what needs to be done"? McCawley suggests that by using this new reasoning, a logic model for a program can be built by asking the following questions in sequence:

# What is the current situation that we intend to impact?
# What will it look like when we achieve the desired situation or outcome?
# What behaviors need to change for that outcome to be achieved?
# What knowledge or skills do people need before the behavior will change?
# What activities need to be performed to cause the necessary learning?
# What resources will be required to achieve the desired outcome?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.d.umn.edu/~kgilbert/educ5165-731/Readings/The%20Logic%20Model.pdf|title=The logic model for program planning and evaluation|last=McCawley|first=Paul F. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=University of Idaho Extension|year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By placing the focus on ultimate outcomes or results, planners can ''think backward'' through the logic model to identify how best to achieve the desired results. Here it helps managers to 'plan with the end in mind', rather than just consider inputs (e.g. budgets, employees) or the tasks that must be done.

===Evaluation===
The logic model is often used in [[government]] or not-for-profit organizations, where the mission and vision are not aimed at achieving a financial benefit. Traditionally, government programs were described only in terms of their [[budget]]s.  It is easy to measure the amount of money spent on a program, but this is a poor indicator of outcomes. Likewise it is relatively easy to measure the amount of work done (e.g. number of workers or number of years spent), but the workers may have just been 'spinning their wheels' without getting very far in terms of ultimate results or outcomes.

However, nature of outcomes varies. To measure the progress toward outcomes, some initiatives may require an ad hoc measurement instrument. In addition, in programs such as in [[education]] or [[social program]]s, outcomes are usually in the long-term and may requires numerous intermediate changes (attitudes, social norm, industry practices, etc.) to advance progressively toward the outcomes.

By making clear the intended outcomes and the causal pathways leading to them, a program logic model provides the basis upon which planners and evaluators can develop a measurement plan and adequate instruments. Instead of only looking at the outcome progress, planners can open the "black box" and examine if the intermediate outcomes progress as planned. In addition, the pathways of numerous outcomes are still largely misunderstood due their complexity, their unpredictability and lack of scientific / practical evidences. Therefore, with proper research design, one may not only assess the progress of intermediate outcomes, but evaluate as well if the program theory of change is accurate, i.e. is successful change of an intermediate outcomes provokes the hypothesized subsequent effects in the causal pathway. Finally, outcomes may easily be achieved through processes independent of the program and an evaluation of those outcomes would suggest program success when in fact external outputs were responsible for the outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = Peter H | last1 = Rossi | first2 = Mark W | last2 = Lipsey | first3 = Howard E | last3 = Freeman | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evaluation : a systematic approach |date=2004|publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-0894-4|edition=7th |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |oclc=52706526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Various types of logic models ==

=== The Inputs --&gt; Activities --&gt; Outputs --&gt; Outcomes template ===
Many authors and guides use the following template when speaking about logic model:&lt;ref name="Frechtling_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LM_EE" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McLaughlin |first=John A. |last2=Jordan |first2=Gretchen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Using Logic Models |date=2015-10-14 |work=Handbook of Practical Program Evaluation |pages=62–87 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |doi=10.1002/9781119171386.ch3 |isbn=978-1-119-17138-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Many refinements and variations{{Which|date=October 2018}} have been added to the basic template. For example, many versions of logic models set out a series of outcomes/impacts, explaining in more detail the logic of how an intervention contributes to intended or observed results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Weiss CH | date = 1972 | title = Evaluation Research. Methods for Assessing Program Effectiveness. | publisher = Prentice-Hall, Inc. | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others often distinguish short-term, medium-term and long-term results, and between direct and indirect results.

=== Intervention Mapping logic models ===
[[File:Logic_Model_of_the_Problem_for_Management_information_Decision_Support_Epilepsy_Tool.jpg|thumb|Logic Model of the Problem for Management information Decision Support Epilepsy Tool (MINDSET program) from Ruiter, DeSmet and Schneider (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shegog R, Begley CE | title = Clinic-Based Mobile Health Decision Support to Enhance Adult Epilepsy Self-Management: An Intervention Mapping Approach | journal = Frontiers in Public Health | volume = 5 | pages = 256 | date = 2017 | pmid = 29043247 | pmc = 5632356 | doi = 10.3389/fpubh.2017.00256 | quote = The full intervention mapping based protocol is available in the full article }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Bartholomew et al. [[Intervention mapping|Intervention Mapping]] approach&lt;ref name="Eldredge_2016" /&gt; makes an extensive use of logic model through the whole life-cycle of a health promotion program. Since this method can start from as far as a vague desired outcomes (authors example is a city whose actors decide to address "health issues" of the city), planners goes through various steps in order to develop effective interventions and properly evaluate them (see [[Intervention Mapping]] entry for a more detailed account). Distinguishable but closely interweave logic models with different purposes are being developed through the process:

* '''Logic model of the problem''', which is a graphical depiction of at-risk population and its social environment behaviours (factors) leading to the health problem and their respective causal pathways (attitudes, beliefs, skills, etc.). This may include as well at-risk population physical environment related causes such as polluants or lack of physical activity infrastructure and their respective causes, i.e. environmental agents behaviours leading to the physical environment causes and their respective causal pathways;
* Once the most relevant behaviours and causal pathways are identified, planners develop a '''logic model of change'''. This is a model of behavioural changes (performance objective) that should happen and their corresponding necessary changes higher in the cause-effects chain.
* Finally, a '''logic model of the intervention''' is developed. This model describe the various activities that will happen and the cascades of effects they are expected to cause toward the desired outcome.

Evaluators thereafter use the logic model of the intervention to design a proper evaluation plan to assess [[Program evaluation#Assessing implementation|implementation]], [[Program evaluation#Assessing the impact (effectiveness)|impact]] and [[Program evaluation#Assessing efficiency|efficiency]].

==Advantages==
By describing work in this way, managers have an easier way to define the work and measure it.  [[Performance measurement|Performance measures]] can be drawn from any of the steps.  One of the key insights of the logic model is the importance of measuring final outcomes or results, because it is quite possible to waste time and money (inputs), "spin the wheels" on work activities, or produce outputs without achieving desired outcomes.  It is these outcomes (impacts, long-term results) that are the only justification for doing the work in the first place.  For commercial organizations, outcomes relate to [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].  For [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] or [[governmental organization]]s, outcomes relate to successful achievement of mission or program goals.

==Disadvantages==
There are some potential disadvantages of logic models due to tendencies toward oversimplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The logic model guidebook : better strategies for great results | first1 = Lisa Wyatt | last1 = Knowlton | first2 = Cynthia C | last2 = Phillips | last3 =Phillips | first3 = Cynthia | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013|publisher=SAGE C.|isbn=978-1-4522-1675-1|edition=2nd|location=Los Angeles|oclc=791492618}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
#Program logic is no guarantee of actual logic in how the program may work. The world is complex, and some situations cannot be ascertained before they are implemented, so some programs may even progress against the "logic" of the model.
#It is a partial representation of a complex system.
#It is a representation of reality, not reality itself. Programs are not linear
#Normally, it does not include effects besides those initially expected.
#They do not necessarily establish causality. Many factors exert influence upon the effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12870">The phrase '''man bites dog''' is a shortened version of an [[aphorism]] in [[journalism]] which describes how an unusual, infrequent event (such as a man biting a dog) is more likely to be reported as news than an ordinary, everyday occurrence with similar consequences, such as a [[dog bite|dog biting a man]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues/ Owen Spencer-Thomas  ''News Values''. Accessed October 15, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; An event is usually considered more newsworthy if there is something unusual about it; a commonplace event is less likely to be seen as newsworthy, even if the consequences of both events have objectively similar outcomes. The result is that rarer events more often appear as news stories, while more common events appear less often, thus distorting the perceptions of news consumers of what constitutes normal rates of occurrence.

The phenomenon is also described in the journalistic saying, "You never read about a plane that did not crash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06257/721583-152.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=There's news in planes that don't crash | date=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was coined by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe]] (1865–1922), a British newspaper magnate, but is also attributed to ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' editor John B. Bogart (1848–1921): "When a dog bites a man, that is not news, because it happens so often. But if a man bites a dog, that is news."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', 16th edition, ed. Justin Kaplan (Boston, London, and Toronto: Little, Brown, 1992), p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Luther Mott]] (1941) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G3tWmzirWwoC American Journalism. A History of Newspapers in the United States through 250 Years, 1690 to 1940]''&lt;/ref&gt; The quote is also attributed to [[Charles Anderson Dana]] (1819–1897).&lt;ref&gt;Recollections of the Civil War By Charles Anderson Dana, Charles E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9709">The '''marginal propensity to save''' ('''MPS''') is the fraction of an increase in [[income]] that is not spent on an increase in [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. That is, the marginal propensity to save is the proportion of each additional dollar of household income that is used for [[saving]]. It is the slope of the line plotting saving against income.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, O. (2006). Macroeconomics. (Fourth ed., p. 59). Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a household earns one extra dollar, and the marginal propensity to save is 0.35, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. Likewise, it is the fractional decrease in saving that results from a decrease in income.

The MPS plays a central role in [[Keynesian economics]] as it quantifies the saving-income relation, which is the flip side of the consumption-income relation, and according to [[Keynes]] it reflects the [[fundamental psychological law]]. The marginal propensity to save is also a key variable in determining the value of the [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]].

==Calculation==

MPS can be calculated as the change in savings divided by the change in income.

:&lt;math&gt;MPS=\frac{\text{Change in Savings}}{\text{Change in Income}}&lt;/math&gt;

Or mathematically, the marginal propensity to save (MPS) function is expressed as the derivative of the savings (S) function with respect to [[disposable income]] (Y).

:&lt;math&gt;MPS=\frac{dS}{dY}&lt;/math&gt;  where, dS=Change in Savings and dY=Change in income.

===An example===

::{| class="wikitable"
|-
! width=20%| 
!! width=40%| Saving
!! width=40%| Income
|-
| align="center" | A
| align="center" | 200
| align="center" | 1000
|-
| align="center" | B
| align="center" | 400
| align="center" | 1500
|}

Now, MPS can be calculated as follows:

: '''Change in savings''' = (400-200) = 200

: '''Change in income''' = (1500-1000) = 500

MPS = (Change in savings) / (Change in income)
  
: so, MPS = 200/500 = '''0.4'''

This implies that for each additional one unit of income, the savings increase by 0.4.

There are different implications of this above-mentioned formula.

* First it quantifies induced savings.Induced saving is the portion of saving that responds to changes in income.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Marks,  [http://www.agsm.edu.au/bobm/teaching/MM/lect04.pdf "Macroeconomics for manager"], Lecture Series, March 1997, Australian Graduate School of Management, University of New South Wales&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, induced saving can be defined as the household saving that depends on income or production (especially disposable income, national income, or even gross domestic product).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&amp;c=dsp&amp;k=induced+saving "Induced Savings"], AmosWEB LLC, Economic WEB*pedia,2010-2011.[Accessed: November 8, 2011] Web.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Second, it is a measure of slope of the savings function.

====Value====

Since MPS is measured as ratio of change in savings to change in income, its value lies between 0 and 1.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, O. (2006). Macroeconomics. (Fourth ed., p. 59). Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, marginal propensity to save is opposite of marginal propensity to consume.

Mathematically, in a closed economy, '''MPS + MPC = 1''',&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, G., &amp; Yeuh, L. (2006). Macroeconomics. (p. 23). Italy: Thomson Learning Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahuja, H. L. (2008). Macroeconomics : Theories and policies. (14th ed., pp. 125-126). Delhi: S.Chand and Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; since an increase in one unit of income will be either consumed or saved.

In the above example, If MPS = 0.4, then MPC = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

Generally, it is assumed that value of marginal propensity to save for the richer is more than the marginal propensity to save for the poorer. If income increases for both parties by $1, then the propensity to save for a richer person would be more than that for the poorer person.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, C. (2000) Why do the rich save so much, in Does Atlas Shrug? Economic Consequences of Taxing the Rich, Slemrod, J. (Ed.), Cambridge University Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slope of saving line==

Marginal propensity to save is also used as an alternative term for slope of saving line.
The slope of a saving line is given by the equation S = -a + (1-b)Y,&lt;ref&gt;Froyan, R. T. (2005). Macroeconomics : Theories and policies. (Eighth ed., p. 123,130). Pearson Education Inc. Pvt. Ltd. and Dorling Kindersley Publishing Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dwivedi, D. N. (2005). Macroeconomics: Theory and policy. (2nd ed., p. 73). New York: Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; where -a refers to autonomous savings and (1-b) refers to marginal propensity to save (here b refers to marginal propensity to consume but as MPC + MPS = 1, so (1-b) refers to MPS).

In this diagram, the savings function is an increasing function of disposable income i.e. savings increase as income increases.&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, R., Fischer, S., &amp; Startz, R. (2004). Macroeconomics. (Ninth ed., pp. 217,221-23). New York: Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The savings function.png|thumb|The savings function]]

==Multiplier effect==

An important implication of marginal propensity to save is measurement of the multiplier. A multiplier measures the magnified change in aggregate product i.e. the gross domestic product, resulting from a change in an autonomous variable (for example, government expenditure, investment expenditures, etc.).

The  effect of a change in production creates a multiplied impact because it creates income which further creates consumption. However, the resulting consumption is also an expenditure which thus, generates more income, which creates more consumption. This next round of consumption leads to a further change in production, which generates even more income, and which induces even more consumption.

And thus, as it goes on and on, it results in a magnified, multiplied change in aggregate production initially triggered by a change in autonomous variable, but amplified by the creation of more income and increase in consumption.

===Mathematical implication===
Mathematically, the above effect can be stated as:

* In round 1, there is a change in an autonomous variable (say the government invests in a bridge making project for which it approaches a construction company) by an amount $1 (just an assumption for simplification). Now let the marginal propensity to consume for the construction company be 'c'. Thus, the construction company would spend an amount c×$1 i.e. $c.
* In round 2, the construction company incurs expenditure ($c) by procuring raw materials, say cement, steel, gravel, mortar, etc. from respective companies and thus, this amount $c becomes income for these companies. Now again the marginal propensity to consume for these companies is same as the construction company at 'c' and thus, their consumption becomes c×$c i.e. $c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
And it goes on and on.
We can express this as:

::{| class="wikitable"
|-
!width=20% |Round
!!width=40% |Change in income 
!!width=40% |Amount consumed
|-
| align="center"|Round 1 
| align="center"|$1 
| align="center"|$c
|-
| align="center"|Round 2
| align="center"|$c 
| align="center"|$c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| align="center"|Round 3 
| align="center"|$c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 
| align="center"|$c&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|}

:: And so on.

The end result is a magnified, multiplied change in aggregate production initially triggered by the change in investment, but amplified by the change in consumption i.e. the initial investment multiplied by the consumption coefficient (Marginal Propensity to consume).

The MPS enters into the process because it indicates the division of extra income between consumption and saving. It determines how much saving is induced with each change in production and income, and thus how much consumption is induced. If the MPS is smaller, then the multiplier process is also greater as less saving is induced, but more consumption is induced, with each round of activity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&amp;c=dsp&amp;k=marginal%20propensity%20to%20save&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in this highly simplified model, total magnified change in production  due to change in an autonomous variable by $1
                  = &lt;math&gt;1 + c + c^2 + \cdots
                  =\frac{1}{1-c}
                  =\frac{1}{1-MPC} = \frac{1}{MPS}&lt;/math&gt;

===Measuring the multiplier===

The effect of a [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier effect]] can be measured as:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Spending Multiplier} =\frac{1}{MPS}&lt;/math&gt;

If the MPS is smaller, then the multiplier process is also greater as less saving is induced, and more consumption is induced with each round of activity.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, G., &amp; Yeuh, L. (2006). Macroeconomics. (p. 23). Italy: Thomson Learning Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if MPS = 0.2, then multiplier effect is 5, and if MPS = 0.4, then the multiplier effect is 2.5. Thus, we can see that a lower propensity to save implies a higher multiplier effect.

In [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] theory, the '''Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution''' ('''MRTS''')—or '''Technical Rate of Substitution''' ('''TRS''')—is the amount by which the quantity of one input has to be reduced (&lt;math&gt;-\Delta x_2&lt;/math&gt;) when one extra unit of another input is used (&lt;math&gt;\Delta x_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;), so that output remains constant (&lt;math&gt;y = \bar{y}&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;math&gt;MRTS(x_1,x_2) =-\frac{\Delta x_2}{\Delta x_1} = \frac{MP_1}{MP_2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;MP_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;MP_2&lt;/math&gt; are the [[marginal product]]s of input 1 and input 2, respectively.

Along an [[isoquant]], the MRTS shows the rate at which one input (e.g. capital or labor) may be substituted for another, while maintaining the same level of output. Thus the MRTS is the absolute value of the slope of an isoquant at the point in question.

When relative input usages are optimal, the marginal rate of technical substitution is equal to the relative unit costs of the inputs, and the slope of the isoquant at the chosen point equals the slope of the [[isocost|isocost curve]] (see [[Conditional factor demands]]). It is the rate at which one input is substituted for another to maintain the same level of output.

In [[microeconomics]], '''marginal revenue''' (R') is the additional revenue that will be generated by increasing product sales by one unit.&lt;ref name="Essentials"&gt;Bradley R. chiller, "Essentials of Economics", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory"&gt;Edwin Mansfield, "Micro-Economics Theory and Applications, 3rd Edition", New York and London:W.W. Norton and Company, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro"&gt;Roger LeRoy Miller, "Intermediate Microeconomics  Theory Issues Applications, Third Edition", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg"&gt;Tirole, Jean,  "The Theory of Industrial Organization", Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary"&gt;John Black, "Oxford Dictionary of Economics", New York: Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be described as the [[total revenue|unit revenue]] the last item sold has generated for the firm.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary" /&gt;  In a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] market, the additional revenue generated by selling an additional unit of a good is equal to the price the firm is able to charge the buyer of the good.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan &amp; Sheffrin (2003), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because a firm in a [[perfect competition|competitive market]] will always get the same price for every unit it sells regardless of the number of units the firm sells since the firm's sales can never impact the industry's price.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt; However, a [[monopoly]] determines the entire [[industry]]'s sales.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;  As a result, it will have to lower the price of all units sold to increase sales by 1 unit.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;  Therefore, the marginal revenue generated is always lower than the price the firm is able to charge for the unit sold, since each reduction in price causes unit revenue to decline on every good the firm sells.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;  The marginal revenue (the increase in [[total revenue]]) is the price the firm gets on the additional unit sold, less the revenue lost by reducing the price on all other units that were sold prior to the decrease in price. 

A firms profits will be maximized when marginal revenue (MR) equals [[Marginal cost|marginal cost (MC)]]. If &lt;math&gt;MR &gt; MC&lt;/math&gt; then a firm should increase output for more profits, if &lt;math&gt;MR &lt; MC&lt;/math&gt; then a firm should decrease output for additional profits. A firm should choose the output level which is profit maximizing under perfect competition theory &lt;math&gt;MR = MC&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/432989728|title=Managerial economics : a strategic approach|last=David.|first=Prentice,|last2=1962-|first2=Waschik, Robert G.,|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9780415495172|location=|pages=33|oclc=432989728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Marginal revenue is equal to the ratio of the change in revenue for some change in quantity sold to that change in quantity sold. This can also be represented as a derivative when the change in quantity sold becomes arbitrarily small.  More formally, define the revenue function to be the following
:&lt;math&gt;R(q)=P(q)\cdot q &lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[product rule]], marginal revenue is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;R'(q)=P(q) + P'(q)\cdot q&lt;/math&gt;.

For a firm facing perfect competition, price does not change with quantity sold (&lt;math&gt;P'(q)=0&lt;/math&gt;), so marginal revenue is equal to price. For a [[monopoly]], the price decreases with quantity sold (&lt;math&gt;P'(q)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;), so marginal revenue is less than price (for positive &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;).

==Marginal revenue curve==

The marginal revenue curve is affected by the same factors as the demand curve - changes in income, change in the prices of complements and substitutes, change in populations. These factors can cause the R curve to shift and rotate.&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S Price 2002. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship between marginal revenue and elasticity==
The relationship between marginal revenue and the [[price elasticity of demand|elasticity of demand]] by the firm's customers can be derived as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Perloff (2008) p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R' = \frac{dR}{dQ} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle + \left( \frac{d \langle R \rangle}{dQ} \right) Q &lt;/math&gt;
:as &lt;math&gt; \langle R \rangle = P &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle \left[ 1 + \frac{d \langle R \rangle}{dQ} \frac{Q}{\langle R \rangle} \right] &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle (1 + 1 / e_{\langle R \rangle})&lt;/math&gt;

where e is the [[price elasticity of demand]]. If demand is inelastic (e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1) then R' will be negative, because to sell a marginal (infinitesimal) unit the firm would have to lower the selling price so much that it would lose more revenue on the pre-existing units than it would gain on the incremental unit. If demand is elastic (e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1) R' will be positive, because the additional unit would not drive down the price by so much. If the firm is a perfect competitor, so that it is so small in the market that its quantity produced and sold has no effect on the price, then the price elasticity of demand is negative infinity, and marginal revenue simply equals the (market-determined) price.

==Marginal revenue and rule-of-thumb pricing==
Profit maximization requires that a firm produces where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. Firm managers are unlikely to have complete information concerning their marginal revenue function or their marginal costs. Fortunately, the profit maximization conditions can be expressed in a “more easily applicable form” or rule of thumb.

:R' = C' 
:R' = &lt;R&gt;(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
:MC = &lt;R&gt;(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
:MC = &lt;R&gt; + &lt;R&gt;/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
:(&lt;R&gt; - C')/ &lt;R&gt; = - 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="Pindyck, R 2001 p. 334"&gt;Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D (2001) p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Markup is the difference between price and marginal cost. The formula states that markup as a percentage of price equals the negative of the inverse of elasticity of demand.&lt;ref name="Pindyck, R 2001 p. 334"/&gt; Alternatively, the relationship can be expressed as:
:&lt;R&gt; = C'/(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)

Thus if e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is - 2 and mc is $5.00 then price is $10.00.

(&lt;R&gt; - C')/ &lt;R&gt; = - 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is called the Lerner index after economist Abba Lerner.&lt;ref name="Perloff"&gt;Perloff (2008) p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lerner index is a measure of market power - the ability of a firm to charge a price that exceeds marginal cost.  The index varies from zero to 1. The greater the difference between price and marginal cost the closer the index value is to 1. The Lerner index increases as demand becomes less elastic.&lt;ref name="Perloff"/&gt;

'''Example'''
If a company can sell 10 units at $20 each or 11 units at $19 each, then the marginal revenue from the eleventh unit is (11 × 19) - (10 × 20) = $9.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3856">A '''marginal value''' is
#a [[Value (mathematics)|value]] that holds true given particular constraints,
#the ''change'' in a value associated with a specific change in some [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]], whether it be of that variable or of a [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]], or
#[when underlying values are quantified] the ''[[ratio]]'' of the change of a dependent variable to that of the independent variable.
(This third case is actually a special case of the second).

In the case of [[Differentiability#Continuity and differentiability|differentiability]], at the limit, a marginal change is a [[Differential (infinitesimal)|mathematical differential]], or the corresponding [[Derivative (calculus)|mathematical derivative]].

These uses of the term “marginal” are especially common in [[economics]], and result from conceptualizing constraints as ''borders'' or as ''margins''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910),] Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sorts of marginal values most common to economic analysis are those associated with ''unit'' changes of resources and, in [[mainstream economics]], those associated with ''infinitesimal'' changes.  Marginal values associated with units are considered because many decisions are made by unit, and [[marginalism]] explains ''unit price'' in terms of such marginal values.  Mainstream economics uses infinitesimal values in much of its analysis for reasons of mathematical tractability.

== Quantified conception ==

Assume a functional relationship
:&lt;math&gt;y=f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots,x_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Discrete change ===
If the value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is ''discretely'' changed from &lt;math&gt;x_{i,0}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_{i,1}&lt;/math&gt; while other independent variables remain unchanged, then the marginal value of the change in &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x_i =x_{i,1}-x_{i,0}&lt;/math&gt;
and the “marginal value” of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; may refer to
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta y=f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,1},\ldots,x_n \right)-f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,0},\ldots,x_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;
or to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,1},\ldots,x_n \right)-f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,0},\ldots,x_n \right)}{x_{i,1}-x_{i,0}}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example ====
If an individual saw her income increase from $50000 to $55000 per annum, and part of her response was to increase yearly purchases of [[amontillado]] from 2 casks to three casks, then
*the marginal increase in her income was $5000
*the marginal effect on her purchase of amontillado was an increase of 1 cask, or of 1 cask per $5000.

=== Infinitesimal margins ===
If ''infinitesimal'' values are considered, then a marginal value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;dx_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the “marginal value” of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; would typically refer to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i}=\frac{\partial f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots,x_n \right)}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt;

(For a linear functional relationship &lt;math&gt;y = a + b\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, the marginal value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; will simply be the co-efficient of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (in this case, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) and this will not change as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; changes. However, in the case where the functional relationship is non-linear, say &lt;math&gt;y = a\cdot b^x&lt;/math&gt;, the marginal value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; will be different for different values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.)

==== Example ====
Assume that, in some economy, aggregate consumption is well-approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;C=C\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Measures of national income and output|aggregate income]].
Then the ''[[marginal propensity to consume]]'' is
:&lt;math&gt;MPC=\frac{dC}{dY}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Marginalism''' is a theory of [[economics]] that attempts to explain the discrepancy in the value of goods and services by reference to their secondary, or marginal, utility. The reason why the price of diamonds is higher than that of water, for example, owes to the greater additional satisfaction of the diamonds over the water. Thus, while the water has greater total utility, the diamond has greater [[marginal utility]].

Although the central concept of marginalism is that of [[marginal utility]], marginalists, following the lead of [[Alfred Marshall]], drew upon the idea of [[Marginal product|marginal physical productivity]] in explanation of [[cost]]. The [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] tradition that emerged from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] marginalism abandoned the concept of [[utility]] and gave [[Marginal rate of substitution|marginal rates of substitution]] a more fundamental role in analysis.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Marginalism is an integral part of [[mainstream economics|mainstream economic]] theory.

== Important marginal concepts ==

=== Marginality ===
For issues of marginality, constraints are conceptualized as a ''border'' or ''margin''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of the margin for any individual corresponds to his or her ''endowment'', broadly conceived to include opportunities.  This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made both by others and by the individual.

A value that holds true given particular constraints is a [[marginal value|''marginal'' value]].  A change that would be affected as or by a specific loosening or tightening of those constraints is a ''marginal'' change.

Neoclassical economics usually assumes that marginal changes are [[infinitesimal]]s or [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]]. (Though this assumption makes the analysis less robust, it increases tractability.) One is therefore often told that "marginal" is synonymous with "very small", though in more general analysis this may not be operationally true (and would not in any case be literally true).  Frequently, economic analysis concerns the marginal values associated with a change of one unit of a resource, because decisions are often made in terms of units; marginalism seeks to explain unit prices in terms of such marginal values.

=== Marginal use ===
{{main|Marginal use}}
The '''marginal use''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the good or service that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginalism assumes, for any given agent, [[Rational choice theory|economic rationality]] and an [[Order theory|ordering]] of possible states-of-the-world, such that, for any given set of constraints, there is an attainable state which is best in the eyes of that agent.  [[Positive science|Descriptive]] marginalism asserts that choice amongst the specific means by which various anticipated specific states-of-the-world (outcomes) might be affected is governed only by the distinctions amongst those specific outcomes; [[Normative economics|prescriptive]] marginalism asserts that such choice ''ought'' to be so governed.

On such assumptions, each increase would be put to the specific, feasible, previously unrealized use of greatest priority, and each decrease would result in abandonment of the use of lowest priority amongst the uses to which the good or service had been put.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein" /&gt;

=== Marginal utility ===
{{main|Marginal utility}}
The '''marginal utility''' of a good or service is the utility of its [[marginal use]].  Under the assumption of economic rationality, it is the utility of its least urgent possible use ''from'' the best feasible combination of actions in which its use is included.

In 20th century [[mainstream economics]], the term "[[utility]]" has come to be formally defined as a ''[[Measure (mathematics)|quantification]]'' capturing preferences by assigning greater quantities to states, goods, services, or applications that are of higher priority.  But marginalism and the concept of marginal utility predate the establishment of this convention within economics.  The more general conception of utility is that of ''use'' or ''usefulness'', and this conception is at the heart of marginalism; the term "marginal utility" arose from translation of the German "Grenznutzen",&lt;ref name="wieser_ein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wieser_zwei"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Der natürliche Werth'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Natural Value''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1889), Bk I Ch V "Marginal Utility" ([http://praxeology.net/FW-NV-I-5.htm HTML]).&lt;/ref&gt; which literally means ''border use'', referring directly to the marginal use, and the more general formulations of marginal utility do not treat quantification as an ''essential'' feature.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch"&gt;Mc Culloch, James Huston; "The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility", ''[[Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie]]'' 37 (1973) #3&amp;amp;4 (September).&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, none of the early marginalists insisted that utility were ''not'' quantified,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; "The Development of Utility Theory" ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; "The Adoption of Marginal Utility Theory" ''History of Political Economy'' (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; some indeed treated quantification as an essential feature, and those who did not still used an assumption of quantification for expository purposes.  In this context, it is not surprising to find many presentations that fail to recognize a more general approach.

==== Quantified marginal utility ====
Under the [[special case]] in which usefulness can be quantified, the change in utility of moving from state &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; to state &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U=U(S_2)-U(S_1)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; are distinguishable by values of just one variable &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; which is itself quantified, then it becomes possible to speak of the ratio of the marginal utility of the change in &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; to the size of that change:
:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;
(where “[[ceteris paribus|c.p.]]” indicates that the ''only'' [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] to change is &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt;).

Mainstream neoclassical economics will typically assume that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta g\to 0}{\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}}&lt;/math&gt;
is well defined, and use “marginal utility” to refer to a [[partial derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial g}\approx\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;

==== The "law" of diminishing marginal utility ====
The "law" of diminishing marginal utility (also known as a "[[Hermann Heinrich Gossen|Gossen]]'s First Law") is that, ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', as additional amounts of a good or service are added to available resources, their marginal utilities are decreasing.  This "law" is sometimes treated as a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], sometimes as something proven by introspection, or sometimes as a mere [[Instrumentalism|instrumental]] assumption, adopted only for its perceived predictive efficacy.  Actually, it is not quite any of these things, though it may have aspects of each.  The "law" does not hold under all circumstances, so it is neither a tautology nor otherwise proveable; but it has a basis in prior observation.

An individual will typically be able to [[Partially ordered set|partially order]] the potential uses of a good or service.  If there is [[scarcity]], then a rational agent will satisfy wants of highest possible priority, so that no want is avoidably sacrificed to satisfy a want of ''lower'' priority.  In the absence of complementarity across the uses, this will imply that the priority of use of any additional amount will be lower than the priority of the established uses, as in this famous example:
:A pioneer farmer had five sacks of grain, with no way of selling them or buying more. He had five possible uses: as basic feed for himself, food to build strength, food for his chickens for dietary variation, an ingredient for making whisky and feed for his parrots to amuse him. Then the farmer lost one sack of grain. Instead of reducing every activity by a fifth, the farmer simply starved the parrots as they were of less utility than the other four uses; in other words they were on the margin. And it is on the margin, and not with a view to the big picture, that we make economic decisions.&lt;ref name="bawerk_capital"&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; ''Kapital Und Kapitalizns. Zweite Abteilung: Positive Theorie des Kapitales'' (1889). Translated as ''Capital and Interest. II: Positive Theory of Capital'' with appendices rendered as ''Further Essays on Capital and Interest''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Marginal-utility.png|thumb|right|Diminishing marginal utility, given quantification]]
However, if there ''is'' a complementarity across uses, then an amount added can bring things past a desired tipping point, or an amount subtracted cause them to fall short.  In such cases, the marginal utility of a good or service might actually be ''increasing''.

Without the presumption that utility is quantified, the ''diminishing'' of utility should not be taken to be itself an [[Elementary arithmetic|arithmetic]] [[subtraction]].  It is the movement from use of higher to lower priority, and may be no more than a purely [[Ranking|ordinal]] change.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"&gt;[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Theodore-Angwenyi, Nicholas]]; "Utility", ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

When quantification of utility is assumed, diminishing marginal utility corresponds to a utility function whose ''[[slope]]'' is continually or continuously decreasing.  In the latter case, if the function is also smooth, then the “law” may be expressed
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial g^2}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;
Neoclassical economics usually supplements or supplants discussion of marginal utility with [[indifference curve]]s, which were originally derived as the [[level curve]]s of utility functions,&lt;ref name="edgeworth"&gt;Edgeworth, Francis Ysidro; [http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/edgeworth/mathpsychics.pdf ''Mathematical Psychics''] (1881).&lt;/ref&gt; or can be produced without presumption of quantification,&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt; but are often simply treated as axiomatic.  In the absence of complementarity of goods or services, diminishing marginal utility implies [[Convex function|convexity]] of indifference curves&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edgeworth" /&gt; (though such convexity would also follow from [[quasiconcavity]] of the utility function).

=== Marginal rate of substitution ===
{{Main|Marginal rate of substitution}}
The ''rate of substitution'' is the ''least favorable'' rate at which an agent is willing to exchange units of one good or service for units of another.  The '''''marginal''''' '''rate of substitution''' ("MRS") is the rate of substitution at the margin&amp;nbsp;– in other words, given some constraint(s).

When goods and services are [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]], the least favorable rate at which an agent would trade A for B will usually be different from that at which she would trade B for A:
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{AB} \neq \frac1{MRS_{BA}}&lt;/math&gt;
But, when the goods and services are continuously divisible, in the [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]]
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{AB} = \frac1{MRS_{BA}}&lt;/math&gt;
and the marginal rate of substitution is the slope of the [[indifference curve]] (multiplied by &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;).

If, for example, Lisa will not trade a goat for anything less than two sheep, then her
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{SG} = \frac{2\text{ sheep}}\text{goat}&lt;/math&gt;
And if she will not trade a sheep for anything less than two goats, then her
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{GS} = \frac{2\text{ goat}}\text{sheep} \neq \frac{1\text{ goat}}{2\text{ sheep}} = \frac1{\left(\frac{2\text{ sheep}}\text{goat}\right)} = \frac1{MRS_{SG}}&lt;/math&gt;
But if she would trade one gram of banana for one ounce of ice cream ''and vice versa'', then
:&lt;math&gt;MRS_{IB} = \frac{1\text{ oz ice cream}}{1\text{ g banana}} = \frac1{\left(\frac{1\text{ g banana}}{1\text{ oz ice cream}}\right)} = \frac1{MRS_{BI}}&lt;/math&gt;

When indifference curves (which are essentially graphs of instantaneous rates of substitution) and the convexity of those curves are not taken as given, the "law" of diminishing marginal utility is invoked to explain diminishing marginal rates of substitution&amp;nbsp;– a willingness to accept fewer units of good or service &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in substitution for &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as one's holdings of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; grow relative to those of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  If an individual has a stock or flow of a good or service whose marginal utility is less than would be that of some other good or service for which he or she could trade, then it is in his or her interest to effect that trade.  Of course, as one thing is traded-away and another is acquired, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades are now changed.  On the assumption that the marginal utility of one is diminishing, and the other is not increasing, all else being equal, an individual will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed. (One important way in which all else might not be equal is when the use of the one good or service complements that of the other.  In such cases, exchange ratios might be constant.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;) If any trader can better his or her own marginal position by offering an exchange more favorable to other traders with desired goods or services, then he or she will do so.

=== Marginal cost ===
{{Main|Marginal cost}}
At the highest level of generality, a '''marginal cost''' is a marginal [[opportunity cost]].  In most contexts, however, "marginal cost" will refer to marginal ''[[Money|pecuniary]]'' cost&amp;nbsp;– that is to say marginal cost measured by forgone money.

A thorough-going marginalism sees marginal cost as increasing under the "law" of diminishing marginal utility, because applying resources to one application reduces their availability to other applications.  Neoclassical economics tends to disregard this argument, but to see marginal costs as increasing in consequence of [[diminishing returns]].

== Application to price theory ==
Marginalism and neoclassical economics typically explain price formation broadly through the interaction of [[supply and demand|curves or schedules of supply and demand]].  In any case buyers are modelled as pursuing typically lower quantities, and sellers offering typically higher quantities, as price is increased, with each being willing to trade until the marginal value of what they would trade-away exceeds that of the thing for which they would trade.

=== Demand ===
Demand curves are explained by marginalism in terms of marginal rates of substitution.

At any given price, a prospective buyer has some marginal rate of substitution of money for the good or service in question.  Given the "law" of diminishing marginal utility, or otherwise given convex indifference curves, the rates are such that the willingness to forgo money for the good or service decreases as the buyer would have ever more of the good or service and ever less money.  Hence, any given buyer has a demand schedule that generally decreases in response to price (at least until quantity demanded reaches zero).  The aggregate quantity demanded by all buyers is, at any given price, just the sum of the quantities demanded by individual buyers, so it too decreases as price increases.

=== Supply ===
Both neoclassical economics and thorough-going marginalism could be said to explain supply curves in terms of marginal cost; however, there are marked differences in conceptions of that cost.

Marginalists in the tradition of [[Alfred Marshall|Marshall]] and neoclassical economists tend to represent the supply curve for any producer as a curve of marginal pecuniary costs objectively determined by physical processes, with an upward slope determined by [[diminishing returns]].

A more thorough-going marginalism represents the supply curve as a ''complementary demand curve''&amp;nbsp;–  where the demand is ''for'' money and the purchase is made ''with'' a good or service.&lt;ref name="schumMarshScis"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Pt IV Ch 6 §4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The shape of that curve is then determined by marginal rates of substitution of money for that good or service.

=== Markets ===
By confining themselves to limiting cases in which sellers or buyers are both "price takers"&amp;nbsp;– so that demand functions ignore supply functions or ''vice versa''&amp;nbsp;– Marshallian marginalists and neoclassical economists produced tractable models of [[Perfect competition|"pure" or "perfect" competition]] and of various forms of [[Imperfect competition|"imperfect" competition]], which models are usually captured by relatively simple graphs.  Other marginalists have sought to present what they thought of as more realistic explanations,&lt;ref&gt;Mund, Vernon Arthur; ''Monopoly: A History and Theory'' (1933).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mises, Ludwig Heinrich Edler von]]; [http://library.mises.org/books/Ludwig%20von%20Mises/Nationalokonomie%20Theorie%20des%20Handelns%20und%20Wirtschaftens.pdf ''Nationalökonomie: Theorie des Handelns und Wirtschaftens''] (1940). (See also his [https://mises.org/books/humanaction.pdf ''Human Action''.])&lt;/ref&gt; but this work has been relatively uninfluential on the mainstream of economic thought.

=== The paradox of water and diamonds ===
{{main|Paradox of value}}
The "law" of diminishing marginal utility is said to explain the "paradox of water and diamonds", most commonly associated with [[Adam Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam; ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Chapter IV. "Of the Origin and Use of Money".&lt;/ref&gt; (though recognized by earlier thinkers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Scott|last = Gordon|year = 1991|title = History and Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter = The Scottish Enlightenment of the eighteenth century|publisher = [[Routledge]]|isbn = 0-415-09670-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human beings cannot even survive without water, whereas diamonds, in Smith's day, were ornamentation or engraving bits. Yet water had a very small price, and diamonds a very large price. Marginalists explained that it is the ''marginal'' usefulness of any given quantity that matters, rather than the usefulness of a ''class'' or of a ''totality''.  For most people, water was sufficiently abundant that the loss or gain of a gallon would withdraw or add only some very minor use if any, whereas diamonds were in much more restricted supply, so that the loss or gain was much greater.

That is not to say that the price of any good or service is simply a function of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual.  Rather, individuals are willing to trade based upon the respective marginal utilities of the goods that they have or desire (with these marginal utilities being distinct for each potential trader), and prices thus develop constrained by these marginal utilities.

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

=== Proto-marginalist approaches ===
Perhaps the essence of a notion of diminishing marginal utility can be found in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], wherein he writes {{Quotation|external goods have a limit, like any other instrument, and all things useful are of such a nature that where there is too much of them they must either do harm, or at any rate be of no use&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''Politics'', Bk 7 Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

(There has been marked disagreement about the development and role of marginal considerations in Aristotle's' value theory.&lt;ref&gt;Soudek, Josef; “Aristotle's Theory of Exchange: An Inquiry into the Origin of Economic Analysis”, ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' v 96 (1952) pp. 45–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kauder"&gt;Kauder, Emil; “Genesis of the Marginal Utility Theory from Aristotle to the End of the Eighteenth Century”, ''Economic Journal'' v 63 (1953) pp. 638–50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Barry Lewis John; “Aristotle and the Development of Value Theory”, ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' v 78 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schumArist"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Part II Chapter 1 §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, Scott; ''Aristotle's Economic Thought'' (1995) Chapters 1, 2, &amp; 6.&lt;/ref&gt;)

A great variety of economists concluded that there was ''some'' sort of inter-relationship between utility and rarity that effected economic decisions, and in turn informed the determination of prices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Přibram|Přibram, Karl]]; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteenth-century Italian [[Mercantilism|mercantilists]], such as [[Antonio Genovesi]], [[Giammaria Ortes]], [[Pietro Verri]], [[Cesare Beccaria]], and [[Giovanni Rinaldo]], held that value was explained in terms of the general utility and of scarcity, though they did not typically work-out a theory of how these interacted.&lt;ref name="pribramItalMerc"&gt;Pribram, Karl; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983), Chapter 5 “Refined Mercantilism”, “Italian Mercantilists”.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Della Moneta]]'' (1751), Abbé [[Ferdinando Galiani]], a pupil of Genovesi, attempted to explain value as a ratio of two ratios, ''utility'' and ''scarcity'', with the latter component ratio being the ratio of quantity to use.

[[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]], in ''Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution de richesse'' (1769), held that value derived from the general utility of the class to which a good belonged, from comparison of present and future wants, and from anticipated difficulties in procurement.

Like the Italian mercantilists, [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] saw value as determined by utility associated with the class to which the good belongs, and by estimated scarcity.  In ''De commerce et le gouvernement'' (1776), Condillac emphasized that value is not based upon cost but that costs were paid because of value.

This last point was famously restated by the Nineteenth Century proto-marginalist, [[Richard Whately]], who in ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy'' (1832) wrote {{Quotation|It is not that pearls fetch a high price because men have dived for them; but on the contrary, men dive for them because they fetch a high price.&lt;ref&gt;Whately, Richard; ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy, Being part of a course delivered in the Easter term'' (1832).&lt;/ref&gt;}} (Whately's student [[Nassau William Senior]] is noted below as an early marginalist.)

[[Frédéric Bastiat]] in chapters V and XI of his ''Economic Harmonies'' (1850) also develops a theory of value as ratio between services that increment utility, rather than between total utility.

=== Marginalists before the Revolution ===
The first unambiguous published statement of any sort of theory of marginal utility was by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], in "Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis".&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; "Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis" in ''Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae'' 5 (1738); reprinted in translation as "Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk" in ''Econometrica'' 22 (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;  This paper appeared in 1738, but a draft had been written in 1731 or in 1732.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; letter of 4 July 1731 to Nicolas Bernoulli ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=9 September 2008 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Nicolas; letter of 5 April 1732, acknowledging receipt of "Specimen theoriae novae metiendi sortem pecuniariam" ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=9 September 2008 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1728, [[Gabriel Cramer]] produced fundamentally the same theory in a private letter.&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Garbriel; letter of 21 May 1728 to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nicolaus Bernoulli]] ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=9 September 2008 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  Each had sought to resolve the [[St. Petersburg paradox]], and had concluded that the marginal desirability of money decreased as it was accumulated, more specifically such that the desirability of a sum were the [[natural logarithm]] (Bernoulli) or [[square root]] (Cramer) thereof.  However, the more general implications of this hypothesis were not explicated, and the work fell into obscurity.

In "A Lecture on the Notion of Value as Distinguished Not Only from Utility, but also from Value in Exchange",&lt;ref&gt;Finally some recognition that the guidance isn't clear.&lt;/ref&gt; delivered in 1833 and included in ''Lectures on Population, Value, Poor Laws and Rent'' (1837), [[William Forster Lloyd]] explicitly offered a general marginal utility theory, but did not offer its derivation nor elaborate its implications.  The importance of his statement seems to have been lost on everyone (including Lloyd) until the early 20th century, by which time others had independently developed and popularized the same insight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman|Seligman, Edwin Robert Anderson]]; "On some neglected British economists", ''Economic Journal'' v. 13 (September 1903).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''An Outline of the Science of Political Economy'' (1836), [[Nassau William Senior]] asserted that marginal utilities were the ultimate determinant of demand, yet apparently did not pursue implications, though some interpret his work as indeed doing just that.&lt;ref&gt;White, Michael V; "Diamonds Are Forever(?): Nassau Senior and Utility Theory" in ''The Manchester School of Economic &amp;amp; Social Studies'' 60 (1992) #1 (March).&lt;/ref&gt;

In "De la mesure de l'utilité des travaux publics" (1844), [[Jules Dupuit]] applied a conception of marginal utility to the problem of determining bridge tolls.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuit, Jules; "De la mesure de l'utilité des travaux publics", ''Annales des ponts et chaussées'', Second series, 8 (1844).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] published ''Die Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln'', which presented a marginal utility theory and to a very large extent worked-out its implications for the behavior of a market economy.  However, Gossen's work was not well received in the Germany of his time, most copies were destroyed unsold, and he was virtually forgotten until rediscovered after the so-called Marginal Revolution.

=== The Marginal Revolution ===
Marginalism as a formal theory can be attributed to the work of three economists, [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] in England, [[Carl Menger|Menger]] in Austria, and [[Léon Walras|Walras]] in Switzerland.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[William Stanley Jevons]] first proposed the theory in articles in 1863 and 1871.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/jevons/mathem.txt “A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”] ([http://www.eco.utexas.edu/~hmcleave/jevonsmath.pdf PDF]), ''The Theory of Political Economy'' (1871).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Carl Menger]] presented the theory in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre'' (translated as [https://mises.org/document/595 ''Principles of Economics'' PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;  Menger explained why individuals use marginal utility to decide amongst trade-offs, but while his illustrative examples present utility as quantified, his essential assumptions do not.{{vague|date=July 2012}}&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"/&gt;
[[Léon Walras]] introduced the theory in ''Éléments d'économie politique pure'', the first part of which was published in 1874. (American [[John Bates Clark]] is also associated with the origins of Marginalism, but did little to advance the theory.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==== The second generation ====
Although the Marginal Revolution flowed from the work of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, their work might have failed to enter the mainstream were it not for a second generation of economists.  In England, the second generation were exemplified by [[Philip Wicksteed]], by [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]], and by [[Alfred Marshall]]; in Austria by [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]] and by [[Friedrich von Wieser]]; in Switzerland by [[Vilfredo Pareto]]; and in America by [[Herbert Joseph Davenport]] and by [[Frank Fetter|Frank A. Fetter]].

There were significant, distinguishing features amongst the approaches of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, but the second generation did not maintain distinctions along national or linguistic lines.  The work of von Wieser was heavily influenced by that of Walras.  Wicksteed was heavily influenced by Menger.  Fetter referred to himself and Davenport as part of "the American Psychological School", named in imitation of the Austrian "Psychological School". (And Clark's work from this period onward similarly shows heavy influence by Menger.)  William Smart began as a conveyor of Austrian School theory to English-language readers, though he fell increasingly under the influence of Marshall.&lt;ref name="salerno"&gt;Salerno, Joseph T. 1999; "The Place of Mises's Human Action in the Development of Modern Economic Thought". ''Quarterly Journal of Economic Thought'' v. 2 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Böhm-Bawerk was perhaps the most able expositor of Menger's conception.&lt;ref name="salerno" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von. "Grundzüge der Theorie des wirtschaftlichen Güterwerthes", ''Jahrbüche für Nationalökonomie und Statistik'' v 13 (1886).  Translated as ''Basic Principles of Economic Value''.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was further noted for producing a theory of interest and of profit in equilibrium based upon the interaction of diminishing marginal utility with diminishing [[marginal product]]ivity of time and with [[time preference]].&lt;ref name="bawerk_capital"/&gt; (This theory was adopted in full and then further developed by [[Knut Wicksell]]&lt;ref&gt;Wicksell, Johan Gustaf Knut; ''Über Wert, Kapital unde Rente'' (1893). Translated as [https://mises.org/books/valuecapital.pdf ''Value, Capital and Rent''.]&lt;/ref&gt; and, with modifications including formal disregard for time-preference, by Wicksell's American rival [[Irving Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Irving; ''Theory of Interest'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;)

Marshall was the second-generation marginalist whose work on marginal utility came most to inform the mainstream of neoclassical economics, especially by way of his ''Principles of Economics'', the first volume of which was published in 1890.  Marshall constructed the demand curve with the aid of assumptions that utility was quantified, and that the marginal utility of money was constant (or nearly so).  Like Jevons, Marshall did not see an explanation for supply in the theory of marginal utility, so he paired a marginal explanation of demand with a more [[Classical economics|classical]] explanation of supply, wherein costs were taken to be objectively determined.  (Marshall later actively mischaracterized the criticism that these costs were themselves ultimately determined by marginal utilities.&lt;ref name="schumMarshScis" /&gt;)

==== The Marginal Revolution as a response to socialism ====
The doctrines of marginalism and the Marginal Revolution are often interpreted as a response to the rise of the worker's movement, [[Marxian economics]] and the earlier [[Ricardian socialism|(Ricardian) socialist]] theories of the [[exploitation of labour]]. The first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' was not published until July 1867, when marginalism was already developing, but before the advent of Marxian economics, proto-marginalist ideas such as those of Gossen had largely fallen on deaf ears. It was only in the 1880s, when Marxism had come to the fore as the main economic theory of the workers' movement, that Gossen found (posthumous) recognition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Outline of the History of Economic Theory|last=Screpanti|first=Ernesto|last2=Zamagni|first2=Stefano|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=170-173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the rise of Marxism, E. Screpanti and S. Zamagni point to a different 'external' reason for marginalism's success, which is its successful response to the [[Long Depression]] and the resurgence of [[class conflict]] in all developed capitalist economies after the 1848-1870 period of social peace. Marginalism, Screpanti and Zamagni argue, offered a theory of the [[Perfect competition|free market as perfect]], as performing optimal allocation of resources, while it allowed economists to blame any adverse effects of laissez-faire economics on the interference of workers' coalitions in the proper functioning of the market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Scholars have suggested that the success of the generation who followed the preceptors of the Revolution was their ability to formulate straightforward responses to [[Marxist economic theory]].&lt;ref name="screpanti"&gt;Screpanti, Ernesto, and Stefano Zamagni; ''An Outline of the History of Economic Thought'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, “Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems” (1896),&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; “Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems” [“On the Closure of the Marxist System”], ''Staatswiss. Arbeiten. Festgabe für [[Karl Knies|K. Knies]]'' (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; but the first was Wicksteed's “The Marxian Theory of Value. ''Das Kapital'': a criticism” (1884,&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; “Das Kapital: A Criticism”, ''To-day'' 2 (1884) pp. 388–409.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by “The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder” in 1885&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; “The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder”, ''To-day'' 3 (1885) pp. 177–79.&lt;/ref&gt;). The most famous early Marxist responses were [[Rudolf Hilferding]]'s ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904)&lt;ref name="hilferding"&gt;Hilferding, Rudolf; ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904).  Translated as ''Böhm-Bawerk's Criticism of Marx''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class'' (1914) by [[Nikolai Bukharin]].&lt;ref name="bukharin"&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin]]; ''Политической экономии рантье'' (1914).  Translated as [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1927/leisure-economics/ ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class''].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eclipse ===
In his 1881 work ''Mathematical Psychics'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/edgeworth/mathpsychics.pdf ''Mathematical Psychics'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] presented the [[indifference curve]], deriving its properties from marginalist theory which assumed utility to be a differentiable function of quantified goods and services.  But it came to be seen that indifference curves could be considered as somehow ''given'', without bothering with notions of utility.

In 1915, [[Eugen Slutsky]] derived a theory of consumer choice solely from properties of indifference curves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Slutsky]]; "Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore", ''Giornale degli Economisti'' 51 (1915).&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of [[World War I|the World War]], the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], and his own subsequent loss of interest, Slutsky's work drew almost no notice, but similar work in 1934 by [[John Hicks]] and [[R. G. D. Allen]]&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, John Richard, and Roy George Douglas Allen; "A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value", ''Economica'' 54 (1934).&lt;/ref&gt; derived much the same results and found a significant audience. (Allen subsequently drew attention to Slutsky's earlier accomplishment.)

Although some of the third generation of Austrian School economists had by 1911 rejected the quantification of utility while continuing to think in terms of marginal utility,&lt;ref&gt;[[von Mises, Ludwig Heinrich]]; ''[[Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufsmittel]]'' (1912).&lt;/ref&gt; most economists presumed that utility must be a sort of quantity.  Indifference curve analysis seemed to represent a way of dispensing with presumptions of quantification, albeït that a seemingly arbitrary assumption (admitted by Hicks to be a "rabbit out of a hat"&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. "Utility and Preference" §8, p. 23 in the 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;) about decreasing marginal rates of substitution&lt;ref name="hicks_vc"&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. "Utility and Preference" §7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; would then have to be introduced to have convexity of indifference curves.

For those who accepted that superseded marginal utility analysis had been superseded by indifference curve analysis, the former became at best somewhat analogous to the [[Bohr model|Bohr model of the atom]]—perhaps pedagogically useful, but “old fashioned” and ultimately incorrect.&lt;ref name="hicks_vc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="samuelson"&gt;Samuelson, Paul Anthony; "Complementarity: An Essay on the 40th Anniversary of the Hicks-Allen Revolution in Demand Theory", ''Journal of Economic Literature'' vol 12 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival ===
When Cramer and Bernoulli introduced the notion of diminishing marginal utility, it had been to address [[St. Petersburg paradox|a paradox of gambling]], rather than the [[paradox of value]].  The marginalists of the revolution, however, had been formally concerned with problems in which there was neither [[risk]] nor [[uncertainty]].  So too with the indifference curve analysis of Slutsky, Hicks, and Allen.

The [[expected utility hypothesis]] of Bernoulli ''et alii'' was revived by various 20th century thinkers, including [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]] (1926),&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Frank Plumpton; “Truth and Probability” ([http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf  PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227205205/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf |date=27 February 2008 }}), Chapter VII in ''The Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays'' (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] (1944),&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, John and Oskar Morgenstern; ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Leonard Savage]] (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Leonard Jimmie; ''Foundations of Statistics'' (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this hypothesis remains controversial, it brings not merely utility but a quantified conception thereof back into the mainstream of economic thought, and would dispatch the [[Occam's razor|Ockhamistic argument]].&lt;ref name="samuelson" /&gt; (It should perhaps be noted that, in expected utility analysis, the “law” of diminishing marginal utility corresponds to what is called “[[risk aversion]]”.)

== Criticisms==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Economics]] --&gt;

=== Marxist criticisms of marginalism ===
{{main|Marxist economic theory}}
[[Karl Marx]] died before marginalism became the interpretation of economic value accepted by mainstream economics.  His theory was based on the [[labor theory of value]], which distinguishes between [[exchange value]] and [[use value]]. In his ''Capital'' he rejected the explanation of long-term market values by supply and demand:
:Nothing is easier than to realize the inconsistencies of demand and supply, and the resulting deviation of market-prices from market-values. The real difficulty consists in determining what is meant by the equation of supply and demand.
:[...]
:If supply equals demand, they cease to act, and for this very reason commodities are sold at their market-values. Whenever two forces operate equally in opposite directions, they balance one another, exert no outside influence, and any phenomena taking place in these circumstances must be explained by causes other than the effect of these two forces. If supply and demand balance one another, they cease to explain anything, do not affect market-values, and therefore leave us so much more in the dark about the reasons why the market-value is expressed in just this sum of money and no other.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl; [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch10.htm ''Capital'' v. III pt. II ch. 10].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early response to marginalism, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] argued that "the subjective evaluation from which price is to be derived really starts from this price",&lt;ref&gt;Nikolai Bukharin (1914) ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class'', Chapter 3, Section 2. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1927/leisure-economics/ch03.htm#s6].&lt;/ref&gt; concluding:

:Whenever the Böhm-Bawerk theory, it appears, resorts to individual motives as a basis for the derivation of social phenomena, he is actually smuggling in the social content in a more or less disguised form in advance, so that the entire construction becomes a vicious circle, a continuous logical fallacy, a fallacy that can serve only specious ends, and demonstrating in reality nothing more than the complete barrenness of modern bourgeois theory.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholai Bukharin (1914) ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class'', Chapter 3, Section 6. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1927/leisure-economics/ch03.htm#s6].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly a later Marxist critic, [[Ernest Mandel]], argued that marginalism was "divorced from reality", ignored the role of production, and that:
:It is, moreover, unable to explain how, from the clash of millions of different individual "needs" there emerge not only uniform prices, but prices which remain stable over long periods, even under perfect conditions of free competition. Rather than an explanation of constants, and of the basic evolution of economic life, the "marginal" technique provides at best an explanation of ephemeral, short-term variations.&lt;ref&gt;Mandel, Ernest; ''Marxist Economic Theory'' (1962), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/works/marxist-economic-theory/marginalists.htm “The marginalist theory of value and neo-classical political economy”].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Dobb]] argued that prices derived through marginalism depend on the distribution of income.  The ability of consumers to express their preferences is dependent on their spending power.   As the theory asserts that prices arise in the act of exchange, Dobb argues that it cannot explain how the distribution of income affects prices and consequently cannot explain prices.&lt;ref name="dobb"&gt;Dobb, Maurice; ''Theories of value and Distribution'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobb also criticized the ''motives'' behind marginal utility theory.  Jevons wrote, for example, "so far as is consistent with the inequality of wealth in every community, all commodities are distributed by exchange so as to produce the maximum social benefit." (See  [[Fundamental theorems of welfare economics]].) Dobb contended that this statement indicated that marginalism is intended to insulate market economics from criticism by making prices the natural result of the given income distribution.&lt;ref name="dobb" /&gt;

=== Marxist adaptations to marginalism ===
Some economists strongly influenced by the [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] tradition such as [[Oskar Lange]], [[Włodzimierz Brus]], and [[Michał Kalecki]] have attempted to integrate the insights of classical [[political economy]], marginalism, and [[neoclassical economics]]. They believed that Marx lacked a sophisticated theory of prices, and neoclassical economics lacked a theory of the social frameworks of economic activity.  Some other Marxists have also argued that on one level there is no conflict between marginalism and Marxism: one could employ a marginalist theory of supply and demand within the context of a “big picture” understanding of the Marxist notion that capitalists exploit [[surplus labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Steedman, Ian; ''Socialism &amp; Marginalism in Economics, 1870–1930'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}} 
A '''mathematical model''' is a description of a [[system]] using [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and [[Language of mathematics|language]]. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed '''mathematical modeling'''. Mathematical models are used in the [[natural science]]s (such as [[physics]], [[biology]], [[earth science]], [[chemistry]]) and [[engineering]] disciplines (such as [[computer science]], [[electrical engineering]]), as well      as in the [[social sciences]] (such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]]). 

A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.

== Elements of a mathematical model ==

Mathematical models can take many forms, including [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].  These and other types of models can overlap, with a given  model involving a variety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include [[model theory|logical models]].  In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments.  Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed.

In the [[physical sciences]], a traditional mathematical model contains most of the following elements:
# [[Governing equation|Governing equations]]
# Supplementary sub-models
## [[Defining equation (physics)|Defining equations]]
## [[Constitutive equation|Constitutive equations]]
# Assumptions and constraints
## [[Initial condition|Initial]] and [[Boundary condition|boundary conditions]]
## [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|Classical constraints]] and [[Kinematics|kinematic equations]]

== Classifications ==
Mathematical models are usually composed of relationships and ''[[variable (mathematics)|variables]]''. Relationships can be described by ''[[Operator (mathematics)|operators]]'', such as algebraic operators, functions, differential operators, etc. Variables are abstractions of system [[parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] of interest, that can be [[Quantification (science)|quantified]]. Several classification criteria can be used for mathematical models according to their structure:
* '''Linear vs. nonlinear:''' If all the operators in a mathematical model exhibit [[linear]]ity, the resulting mathematical model is defined as linear. A model is considered to be nonlinear otherwise. The definition of linearity and nonlinearity is dependent on context, and linear models may have nonlinear expressions in them.  For example, in a [[Linear model|statistical linear model]], it is assumed that a relationship is linear in the parameters, but it may be nonlinear in the predictor variables.  Similarly, a differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written with linear [[differential operator]]s, but it can still have nonlinear expressions in it.  In a [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] model, if the objective functions and constraints are represented entirely by [[linear equation]]s, then the model is regarded as a linear model.  If one or more of the objective functions or constraints are represented with a [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] equation, then the model is known as a nonlinear model.&lt;br&gt;Nonlinearity, even in fairly simple systems, is often associated with phenomena such as [[Chaos theory|chaos]] and [[irreversibility]].  Although there are exceptions, nonlinear systems and models tend to be more difficult to study than linear ones.  A common approach to nonlinear problems is [[linearization]], but this can be problematic if one is trying to study aspects such as irreversibility, which are strongly tied to nonlinearity.
* '''Static vs. dynamic:''' A ''dynamic'' model  accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the system, while a ''static'' (or steady-state) model calculates the system in equilibrium, and thus is time-invariant.  Dynamic models typically are represented by [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s.
* '''Explicit vs. implicit:''' If all of the input parameters of the overall model are known, and the output parameters can be calculated by a finite series of computations, the model is said to be ''explicit''. But sometimes it is the ''output'' parameters which are known, and the corresponding inputs must be solved for by an iterative procedure, such as [[Newton's method]] (if the model is linear) or [[Broyden's method]] (if non-linear). In such a case the model is said to be ''implicit''. For example, a [[jet engine]]'s physical properties such as turbine and nozzle throat areas can be explicitly calculated given a design [[thermodynamic cycle]] (air and fuel flow rates, pressures, and temperatures) at a specific flight condition and power setting, but the engine's operating cycles at other flight conditions and power settings cannot be explicitly calculated from the constant physical properties.
* '''Discrete vs. continuous:''' A [[discrete modeling|discrete model]] treats objects as discrete, such as the particles in a [[molecular model]] or the states in a [[statistical model]]; while a [[continuous model]] represents the objects in a continuous manner, such as the velocity field of fluid in pipe flows, temperatures and stresses in a solid, and electric field that applies continuously over the entire model due to a point charge.
* '''Deterministic vs. probabilistic (stochastic):''' A [[deterministic system|deterministic]] model is one in which every set of variable states is uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables; therefore, a deterministic model always performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions. Conversely, in a stochastic model—usually called a "[[statistical model]]"—randomness is present, and variable states are not described by unique values, but rather by [[probability]] distributions.
* '''Deductive, inductive, or floating:''' A deductive model is a logical structure based on a theory. An inductive model arises from empirical findings and generalization from them. The floating model rests on neither theory nor observation, but is merely the invocation of expected structure. Application of mathematics in social sciences outside of economics has been criticized for unfounded models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stanislav Andreski |first=Stanislav |last=Andreski |year=1972 |title=Social Sciences as Sorcery |publisher=[[St. Martin’s Press]] |isbn=0-14-021816-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of [[catastrophe theory]] in science has been characterized as a floating model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Clifford Truesdell |first=Clifford |last=Truesdell |year=1984 |title=An Idiot’s Fugitive Essays on Science |pages=121–7 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-90703-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance in the natural sciences ==
Mathematical models are of great importance in the natural sciences, particularly in [[physics]]. Physical [[theory|theories]] are almost invariably expressed using mathematical models.

Throughout history, more and more accurate mathematical models have been developed. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] accurately describe many everyday phenomena, but at certain limits [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]] must be used; even these do not apply to all situations and need further refinement{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Examples|date=September 2017}}. It is possible to obtain the less accurate models in appropriate limits, for example relativistic mechanics reduces to Newtonian mechanics at speeds much less than the [[speed of light]]. Quantum mechanics reduces to classical physics when the quantum numbers are high. For example, the [[de Broglie wavelength]] of a tennis ball is insignificantly small, so classical physics is a good approximation to use in this case.

It is common to use idealized models in physics to simplify things. Massless ropes, point particles, [[ideal gases]] and the [[particle in a box]] are among the many simplified models used in physics. The laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as Newton's laws, [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. These laws are such as a basis for making mathematical models of real situations. Many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximate on a computer, a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws. For example, molecules can be modeled by [[molecular orbital]] models that are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation. In [[engineering]], physics models are often made by mathematical methods such as [[finite element analysis]].

Different mathematical models use different geometries that are not necessarily accurate descriptions of the geometry of the universe. [[Euclidean geometry]] is much used in classical physics, while [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]] are examples of theories that use [[geometry|geometries]] which are not Euclidean.

== Some applications==&lt;!--whatever this section is, it isn't background (original heading), and isn't general--&gt;
Since [[prehistory|prehistorical times]] simple models such as [[map]]s and [[Mathematical diagram|diagrams]] have been used.

Often when engineers analyze a system to be controlled or optimized, they use a mathematical model. In analysis, engineers can build a descriptive model of the system as a hypothesis of how the system could work, or try to estimate how an unforeseeable event could affect the system. Similarly, in control of a system, engineers can try out different control approaches in [[simulation]]s.

A mathematical model usually describes a system by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of variables and a set of equations that establish relationships between the variables. Variables may be of many types; [[Real number|real]] or [[integer]] numbers, [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values or [[String (computing)|strings]], for example. The variables represent some properties of the system, for example, measured system outputs often in the form of [[Signal (electronics)|signals]], [[Chronometry|timing data]], counters, and event occurrence (yes/no). The actual model is the set of functions that describe the relations between the different variables.

== Building blocks ==
In [[business]] and [[engineering]], mathematical models may be used to maximize a certain output. The system under consideration will require certain inputs. The system relating inputs to outputs depends on other variables too: [[decision theory|decision variables]], [[state variable]]s, [[Exogeny|exogenous]] variables, and [[random variable]]s.

Decision variables are sometimes known as independent variables.  Exogenous variables are sometimes known as [[parameter]]s or [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]s.
The variables are not independent of each other as the state variables are dependent on the decision, input, random, and exogenous variables.  Furthermore, the output variables are dependent on the state of the system (represented by the state variables).

[[Goal|Objective]]s and [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s of the system and its users can be represented as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the output variables or state variables.  The [[objective function]]s will depend on the perspective of the model's user.  Depending on the context, an objective function is also known as an ''index of performance'', as it is some measure of interest to the user.  Although there is no limit to the number of objective functions and constraints a model can have, using or optimizing the model becomes more involved (computationally) as the number increases.

For example, [[economist]]s often apply [[linear algebra]] when using [[input-output model]]s. Complicated mathematical models that have many variables may be consolidated by use of [[vector space|vectors]] where one symbol represents several variables.

== A priori information ==
[[File:Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png|thumb|480px|To analyse something with a typical "black box approach", only  the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) ''box''. The usual representation of this ''black box system''  is a [[data flow diagram]] centered in the box.]]

Mathematical modeling problems are often classified into [[black box]] or [[White box (software engineering)|white box]] models, according to how much [[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]] information on the system is available. A black-box model is a system of which there is no a priori information available. A white-box model (also called glass box or clear box) is a system where all necessary information is available. Practically all systems are somewhere between the black-box and white-box models, so this concept is useful only as an intuitive guide for deciding which approach to take.

Usually it is preferable to use as much a priori information as possible to make the model more accurate. Therefore, the white-box models are usually considered easier, because if you have used the information correctly, then the model will behave correctly. Often the a priori information comes in forms of knowing the type of functions relating different variables. For example, if we make a model of how a medicine works in a human system, we know that usually the amount of medicine in the blood is an [[exponential decay|exponentially decaying]] function. But we are still left with several unknown parameters; how rapidly does the medicine amount decay, and what is the initial amount of medicine in blood? This example is therefore not a completely white-box model. These parameters have to be estimated through some means before one can use the model.

In black-box models one tries to estimate both the functional form of relations between variables and the numerical parameters in those functions. Using a priori information we could end up, for example, with a set of functions that probably could describe the system adequately. If there is no a priori information we would try to use functions as general as possible to cover all different models. An often used approach for black-box models are [[artificial neural network|neural networks]] which usually do not make assumptions about incoming data. Alternatively the NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs) algorithms which were developed as part of [[nonlinear system identification]] &lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. (2013), ''Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains'', Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to select the model terms, determine the model structure, and estimate the unknown parameters in the presence of correlated and nonlinear noise. The advantage of NARMAX models compared to neural networks is that NARMAX produces models that can be written down and related to the underlying process, whereas neural networks produce an approximation that is opaque.

=== Subjective information ===
Sometimes it is useful to incorporate subjective information into a mathematical model.  This can be done based on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[experience]], or [[expert opinion]], or based on convenience of mathematical form.  [[Bayesian statistics]] provides a theoretical framework for incorporating such subjectivity into a rigorous analysis: we specify a [[prior probability distribution]] (which can be subjective), and then update this distribution based on empirical data.

An example of when such approach would be necessary is a situation in which an experimenter bends a coin slightly and tosses it once, recording whether it comes up heads, and is then given the task of predicting the probability that the next flip comes up heads.  After bending the coin, the true probability that the coin will come up heads is unknown; so the experimenter would need to make a decision (perhaps by looking at the shape of the coin) about what prior distribution to use.  Incorporation of such subjective information might be important to get an accurate estimate of the probability.

== Complexity ==
In general, model complexity involves a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy of the model.  [[Occam's razor]] is a principle particularly relevant to modeling, its essential idea being that among models with roughly equal predictive power, the simplest one is the most desirable.  While added complexity usually improves the realism of a model, it can make the model difficult to understand and analyze, and can also pose computational problems, including [[numerical instability]].  [[Thomas Kuhn]] argues that as science progresses, explanations tend to become more complex before a [[paradigm shift]] offers radical simplification {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

For example, when modeling the flight of an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model. Additionally, the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system, because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model. It is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size. Engineers often can accept some approximations in order to get a more robust and simple model. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[classical mechanics]] is an approximated model of the real world. Still, Newton's model is quite sufficient for most ordinary-life situations, that is, as long as particle speeds are well below the [[speed of light]], and we study macro-particles only.

== Training and tuning ==
Any model which is not pure white-box contains some [[parameter]]s that can be used to fit the model to the system it is intended to describe. If the modeling is done by an [[artificial neural network]] or other [[machine learning]], the optimization of parameters is called ''training''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Why|date=September 2017}}, while the optimization of model hyperparameters is called ''tuning'' and often uses [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. In more conventional modeling through explicitly given mathematical functions, parameters are often determined by ''[[curve fitting]]''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

== Model evaluation ==
A crucial part of the modeling process is the evaluation of whether or not a given mathematical model describes a system accurately.  This question can be difficult to answer as it involves several different types of evaluation.

=== Fit to empirical data ===
Usually the easiest part of model evaluation is checking whether a model fits experimental measurements or other empirical data.  In models with parameters, a common approach to test this fit is to split the data into two disjoint subsets: training data and verification data. The training data are used to estimate the model parameters.  An accurate model will closely match the verification data even though these data were not used to set the model's parameters. This practice is referred to as [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] in statistics.

Defining a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] to measure distances between observed and predicted data is a useful tool of assessing model fit.  In statistics, decision theory, and some [[economic model]]s, a [[loss function]] plays a similar role.

While it is rather straightforward to test the appropriateness of parameters, it can be more difficult to test the validity of the general mathematical form of a model.  In general, more mathematical tools have been developed to test the fit of [[statistical model]]s than models involving [[differential equations]].  Tools from [[non-parametric statistics]] can sometimes be used to evaluate how well the data fit a known distribution or to come up with a general model that makes only minimal assumptions about the model's mathematical form.

=== Scope of the model ===
Assessing the scope of a model, that is, determining what situations the model is applicable to, can be less straightforward.  If the model was constructed based on a set of data, one must determine for which systems or situations the known data is a "typical" set of data.

The question of whether the model describes well the properties of the system between data points is called [[interpolation]], and the same question for events or data points outside the observed data is called [[extrapolation]].

As an example of the typical limitations of the scope of a model, in evaluating Newtonian [[classical mechanics]], we can note that Newton made his measurements without advanced equipment, so he could not measure properties of particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light.  Likewise, he did not measure the movements of molecules and other small particles, but macro particles only. It is then not surprising that his model does not extrapolate well into these domains, even though his model is quite sufficient for ordinary life physics.

=== Philosophical considerations ===
Many types of modeling implicitly involve claims about [[causality]].  This is usually (but not always) true of models involving differential equations.  As the purpose of modeling is to increase our understanding of the world, the validity of a model rests not only on its fit to empirical observations, but also on its ability to extrapolate to situations or data beyond those originally described in the model. One can think of this as the differentiation between qualitative and quantitative predictions. One can also argue that a model is worthless unless it provides some insight which goes beyond what is already known from direct investigation of the phenomenon being studied.

An example of such criticism is the argument that the mathematical models of [[optimal foraging theory]] do not offer insight that goes beyond the common-sense conclusions of [[evolution]] and other basic principles of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pyke | first1 = G. H. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515 | title = Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 15 | pages = 523–575 | year = 1984 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* One of the popular examples in [[computer science]] is the mathematical models of various machines, an example is the [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) which is defined as an abstract mathematical concept, but due to the deterministic nature of a DFA, it is implementable in hardware and software for solving various specific problems. For example, the following is a DFA M with a binary alphabet, which requires that the input contains an even number of 0s.

[[File:DFAexample.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[state diagram]] for ''M'']]
''M'' = (''Q'', Σ, δ, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F'') where
*''Q'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;},
*Σ = {0, 1},
*''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
*''F'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}, and
*δ is defined by the following [[state transition table]]:
:{| border="1" cell padding="1" cell spacing="0"
| || &lt;center&gt;'''0'''&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;'''1'''&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

The state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents that there has been an even number of 0s in the input so far, while ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained an even number of 0s or not. If the input did contain an even number of 0s, ''M'' will finish in state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted.

The language recognized by ''M'' is the [[regular language]] given by the [[regular expression]] 1*( 0 (1*) 0 (1*) )*, where "*" is the [[Kleene star]], e.g., 1* denotes any non-negative number (possibly zero) of symbols "1".

* Many everyday activities carried out without a thought are uses of mathematical models. A geographical [[map projection]] of a region of the earth onto a small, plane surface  is a model&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landinfo.com/resources_dictionaryMP.htm landinfo.com, definition of map projection]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for many purposes such as planning travel.
* Another simple activity is predicting the position of a vehicle from its initial position, direction and speed of travel, using the equation that distance traveled is the product of time and speed. This is known as [[dead reckoning]] when used more formally. Mathematical modeling in this way does not necessarily require formal mathematics; animals have been shown to use dead reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallistel |first= |title=The Organization of Learning |location=Cambridge |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1990 |ISBN=0-262-07113-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whishaw | first1 = I.

* ''[[Population]] Growth''. A simple (though approximate) model of population growth is the [[Malthusian growth model]]. A slightly more realistic and largely used population growth model is the [[logistic function]], and its extensions. 
* ''Model of a particle  in a potential-field''. In this model we consider a particle as being a point of mass which describes a trajectory in space which is modeled by a function giving its coordinates in space as a function of time. The potential field is given by a function &lt;math&gt;V\!:\mathbb{R}^3\!\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the trajectory, that is a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\!:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, is the solution of the [[differential equation]]:

::&lt;math&gt; -\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}m=\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial x}\mathbf{\hat{x}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial y}\mathbf{\hat{y}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial z}\mathbf{\hat{z}}, &lt;/math&gt;

that can be written also as:

::&lt;math&gt; m\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-\nabla V[\mathbf{r}(t)]. &lt;/math&gt;

:Note this model assumes  the particle is a point mass, which is certainly known to be false in many cases in which we use this model; for example, as a model of planetary motion.

* ''Model of rational behavior for a consumer''.  In this model we assume a consumer faces a choice of ''n'' commodities labeled 1,2,...,''n'' each with a market price ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The consumer is assumed to have an [[ordinal utility]] function ''U'' (ordinal in the sense that only the sign of the differences between two utilities, and not the level of each utility, is meaningful), depending on the amounts of commodities ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consumed.  The model further assumes that the consumer has a budget ''M'' which is used to purchase a vector ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in such a way as to maximize ''U''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  The problem of rational behavior in this model then becomes an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem, that is:
:: &lt;math&gt; \max U(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:: subject to:
:: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i \leq M.&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; x_{i} \geq 0   \; \; \; \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n \} &lt;/math&gt;
: This model has been used in a wide variety of economic contexts, such as in [[general equilibrium theory]] to show existence and [[Pareto efficiency]] of economic equilibria.

A '''mental image''' or '''mental picture''' is the representation in a person's mind of the physical world outside that person.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M. W. (2012). Fundamentals of cognition, 2nd ed. New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an experience that, on most occasions, significantly resembles the experience of perceiving some object, event, or scene, but occurs when the relevant object, event, or scene is not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;McKellar, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finke, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  There are sometimes episodes, particularly on falling asleep ([[Hypnagogia|hypnagogic imagery]]) and waking up ([[hypnopompic]]), when the mental imagery, being of a rapid, phantasmagoric and involuntary character, defies perception, presenting a kaleidoscopic field, in which no distinct object can be discerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Edmond |year=1983 |title=Inspecting images |journal=Philosophy |volume=58 |issue=223 |pages=57–72 (see pp. 68–72) |doi=10.1017/s0031819100056266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental imagery can sometimes produce the same effects as would be produced by the behavior or experience imagined.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kappes|first=Heather Barry|last2=Morewedge|first2=Carey K.|date=2016-07-01|title=Mental Simulation as Substitute for Experience|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=10|issue=7|pages=405–420|doi=10.1111/spc3.12257|issn=1751-9004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of these experiences, what makes them possible, and their function (if any) have long been subjects of research and controversy{{Elucidate|date=April 2014}} in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], and, more recently, [[neuroscience]]. As contemporary researchers{{whom2|date=April 2014}} use the expression, mental images or imagery can comprise information from any source of sensory input; one may experience auditory images,&lt;ref&gt;Reisberg, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; olfactory images,&lt;ref&gt;Bensafi et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and so forth. However, the majority of philosophical and scientific investigations of the topic focus upon ''visual'' mental imagery. It has sometimes been assumed{{By whom|date=April 2014}} that, like humans, some types of animals are capable of experiencing mental images.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]]: ''[[On the Soul]]'' III.3 428a&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fundamentally introspective nature of the phenomenon, there is little to no evidence either for or against this view.

Philosophers such as [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], and early experimental psychologists such as [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[William James]], understood [[idea]]s in general to be mental images. Today it is very widely believed{{By whom|date=April 2014}} that much imagery functions as mental representations (or [[mental model]]s), playing an important role in memory and thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Paivio|Pavio]], 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kieran Egan (educationist)|Egan]], 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence W. Barsalou|Barsalou]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; William Brant (2013, p.&amp;nbsp;12) traces the scientific use of the phrase "mental images" back to [[John Tyndall]]'s 1870 speech called the "Scientific Use of the Imagination". Some have gone so far as to suggest that images are best understood to be, by definition, a form of inner, mental or neural representation;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ned Block|Block]], 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Kosslyn|Kosslyn]], 1983&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of hypnagogic and hypnapompic imagery, it is not representational at all.  Others reject the view that the image experience may be identical with (or directly caused by) any such representation in the mind or the brain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sartre]], 1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Ryle|Ryle]], 1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]], 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomeo, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett &amp; Hacker, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; but do not take account of the non-representational forms of imagery.

In 2010, [[IBM]] applied for a patent on a method to extract mental images of human faces from the human brain. It uses a feedback loop based on brain measurements of the [[fusiform face area]] in the brain that activates proportionate with degree of facial recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20100049076.pdf IBM Patent Application: Retrieving mental images of faces from the human brain]&lt;/ref&gt; It was issued in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4-traders.com/INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS-MA-4828/news/Business-Machines--Patent-Issued-for-Retrieving-Mental-Images-of-Faces-from-the-Human-Brain-20127314/ Business Machines : Patent Issued for Retrieving Mental Images of Faces from the Human Brain]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The mind's eye==
The notion of a "mind's eye" goes back at least to [[Cicero]]'s reference to '''''mentis oculi''''' during his discussion of the orator's appropriate use of [[simile]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XCU9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA535#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Liber III: XLI: 163.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this discussion, Cicero observed that allusions to "the [[Gulf of Gabès|Syrtis]] of his patrimony" and "the [[Charybdis]] of his possessions" involved similes that were "too far-fetched"; and he advised the orator to, instead, just speak of "the rock" and "the gulf" (respectively)—on the grounds that "the eyes of the mind are more easily directed to those objects which we have seen, than to those which we have only heard".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ciceroonoratorya00ciceuoft#page/239/mode/1upWatson, J.S. (trans. and ed.), ''Cicero on Oratory and Orators'', Harper &amp; Brothers, (New York), 1875:  Book III, C.XLI, p.239.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "the mind's eye" first appeared in English in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] (c. 1387) [[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law's Tale]] in his ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', where he tells us that one of the three men dwelling in a castle was blind, and could only see with "the eyes of his mind"; namely, those eyes "with which all men see after they have become blind".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyprol00chauuoft#page/78/mode/1up ''The Man of Laws Tale'', lines 550-553.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical basis ==
The biological foundation of the mind's eye is not fully understood. Studies using [[fMRI]]  have shown that the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] and the [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex .28V1.29|V1 area]] of the [[visual cortex]] are activated during mental imagery tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ini.unizh.ch/~alumit/ishai_neuroimage2002.pdf Imagery of famous faces: effects of memory and attention revealed by fMRI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821220736/http://www.ini.unizh.ch/~alumit/ishai_neuroimage2002.pdf |date=2006-08-21 }}, A. Ishai, J. V. Haxby and L. G. Ungerleider, ''NeuroImage'' '''17''' (2002), pp. 1729-1741.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Ratey|Ratey]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[visual pathway]] is not a one-way street. Higher areas of the [[human brain|brain]] can also send visual input back to [[neuron]]s in lower areas of the visual cortex. [...] As humans, we have the ability to see with the mind's eye – to have a perceptual experience in the absence of visual input. For example, [[PET scan]]s have shown that when subjects, seated in a room, imagine they are at their front door starting to walk either to the left or right, activation begins in the [[visual association cortex]], the [[parietal cortex]], and the [[prefrontal cortex]] - all higher [[Information processing theory#Cognitive processes|cognitive processing center]]s of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;''A User's Guide to the Brain'', John J. Ratey, {{ISBN|0-375-70107-9}}, at p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rudiments of a biological basis for the mind's eye is found in the deeper portions of the brain below the [[neocortex]], or where the center of perception exists.  The [[thalamus]] has been found to be discrete to other components in that it processes all forms of perceptional data relayed from both lower and higher components of the brain.  Damage to this component can produce permanent perceptual damage, however when damage is inflicted upon the [[cerebral cortex]], the brain adapts to [[neuroplasticity]] to amend any occlusions for perception.  It can be thought that the neocortex is a sophisticated memory storage warehouse in which data received as an input from sensory systems are compartmentalized via the cerebral cortex.  This would essentially allow for shapes to be identified, although given the lack of filtering input produced internally, one may as a consequence, hallucinate - essentially seeing something that isn't received as an input externally but rather internal (i.e. an error in the filtering of segmented sensory data from the cerebral cortex may result in one seeing, feeling, hearing or experiencing something that is inconsistent with reality).

Not all people have the same internal perceptual ability. For many, when the eyes are closed, the perception of darkness prevails. However, some people are able to perceive colorful, dynamic imagery. The use of [[hallucinogen]]ic drugs increases the subject's ability to consciously access visual (and auditory, and other sense) percepts.

Furthermore, the [[pineal gland]] is a hypothetical candidate for producing a mind's eye; [[Rick Strassman]] and others have postulated that during [[near-death experiences]] (NDEs) and [[dream]]ing, the gland might secrete a hallucinogenic chemical [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|''N'',''N''-Dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT) to produce internal visuals when external sensory data is occluded.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Strassman, DMT: The Spirit Molecule: A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences, 320 pages, Park Street Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-89281-927-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this hypothesis has yet to be fully supported with [[neurochemical]] evidence and plausible mechanism for DMT production.

The hypothesized condition where a person lacks a mind's eye is called [[aphantasia]]. The term was first suggested in a 2015 study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2015.05.019| pmid = 26115582| issn = 0010-9452| last1 = Zeman| first1 = Adam| last2 = Dewar| first2 = Michaela| last3 = Della Sala| first3 = Sergio| title = Lives without imagery – Congenital aphantasia| journal = Cortex| accessdate = 2015-06-24| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945215001781| volume=73| pages=378–380| year = 2015| hdl = 10871/17613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common examples of mental images include [[daydreaming]] and the mental visualization that occurs while reading a book. Another is of the pictures summoned by athletes during training or before a competition, outlining each step they will take to accomplish their goal.&lt;ref&gt;Plessinger, Annie. ''The Effects of Mental Imagery on Athletic Performance''. The Mental Edge. 12/20/13. Web. http://www.vanderbilt.edu&lt;/ref&gt; When a musician hears a song, he or she can sometimes "see" the song notes in their head, as well as hear them with all their tonal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |year=2007 |title=Musicophilia:  Tales of Music and the Brain |place=London |publisher=Picador |pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is considered different from an after-effect, such as an after-image.  Calling up an image in our minds can be a voluntary act, so it can be characterized as being under various degrees of conscious control.

According to psychologist and cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1999). ''How the Mind Works''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; our experiences of the world are represented in our minds as mental images. These mental images can then be associated and compared with others, and can be used to synthesize completely new images. In this view, mental images allow us to form useful theories of how the world works by formulating likely sequences of mental images in our heads without having to directly experience that outcome. Whether [[animal cognition|other creatures have this capability]] is debatable.

There are several theories as to how mental images are formed in the mind. These include the [[dual coding theory|dual-code theory]], the propositional theory, and the functional-equivalency hypothesis. The dual-code theory, created by [[Allan Paivio]] in 1971, is the theory that we use two separate codes to represent information in our brains: image codes and verbal codes. Image codes are things like thinking of a picture of a dog when you are thinking of a dog, whereas a verbal code would be to think of the word "dog".&lt;ref&gt;Paivio, Allan. 1941. ''Dual Coding Theory. Theories of Learning in Educational Psychology''. (2013). Web. {{cite web |url=http://www.lifecircles-inc.com/Learningtheories/IP/paivio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221091503/http://www.lifecircles-inc.com/Learningtheories/IP/paivio.html |archivedate=2011-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the difference between thinking of abstract words such as ''justice'' or ''love'' and thinking of concrete words like ''elephant'' or ''chair.'' When abstract words are thought of, it is easier to think of them in terms of verbal codes—finding words that define them or describe them. With concrete words, it is often easier to use image codes and bring up a picture of a ''human'' or ''chair'' in your mind rather than words associated or descriptive of them.

The propositional theory involves storing images in the form of a generic propositional code that stores the meaning of the concept not the image itself. The propositional codes can either be descriptive of the image or symbolic. They are then transferred back into verbal and visual code to form the mental image.&lt;ref&gt;Mental Imaging Theories. 2013. Web. http://faculty.mercer.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional-equivalency hypothesis is that mental images are "internal representations" that work in the same way as the actual perception of physical objects.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M. W. (2012). ''Fundamentals of Cognition'', 2nd ed. New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the picture of a dog brought to mind when the word ''dog'' is read is interpreted in the same way as if the person looking at an actual dog before them.

Research has occurred to designate a specific neural correlate of imagery; however, studies show a multitude of results. Most studies published before 2001 suggest neural correlates of visual imagery occur in brodmann area 17.&lt;ref name="Kobayashi e21736"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobayashi|first=Masayuki|last2=Sasabe|first2=Tetsuya|last3=Shigihara|first3=Yoshihito|last4=Tanaka|first4=Masaaki|last5=Watanabe|first5=Yasuyoshi|date=2011-07-08|title=Gustatory Imagery Reveals Functional Connectivity from the Prefrontal to Insular Cortices Traced with Magnetoencephalography|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e21736|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021736|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3132751|pmid=21760903|bibcode=2011PLoSO...621736K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory performance imagery have been observed in the premotor areas, precunes, and medial brodmann area 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meister|first=I.

==Neural substrates of visual imagery==
'''Visual imagery''' is the ability to create [[Mental image|mental representations]] of things, people, and places that are absent from an individual’s visual field. This ability is crucial to problem-solving tasks, memory, and spatial reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, N., Bosch, S. E., &amp; van Gerven, M. A. J. [http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/5/1367.abstract “Vividness of Visual Imagery Depends on the Neural Overlap with Perception in Visual Areas”], The Journal of Neuroscience, 37(5), 1367 LP-1373. (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroscientist|Neuroscientists]] have found that imagery and [[Perception|perception]] share many of the same [[Neural substrate|neural substrates]], or areas of the [[Brain|brain]] that function similarly during both imagery and perception, such as the [[Visual cortex|visual cortex]] and higher visual areas. Kosslyn and colleagues (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn, S. M., Pascual-Leone, A., Felician, O., Camposano, S., Keenan, J. P., L., W., … Alpert. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/284/5411/167.abstract “The Role of Area 17 in Visual Imagery: Convergent Evidence from PET and rTMS”], Science, 284(5411), 167 LP-170, (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the early visual cortex, Area 17 and Area 18/19, is activated during visual imagery. They found that inhibition of these areas through repetitive [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (rTMS) resulted in impaired visual perception and imagery. Furthermore, research conducted with lesioned patients has revealed that visual imagery and visual perception have the same representational organization. This has been concluded from patients in which impaired perception also experience visual imagery deficits at the same level of the mental representation.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, M. (1988). "Is Visual Imagery Really Visual? Overlooked Evidence From Neuropsychology". Psychological review. 95. 307-17. 10.1037/0033-295X.95.3.307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Behrmann and colleagues (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Behrmann, M., Winocur, G., &amp; Moscovitch, M. [https://doi.org/10.1038/359636a0 “Dissociation between mental imagery and object recognition in a brain-damaged patient”]. Nature, 359, 636. (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; describe a patient C.K., who provided evidence challenging the view that visual imagery and visual perception rely on the same representational system. C.K. was a 33-year old man with [[Visual agnosia|visual object agnosia]] acquired after a vehicular accident. This deficit prevented him from being able to recognize objects and copy objects fluidly. Surprisingly, his ability to draw accurate objects from memory indicated his visual imagery was intact and normal. Furthermore, C.K. successfully performed other tasks requiring visual imagery for judgment of size, shape, color, and composition. These findings conflict with previous research as they suggest there is a partial dissociation between visual imagery and visual perception. C.K. exhibited a perceptual deficit that was not associated with a corresponding deficit in visual imagery, indicating that these two processes have systems for mental representations that may not be mediated entirely by the same neural substrates. 

Schlegel and colleagues (2013)&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, A., Kohler, P. J., Fogelson, S. V, Alexander, P., Konuthula, D., &amp; Tse, P. U. [http://www.pnas.org/content/110/40/16277.abstract “Network structure and dynamics of the mental workspace”], Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110(40), 16277 LP-16282. (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] analysis of regions activated during manipulation of visual imagery. They identified 11 bilateral [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] and subcortical regions that exhibited increased activation when manipulating a visual image compared to when the visual image was just maintained. These regions included the [[Occipital lobe|occipital lobe]] and [[Two-streams hypothesis|ventral stream]] areas, two [[Parietal lobe|parietal lobe]] regions, the [[Posterior parietal cortex|posterior parietal cortex]] and the [[Precuneus|precuneus]] lobule, and three [[Frontal lobe|frontal lobe]] regions, the [[Frontal eye fields|frontal eye fields]], [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], and the [[Prefrontal cortex|prefrontal cortex]]. Due to their suspected involvement in [[Working memory|working memory]] and [[Attention|attention]], the authors propose that these parietal and prefrontal regions, and occipital regions, are part of a network involved in mediating the manipulation of visual imagery. These results suggest a top-down activation of visual areas in visual imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, B., &amp; Whishaw, I. Q. (2015). Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology. New York. Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[Dynamic causal modelling|Dynamic Causal Modeling]] (DCM) to determine the connectivity of cortical networks, Ishai et al. (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Ishai, A. “Seeing faces and objects with the "mind's eye”", Archives Italiennes de Biologie, 148(1):1-9. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that activation of the network mediating visual imagery is initiated by prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex activity. Generation of objects from memory resulted in initial activation of the prefrontal and the posterior parietal areas, which then activate earlier visual areas through backward connectivity. Activation of the prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex has also been found to be involved in retrieval of object representations from [[Long-term memory|long-term memory]], their maintenance in working memory, and attention during visual imagery. Thus, Ishai et al. suggest that the network mediating visual imagery is composed of attentional mechanisms arising from the posterior parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex.

Vividness of visual imagery is a crucial component of an individual’s ability to perform cognitive tasks requiring imagery. Vividness of visual imagery varies not only between individuals but also within individuals. Dijkstra and colleagues (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, N., Bosch, S. E., &amp; van Gerven, M. A. J. [http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/5/1367.abstract “Vividness of Visual Imagery Depends on the Neural Overlap with Perception in Visual Areas”], The Journal of Neuroscience, 37(5), 1367 LP-1373. (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; found that the variation in vividness of visual imagery is dependent on the degree to which the neural substrates of visual imagery overlap with those of visual perception. They found that overlap between imagery and perception in the entire visual cortex, the parietal precuneus lobule, the right parietal cortex, and the medial frontal cortex predicted the vividness of a mental representation. The activated regions beyond the visual areas are believed to drive the imagery-specific processes rather than the visual processes shared with perception. It has been suggested that the precuneus contributes to vividness by selecting important details for imagery. The medial frontal cortex is suspected to be involved in the retrieval and integration of information from the parietal and visual areas during working memory and visual imagery. The right parietal cortex appears to be important in attention, visual inspection, and stabilization of mental representations. Thus, the neural substrates of visual imagery and perception overlap in areas beyond the visual cortex and the degree of this overlap in these areas correlates with the vividness of mental representations during imagery.

==Philosophical ideas==
{{Main|Mental representation}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Mental images are an important topic in classical and modern philosophy, as they are central to the study of [[knowledge]].  In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', Book VII, [[Plato]] has [[Socrates]] present the [[Allegory of the Cave]]: a prisoner, bound and unable to move, sits with his back to a fire watching the shadows cast on the cave wall in front of him by people carrying objects behind his back. These people and the objects they carry are representations of real things in the world. Unenlightened man is like the prisoner, explains  Socrates, a human being making mental images from the sense data that he experiences.

The eighteenth-century philosopher Bishop [[George Berkeley]] proposed similar ideas in his theory of [[idealism]].  Berkeley stated that reality is equivalent to mental images&amp;mdash;our mental images are not a copy of another material reality but that reality itself. Berkeley, however, sharply distinguished between the images that he considered to constitute the external world, and the images of individual imagination. According to Berkeley, only the latter are considered "mental imagery" in the contemporary sense of the term.

The eighteenth century British writer Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]] criticized idealism.  When asked what he thought about idealism, he is alleged to have replied "I refute it thus!"{{Cite quote|date=February 2017}} as he kicked a large rock and his leg rebounded.  His point was that the idea that the rock is just another mental image and has no material existence of its own is a poor explanation of the painful sense data he had just experienced.

David Deutsch addresses Johnson's objection to idealism in ''The Fabric of Reality'' when he states that, if we judge the value of our mental images of the world by the quality and quantity of the sense data that they can explain, then the most valuable mental image&amp;mdash;or theory&amp;mdash;that we currently have is that the world has a real independent existence and that humans have successfully evolved by building up and adapting patterns of mental images to explain it.  This is an important idea in [[Philosophy of science|scientific thought]].{{Why|date=May 2010}}

Critics of [[scientific realism]] ask how the inner perception of mental images actually occurs. This is sometimes called the "[[homunculus]] problem" (see also the [[mind's eye]]). The problem is similar to asking how the images you see on a computer screen exist in the memory of the computer. To scientific [[materialism]], mental images and the perception of them must be brain-states. According to critics,{{Who|date=May 2010}} scientific realists cannot explain where the images and their perceiver exist in the brain. To use the analogy of the computer screen, these critics argue that [[cognitive science]] and [[psychology]] have been unsuccessful in identifying either the component in the brain (i.e., "hardware") or the mental processes that store these images (i.e. "software").

==In experimental psychology==

[[cognitive psychology|Cognitive psychologists]] and (later) [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscientists]] have empirically tested some of the philosophical questions related to whether and how the human brain uses mental imagery in cognition.

[[Image:MR TMR.jpg|right]]One theory of the mind that was examined in these experiments was the "brain as serial computer" philosophical metaphor of the 1970s. Psychologist [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] theorized that the human mind processes mental images by decomposing them into an underlying mathematical proposition. [[Roger Shepard]] and Jacqueline Metzler challenged that view by presenting subjects with 2D line drawings of groups of 3D block "objects" and asking them to determine whether that "object" is the same as a second figure, some of which rotations of the first "object".&lt;ref&gt;Shepard and Metzler 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Shepard and Metzler proposed that if we decomposed and then mentally re-imaged the objects into basic mathematical propositions, as the then-dominant view of cognition "as a serial digital computer"&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 1987&lt;/ref&gt; assumed, then it would be expected that the time it took to determine whether the object is the same or not would be independent of how much the object had been rotated.  Shepard and Metzler found the opposite: a linear relationship between the degree of rotation in the mental imagery task and the time it took participants to reach their answer.

This [[mental rotation]] finding implied that the human mind—and the human brain—maintains and manipulates mental images as topographic and topological wholes, an implication that was quickly put to test by psychologists.  [[Stephen Kosslyn]] and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn 1995; see also 1994&lt;/ref&gt; showed in a series of neuroimaging experiments that the mental image of objects like the letter "F" are mapped, maintained and rotated as an image-like whole in areas of the human visual cortex.  Moreover, Kosslyn's work showed that there are considerable similarities between the neural mappings for imagined stimuli and perceived stimuli.  The authors of these studies concluded that, while the neural processes they studied rely on mathematical and computational underpinnings, the brain also seems optimized to handle the sort of mathematics that constantly computes a series of topologically-based images rather than calculating a mathematical model of an object.

Recent studies in neurology and neuropsychology on mental imagery have further questioned the "mind as serial computer" theory, arguing instead that human mental imagery manifests [[motor imagery|both visually and kinesthetically]].  For example, several studies have provided evidence that people are slower at rotating line drawings of objects such as hands in directions incompatible with the joints of the human body,&lt;ref&gt;Parsons 1987; 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and that patients with painful, injured arms are slower at mentally rotating line drawings of the hand from the side of the injured arm.&lt;ref&gt;Schwoebel et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists, including Kosslyn, have argued that such results occur because of interference in the brain between distinct systems in the brain that process the visual and motor mental imagery.  Subsequent [[neuroimaging]] studies&lt;ref&gt;Kosslyn et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the interference between the motor and visual imagery system could be induced by having participants physically handle actual 3D blocks glued together to form objects similar to those depicted in the line-drawings.  Amorim et al. have shown that, when a cylindrical "head" was added to Shepard and Metzler's line drawings of 3D block figures, participants were quicker and more accurate at solving mental rotation problems.&lt;ref&gt;Amorim et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that motoric embodiment is not just "interference" that inhibits visual mental imagery but is capable of facilitating mental imagery.

As cognitive neuroscience approaches to mental imagery continued, research expanded beyond questions of serial versus parallel or topographic processing to questions of the relationship between mental images and perceptual representations. Both brain imaging (fMRI and ERP) and studies of neuropsychological patients have been used to test the hypothesis that a mental image is the reactivation, from memory, of brain representations normally activated during the perception of an external stimulus. In other words, if perceiving an apple activates contour and location and shape and color representations in the brain’s visual system, then imagining an apple activates some or all of these same representations using information stored in memory. Early evidence for this idea came from neuropsychology. Patients with brain damage that impairs perception in specific ways, for example by damaging shape or color representations, seem to generally to have impaired mental imagery in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Martha J.|title=Is visual imagery really visual? Overlooked evidence from neuropsychology|journal=Psychological Review|date=Sep 30, 1987|volume=95|issue=3|pages=307–317|doi=10.1037/0033.295X.95.3.307|pmid=3043530|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/95/3/307/|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of brain function in normal human brains support this same conclusion, showing activity in the brain’s visual areas while subjects imagined visual objects and scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cichy|first1=Radoslaw M.|last2=Heinzle|first2=Jakob|last3=Haynes|first3=John-Dylan|title=Imagery and Perception Share Cortical Representations of Content and Location|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=June 10, 2011|volume=22|issue=2|pages=372–380|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhr106|url=http://psych.wisc.edu/postlab/readings/Cereb.%20Cortex-2012-Cichy-372-80.pdf|pmid=21666128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previously mentioned and numerous related studies have led to a relative consensus within [[cognitive science]], psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy on the neural status of mental images.  In general, researchers agree that, while there is no [[homunculus]] inside the head viewing these mental images, our brains do form and maintain mental images as image-like wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Rohrer 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem of exactly how these images are stored and manipulated within the human brain, in particular within language and communication, remains a fertile area of study.

One of the longest-running research topics on the mental image has basis on the fact that people report large individual differences in the vividness of their images.  Special questionnaires have been developed to assess such differences, including the [[Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ)]] developed by [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]]. Laboratory studies have suggested that the subjectively reported variations in imagery vividness are associated with different neural states within the brain and also different cognitive competences such as the ability to accurately recall information presented in pictures&lt;ref&gt;Marks, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Rodway, Gillies and Schepman used a novel long-term change detection task to determine whether participants with low and high vividness scores on the VVIQ2 showed any performance differences.&lt;ref&gt;Rodway, Gillies and Schepman 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Rodway et al. found that high vividness participants were significantly more accurate at detecting salient changes to pictures compared to low-vividness participants.&lt;ref&gt;Rodway et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This replicated an earlier study.&lt;ref&gt;Gur and Hilgard 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have found that individual differences in VVIQ scores can be used to predict changes in a person's brain while visualizing different activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cui et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) was used to study the association between early visual cortex activity relative to the whole brain while participants visualized themselves or another person bench pressing or stair climbing. Reported image vividness correlates significantly with the relative fMRI signal in the visual cortex. Thus, individual differences in the vividness of visual imagery can be measured objectively.

Logie, Pernet, Buonocore and Della Sala (2011) used behavioural and fMRI data for mental rotation from individuals reporting vivid and poor imagery on the VVIQ. Groups differed in brain activation patterns suggesting that the groups performed the same tasks in different ways. These findings help to explain the lack of association previously reported between VVIQ scores and mental rotation performance.

==Training and learning styles==

Some [[Learning theory (education)|educational theorists]]{{Who|date=May 2010}} have drawn from the idea of mental imagery in their studies of [[learning styles]]. Proponents of these theories state that people often have learning processes that emphasize visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems of experience.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} According to these theorists, teaching in multiple overlapping sensory systems benefits learning, and they encourage teachers to use content and media that integrates well with the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems whenever possible.

Educational researchers have examined whether the experience of mental imagery affects the degree of learning. For example, imagining playing a 5-finger piano exercise (mental practice) resulted in a significant improvement in performance over no mental practice—though not as significant as that produced by physical practice.  The authors of the study stated that "mental practice alone seems to be sufficient to promote the modulation of neural circuits involved in the early stages of motor skill learning".&lt;ref&gt;Pascual-Leone et al. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visualization and the Himalayan traditions==
In general, [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], [[Bön]], and [[Tantra]] utilize sophisticated visualization or ''imaginal'' (in the language of [[Jean Houston]] of [[Transpersonal Psychology]]) processes in the [[thoughtform]] construction of the [[yidam]] [[sadhana]], [[kye-rim]], and [[dzog-rim]] modes of [[meditation]] and in the [[yantra]], [[thangka]], and [[mandala]] traditions, where holding the fully realized form in the mind is a prerequisite prior to creating an 'authentic' new art work that will provide a sacred support or foundation for deity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Dalai-Lama-at-MIT/dp/0674023196 The Dalai Lama at MIT] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.berkeley.edu/faculty/profiles/erosch2007-2.pdf Mental Imagery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229110116/http://psychology.berkeley.edu/faculty/profiles/erosch2007-2.pdf |date=2008-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Substitution effects ==
Mental imagery can act as a [[Substitute good|substitute]] for the imagined experience: Imagining an experience can evoke similar cognitive, physiological, and/or behavioral consequences as having the corresponding experience in reality. At least four classes of such effects have been documented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Imagined experiences are attributed evidentiary value like physical evidence. 
# [[Mental practice of action|Mental practice]] can instantiate the same performance benefits as physical practice. 
# Imagined consumption of a food can reduce its actual consumption. 
# Imagined goal achievement  can reduce motivation for actual goal achievement.

The mental model theory of reasoning was developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991). It has been applied to the main domains of deductive inference including relational inferences such as spatial and temporal deductions; propositional inferences, such as conditional, disjunctive and negation deductions; quantified inferences such as syllogisms; and meta-deductive inferences.

Ongoing research on [[mental models and reasoning]] has led the theory to be extended to account for probabilistic inference (e.g., Johnson-Laird, 2006) and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3131">'''Model worker''' ({{zh|s=劳动模范|p=láodòng mófàn}}, abbreviated as 劳模 or '''''láomó''''') is a Communist Chinese political term referring to an exemplary worker who exhibits some or all of the traits appropriate to the ideal of the socialist worker. The idea is similar to the Soviet [[Stakhanovite]] icon.  Model workers are selected in China by central and provincial-level departments. Some cities and large companies also have processes for selecting and praising model workers.

The basic criteria for model workers are [[patriotism]], "worship of science," activities in [[environmental protection]], and the pursuit of excellence.

Model workers are often afforded privileges not available to other citizens or [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] members. "The possibility to become a model worker offered peasants and workers one of the few opportunities for upward mobility other than joining the army," writes scholar Yu Miin-lin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = China Learns from the Soviet Union, 1949-Present (The Harvard Cold War Studies Book Series)|last = Li &amp; Bernstein|first = Hua-Yu &amp; Thomas P.|publisher = Lexington Books|year = 2011|isbn = 0739142232|location = |pages = 254|chapter = “Labor Is Glorious”: Model Laborers in the People's Republic of China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model workers have an easier time joining the Communist Party, and also to become a higher-level cadre, manager, or other leader.

==Notable model workers==
[[File:Hao Jianxiu in textile mill.jpg|thumb|[[Hao Jianxiu]], model worker in 1951]]
One of the earliest model workers was the teenage textile worker [[Hao Jianxiu]] (awarded 1951), who invented the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method". She was sent to study at [[East China Textile Engineering Institute]] and was elevated to the upper echelon of Chinese politics, serving as Minister of Textile Industry, secretary of the [[CPC Central Secretariat]], and vice chair of the [[National Development and Reform Commission|State Planning Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Lily Xiao Hong |last2=Stefanowska |first2=A.

[[File:Ni Zhifu1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ni Zhifu]], model worker in 1959]]
Another prominent model worker was [[Ni Zhifu]] (awarded 1959), a [[Fitter (occupation)|fitter]] who invented the "Ni Zhifu drill". He was elevated to leadership positions in the municipal governments of [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Tianjin]], and became a member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China]]. He also served as Chairman of the [[All-China Federation of Trade Unions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.people.com.cn/n/2013/0503/c1001-21348753.html |script-title=zh:倪志福同志生平 |trans-title=Biography of Ni Zhifu |work=People's Daily |date=3 May 2013 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10630">'''Negative consequentialism''' is a version of the ethical theory [[consequentialism]], which is "one of the major theories of [[normative ethics]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peterson|2013|page=vii}}: "Consequentialism is one of the major theories of normative ethics."&lt;/ref&gt; Like other versions of consequentialism, negative consequentialism holds that moral right and wrong depend only on the value of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=19}}: "The whole family of utilitarian theories is captured by the equation: Utilitarianism = Consequentialism (nothing but the values of outcomes matter for the rightness of actions) + Welfarism (nothing but well-being matters for the value of outcomes)."&lt;/ref&gt; That is, for negative and other versions of consequentialism, questions such as "what should I do?" and "what kind of person should I be?" are answered only based on consequences. Negative consequentialism differs from other versions of consequentialism by giving greater weight in moral deliberations to what is bad (e.g. suffering or injustice) than what is good (e.g. happiness or justice).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “Negative consequentialism is the version of consequentialism that focuses on reducing harms. It has this focus because it assumes that there aren’t things of positive intrinsic value, while there are things of negative intrinsic value. Therefore, in deciding on whether to act in a particular way, a negative consequentialist would consider what harms it would cause, eliminate, increase or decrease.”
{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}: “Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family.”
{{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: “NU [negative utilitarianism] comes in several flavours, which I will outline later, but the basic thrust is that an act is morally right if and only if it leads to less suffering than any available alternative. Unlike Classical Utilitarianism, positive experiences such as pleasure or happiness are either given no weight, or at least a lot less weight. (In what follows, I use the word 'happiness' to stand in for whatever aspects of life might be thought to have positive value).”
&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific type of consequentialism is [[utilitarianism]], which says that the consequences that matter are those that affect well-being.{{sfn|Bykvist|2009|page=19}} Consequentialism is broader than utilitarianism in that consequentialism can say that the value of outcomes depend on other things than well-being; for example, justice, fairness, and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooker|Mason|Miller|2000|page=2}}: “Other consequentialist theories take other things to be valuable, for example justice, fairness, and equality.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Negative utilitarianism]] is thus a form of negative consequentialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “One form of negative consequentialism is negative utilitarianism.”&lt;/ref&gt; Much more has been written explicitly about [[negative utilitarianism]] than directly about negative consequentialism, although since negative utilitarianism is a form of negative consequentialism, everything that has been written about negative utilitarianism is by definition about a specific (utilitarian) version of negative consequentialism. Similarly to how there are many variations of consequentialism and negative utilitarianism, there are many versions of negative consequentialism, for example negative [[prioritarianism]] and negative consequentialist [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “According to negative consequentialism such as negative prioritarianism, negative utilitarianism, and negative consequentialist egalitarianism...”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. E. Moore]]'s ethics can be said to be a negative consequentialism (more precisely, a consequentialism with a negative utilitarian component), because he has been labeled a consequentialist,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|1995|page=46}}: “Moore is indeed a consequentialist.”&lt;/ref&gt; and he said that "consciousness of intense pain is, by itself, a great evil"{{sfn|Moore|1951 |p=213}} whereas "the mere consciousness of pleasure, however intense, does not, ''by itself'', appear to be a ''great'' good, even if it has some slight intrinsic value. In short, pain (if we understand by this expression, the consciousness of pain) appears to be a far worse evil than pleasure is a good."{{sfn|Moore|1951 |p=212}} Moore wrote in the first half of the 20th century before any of the terms 'consequentialism,' 'negative utilitarianism' or 'negative consequentialism' were coined, and he did not use the term 'negative consequentialism' himself.&lt;ref&gt;Moore died in 1958; the same year that both of the terms 'consequentialism' and 'negative utilitarianism' seem to have been coined. According to {{harvnb|Spielthenner|2005|page=231}}, "It seems that the term 'consequentialism' has been coined by E. Anscombe in her influential article 'Modern Moral Philosophy' (1958)." {{harvnb|Smart|1958}} is widely considered to have coined the term 'negative utilitarianism.'&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Moore, [[Ingemar Hedenius]] defended a consequentialism that could be called negative (or could be said to have a negative utilitarian component) because he assigned more importance to suffering than to happiness. Hedenius saw the worst in life, such as infernalistic suffering, as so evil that calculations of happiness versus suffering becomes unnecessary; he did not see that such evil could be counterbalanced by any good, such as happiness.{{sfn|Petersson|2009}}

Philosophy professor Clark Wolf defends "negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2009|page=360}}: "For a defence of a negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice, see Wolf (1999)." That is, see {{harvnb|Wolf|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Sinnott-Armstrong]] interprets [[Bernard Gert]]'s moral system as a "sophisticated form of negative objective universal public rule consequentialism."{{sfn|Sinnott-Armstrong|2002|p=147}} Jamie Mayerfeld argues for a strong duty to relieve suffering, which is consequentialist in form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayerfeld|1999|page=116}}: "The duty to relieve suffering, I have suggested, arises from the badness of suffering." {{harvnb|Mayerfeld|1999|page=117}}: "The duty to relieve suffering is consequentialist in form."&lt;/ref&gt; He says that "suffering is more bad than happiness is good,"{{sfn|Mayerfeld|1999|p=136}} and that "the lifelong bliss of many people, no matter how many, cannot justify our allowing the lifelong torture of one."{{sfn|Mayerfeld|1999|p=178}}

'''Negative cutting'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Case|first=Dominic|title=Film Technology in Post Production|publisher=CRC Press, 2012|isbn= 9781136049774}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''negative matching''' and '''negative conforming''') is the process of cutting motion picture negative to match precisely the final edit as specified by the [[film editor]]. [[Original camera negative]] (OCN) is cut with scissors and joined using a [[film splicer]] and [[film cement]]. Negative cutting is part of the [[post-production]] process and occurs after editing and prior to striking [[internegative]]s and release prints. The process of negative cutting has changed little since the beginning of cinema in the early 20th century. In the early 1980s computer software was first used to aid the cutting process.  Kodak introduced barcode on motion picture negative in the mid-1990s. This enabled negative cutters to more easily track shots and identify film sections based on [[keykode]].

Toward the late 1990s and early 2000s negative cutting changed due to the advent of [[digital cinema]] technologies such as [[digital intermediate]] (DI), digital projection and [[high-definition television]]. In some countries, due to the high cost of online suites, negative cutting is still used for commercials by reducing footage. Increasingly feature films are bypassing the negative cutting process altogether and are being scanned directly from the uncut [[Dailies|rushes]].

The existence of [[digital intermediate]]s (DI) has created a new demand for negative cutters to extract [[selected takes]] which are cut from the [[Dailies|rushes]] and re-spliced into new rolls (in edit order) to reduce the volume of footage for scanning.

== Basic ==
After a film shoot, the [[original camera negative]] (OCN) is sent to a film laboratory for processing. Two or three {{convert|400|ft|m|sing=on}} camera rolls are spliced together to create a lab roll approximately {{convert|1200|-|1500|ft|m|abbr=on}} long. After developing the lab roll, it is put through a [[telecine]] to create a [[Dailies|rushes]] transfer tape. This [[Dailies|rushes]] transfer tape is of lower quality than film and is used for editing purposes only.

The [[Dailies|rushes]] tape is sent to the Editor who loads it into an offline edit suite. The lab rolls are sent to the negative cutter for logging and storage.

After the Editor finishes the Edit it is exported to an offline [[edit decision list|EDL list]] and the EDL list is sent to the negative cutter. The negative cutter will translate the Timecode in the EDL list to edge numbers ([[keykode]]) using specially designed negative cutting software to find which shot is needed from the [[Juncaceae|rushes]] negative.

Traditionally a negative cutter would then fine cut the negative to match the Editor's final edit frame accurately. Negative would be spliced together to create rolls less than {{convert|2000|ft|m}} which would then be sent to the film laboratory to print release prints.

Today most feature films are extracted full takes (as [[selected takes]]) and scanned digitally as a [[digital intermediate]]. Television series and commercials shot on film follow the same extraction process but are sent for [[telecine]]. Each required shot is extracted from the lab roll as a full take and [[Film splicer|respliced]] together to create a new selected roll of negative. This reduces the negative required by up to 1/10 of the footage shot, saving considerable time during scanning or telecine. The negative cutter will create a new Online EDL list replacing the [[Dailies|rushes]] roll timecode with the new selected roll timecode.

In the case of feature films the selected roll and Online EDL are sent to a post production facility for scanning as a [[digital intermediate]]. For television commercials or series the selected takes and EDL are sent to a post production facility for re-telecine and compiled in an Online Suite for final grading.

== Software ==

There have been a number of dedicated software systems that have been developed for and by negative cutters to manage the process of cutting motion picture negative. A number of individual proprietary software systems have been developed starting in the early 1980s. Stan Sztaba developed a system for World Cinevision Services Inc (New York) in 1983 using Apple II DOS and then [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], this system is still used today. Elliott Gamson of Immaculate Matching (New York) developed a system using [[MS-DOS]]. Computamatch was one of the first [[MS-DOS]]-based systems developed and is still in use today in several countries.

The first commercially available software product was OSC/R (pronounced "Oscar"), a DOS-based application developed in Toronto, Canada by The Adelaide Works. OSC/R was very widely used and at the time was the only negative cutting software on the market until Adelaide Works ceased operation in 1993. OSC/R is still used today in some negative cutting facilities but has been mostly replaced by newer and more advanced systems. Excalibur was a later Windows 98 based product developed by FilmLab Engineering in Britain. Film Fusion is one of the most recent developments and is a Windows XP and Vista based system developed in Sydney, Australia by Popsoft IT.

== Hardware ==

Negative cutters use various hardware tools such as film [[Synchronizer (film editing)|synchronizers]], re-winders, [[film splicer]]s, scissors, [[film cement]] and film keykode readers. [[DigiSync]], a purpose built keykode reader is used by most negative cutters in conjunction with software for logging the keykode from film. [[DigiSync]] was developed by [[Research In Motion]] and in 1998 it won a Technical Achievement Academy Award for the design and development of the [[DigiSync]] Film Keykode Reader. [[Research In Motion]] later moved on to bigger things and invented the [[BlackBerry]] Wireless Email Phone and is now a publicly listed company. Other brands of  barcode scanners are also in use.

In [[organic chemistry]], '''negative hyperconjugation''' is the donation of [[electron density]] from a filled π- or p-orbital to a neighboring [[antibonding orbital|σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-orbital]].&lt;ref name="iupac1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.iupac.org/goldbook/NT07081.pdf |title=Negative Hyper-Conjugation |publisher=Old.iupac.org |accessdate=2013-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324085532/http://old.iupac.org/goldbook/NT07081.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon, a type of [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]], can stabilize the molecule or [[transition state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/54173058/46/Negative-Hyperconjugation |title=2.2.3 Negative Hyperconjugation for Ebooksclub.org Molecular Orbitals and Organic Chemical Reactions Student Edition |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2011-04-29 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also causes an elongation of the [[sigma bond|σ-bond]] by adding electron density to its [[antibonding orbital]].&lt;ref name="iupac1"/&gt;

Negative hyperconjugation is most commonly observed when the σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-orbital is located on certain C–F or C–O bonds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2008/NJ/b718430a |title=Negative hyperconjugation of some fluorine containing groups – New Journal of Chemistry (RSC Publishing) |publisher=Pubs.rsc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo7017476 |title=Role of Negative Hyperconjugation and Anomeric Effects in the Stabilization of the Intermediate in SNV Reactions - The Journal of Organic Chemistry (ACS Publications) |publisher=Pubs.acs.org |date=2007-08-09 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not occur to an appreciable extent with normal C–H bonds.

In negative hyperconjugation, the electron density flows in the ''opposite'' direction (from π- or p-orbital to empty σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-orbital) than it does in the more common [[hyperconjugation]] (from σ-orbital to empty p-orbital).

A '''negative repetition''' ('''negative rep''') is the repetition of a technique in [[weight training|weight lifting]] in which the lifter performs the eccentric phase of a lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of Eccentric Weight Training|url = http://weighttraining.about.com/od/glossary/g/eccentric.htm|accessdate = 2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of pressing the weight up slowly, in proper form, a [[Spotting (weight training)|spotter]] generally aids in the concentric, or lifting, portion of the repetition while the lifter slowly performs the eccentric phase for 3–6 seconds. Negative reps are used to improve both [[Physical strength|muscular strength]] and power in subjects, this is commonly known as hypertrophy training.

Due to its mechanical properties, this form of training can be used for both healthy individuals and individuals who are in rehabilitation. Studies have shown that negative repetitions or "[[Eccentric training|eccentric phase training]]" combines a high amount of force on the muscle with a lower energy cost than normal concentric training, which requires 4–5 times the amount of energy. This justifies why this type of training is more beneficial and less of a risk to subjects rehabilitating or with a limited exercise capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Eccentric+Exercise+Training%3A+Modalities%2C+Applications+and+Perspectives&amp;rft.jtitle=Sports+Medicine&amp;rft.au=Marie-Eve+Isner-Horobeti&amp;rft.au=St%C3%A9phane+Pascal+Dufour&amp;rft.au=Philippe+Vautravers&amp;rft.au=Bernard+Geny&amp;rft.date=2013-06-01&amp;rft.pub=Springer+Science+%26+Business+Media&amp;rft.issn=0112-1642&amp;rft.eissn=1179-2035&amp;rft.volume=43&amp;rft.issue=6&amp;rft.spage=483&amp;rft.externalDocID=3141405021&amp;paramdict=en-US|title = Eccentric exercise training: modalities, applications and perspectives|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = Sports Medicine|doi = 10.1007/s40279-013-0052-y|pmid = |access-date = |volume=43 |pages=483–512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Eccentric training is often associated with the terms "muscles soreness" and "muscle damage". In 1902, [[Theodore Hough]] discovered and developed the term DOMS ([[delayed onset muscle soreness]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/doms-the-good-the-bad-and-what-it-really-means-to-your-training|title = DOMS: the good, the bad and what it really means to your training|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; after he found that exercises containing negative repetitions caused athletes to have sore muscles. Hough believed this was causing a rupture within the muscle; when he looked further into the subject, he found that when performing eccentric exercise that exhibited soreness, the muscle "quickly adapts and becomes accustomed to the increase in applied stress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mc.uky.edu/athletic_training/docs/nzsmsc-2010/Eccentric_Training_Spring2011.pdf|title = Eccentric training|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this was that the muscles' soreness not only decreased, but the muscular damage did too.

== Health benefits for the elderly ==
It has been proven that eccentric resistance training improves the functional mobility of older adults. Studies have shown that eccentric training of the lower body, in particular the [[:Category:Knee extensors|knee extensors]], are essential in preventing falls in older adults and helping them maintain their independence. A study conducted focusing on eccentric training for the age group 65–87 years of age showed that, over 12 weeks, they had strengthened their knee extensors by up to 26%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Aging%2C+functional+capacity+and+eccentric+exercise+training&amp;rft.jtitle=Aging+and+disease&amp;rft.au=Gault%2C+Mandy+L&amp;rft.au=Willems%2C+Mark+E+T&amp;rft.date=2013&amp;rft.eissn=2152-5250&amp;rft.volume=4&amp;rft.issue=6&amp;rft.spage=351&amp;rft_id=info:pmid/24307968&amp;rft.externalDocID=24307968&amp;paramdict=en-US|title = Aging, Functional Capacity and Eccentric Exercise Training|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this evidence, it is reasonable to suggest that negative repetitions can help improve the health of older adults.

== Treatment of Tendinopathy ==
Studies have shown that eccentric training may be successful in the treatment of certain [[Tendinitis|tendonitis]]. Studies have shown that the use of eccentric training for twelve weeks may be an alternative to therapy for people suffering from [[Patellar tendinitis|Patellar Tendinopathy]] (Jumper's Knee).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Surgical Treatment Compared with Eccentric Training for Patellar Tendinopathy (Jumper's Knee)|url = http://jbjs.org/content/88/8/1689|journal = The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery|date = 2006-08-01|access-date = 2015-04-16|issn = 0021-9355|pmid = 16882889|pages = 1689–1698|volume = 88|issue = 8|doi = 10.2106/JBJS.E.01181|first = Roald|last = Bahr|first2 = Bjørn|last2 = Fossan|first3 = Sverre|last3 = Løken|first4 = Lars|last4 = Engebretsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eccentric training has also been proven successful in the treatment of chronic [[Achilles tendinitis|Achilles tendonitis]], using a twelve-week eccentric calf muscle program various studies have shown the ability for people to return to normal pre-tendonitis levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chronic Achilles tendon pain treated with eccentric calf-muscle training|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00167-003-0418-z|journal = Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy|date = 2003-08-26|access-date = 2015-04-16|issn = 0942-2056|pages = 327–333|volume = 11|issue = 5|doi = 10.1007/s00167-003-0418-z|first = Martin|last = Fahlström|first2 = Per|last2 = Jonsson|first3 = Ronny|last3 = Lorentzon|first4 = Håkan|last4 = Alfredson|pmid=12942235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0838.2001.110402.x/epdf|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0838.2001.110402.x/epdf|accessdate = 2015-04-16 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0838.2001.110402.x|volume=11|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports|pages=197–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning behind the benefits of eccentric training for tendinopathy is still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Clinical improvement after 6 weeks of eccentric exercise in patients with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy – a randomized trial with 1-year follow-up |url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.378.x|journal = Scand J Med Sci Sports|access-date = 2015-04-16|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.378.x|volume=14|pages=286–295|pmid=15387802|date=October 2004 | last1 = Roos | first1 = EM | last2 = Engström | first2 = M | last3 = Lagerquist | first3 = A | last4 = Söderberg | first4 = B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current &lt;math&gt;v/i\,&lt;/math&gt;, and ''differential resistance'', the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;. The term negative resistance means '''negative differential resistance (NDR)''', &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can [[amplifier|amplify]],&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;"''In semiconductor physics, it is known that if a two-terminal device shows negative differential resistance it can amplify.''" {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, and [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[neon lamp]]s. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as [[transistor]]s and [[op amp]]s with [[positive feedback]] can have negative differential resistance. These are used in [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] and [[active filter]]s.

Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive "ohmic" resistances usually encountered in [[electric circuit]]s. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can have negative resistance over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; Therefore, there is no real "negative resistor" analogous to a positive [[resistor]], which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.

The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in ''I–V'' graphs where the voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is the independent variable) and is constant.

==Operation==
One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions of current and electric power between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:
{|
|-
| The voltage '''''v''''' and current '''''i''''' variables in an electrical component must be defined according to the [[passive sign convention]]; positive [[conventional current]] is defined to enter the positive voltage terminal; this means power '''''P''''' flowing from the circuit into the component is defined to be positive, while power flowing from the component into the circuit is negative.&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt; This applies to both DC and AC current. The diagram shows the directions for positive values of the variables. || [[File:Passive sign convention.svg|140px]]
|-
| In a '''positive static resistance''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, so '''''v''''' and '''''i''''' have the same sign.&lt;ref name="Chua2"&gt;{{cite book

}}, &lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, from the passive sign convention above, conventional current (flow of positive charge) is through the device from the positive to the negative terminal, in the direction of the [[electric field]] '''''E''''' (decreasing [[electric potential|potential]]).&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt; so the charges lose [[potential energy]] doing [[work (physics)|work]] on the device, and electric power flows from the circuit into the device,&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karady" /&gt; where it is converted to heat or some other form of energy ''(yellow)''. If AC voltage is applied, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; periodically reverse direction, but the instantaneous &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; always flows from the higher potential to the lower potential. || [[File:Electric load animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a '''power source''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt; so &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; This means current is forced to flow from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt; The charges gain potential energy, so power flows out of the device into the circuit:&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Work ''(yellow)'' must be done on the charges by some power source in the device to make them move in this direction against the force of the electric field. || [[File:Electric power source animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a passive '''negative differential resistance''', &lt;math&gt;r_\text{diff}\;=\;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, only the ''AC component'' of the current flows in the reverse direction. The static resistance is positive&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; so the current flows from positive to negative: &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. But the current (rate of charge flow) decreases as the voltage increases. So when a time-varying (AC) voltage is applied in addition to a DC voltage ''(right)'', the time-varying current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; and voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; components have opposite signs, so &lt;math&gt;P_\text{AC}\;=\;\Delta v\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; This means the instantaneous AC current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; flows through the device in the direction of increasing AC voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt;, so AC power flows out of the device into the circuit. The device consumes DC power, some of which is converted to AC signal power which can be delivered to a load in the external circuit,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; enabling the device to amplify the AC signal applied to it.&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; || [[File:Negative differential resistance animation.gif|150px]]

}} In this video Prof. Horowitz demonstrates that negative static resistance actually exists. He has a black box with two terminals, labelled "−10 kilohms" and shows with ordinary test equipment that it acts like a linear negative resistor (active resistor) with a resistance of −10 KΩ: a positive voltage across it causes a proportional ''negative'' current through it, and when connected in a voltage divider with an ordinary resistor the output of the divider is greater than the input, it can amplify. At the end he opens the box and shows it contains an op-amp negative impedance converter circuit and battery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Unlike in the above devices, the downward-sloping region of the ''I–V'' curve passes through the origin, so it lies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the plane, meaning the device sources power.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; Amplifying devices like [[transistor]]s and [[op-amp]]s with positive [[feedback]] can have this type of negative resistance,&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pippard3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisson"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Battery and resistor circuit 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law|KVL]], the static resistance of a power source (''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), such as a battery, is always equal to the negative of the static resistance of its load (''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; ]]

However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current '''''v/i''''' at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt; For electric power ([[potential energy]]) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, [[conventional current]] (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; So the direction of the instantaneous current is ''out'' of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the [[passive sign convention]] so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{static} = \frac {v}{i} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
This can also be proved from [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]]&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = iv = i^2 R_\mathrm{static} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;P\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Whether or not this quantity is referred to as "resistance" when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative,&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; but this is not to be regarded as "resistance" in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to [[conservation of energy]] it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit ''(right)''.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;

[[Work (physics)|Work]] must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so [[conservation of energy]] requires that negative static resistances have a source of power.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar"&gt;{{cite book

This derives a slightly more complicated circuit where the two voltage divider resistors are different to allow scaling, but it reduces to the text circuit by setting ''R2'' and ''R3'' in the source to ''R1'' in the text, and ''R1'' in source to ''Z'' in the text. The ''I–V'' curve is the same.&lt;/ref&gt; will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.

==Negative differential resistance==
In a device or circuit with negative differential resistance (NDR), in some part of the ''I–V'' curve the current decreases as the voltage increases:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{diff} = \frac {dv}{di} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
The ''I–V'' curve is [[monotonic|nonmonotonic]] (having peaks and troughs) with regions of negative slope representing negative differential resistance.

[[Passivity (engineering)|Passive]] negative differential resistances have positive ''static'' resistance;&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; they consume net power. Therefore, the ''I–V'' curve is confined to the 1st and 3rd quadrants of the graph,&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; and passes through the origin. This requirement means (excluding some asymptotic cases) that the region(s) of negative resistance must be limited,&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; and surrounded by regions of positive resistance, and cannot include the origin.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;

The reason is that in [[linear circuit]]s if the load line crosses the I-V curve of the NR device at one point, the circuit is stable, while in nonlinear switching circuits that operate by [[hysteresis]] the same condition causes the circuit to become unstable and oscillate as an [[astable multivibrator]], and the [[bistability|bistable]] region is considered the "stable" one. This article uses the former "linear" definition, the earliest one, which is found in the Abraham, Bangert, Dorf, Golio, and Tellegen sources. The latter "switching circuit" definition is found in the Kumar and Taub sources.&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''N'''" type): In this type the current is a [[single-valued function|single valued]], [[continuous function]] of the voltage, but the voltage is a [[multivalued function]] of the current.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter "N". As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then increases again.

Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is &lt;math&gt;\Delta v /\Delta i\,=\,-r&lt;/math&gt;. For stability &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Using the formula for a [[voltage divider]], the AC output voltage is&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_o = \frac{-r}{R-r}v_i = \frac{r}{r-R}v_i \,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;so the [[voltage gain]] is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;G_v = \frac{r}{r-R} \,&lt;/math&gt;
In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance &lt;math&gt;r - R\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than the resistance of the diode alone &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; so the AC output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_o&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the input &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage gain &lt;math&gt;G_v\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, and increases without limit as &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Because the current and voltage are 180° out of phase, the instantaneous AC current Δ''i'' flows ''out'' of the terminal with positive AC voltage Δ''v''. Therefore it adds to the AC source current Δ''i''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; through the load ''R'', increasing the output power.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt;

The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the [[superposition principle]] the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;V_{bias},\;I_{bias}&lt;/math&gt;)}} and an AC component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\Delta v,\;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = V_\text{bias} + \Delta v(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = I_\text{bias} + \Delta i(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since a positive change in voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; causes a ''negative'' change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° [[out of phase]].&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radmanesh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web

With the proper external circuit, the device can increase the AC signal power delivered to a load, serving as an [[amplifier]],&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; or excite oscillations in a resonant circuit to make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. Unlike in a [[two port]] amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals ([[two port|port]]) as the input signal enters.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current,&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power is limited by the bias power&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|P_\text{AC}| \le I_\text{bias} V_\text{bias} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The negative differential resistance region cannot include the origin, because it would then be able to amplify a signal with no applied DC bias current, producing AC power with no power input.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; The device also dissipates some power as heat, equal to the difference between the DC power in and the AC power out.

The device may also have [[electrical reactance|reactance]] and therefore the phase difference between current and voltage may differ from 180° and may vary with frequency.&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book

The reason that the output signal can leave a negative resistance through the same port that the input signal enters is that from [[transmission line]] theory, the AC voltage or current at the terminals of a component can be divided into two oppositely moving waves, the ''incident wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_I\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels toward the device, and the ''reflected wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_R\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels away from the device.&lt;ref name="Bowick"&gt;{{cite book

The "reflected" (output) signal has larger amplitude than the incident; the device has "reflection gain".&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; The reflection coefficient is determined by the AC impedance of the negative resistance device, &lt;math&gt;Z_N(j\omega)\,=\,R_N\,+\,jX_N&lt;/math&gt;, and the impedance of the circuit attached to it, &lt;math&gt;Z_L(j\omega)\,=\,R_L\,+\,jX_L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; If &lt;math&gt;R_N\,&lt;\,0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&gt;\,0\,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|\Gamma|\,&gt;\,0\,&lt;/math&gt; and the device will amplify.

The DC load line (DCL) is a straight line determined by the DC bias circuit, with equation
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_S - IR\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt; is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) occur where the DC load line intersects the ''I–V'' curve. For stability&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt;
*VCNRs require a low impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}}, such as a [[voltage source]].
*CCNRs require a high impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}} such as a [[current source]], or voltage source in series with a high resistance.
The AC load line (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; facing the device. Increasing &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions ''(see diagrams)'', depending on &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;
*'''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;Stable region (green)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): When the load line lies in this region, it intersects the ''I–V'' curve at one point ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; For nonreactive circuits it is a [[stability theory|stable equilibrium]] ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in the LHP) so the circuit is stable.

*'''Unstable point''' (Line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): When &lt;math&gt;R_L\;=\;r&lt;/math&gt; the load line is tangent to the ''I–V'' curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the ''jω'' axis), so it is unstable and with a [[tuned circuit]] can oscillate. Linear [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to ''eventual passivity'' the negative resistance ''r'' decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R_L&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Bistable region (red)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): In this region the load line can intersect the ''I–V'' curve at three points.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The center point (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a point of [[unstable equilibrium]] (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[stable equilibria]]. So with correct biasing the circuit can be [[bistability|bistable]], it will converge to one of the two points ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s ([[bistable multivibrator]]s) and [[Schmidt trigger]]s operate in this region.
**VCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;
**CCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;

These have negative differential resistance ''(&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; region)'' and produce power ''(grey region)''. Applying a large enough voltage or current of either polarity to the port moves the device into its nonlinear region where saturation of the amplifier causes the differential resistance to become positive ''('''black''' portion of curve)'', and above the supply voltage rails &lt;math&gt;\pm V_S\,&lt;/math&gt; the static resistance becomes positive and the device consumes power. The negative resistance depends on the loop gain &lt;math&gt;A\beta \,&lt;/math&gt; ''(right)''.

In circuit theory these are called "active resistors".&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kouřil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miano" /&gt; Applying a voltage across the terminals causes a proportional current ''out'' of the positive terminal, the opposite of an ordinary resistor.&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HorowitzVideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; For example, connecting a battery to the terminals would cause the battery to [[rechargeable battery|charge]] rather than discharge.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

Considered as one-port devices, these circuits function similarly to the passive negative differential resistance components above, and like them can be used to make one-port amplifiers and oscillators&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; with the advantages that:
*because they are active devices they do not require an external DC bias to provide power, and can be [[DC coupling|DC coupled]],
*the amount of negative resistance can be varied by adjusting the [[loop gain]],
*they can be linear circuit elements;&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimopoulos" /&gt; if operation is confined to the straight segment of the curve near the origin the voltage is proportional to the current, so they do not cause [[harmonic distortion]].
The ''I–V'' curve can have voltage-controlled ("N" type) or current-controlled ("S" type) negative resistance, depending on whether the feedback loop is connected in "shunt" or "series".&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;

A tuned circuit connected to a negative resistance which cancels some but not all of its parasitic loss resistance (so &lt;math&gt;|R_\text{if}|\;&lt;\;r_\text{loss}&lt;/math&gt;) will not oscillate, but the negative resistance will decrease the damping in the circuit (moving its [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s toward the ''jω'' axis), increasing its [[Q factor]] so it has a narrower [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and more [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite conference

:&lt;math&gt;v_o = v(R_1 + R_1)/R_1 = 2v \,&lt;/math&gt;
So if a voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied "backwards" across &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, causing current to flow through it out of the input.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The current is
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac {v - v_o}{Z} = \frac {v - 2v}{Z} = - \frac {v}{Z} \, &lt;/math&gt;
So the input impedance to the circuit is&lt;ref name="Muthuswamy" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{in} = \frac {v}{i} = -Z \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The circuit converts the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to its negative. If &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a resistor of value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, within the linear range of the op amp &lt;math&gt;V_\text{S}/2\;&lt;\;v\;&lt;\;-V_\text{S}/2&lt;/math&gt; the input impedance acts like a linear "negative resistor" of value &lt;math&gt;-R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component.

===Negative capacitance and inductance===
By replacing &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in the above circuit with a capacitor {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;) or inductor (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;)}}, negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; A negative capacitance will have an ''I–V'' relation and an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{C}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;i = -C {dv \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_C = -1/j\omega C \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to ''discharge''; its voltage will ''decrease''. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an ''I–V'' characteristic and impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;v = -L {di \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_L = -j\omega L \,&lt;/math&gt;
A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.

There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are "non-Foster" circuits which violate [[Foster's reactance theorem]].&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A resonator such as an LC circuit is "almost" an oscillator; it can store oscillating electrical energy, but because all resonators have internal resistance or other losses, the oscillations are [[damping|damped]] and decay to zero.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; The negative resistance cancels the positive resistance of the resonator, creating in effect a lossless resonator, in which spontaneous continuous oscillations occur at the resonator's [[resonant frequency]].&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in modern high frequency oscillators, transistors are increasingly used as one-port negative resistance devices like diodes. At microwave frequencies, transistors with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable due to internal feedback and show negative resistance at the other port.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt; So high frequency transistor oscillators are designed by applying a reactive load to one port to give the transistor negative resistance, and connecting the other port across a resonator to make a negative resistance oscillator as described below.&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

''DCL'': DC load line, which sets the Q point.&lt;br /&gt;
''SSL'': negative resistance during startup while amplitude is small. Since &lt;math&gt;r\;&lt;\;R&lt;/math&gt; poles are in RHP and amplitude of oscillations increases.&lt;br /&gt;
''LSL'': large-signal load line. When the current swing approaches the edges of the negative resistance region ''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(green)&lt;/span&gt;'', the sine wave peaks are distorted ("clipped") and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; decreases until it equals &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. ]]

The common [[Gunn diode]] oscillator ''(circuit diagrams)''&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode ''D'' has voltage controlled ("N" type) negative resistance and the voltage source &lt;math&gt;V_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is &lt;math&gt;dv/di\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt;. The [[choke (electronics)|choke]] ''RFC'' prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit &lt;math&gt;LC&lt;/math&gt;, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] gives a differential equation for &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2 i}{dt^2} + \frac {R - r}{L}\frac {di}{dt} + \frac {1}{LC}i = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation gives a solution of the form&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = i_0 e^{\alpha t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{r - R}{2L} \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac {1}{LC} - \left(\frac {r - R}{2L}\right)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the current through the circuit, &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, varies with time about the DC [[Q point]], &lt;math&gt;I_\text{bias}&lt;/math&gt;. When started from a nonzero initial current &lt;math&gt;i(t)\;=\;i_0&lt;/math&gt; the current oscillates [[sinusoidal]]ly at the [[resonant frequency]] '''''ω''''' of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing [[exponential function|exponentially]], depending on the value of '''''α'''''. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
#[[File:Sinusoid decreasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &lt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; So the circuit does not oscillate.
#[[File:Sinusoid constant amplitude.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r = R \Rightarrow \alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles on '''''jω''''' axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.
#[[File:Sinusoid increasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &gt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started.&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; A widely used rule of thumb is to make &lt;math&gt;R\;=\;r/3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung2"&gt;{{cite web

}}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; When the power is turned on, [[electrical noise]] in the circuit provides a signal &lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt; to start spontaneous oscillations, which grow exponentially. However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.

At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be the "average" resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance &lt;math&gt;R\;-\;r&lt;/math&gt; and the damping &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;

*'''Negative resistance (voltage controlled) oscillator:''' Since VCNR ("N" type) devices require a low impedance bias and are stable for load impedances less than ''r'',&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt; the ideal oscillator circuit for this device has the form shown at top right, with a voltage source ''V''&lt;sub&gt;bias&lt;/sub&gt; to bias the device into its negative resistance region, and [[RLC circuit|parallel resonant circuit]] load ''LC''. The resonant circuit has high impedance only at its resonant frequency, so the circuit will be unstable and oscillate only at that frequency.

The series LC circuit has low impedance only at its resonant frequency and so will only oscillate there.

===Conditions for oscillation===
Most oscillators are more complicated than the Gunn diode example, since both the active device and the load may have reactance (''X'') as well as resistance (''R''). Modern negative resistance oscillators are designed by a [[frequency domain]] technique due to K. Kurokawa.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurokawa"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[complex impedance]] of the negative resistance part &lt;math&gt;Z_N = R_N(I, \omega) + jX_N(I, \omega) \,&lt;/math&gt; depends on frequency ''ω'' but is also nonlinear, in general declining with the amplitude of the AC oscillation current ''I''; while the resonator part &lt;math&gt;Z_L = R_L(\omega) + jX_L(\omega) \,&lt;/math&gt; is linear, depending only on frequency.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt; The circuit equation is &lt;math&gt;(Z_N + Z_L)I = 0\,&lt;/math&gt; so it will only oscillate (have nonzero ''I'') at the frequency ''ω'' and amplitude ''I'' for which the total impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_N + Z_L \,&lt;/math&gt; is zero.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt; This means the magnitude of the negative and positive resistances must be equal, and the reactances must be [[complex conjugate|conjugate]]&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_N \le -R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;X_N = -X_L \,&lt;/math&gt;
For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the [[reflection coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_N = V_2/V_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, while that of the resonator part &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_L = V_1/V_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Gamma_N \Gamma_L| \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]] for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient,&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions,&lt;ref name="Kurokawa" /&gt; which are often used instead.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

==Amplifiers==
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make [[amplifier]]s, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Because negative resistance devices have only one ''port'' (two terminals), unlike [[two-port network|two-port]] devices such as [[transistor]]s, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it.&lt;ref name="Iniewski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is ''bilateral''; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] devices such as [[isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s and [[directional coupler]]s.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A circulator is a [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] component with three [[two port|ports]] (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode ''N'' is attached through a filter ''F'' to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing "reflected" amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; of the input and output [[transmission line]]s, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter ''F'' is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{in} = V_I^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
The output power from the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = V_R^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
So the [[power gain]] &lt;math&gt;G_P&lt;/math&gt; of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient&lt;ref name="Das" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart"&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{P} = |\Gamma|^2 = {(r + R_1)^2 + 4X_N^2 \over (r - R_1)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; while a CCNR amplifier is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as &lt;math&gt;R_\text{1}&lt;/math&gt; approaches the point of oscillation at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,&lt;ref name="Willardson" /&gt; contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports.

[[Maser]]s and [[parametric amplifier]]s are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in [[switching circuit]]s in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a [[relaxation oscillator]], [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] or memory cell can be built with a single active device,&lt;ref name="Abraham" /&gt; whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the [[multivibrator|Eccles-Jordan multivibrator]], requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*''[[Astable multivibrator]]'' – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a [[relaxation oscillator]], and can produce [[square wave]]s or [[triangle wave]]s.
*''[[Monostable multivibrator]]'' – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*''[[Bistable multivibrator]]'' or ''[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]'' – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and [[digital counter]]s.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the first example of an electronic oscillator. [[William Duddell]], a student of Ayrton at London Central Technical College, brought Thomson's arc oscillator to public attention.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; Due to its negative resistance, the current through an arc was unstable, and [[arc lamp|arc lights]] would often produce hissing, humming, or even howling noises. In 1899, investigating this effect, Duddell connected an [[LC circuit]] across an arc and the negative resistance excited oscillations in the tuned circuit, producing a musical tone from the arc.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; To demonstrate his invention Duddell wired several tuned circuits to an arc and played a tune on it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; Duddell's "[[William Duddell|singing arc]]" oscillator was limited to audio frequencies.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; However, in 1903 Danish engineers [[Valdemar Poulsen]] and P. O. Pederson increased the frequency into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere in a magnetic field,&lt;ref name="Poulsen"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Valdemar |last=Poulsen |title=System for producing continuous electric oscillations |booktitle=Transactions of the International Electrical Congress, St. Louis, 1904, Vol. 2 |pages=963–971 |publisher=J.

===Vacuum tubes===
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt; [[Heinrich Barkhausen]] in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that [[mercury vapor lamp]]s could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&amp;T had used them to build amplifying [[repeater]]s for [[telephone line]]s.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;

In 1918 Albert Hull at [[General Electric|GE]] discovered that [[vacuum tube]]s could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called [[secondary emission]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal

This represents a current ''away'' from the plate, reducing the plate current.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt; Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a ''decrease'' in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the [[dynatron oscillator]]. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the [[magnetron]] invented by Hull in 1920.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;

The term '''negative return''' is used in [[business]] or [[finance]] to describe a loss, i.e., a negative return on investment. By extension the term is also used for a project that is not worthwhile, even in a non-economic sense.

The '''product/process distinction''' is the distinction between the product information and the process information of a consumer good. Product information is information that pertains to a consumer good, namely to its price, quality, and safety (its proximate attributes). Process information is information that pertains to the means by which the consumer good is made [[i.e.]] the working conditions under which it comes into being, as well as the treatment of animals involved in its production chain (its peripheral attributes).

The product/process distinction is used by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) as a way to determine whether or not a complaint filed by an importing nation is valid and warrants [[trade barriers]] against the exporting nation. Under WTO rules, an importing nation can lodge a complaint with the WTO that the exporting nation uses methods for obtaining or producing the good in question that the importing nation finds to be immoral or unethical.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} If the independent World Trade Organization Advisory Board, made up of a panel of international law and trade experts, finds that the importing nation has a legitimate complaint, enforces said ethical standards for domestic production, and isn't trying to merely skirt its free trade obligations, then the Board will rule that trade barriers are justified.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Despite what World Trade Organization officials have said, in practice the World Trade Organization finds these complaints illegitimate the vast majority of the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

For example, if the [[European Union]] (EU) wants to ban imports of cosmetics that were tested on laboratory animals on grounds that such testing is unethical, it can file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and, in theory, the WTO would allow the EU to enact trade barriers provided that the EU bans its own domestic cosmetic producers from testing on laboratory animals. 
In these cases, however, the World Trade Organization has consistently ruled that such barriers are illegal because only the process is different, while the final product itself is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=KIRK|first1=lisbeth|title=MEPs vote for EU ban on cosmetics tested on animal|url=https://euobserver.com/news/1966|website=euobserver|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the WTO has made the product/process distinction an important factor in determining whether trade barriers are justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howse/Regan|title=The Product/Process Distinction--An Illusory Basis for Disciplining Unilateralism in Trade Policy|url=http://iatp.org/files/ProductProcess_Distinction--An_Illusory_Basis_.htm|website=WTO Paper|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Trade Organization has stated that if nations were able to enact barriers merely because the importing nation's standards differ from their own, control could be lost and barriers could be enacted around the world for frivolous reasons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} However, many complain that these rulings go against the stated intentions of the World Trade Organization, and prove that the organization often puts commercial interests above environmental, ethical, and  human rights issues.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The '''revelation principle''' is a fundamental principle in [[mechanism design]]. It states that if a [[social choice function]] can be implemented by an arbitrary mechanism (i.e. if that mechanism has an equilibrium outcome that corresponds to the outcome of the social choice function), then the same function can be implemented by an incentive-compatible-direct-mechanism (i.e. in which players [[Incentive compatibility|truthfully report]] type) with the same equilibrium outcome (payoffs).&lt;ref name="AGT"&gt;{{Cite Algorithmic Game Theory 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224–225}}

In [[mechanism design]], the revelation principle is of utmost importance in finding solutions. The researcher need only look at the set of equilibrium characterized by [[incentive compatibility]]. That is, if the mechanism designer wants to implement some outcome or property, he can restrict his search to mechanisms in which agents are willing to reveal their private information to the mechanism designer that has that outcome or property. If no such direct and truthful mechanism exists, no mechanism can implement this outcome/property. By narrowing the area needed to be searched, the problem of finding a mechanism becomes much easier.

The principle comes in two variants corresponding to the two flavors of [[Incentive compatibility|incentive-compatibility]]:
*The ''dominant-strategy revelation-principle'' says that every social-choice function that can be implemented in [[Strategic dominance|dominant-strategies]] can be implemented by a  [[Strategyproofness|dominant-strategy-incentive-compatible (DSIC)]] mechanism (introduced by [[Allan Gibbard]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibbard, A. 1973. Manipulation of voting schemes: a general result. Econometrica 41, 587–601.&lt;/ref&gt;).
*The ''Bayesian-Nash revelation-principle'' says that every social-choice function that can be implemented in Bayesian-Nash equilibrium ([[Bayesian game]], i.e. game of incomplete information) can be implemented by a [[Incentive compatibility|Bayesian-Nash incentive-compatibility (BNIC)]] mechanism. This broader solution concept was introduced by Dasgupta, Hammond and [[Eric Maskin|Maskin]],&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, P., Hammond, P. and Maskin, E. 1979. The implementation of social choice rules: some results on incentive compatibility. Review of Economic Studies 46, 185–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmstrom,&lt;ref&gt;Holmstrom, B. 1977. On incentives and control in organizations. Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roger Myerson|Myerson]].&lt;ref&gt;Myerson, R. 1979. Incentive-compatibility and the bargaining problem. Econometrica 47, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Consider the following example. There is a certain item that Alice values as &lt;math&gt;v_A&lt;/math&gt; and Bob values as &lt;math&gt;v_B&lt;/math&gt;. The government needs to decide who will receive that item and in what terms. 
* A ''social-choice-function'' is a function that maps a set of individual ''preferences'' to a social outcome. An example function is the [[utilitarian]] function, which says "give the item to a person that values it the most". We denote a social choice function by '''Soc''' and its recommended outcome given a set of preferences by '''Soc(Prefs)'''.
* A ''mechanism'' is a rule that maps a set of individual ''actions'' to a social outcome. A mechanism '''Mech''' induces a [[game theory|game]] which we denote by '''Game(Mech)'''.
* A mechanism '''Mech''' is said to ''implement'' a social-choice-function '''Soc''' if, for every combination of individual preferences, there is a [[Nash equilibrium]] in '''Game(Mech)''' in which the outcome is '''Soc(Prefs)'''. Two example mechanisms are:
** "Each individual says a number between 1 and 10. The item is given to the individual who says the lowest number; if both say the same number, then the item is given to Alice". This mechanism does NOT implement the utilitarian function, since for every individual who wants the item, it is a dominant strategy to say "1" regardless of his/her true value. This means that in equilibrium the item is always given to Alice, even if Bob values it more.
** [[First-price sealed-bid auction]] is a mechanism which implements the utilitarian function. For example, if &lt;math&gt;v_B&gt;v_A&lt;/math&gt;, then any action profile in which Bob bids more than Alice and both bids are in the range &lt;math&gt;(v_A,v_B)&lt;/math&gt; is a Nash-equilibrium in which the item goes to Bob. Additionally, if the valuations of Alice and Bob are random variables drawn independently from the same distribution, then there is a [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium]] in which the item goes to the bidder with the highest value.
* A ''direct-mechanism'' is a mechanism in which the set of actions available to each player is just the set of possible preferences of the player. 
* A direct-mechanism '''Mech''' is said to be ''Bayesian-Nash-[[Incentive-compatible]] (BNIC)'' if there is a [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium]] of '''Game(Mech)''' in which all players reveal their true preferences. Some example direct-mechanisms are:
** "Each individual says how much he values the item. The item is given to the individual that said the highest value. In case of a tie, the item is given to Alice". This mechanism is NOT BNIC, since a player who wants the item is better-off by saying the highest possible value, regardless of his true value.
** [[First-price sealed-bid auction]] is also NOT BNIC, since the winner is always better-off by bidding the lowest value that is slightly above the loser's bid.
** However, if the distribution of the players' valuations is known, then there is [[First-price sealed-bid auction#Incentive-compatible_variant|a variant]] which is BNIC and implements the utilitarian function.
** Moreover, it is known that [[Second price auction]] is BNIC (it is even IC in a stronger sense - dominant-strategy IC). Additionally, it implements the utilitarian function.

== Proof ==
Suppose we have an arbitrary mechanism '''Mech''' that implements '''Soc'''.

We construct a direct mechanism '''Mech'''' that is truthful and implements '''Soc'''.

'''Mech'''' simply simulates the equilibrium strategies of the players in Game('''Mech'''). I.e:
* '''Mech'''' asks the players to report their valuations.
* Based on the reported valuations, '''Mech'''' calculates, for each player, his equilibrium strategy in '''Mech'''.
* '''Mech'''' returns the outcome returned by '''Mech'''.

Reporting the true valuations in '''Mech'''' is like playing the equilibrium strategies in '''Mech'''. Hence, reporting the true valuations is a Nash equilibrium in '''Mech'''', as desired. Moreover, the equilibrium payoffs are the same, as desired.

==In correlated equilibrium==
The revelation principle says that for every arbitrary ''coordinating device'' a.k.a. correlating there exists another direct device for which the state space equals the action space of each player.  Then the coordination is done by directly informing each player of his action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2085">'''Saint-Venant's principle''', named after [[Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant]], a [[French people|French]] [[elasticity (mathematics)|elasticity theorist]],  may be expressed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustus Edward Hough Love|A. E. H. Love]], "A treatise on the mathematical theory of elasticity," Cambridge University Press, 1927. (Dover reprint {{ISBN|0-486-60174-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... the difference between the effects of two different but statically equivalent loads becomes very small at sufficiently large distances from load.}}

The original statement was published in French by Saint-Venant in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. C. B. Saint-Venant,  1855, Memoire sur la Torsion des Prismes, Mem. Divers Savants, 14, pp. 233–560.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this informal statement of the principle is well known among structural and mechanical engineers, more recent mathematical literature gives a rigorous interpretation in the context of partial differential equations. An early such interpretation was made by [[Richard von Mises|von Mises]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;R. von Mises, On Saint-Venant's Principle. Bull. AMS, 51, 555–562, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saint-Venant's principle allows elasticians to replace complicated stress distributions or weak boundary conditions with ones that are easier to solve, as long as that boundary is geometrically short. Quite analogous to the [[electrostatics]], where the [[electric field]] due to the ''i''-th moment of the load (with 0th being the net charge, 1st the [[dipole]], 2nd the [[quadrupole]]) decays as &lt;math&gt;1/r^{i+2} &lt;/math&gt;  over space, Saint-Venant's principle states that high order momentum of mechanical load (moment with order higher than [[torque]]) decays so fast that they never need to be considered for regions far from the short boundary. Therefore, the Saint-Venant's principle can be regarded as a statement on the [[asymptotic]] behavior of the [[Green's function]] by a point-load.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2069">{{distinguish|text=Schwinger's variational principle, ''[[Schwinger variational principle]]''}}

The '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is a [[variational method|variational]] approach to [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. This theory was introduced by [[Julian Schwinger]]. In this approach, the '''quantum action''' is an operator. Although it is superficially different from the [[path integral formulation]] where the action is a classical function, the modern formulation of
the two formalisms are identical.

Suppose we have two states defined by the values of a [[complete set of commuting operators]] at two times. Let the early and late states be &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Suppose that there is a parameter in the Lagrangian which can be varied, usually a source for a field. The main equation of '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \langle B|A\rangle = i \langle B| \delta S |A\rangle,\ &lt;/math&gt;

where the derivative is with respect to small changes in the parameter.

In the path integral formulation, the transition amplitude is represented by the sum
over all histories of &lt;math&gt;\exp(iS)&lt;/math&gt;, with appropriate [[boundary condition]]s representing the states &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;. The infinitesimal change in the amplitude is clearly given by Schwinger's formula. Conversely, starting from Schwinger's formula, it is easy to show that the fields obey canonical commutation relations and the classical equations
of motion, and so have a path integral representation. Schwinger's formulation was most significant because it could treat fermionic anticommuting fields with the same formalism as bose fields, thus implicitly introducing differentiation and integration
with respect to anti-commuting coordinates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19944">{{Network neutrality}}

'''Search neutrality''' is a [[principle]] that [[search engine]]s should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, [[impartial]] and based solely on [[relevance]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html | title=Search, but You May Not Find | publisher=The New York Times | year=2009 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider's domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain [[bias]]. 
 
Search neutrality is related to [[network neutrality]] in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the Internet. Search neutrality aims to keep the [[organic search]] results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.

==Background==
The term "search neutrality" in context of the internet appears as early as March 2009 in an academic paper by Andrew Odlyzko titled, "Network Neutrality, Search Neutrality, and the Never-ending Conflict between Efficiency and Fairness in Markets"&lt;ref name="odlyzko"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Odlyzko|first1=Andrew|title=Network Neutrality, Search Neutrality, and the Never-ending Conflict between Efficiency and Fairness in Markets|journal=Review of Network Economics|date=March 2009|pages=40-60|url=https://www.bsi.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/rne81.pdf|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this paper, Odlykzo predicts that if net neutrality were to be accepted as a legal or regulatory principle, then the questions surrounding search neutrality would be the next controversies. Indeed, in December 2009 the New York Times published an opinion letter by Foundem co-founder and lead complainant in an anti-trust complaint against Google, Adam Raff, which likely brought the term to the broader public. According to Raff in his opinion letter, search neutrality ought to be "the [[principle]] that [[search engines]] should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, [[impartial]] and based solely on [[relevance]]"&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html | title=Search, but You May Not Find | publisher=The New York Times | year=2009 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  On October 11, 2009, Adam and his wife Shivaun launched SearchNeutrality.org, an initiative dedicated to promoting investigations against Google's search engine practices &lt;ref name=raff1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/about|website=searchneutrality.org|title=About SearchNeutrality.org|accessdate=4 July 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804021604/http://www.searchneutrality.org/about|archivedate=4 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There, the Raffs note that they chose to frame their issue with Google as "search neutrality" in order to benefit from the focus and interest on net neutrality&lt;ref name="raff1" /&gt;.

In contrast to net neutrality, answers to such questions, as "what is search neutrality?" or "what are appropriate legislative or regulatory principles to protect search neutrality?", appear to have less consensus. The idea that neutrality means equal treatment, regardless of the content, comes from debates on net neutrality &lt;ref name=grimmelmann&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1742444|title=Some Skepticism about Search Neutrality|work=The Next Digital Decade: Essays on the Future of the Internet|last1=Grimmelmann|first1=James|pages=435-461|accessdate=5 July 2017 }} &lt;/ref&gt;. Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other [[information retrieval]] applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking). "Relevance" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results. Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences. And because relevance is so subjective, putting search neutrality into practice has been so contentious.

Search neutrality became a concern after [[search engines]], most notably [[Google]], were accused of search bias by other companies.&lt;ref name="jolt.law.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lao|first1=Marina|title="Neutral" Search As A Basis for Antitrust Action?|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology Occasional Paper Series|date=July 2013|pages=1–12|url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/antitrust/articles/Lao.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors and companies claim search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in their lists of results, disrupting the objective results users believe they are getting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herman|first1=Tavani|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.|title=Search Engines and Ethics|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2014|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/ethics-search/|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The call for search neutrality goes beyond traditional search engines. Sites like [[Amazon.com]] and [[Facebook]] are also accused of skewing results.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shavin|first1=Naomi|title=Are Google and Amazon the next threat to net neutrality?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/naomishavin/2014/07/02/are-google-and-amazon-the-next-threat-to-net-neutrality/|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon’s search results are influenced by companies that pay to rank higher in their search results while Facebook filters their newsfeed lists to conduct social experiments.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

== "Vertical search" spam penalties ==
In order to find information on the Web, most users make use of [[search engines]], which [[web crawler|crawl the web]], index it and show a list of results ordered by relevance. The use of search engines to access information through the web has become a key factor for [[online business]]es companies, which depend on the flow of users visiting their pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marketingtoday.com/emarketing/0305/b2b_importance_sem.htm| title=Search Engine Marketing | publisher=Marketing Today | year=2005 | accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these companies is Foundem. Foundem provides a "[[vertical search]]" service to compare products available on online markets for the U.K. Many people see these "vertical search" sites as spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antitrust nemesis accuses Google of 'WMD program'|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/01/foundem_accuses_google_of_wmd_program_against_vertical_search_rivals/|work=The Register|publisher=The Register|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Cade Metz|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2006 and for three and a half years following, Foundem’s traffic and business dropped significantly due to what they assert to be a penalty deliberately applied by Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/foundem-google-story| title=Foundem’s Google Story| publisher=www.searchneutrality.org| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127070002/http://www.searchneutrality.org/foundem-google-story |archivedate=27 January 2010 | year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear, however, whether their claim of a penalty was self-imposed via their use of iframe HTML tags to embed the content from other websites.  At the time at which Foundem claims the penalties were imposed, it was unclear whether web crawlers crawled beyond the main page of a website using iframe tags without some extra modifications. The former SEO director OMD UK, Jaamit Durrani, among others, offered this alternative explanation, stating that “Two of the major issues that Foundem had in summer was content in iFrames and content requiring javascript to load – both of which I looked at in August, and they were definitely in place. Both are huge barriers to search visibility in my book. They have been fixed somewhere between then and the lifting of the supposed ‘penalty’. I don’t think that’s a coincidence.”&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title = Foundem vs Google redux: it was a penalty!

Most of Foundem’s accusations claim that Google deliberately applies penalties to other vertical search engines because they represent competition.&lt;ref name="policyBlog"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/02/committed-to-competing-fairly.html | title=Committed to competing fairly| publisher=[[Google]] | year=2010 | accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foundem is backed by a Microsoft proxy group, the 'Initiative for Competitive Online Marketplace'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Conducting Antitrust Review of Google|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/204857/texas_conducting_antitrust_review_of_google.html|work=PC World|publisher=IDG Consumer and SMB|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Nancy Gohring|date=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years of looking into claims that Google “manipulated its search algorithms to harm vertical websites and unfairly promote its own competing vertical properties,” the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) voted unanimously to end the antitrust portion of its investigation without filing a formal complaint against Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Agrees to Change Its Business Practices to Resolve FTC Competition Concerns In the Markets for Devices Like Smart Phones, Games and Tablets, and in Online Search|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/01/google-agrees-change-its-business-practices-resolve-ftc|website=FTC.gov|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=20 November 2014|date=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC concluded that Google’s “practice of favoring its own content in the presentation of search results” did not violate U.S. antitrust laws.&lt;ref name="jolt.law.harvard.edu"/&gt; The FTC further determined that even though competitors might be negatively impacted by Google's changing algorithms, Google did not change its algorithms to hurt competitors, but as a product improvement to benefit consumers.&lt;ref name="jolt.law.harvard.edu"/&gt;

== Arguments ==
There are a number of arguments for and against search neutrality.

=== Pros ===
* Those who advocate search neutrality argue that the results would not be biased towards sites with more advertising, but towards sites most relevant to the user.&lt;ref name="Concurring Opinions"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2011/02/search-neutrality-as-disclosure-and-auditing.html | title=Search Neutrality as Disclosure and Auditing | publisher=Concurring Opinions | date=February 19, 2011 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Search neutrality encourages sites to have more quality content rather than pay to rank higher on organic results.
* Restrains search engines from only supporting their best advertisers.&lt;ref name="Concurring Opinions"/&gt;
* Search engines would allow traffic to sites that depend on visitors, keeping their results comprehensive, impartial, and based solely on relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html?_r=1 | title=Search, but You May Not Find | publisher=Bucknell.edu | date=December 27, 2009 | accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann"&gt;{{cite book | last=Grimmelmann | first=James | chapterurl=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=james_grimmelmann | title=The Next Digital Decade: Essays on the Future of the Internet | chapter=Some Skepticism About Search Neutrality | publisher=TechFreedom | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allows for organized, logical manipulation of search results by an objective, automatic algorithm.  At the same time, disallowing underhanded ranking of results on an individual basis.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann"/&gt;
* Personalized search results might suppress information that disagrees with users' [[worldview]]s, isolating them in their own cultural or ideological "[[filter bubble]]s".&lt;ref name=twsT43&gt;{{cite news|first1= Lynn | last1= Parramore|title= The Filter Bubble|work= The Atlantic|quote= Since Dec. 4, 2009, Google has been personalized for everyone. So when I had two friends this spring Google "BP," one of them got a set of links that was about investment opportunities in BP. The other one got information about the oil spill....|date=  October 10, 2010|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2010/10/the-filter-bubble/181427/|accessdate= April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cons ===
*Forcing search engines to treat all websites equally would lead to the removal of their biased look at the Internet. A biased view of the Internet is exactly what search users are seeking. By performing a search the user is seeking what that search engine perceives as the "best" result to their query. Enforced search neutrality would, essentially, remove this bias. Users continually return to a specific search engine because they find the "biased" or "subjective" results to fit their needs.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;
*Search neutrality has the possibility of causing search engines to become stagnant. If site A is first on a [[Search engine results page|SERP]] (search engine results page) one month, and then tenth the next month search neutrality advocates cry "foul play," but in reality it is often the page's loss in popularity, relevance, or quality content that has caused the move. The case against Google brought forth by the owners of Foundem extoll this phenomenon and regulation could limit the search engine's ability to adjust ranking based on their own metrics.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;
*Proponents of search neutrality desire transparency in a search engine's ranking algorithm. Requiring transparent algorithms leads to two concerns. These algorithms are the companies private [[intellectual property]] and should not be forced into the open. This would be similar to forcing a soda manufacturer to publish their recipes. The second concern is that opening the algorithm would allow spammers to exploit and target how the algorithm functions directly. This would permit spammers to circumvent the metrics in place that prevent spammed websites from being at the top of a SERP.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;
*Removing a search engine's ability to directly manipulate rankings limits their ability to penalize dishonest websites that practice [[Black hat hacking|black hat]] techniques to improve their rankings. Any site who finds a way to circumvent the algorithm would benefit from a search engine's inability to manually decrease their ranking causing a spam site to gain high ranking for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;

This decline has been attributed to Google linking to its own services rather than the services offered at external websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/universalsearch_20070516.html | title=Google Begins Move to Universal Search | publisher=[[Google]] | date=May 17, 2007| accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://searchengineland.com/google-maps-gaining-on-market-leader-mapquest-13103 | title=Google Maps Gaining On Market Leader Mapquest | publisher=Search Engine Land | date=January 10, 2008 | accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these claims, Google actually displays Google content on the first page, while rival search engines do not considerably less often than Microsoft's Bing which displays Microsoft content when rivals do not. Bing displays Microsoft content in first place more than twice as often as Google shows Google content in first place. This indicates that as far as there is any 'bias', Google is less biased than its principal competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining and Measuring Search Bias:  Some Preliminary Evidence|url=http://www.laweconcenter.org/images/articles/definingmeasuring.pdf|work=Defining and Measuring Search Bias:  Some Preliminary Evidence|publisher=International Center for Law and Economics|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Joshua D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11668">'''Signed zero''' is [[zero]] with an associated [[Plus and minus signs|sign]]. In ordinary arithmetic, the number 0 does not have a sign, so that −0, +0 and 0 are identical. However, in [[computing]], some number representations allow for the existence of two zeros, often denoted by '''−0''' ('''negative zero''') and '''+0''' ('''positive zero'''), regarded as equal by the numerical comparison operations but with possible different behaviors in particular operations. This occurs in the ''sign and magnitude'' and ''ones' complement'' [[signed number representation]]s for integers, and in most [[floating-point number]] representations. The number 0 is usually encoded as +0, but can be represented by either +0 or −0.

The [[IEEE 754]] standard for floating-point arithmetic (presently used by most computers and programming languages that support floating point numbers) requires both +0 and −0. Real arithmetic with signed zeros can be considered a variant of the [[extended real number line]] such that 1/−0 = −[[infinity|∞]] and 1/+0 = +∞; [[Division (mathematics)|division]] is only [[Indeterminate form|undefined]] for [[Plus-minus sign|±]]0/±0 and ±∞/±∞.

Negatively signed zero echoes the [[mathematical analysis]] concept of approaching 0 from below as a [[one-sided limit]], which may be denoted by ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0−, or ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;↑0.  The notation "−0" may be used informally to denote a small negative number that has been [[rounding|rounded]] to zero.  The concept of negative zero also has some theoretical applications in [[statistical mechanics]] and other disciplines.

It is claimed that the inclusion of signed zero in IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 makes it much easier to achieve numerical accuracy in some critical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kahan]], "Branch Cuts for Complex Elementary Functions, or Much Ado About Nothing's Sign Bit", in [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=59678 ''The State of the Art in Numerical Analysis''] (eds. Iserles and Powell), Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular when computing with [[complex number|complex]] elementary functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kahan]], [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Math185/Derivative.pdf Derivatives in the Complex z-plane], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the concept of signed zero runs contrary to the general assumption made in most mathematical fields that negative zero is the same thing as zero.  Representations that allow negative zero can be a source of errors in programs, if software developers do not take into account that while the two zero representations behave as equal under numeric comparisons, they yield different results in some operations.

==Representations==
The widely used [[two's complement]] encoding does not allow a negative zero.  In a 1+7-bit [[signed magnitude|sign-and-magnitude]] representation for integers, negative zero is represented by the bit string {{gaps|1000|0000}}. In an 8-bit [[one's complement]] representation, negative zero is represented by the bit string {{gaps|1111|1111}}. In all three encodings, positive zero is represented by {{gaps|0000|0000}}.

[[Image:IEEE 754 Single Negative Zero.svg|thumb|right|400px|Negative zero by IEEE 754 representation in [[binary32]] ]]
In [[IEEE floating-point standard|IEEE 754]] binary floating point numbers, zero values are represented by the biased exponent and [[significand]] both being zero. Negative zero has the sign bit set to one.  One may obtain negative zero as the result of certain computations, for instance as the result of [[arithmetic underflow]] on a negative number, or &lt;code&gt;−1.0×0.0&lt;/code&gt;, or simply as &lt;code&gt;−0.0&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE 754]] decimal floating point encoding, a negative zero is represented by an exponent being any valid exponent in the range for the encoding, the true significand being zero, and the sign bit being one.

==Properties and handling==
The IEEE 754 floating point standard specifies the behavior of positive zero and negative zero under various operations.  The outcome may depend on the current [[floating point#Rounding modes|IEEE rounding mode]] settings.

===Notation===
In systems that include both signed and unsigned zeros, the notation &lt;math&gt;0^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0^-&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used for signed zeros.

===Arithmetic===
Addition and multiplication are commutative, but there are some special rules that have to be followed, which mean the usual mathematical rules for algebraic simplification may not apply. The &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; sign below shows the signed result of the operations.

The usual rule for signs is always followed when multiplying or dividing:

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{-0}{ \left| x \right| } = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; different from 0)
* &lt;math&gt;(-0) \cdot (-0) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

There are special rules for adding or subtracting signed zero:

* &lt;math&gt;x + (\pm 0) = x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; different from 0)
* &lt;math&gt;(-0) + (-0) = (-0) - (+0) = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(+0) + (+0) = (+0) - (-0) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x - x = x + (-x) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for any finite &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, −0 when rounding toward negative)

Because of negative zero (and also when the rounding mode is upward or downward), the expressions {{nowrap|−(''x'' − ''y'')}} and {{nowrap|(−''x'') − (−''y'')}}, for floating-point variables ''x'' and ''y'', cannot be replaced by {{nowrap|''y'' − ''x''}}. However {{nowrap|(−0) + ''x''}} can be replaced by ''x'' with rounding to nearest (except when ''x'' can be a [[NaN#Signaling NaN|signaling NaN]]).

Some other special rules:

* &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-0} = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daops.html#refsqrt|title=Decimal Arithmetic: Arithmetic operations{{snd}}square-root|first=Mike|last=Cowlishaw|authorlink=Mike Cowlishaw|date=7 April 2009|publisher=speleotrove.com ([[IBM Corporation]])|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{-0}{-\infty} = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (follows the sign rule for division)
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\left|x\right|}{-0} = -\infty\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (for non-zero &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, follows the sign rule for division)
* &lt;math&gt;{\pm 0} \times {\pm \infty} = \mbox{NaN}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ([[Not a Number]] or interrupt for [[indeterminate form]])
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pm 0}{\pm 0} = \mbox{NaN}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Division of a non-zero number by zero sets the divide by zero [[flag (computing)|flag]], and an operation producing a NaN sets the invalid operation flag. An [[exception handling|exception handler]] is called if enabled for the corresponding flag.

===Comparisons===
According to the IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 standard, negative zero and positive zero should compare as equal with the usual (numerical) comparison operators, like the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operators of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java programming language|Java]].  In those languages, special programming tricks may be needed to distinguish the two values:

* [[Type punning]] the number to an integer type, so as to look at the sign bit in the bit pattern;
* using the ISO C &lt;code&gt;copysign()&lt;/code&gt; function (IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 copySign operation) to copy the sign of the zero to some non-zero number;
* using the ISO C &lt;code&gt;signbit()&lt;/code&gt; macro (IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 isSignMinus operation) that returns whether the sign bit of a number is set;
* taking the reciprocal of the zero to obtain either 1/(+0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+∞ or 1/(−0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−∞ (if the [[division by zero]] exception is not trapped).

Note: [[Cast (computer programming)|Casting]] to integral type will not always work, especially on two's complement systems.

However, some programming languages may provide alternative comparison operators that do distinguish the two zeros. This is the case, for example, of the &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt; method in Java's &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; wrapper class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29 http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals(java.lang.Object)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific uses==
Informally, one may use the notation "−0" for a negative value that was rounded to zero.  This notation may be useful when a negative sign is significant; for example, when tabulating [[Celsius]] temperatures, where a negative sign means ''below freezing''.

In statistical mechanics, one sometimes uses [[negative temperature]]s to describe systems with [[population inversion]], which can be considered to have a temperature greater than positive infinity, because the coefficient of energy in the population distribution function is &amp;minus;1/Temperature. In this context, a temperature of &amp;minus;0 is a (theoretical) temperature larger than any other negative temperature, corresponding to the (theoretical) maximum conceivable extent of population inversion, the opposite extreme to +0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Charles Kittel|Kittel, Charles]] and [[Herbert Kroemer]] | title=Thermal Physics (2nd ed.) | publisher=W.

'''Spaceship Earth''' or '''Spacecraft Earth''' is a [[world view]] encouraging everyone on [[Earth]] to act as a harmonious crew working toward the greater good.

The earliest known use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalen|first1=San|title=ECOLOGY COMES OF AGE: NEPA'S LOST MANDATE|journal=DUKE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW &amp; POLICY FORUM|date=2010|volume=21:113|issue=Fall|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&amp;context=delpf|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a passage in [[Henry George]]'s best known work, ''[[Progress and Poverty]]''&lt;ref&gt;The text on wikisource differs from versions available [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPP20.html#Book%20IV,%20Chapter%202 here] and [http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp042.html here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909042705/http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp042.html |date=2005-09-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; (1879).
From book IV, chapter 2: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. And very great command over the services of others comes to those who as the hatches are opened are permitted to say, "This is mine!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[George Orwell]] later paraphrases Henry George in ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all cooperate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one could possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for clinging to the present system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965 [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] made a famous speech to the UN in which he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave—to the ancient enemies of man—half free in a liberation of resources undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel safely with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/73/477.html Speech to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, Geneva, Switzerland, July 9, 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following year, ''Spaceship Earth'' became the title of a book by a friend of Stevenson's, the internationally influential economist [[Barbara Ward]].

Also in 1966, [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], who was influenced by reading [[Henry George]],&lt;ref&gt;King, J. E. "Economic Exiles". Palgrave Macmillan, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; used the phrase in the title of an essay, ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page160.htm|title=The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth|first=Kenneth E.|last=Boulding|authorlink=Kenneth E. Boulding|date=1966|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulding described the past open [[economy]] of apparently illimitable resources, which he said he was tempted to call the "cowboy economy", and continued: "The closed economy of the future might similarly be called the 'spaceman' economy, in which the earth has become a single spaceship, without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution, and in which, therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system".
([[David Korten]] would take up the "cowboys in a spaceship" theme in his 1995 book ''[[When Corporations Rule the World]]''.)

The phrase was also popularized by [[Buckminster Fuller]], who published a book in 1968 under the title of ''[[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Buckminster|last=Fuller|authorlink=Buckminster Fuller|publisher=E.P. Dutton &amp; Co.|location=New York|date=1963|isbn=0-525-47433-1|url=http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth|title=Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717141812/http://bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth|archivedate=2010-07-17|df=}}  The quotation is from [http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth/chapter-8-regenerative-landscape Section 8: The regenerative landscape] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823122401/http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth/chapter-8-regenerative-landscape |date=2010-08-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This quotation, referring to [[fossil fuel]]s, reflects his approach: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;…we can make all of humanity successful through science's world-engulfing industrial evolution provided that we are not so foolish as to continue to exhaust in a split second of astronomical history the orderly energy savings of billions of years' energy conservation aboard our Spaceship Earth.  These energy savings have been put into our Spaceship's life-regeneration-guaranteeing bank account for use only in self-starter functions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[United Nations]] [[Secretary-General]] [[U Thant]] spoke of Spaceship Earth on [[Earth Day]] March 21, 1971 at the ceremony of the ringing of the [[Japanese Peace Bell]]: "May there only be peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowzone.com/mc-lee.htm|title=Earth Day: Past, Present, Future|first=Lee|last=Lawrence|author2=John McConnell |date=July 3, 1999|publisher=Wish Only Well|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spaceship Earth 2.jpg|thumb|Epcot's Spaceship Earth]]

Spaceship Earth is the name given to the 50&amp;nbsp;m diameter [[geodesic dome|geodesic sphere]] that greets visitors at the entrance of [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]] theme park. Housed within the sphere is [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|a dark ride]] that serves to explore the history of [[communications]] and promote Epcot's founding principles, "[a] belief and pride in man's ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korkis|first1=Jim|title=WDW Chronicles: 1982 Opening of Epcot Center|website=http://allears.net/ae/issue678.htm|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous incarnation of the ride, narrated by actor [[Jeremy Irons]] and revised in 2008, was explicit in its message:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like a grand and miraculous spaceship, our planet has sailed through the universe of time, and for a brief moment, we have been among its many passengers….We now have the ability and the responsibility to build new bridges of acceptance and co-operation between us, to create a better world for ourselves and our children as we continue our amazing journey aboard Spaceship Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irons|first1=Jeremy|title=SE Script - Irons Version|website=http://www.intercot.com/edc/SpaceshipEarth/spscript.html|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Deutsch]] has pointed out that the picture of Earth as a friendly "spaceship" habitat is difficult to defend even in metaphorical sense. The Earth environment is harsh and survival is constant struggle for life, including whole species [[extinction]]. Humans wouldn't be able to live in most of the areas where they are living now without knowledge necessary to build life-support systems such as houses, heating, water supply, etc.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=David Deutsch |author-link=David Deutsch |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Spaceship Earth" is frequently used on the labels of [[Emanuel Bronner]]'s products to refer to the Earth.

[[File:ToK Simple.jpg|thumb|379px|Gregg Henriques' Tree of Knowledge System]]

The '''tree of knowledge''' ('''ToK''') '''system''' is a theoretical approach to the unification of [[psychology]] developed by [[Gregg Henriques]], associate professor and director of the Combined-Integrated Doctoral Program in Clinical and School Psychology at [[James Madison University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/about%20me.htm "About Me" section of the ToK System website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the system was published in 2003 in ''[[Review of General Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Two special issues of the ''[[Journal of Clinical Psychology]]'' in December 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109747885 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (December 2004). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 1) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 60 Issue 12, Pages 1203 – 1315]&lt;/ref&gt; and January 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109856879 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (January 2005). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 2) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 61 Issue 1, Pages 1 – 139 ]&lt;/ref&gt; were devoted to the elaboration and evaluation of the model. The latest evaluation of this model appeared in a December 2008 special issue of ''[[Theory &amp; Psychology']]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol18/issue6/ ''Theory &amp; Psychology''. (December 2008). Volume 18, No. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official website on the tree of knowledge system claims that the ToK is

:''a new unified theory of knowledge that maps the pieces of the scientific puzzle in a novel way that connects Quantum Mechanics to Sociological processes and everything in between into a coherent whole. The most novel aspect of the ToK is its visuo-spatial depiction of knowledge as consisting of four dimensions of complexity (Matter, Life, Mind, and Culture) that correspond to the behavior of four classes of objects (material objects, organisms, animals, and humans), and four classes of science (physical, biological, psychological, and social).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/other%20research.htm ToK FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "problem of psychology"==
Henriques argues that the most difficult problem in psychology as a discipline is that while there is incredible diversity offered by different approaches to psychology, there is no consensus model of what ''psychology'' actually is.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the ToK system, the "problem of psychology", (as Henriques puts it), is that a clear definition, an agreed upon subject matter, and a coherent conceptual framework have eluded its students for its entire [[history of psychology|history]]. He further argues that the patent tendency of psychology has been toward theoretical and substantial fragmentation and increasing insularity among the "specialties." In other words, the discipline has fragmented into [[psychological schools|different schools of thought]] and methodology, with no overall framework to interpret and integrate the research of different areas. At its best, the different approaches are a strength of psychology; different approaches lead to novel ideas, and prevent psychologists from clinging to a paradigm that fails to explain a phenomenon. At its worst, adherents of one particular school cling to their beliefs concerning the relative importance of their research and disregard or are ignorant of different approaches. In most cases, individual psychologists have to determine for themselves which elements of which perspective to apply, and how to integrate them into their overall understanding.
 
The reason for psychology's fragmentation, according to the ToK, is that there has been no [[metatheory|meta-theoretical]] frame that allows scholars to agree on the basic questions that need to be addressed. As such, the different schools of thought in psychology are like the blind men who each grab a part of the elephant and proclaim they have discovered its true nature. With its novel depiction of evolving dimensions of complexity, the ToK allows scholars finally to see the elephant. In his 2003 ''Review of General Psychology'' paper,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques used the ToK System with the attempt to clarify and align the views of [[B.F. Skinner]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. These luminaries were chosen because when one considers their influence and historical opposition, it can readily be argued that they represent two schools of thought that are the most difficult to integrate. Henriques used the meta-perspective offered by the ToK to argue how one can retain the key insights from each school of thought, identify errors and points of confusion, and integrate the insights into a coherent whole.

Cultural and personality psychologist, Michael Katzko,&lt;ref&gt;[http://baserv.uci.kun.nl/~mwsk49/ Homepage of Michael Katzko]&lt;/ref&gt; however critiques Henriques' position on "the problem of psychology":

:''There is a very good reason for skepticism regarding the repeated claims that the one unique problem of psychology, applicable across the entire discipline, has been identified and that the ToK System solves it. The reason is given by the detail with which alternatives have been worked out, be they historical studies of institutional development or critical commentaries on the rhetorical structure of psychology's literature.''&lt;ref&gt;Katzko, M.W. (2008). Pruning the Tree of Knowledge. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 817–828. [http://tap.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/18/6/817 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tree of knowledge==
In one way, the tree of knowledge system reflects a fairly common hierarchy of nature and of the sciences that has been represented in one way or another since the time of [[Auguste Comte]], who in the 19th century used a hierarchical conception of nature to argue for the existence of sociology. Despite its surface agreement with a standard conception, the ToK System offers a set of ideas that have added implications for both [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. The ontological claim made by the ToK, (and [[#top|depicted pictorially above]]), is that [[Physical cosmology|cosmic evolution]] consists of four separable dimensions of complexity, namely [[matter]], life, [[mind]], and culture. The dimension of complexity argument is arguably one of the most complicated aspects of the system. Many have argued nature is hierarchically leveled; for example, a list of such levels might be [[subatomic particles]], [[atoms]], [[molecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, organ structures, multi-celled organisms, [[consciousness]], and society is common. The ToK System embraces a view of nature as levels, but adds the notion that there are also ''dimensions of complexity''. The difference can be seen pictorially. A view of nature as solely consisting of levels would have a single "cone" of complexity, whereas the ToK depicts four "cones". The ToK posits that a separate dimension of complexity emerges when a process of selection operates on a unit of information. Thus, according to the ToK, [[natural selection]] operating on genetic combinations gives rise to the dimension of Life; [[Radical behaviorism|behavioral selection]] operating on [[neuron]]al combinations gives rise to the dimension of Mind; and [[theory of justification|justification]] operating on [[symbol]]ic combinations gives rise to Culture.

The ToK system also offers a new epistemology that Henriques believes will move toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed ''[[consilience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1999). ''[[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]''. Vintage:USA&lt;/ref&gt; Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. The ToK offers alternative perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts science itself as both emerging out of culture and as a unique type of "justification system" that is based on the values of [[accuracy]] and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the ToK system. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; A "justification system", according to Henriques, refers to any belief system that emerges that coordinates the behaviors of individual humans to human populations. The four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the [[physical science|physical]], [[biology|biological]], [[psychology|psychological]] and [[social science]]s.

===Matter===

The dimension of [[matter]] refers to the set of material objects and their behaviors through time. In accordance with modern [[cosmology]], matter is theorized to have emerged from a pure energy [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the [[Big Bang]]. [[Space-time|Space and time]] were also born at such a point. Nonliving material objects range in complexity from [[subatomic particle]]s to large organic molecules. The physical sciences (i.e., [[physics]], [[chemistry]], geology, [[astronomy]]) describe the behavior of material objects.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life===

The dimension of life refers to [[organism]]s and their behaviors through time. Living objects are considered a unique subset of material objects. Just as [[quantum particle]]s form the fundamental units of material complexity, [[gene]]s are the fundamental units of living information. Although many questions about the emergence of life remain unanswered, in accordance with modern biology, the ToK posits that natural selection operating on genetic combinations through time is the unified theory of biology and forms the foundational understanding for the emergence of organic complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind===

Mind/cognition in the ToK system refers to the set of mental behaviors. ''Mental behaviors'' are behaviors of animals mediated by the [[nervous system]] that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind/cognition is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting a drink of water are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with [[sentience]] or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed to emerge in the mental/cognitive dimension. [[Cognition]], in the broad sense of the term is meaning bodily-neuro-social information processing, as in EEEE Cognition: Embodied, Embedded, Enactive, Extended. While cognitive science stands for naturalist study of mind, psychology is an approach grounded in the tradition of humanities, especially philosophy. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[behaviorism|behavioral science]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===

Culture in the ToK system refers to the set of [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] behaviors, which range from large scale nation states to individual human justifications for particular actions. Just as genetic information processing is associated with the Life dimension and neuronal information processing associated with the Mind dimension, symbolic information processing emerges with the Cultural dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical joint points==

===Quantum gravity===
{{main|Quantum gravity}}

'''Quantum gravity''' refers to the imagined merger between the twin pillars of physical science which are [[quantum mechanics]], the study of the microscopic (e.g., electrons), and [[general relativity]], the science of the macroscopic (e.g., [[galaxy|galaxies]]). Currently, these two great domains of science cannot be effectively interwoven into a single, physical [[Theory of Everything]]. Yet progress is being made, most notably through [[string theory]], [[loop quantum gravity]], [[black hole thermodynamics]] and the study of the early universe. Some of the difficulties combining these two pillars of physical science are philosophical in nature and it is possible that the macro view of knowledge offered by the ToK may eventually aid in the construction of a coherent theory of quantum gravity. The reason the ToK might help is that it locates scientific knowledge in relationship to the physical universe.

===The modern synthesis===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)|l1=The Modern Synthesis}}

The '''modern synthesis''' refers to the merger of genetics with [[natural selection]] which occurred in the 1930s and 1940s and offers a reasonably complete framework for understanding the emergence of biological complexity. Although there remain significant gaps in biological knowledge surrounding questions such as the origin of life and the emergence of sexual reproduction, the modern synthesis represents the most complete and well-substantiated joint point.

===Behavioral investment theory===

'''Behavioral investment theory''' ('''BIT''') is proposed as a merger of the selection science of [[behaviorism]] with the information science of [[cognitive neuroscience]] (notice the parallel with the modern synthesis). BIT posits that the nervous system evolved as an increasingly flexible computational control system that coordinates the behavioral expenditure of energy of the animal as a whole. Expenditure of behavioral energy is theorized to be computed on an investment value system built evolutionarily through natural selection operating on genetic combinations and [[ontogeny|ontogenetically]] through behavioral selection operating on neural combinations. As such, the current behavioral investments of the animal are conceptualized as the joint product of the two vectors of [[phylogeny]] and [[ontogeny]]. A unique element of BIT is that it finds a core of agreement and builds bridges between five brain-behavior paradigms: (1) [[cognitive science]]; (2) [[behavioral science]]; (3) evolutionary theory and genetics; (4) neuroscience; and (5) [[cybernetics]]/[[systems theory]].

[[David C. Geary]] noted the similarities between his "motive-to-control" hypothesis and Henriques' Behavioral Investment Theory, which were developed independently of each other. Furthermore, Geary suggested that his model "seem[ed] to fill in many of the [[proximate causation|proximate mechanisms]] and evolutionary pressures that define the life-mind joint point, and provided a framework for further development of the mind-culture joint point."&lt;ref&gt;Geary, D. C. (2005). [http://web.missouri.edu/~psycorie/JCP05%5Bfinal%5D05.pdf The motivation to control and the origin of mind: Exploring the life-mind joint point in the tree of knowledge.] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 61,'' 21–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justification hypothesis===

The '''justification hypothesis''' ('''JH''') is a novel proposal that allows for both the understanding of the evolution of culture and for identifying what makes humans distinct animals. A basic initial claim of the JH is that the process of justification is a crucial component of human mental behavior at both the individual and societal level. Unlike all other animals, humans everywhere ask for and give explanations for their actions. Arguments, debates, moral dictates, rationalizations, and excuses all involve the process of explaining why one's claims, thoughts or actions are warranted. In virtually every form of social exchange, from warfare to politics to family struggles to science, humans are constantly justifying their behavioral investments to themselves and others.

The JH can be stated succinctly as follows: The evolution of language gave rise to the problem of justification, and this evolutionary pressure ultimately resulted in the human self-consciousness system and human culture. The JH carries with it three fundamental postulates. 
*The first is that the evolution of language must have created the problem of justification, which is the problem of explaining one’s self to others in a justifiable manner.
*The second postulate is that the human self-consciousness system can be understood as a “justification filter”. This second claim links the evolutionary analysis with key insights from [[psychodynamic theory]]. Specifically, psychodynamic theory posits that socially unjustifiable impulses are inhibited and socially justifiable reasons are given for actions taken.
*The third postulate is that culture can be understood as large scale justification systems that coordinate the behavior of human populations. Cultural systems are seen to evolve much in the same way as organisms do in biological evolution: there is a process of variation, selection and retention of belief systems.

==How the ToK solves the problem of psychology==

The problem of psychology, according to the ToK, is its conceptual incoherence, which Henriques identifies by the following: 
:(1) There is no agreed upon definition.
:(2) There is no agreed upon subject matter.
:(3) There is a proliferation of overlapping and redundant concepts.
:(4) There are a large number of paradigms with fundamentally different epistemological assumptions.
:(5) Specialization continues to be increasingly emphasized at the expense of generalization and thus the problem of fragmentation only grows.

When the various conceptions of psychology (e.g., behavioral, humanistic, cognitive) are viewed through the lens of the ToK System, psychology spans two different dimensions of complexity: the mental and the cultural. In other words, the discipline has historically spanned two fundamentally separate problems: 
:(1) the problem of animal behavior in general, and
:(2) the problem of human behavior at the individual level.
 
If, as previously thought, nature simply consisted of levels of complexity, psychology would not be crisply defined in relationship to biology or the social sciences. And, indeed, it is frequently suggested that psychology exists in an amorphous space between biology and the social sciences. However, with its dimension of complexity depiction, the ToK System suggests that psychology can be crisply defined as the science of mind, which is the third dimension of complexity. Furthermore, because human behavior exists in the fourth dimension, psychology must be divided into two broad scientific domains of 
:(1) psychological formalism and
:(2) human psychology.

''Psychological formalism'' is defined as the science of mind and corresponds to the behavior of animal objects. ''Human psychology'' is considered to be a unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is important to point out that there are other disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an object level perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though David A. F. Haaga "congratulate[d] Dr. Henriques' ambitious, scholarly, provocative paper", and "found the Tree of Knowledge taxonomy, the theoretical joint points, the evolutionary history, and the levels of emergent properties highly illuminating", he asks the rhetorical questions, 
:''If it is so difficult to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take the rest of the afternoon off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.''&lt;ref&gt;Haaga, D.A.F. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Defining%20Psychology.pdf Defining psychology: What can it do for us?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1227–1230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, Scott O. Lilienfeld, who described Henriques' effort as "thoughtful", contended that psychology is "an inherently fuzzy concept that resists precise definition" and that "attempts to define psychology [would be] likely to hamper rather than foster consilience across disciplines". Lilienfield went on further to suggest that the scientist-practitioner gap in psychology lies not in definitional issues, but in different "epistemic attitudes" between these two groups. He stated that scientists have an epistemic attitude of [[empiricism]], (where questions regarding human nature are settled by scientific evidence), and that practitioners have an epistemic attitude of [[romanticism]], (where questions of human nature are settled by intuition). Lilienfeld suggested that the solution to the scientist-practitioner gulf isn't definitional, but in "train[ing] future clinical scientists to appreciate the proper places of romanticism and empiricism within science".&lt;ref&gt;Lilienfeld, S.O. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Is%20it%20worth%20the%20trouble.pdf Defining psychology: Is it worth the trouble?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1249–1253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consciousness and human behavior==

A frequent question and point of confusion in the ToK System is the definition and meaning of [[consciousness]]. As mentioned above, mind is not synonymous with consciousness. And, to understand consciousness from a ToK vantage point, it is crucial to recognize that the term is often ambiguous in its meaning. Two primary meanings are [[sentience]], which is the capacity for mental experience and [[self-awareness]], which is the capacity to be aware of one's awareness. Sentience is conceptualized as a "level 3" phenomena, possessed by many animals other than humans and is defined as a "perceived" electro-neuro-chemical representation of animal-environment relations. The ingredient of neurological behavior that allows for the emergence of mental experience is considered the "hard" problem of conscious and the ToK System does not address this question explicitly. In contrast, through the Justification Hypothesis (see below), the ToK System involves a very direct analysis of the other issue of consciousness, that of [[self-awareness]]. 
 
Another frequent question that is raised is "Where does individual human behavior fall on the ToK?" To analyze human behavior from the context of the ToK, one uses the ToK like a prism to separate the dimensions of behavior into physiochemical, biogenetic, neuropsychological and sociolinguistic. Thus if we imagine a conversation between a husband and wife as follows:

:Wife: “You are late again.”
:Husband: “Please not now. It was a stressful day and traffic was bad and you know if work needs to be done, I can’t just leave it.”

The words represent the sociolinguistic dimension and are understood as a function of justification. Justification systems are seen both at the level of individual, micro-social and societal (i.e., the context of justification in which men work and women stay at home). The actions of the husband and wife in terms of [[facial expression]], body movement, etc. are seen as the mental dimension and are understood as a function of behavioral investment. The physiological make up of the organ systems and cells of each body is seen as the biogenetic dimension. Finally, the position, temperature, molecular make up is seen as the physiochemical dimension. Each of the more basic dimensions represent conditions of possibility that allow for the emergence of the higher dimension of process. Thus, insufficient oxygen disrupts organic processes which in turn renders neuropsychological and sociolinguistic processes impossible.

==Toward the integration of human knowledge==

As stated above, the ToK System proposes a new [[epistemology]] with the goal of moving academic knowledge toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed [[consilience]]. Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. Henriques argues that the ToK affords new perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts how science emerges from culture and that the four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the physical, biological, psychological and social sciences.

Henriques further argues that developing such a system for integrating knowledge is not just an academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge can be seen as one of the most pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.
  
In a 2008 article on the ToK,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the Tree of Knowledge System. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques cites [[Oliver Reiser]]'s 1958 call for unifying scientific knowledge that Henriques implies is similar in theme to the ToK:

::''In this time of divisive tendencies within and between the nations, races, religions, sciences and humanities, synthesis must become the great magnet which orients us all…[Yet] scientists have not done what is possible toward integrating bodies of knowledge created by science into a unified interpretation of man, his place in nature, and his potentialities for creating the good society. Instead, they are entombing us in dark and meaningless catacombs of learning.''&lt;ref&gt;Reiser, O.L. (1958). The integration of human knowledge. Boston: Porter Sargent.&lt;/ref&gt;

With its depiction of the dimensions of complexity and interlocking theoretical joint points, Henriques' believes that his  ToK System offers new avenues that might allow scholars to meet Reiser’s call for academic synthesis. Henriques, like Reiser, believes that with a shared sense of purpose and a common background of explanation, people might yet be able to integrate bodies of knowledge into a unified interpretation of humanity, with humanity's place in nature and its potentialities for creating the good society.

The '''type–token distinction''' is used in disciplines such as [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[metalogic]], [[typography]], and [[computer programming]] to clarify what words mean.

==Overview==
The sentence "''they drive the same car''" is ambiguous. Do they drive the same ''type'' of car (the same model) or the same instance of a car type (a single vehicle)? Clarity requires us to distinguish words that represent abstract types from words that represent objects that embody or exemplify types. The type–token distinction separates types (abstract descriptive concepts) from tokens (objects that instantiate concepts).

For example: "bicycle" represents a type: the concept of a bicycle; whereas "my bicycle" represents a token of that type: an object that instantiates that type. In the sentence "the bicycle is becoming more popular" the word "bicycle" represents a type that is a concept; whereas in the sentence "the bicycle is in the garage" the word "bicycle" represents a token: a particular object.

(The distinction in [[computer programming]] between [[class (software)|classes]] and [[object (computer science)|objects]] is related, though in this context, "class" sometimes refers to a set of objects (with class-level attribute or operations) rather than a description of an object in the set, as "type" would.)

The words type, concept, property, quality, feature and attribute (all used in describing things) tend to be used with different verbs. E.g. Suppose a rose bush is defined as a plant that is "thorny", "flowering" and "bushy". You might say a rose bush ''instantiates'' these three types, or ''embodies'' these three concepts, or ''exhibits'' these three properties, or ''possesses'' these three qualities, features or attributes.

Property types (e.g "height in metres" or "thorny") are often understood [[ontology|ontologically]] as concepts. Property instances (e.g. height = 1.74) are sometimes understood as measured values, and sometimes understood as sensations or observations of reality.

Some say types exist in descriptions of objects, but not as tangible [[physical object]]s. They say one can show someone a particular bicycle, but cannot show someone the type "bicycle", as in "''the bicycle'' is popular.". However types do exist in the sense that they appear in mental and documented models.

Some say tokens are objects that are tangible, exist in space and time as physical matter and/or energy. However, tokens can be intangible objects of types such as "thought", "tennis match", "government" and "act of kindness".

== Occurrences ==
There is a related distinction very closely connected with the type-token distinction. This distinction is the distinction between an object, or type of object, and an '''''occurrence''''' of it. In this sense, an occurrence is not necessarily a token. Considering the sentence: "[[A rose is a rose is a rose]]". We may equally correctly state that there are eight or three words in the sentence. There are, in fact, three word types in the sentence: "rose", "is" and "a". There are eight word tokens in a token copy of the line. The line itself is a type. There are not eight word types in the line. It contains (as stated) only the three word types, 'a', 'is' and 'rose', each of which is unique. So what do we call what there are eight of? They are occurrences of words. There are three occurrences of the word type 'a', two of 'is' and three of 'rose'.

The need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types arises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have other types of things occurring in them.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/types-tokens Types and Tokens]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection on the simple case of occurrences of [[numeral system|numerals]] is often helpful.{{citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=Claim made with no support or citation, term used without definition.}}

== Typography ==
In [[typography]], the type–token distinction is used to determine the presence of a text printed by [[movable type]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]]: ''Die Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift von 1119. Eine paläographisch-typographische Untersuchung'', Scriptorium Verlag für Kultur und Wissenschaft, Regensburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-937527-06-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The defining criteria which a typographic print has to fulfill is that of the type identity of the various [[letter form]]s which make up the printed text. In other words: each letter form which appears in the text has to be shown as a particular instance ("token") of one and the same type which contains a reverse image of the printed [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]].}}

== Charles Sanders Peirce ==
:''There are only 26 letters in the [[English alphabet]] and yet there are more than 26 letters in this [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letters have been created.''

The word 'letters' was used three times in the above paragraph, each time in a different meaning. The word 'letters' is one of many words having "type–token ambiguity". This section disambiguates 'letters' by separating the three senses using terminology standard in logic today. The key distinctions were first made by the American logician-philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in 1906 using terminology that he established.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanders Peirce, Prolegomena to an apology for pragmaticism, Monist, vol.16 (1906), pp. 492–546.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters that are created by writing are physical objects that can be destroyed by various means: these are letter TOKENS or letter INSCRIPTIONS. The 26 letters of the alphabet are letter TYPES or letter FORMS.

'''Peirce's type–token distinction''', also applies to words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on: to anything in a universe of discourse of character-string theory, or [[concatenation theory]]. There is only one word type spelled el-ee-tee-tee-ee-ar,&lt;ref&gt;Using a variant of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s structural-descriptive naming found in [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]], [https://philarchive.org/archive/CORSTC Schemata: the Concept of Schema in the History of Logic], Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, vol. 12 (2006), pp. 219–40.&lt;/ref&gt; namely, 'letter'; but every time that word type is written, a new word token has been created.

Some logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens. Other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens. The type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members.

The word type 'letter' uses only four letter types: el, ee, tee, and ar. Nevertheless, it uses ee twice and tee twice. In standard terminology, the word type 'letter' has six letter OCCURRENCES and the letter type ee OCCURS twice in the word type 'letter'. Whenever a word type is inscribed, the number of letter tokens created equals the number of letter occurrences in the word type.

Peirce's original words are the following.
"A common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a ... printed book is to count the number of words. There will ordinarily be about twenty 'thes' on a page, and, of course, they count as twenty words. In another sense of the word 'word,' however, there is but one word 'the' in the English language; and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page, or be heard in any voice .... Such a ... Form, I propose to term a Type. A Single ... Object ... such as this or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book, I will venture to call a Token. .... In order that a Type may be used, it has to be embodied in a Token which shall be a sign of the Type, and thereby of the object the Type signifies." – Peirce 1906, Ogden-Richards, 1923, 280-1.

These distinctions are subtle but solid and easy to master. This section ends using the new terminology to disambiguate the first paragraph.

:''There are 26 letter types in the English alphabet and yet there are more than 26 letter occurrences in this sentence type. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letter tokens have been created.''

In [[quantum mechanics]], the '''uncertainty principle''' (also known as '''Heisenberg's uncertainty principle''') is any of a variety of [[Inequality (mathematics)|mathematical inequalities]]&lt;ref name=Sen2014&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sen | first1 = D. | title = The Uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics | url = http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/107/02/0203.pdf | journal = Current Science | volume = 107| issue = 2| year = 2014| pages = 203–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a [[particle]], known as [[Complementarity (physics)|complementary variables]], such as [[Position (vector)|position]] ''x'' and [[momentum]] ''p'', can be known.

Since the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics, typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it.

The uncertainty principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt; So it is helpful to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.

Mathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''ħk''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].

In [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|Ψ}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Laloë |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Matter wave|de Broglie hypothesis]], every object in the universe is a [[wave]], i.e., a situation which gives rise to this phenomenon. The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or momentum ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\hbar} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname P [a \leq X \leq b] = \int_a^b |\psi(x)|^2 \, \mathrm{d}x ~.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of the single-moded plane wave, &lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. 

On the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \propto \sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\hbar}~, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \varphi(p) \cdot e^{i p x/\hbar} \, dp ~, &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.

One way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&amp;nbsp;''σ''. Since &lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.

The precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. Another way of stating this is that σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below. This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound. Click the ''show'' button below to see a semi-formal derivation of the Kennard inequality using wave mechanics.

!Proof of the Kennard inequality using wave mechanics
|-
|We are interested in the [[variance]]s of position and momentum, defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx - \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p^2 \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp - \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty p \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp \right)^2~.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Without loss of generality]], we will assume that the [[expected value|means]] vanish, which just amounts to a shift of the origin of our coordinates. (A more general proof that does not make this assumption is given below.) This gives us the simpler form

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p^2 \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp~.&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x \cdot \psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as a [[vector space|vector]] in a [[function space]]. We can define an [[inner product]] for a pair of functions ''u''(''x'') and ''v''(''x'') in this vector space:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle u \mid v \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty u^*(x) \cdot v(x) \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where the asterisk denotes the [[complex conjugate]].

With this inner product defined, we note that the variance for position can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \langle f \mid f \rangle ~.&lt;/math&gt;

We can repeat this for momentum by interpreting the function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}(p)=p \cdot \varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; as a vector, but we can also take advantage of the fact that &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; are Fourier transforms of each other. We evaluate the inverse Fourier transform through [[integration by parts]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} g(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tilde{g}(p) \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty p \cdot \varphi(p) \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2 \pi \hbar} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ p \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(\chi) e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \right] \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{i}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ \cancel{ \left. \psi(\chi) e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \right|_{-\infty}^\infty } - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d\psi(\chi)}{d\chi} e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \right] \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{-i}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d\psi(\chi)}{d\chi} e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \, e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \left( -i \hbar \frac{d}{dx} \right) \cdot \psi(x) ,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the canceled term vanishes because the wave function vanishes at infinity. Often the term &lt;math&gt;-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is called the momentum operator in position space. Applying [[Parseval's theorem]], we see that the variance for momentum can be written as

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\tilde{g}(p)|^2 \, dp = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |g(x)|^2 \, dx = \langle g \mid g \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] asserts that
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 = \langle f \mid f \rangle \cdot \langle g \mid g \rangle \ge |\langle f \mid g \rangle|^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The modulus squared of any complex number ''z'' can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;|z|^{2} = \Big(\text{Re}(z)\Big)^{2}+\Big(\text{Im}(z)\Big)^{2} \geq \Big(\text{Im}(z)\Big)^{2}=\Big(\frac{z-z^{\ast}}{2i}\Big)^{2}. &lt;/math&gt;
we let &lt;math&gt;z=\langle f|g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z^{*}=\langle g\mid f\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and substitute these into the equation above to get

:&lt;math&gt;|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2 \geq \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g \mid f \rangle}{2i}\bigg)^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

All that remains is to evaluate these inner products.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle = {} &amp; \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \, x \cdot \left(-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}\right) \, \psi(x) \, dx \\
&amp;{} - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \, \left(-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}\right) \cdot x \, \psi(x) \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \left[ \left(-x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right) + \frac{d(x \psi(x))}{dx} \right] \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \left[ \left(-x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right) + \psi(x) + \left(x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right)\right] \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \psi(x) \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this into the above inequalities, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 \ge |\langle f \mid g \rangle|^2 \ge \left(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2i}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{i \hbar}{2 i}\right)^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
or taking the square root

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}~.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the only ''physics'' involved in this proof was that &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; are wave functions for position and momentum, which are Fourier transforms of each other. A similar result would hold for ''any'' pair of conjugate variables.

===Matrix mechanics interpretation===
(Ref &lt;ref name="L&amp;L"/&gt;) 
{{Main article|Matrix mechanics}}
In matrix mechanics, observables such as position and momentum are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s. When considering pairs of observables,  an important quantity is the ''[[commutator]]''. For a pair of operators {{mvar|Â}} and {{mvar|B̂}},  one defines their commutator as
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{B}\hat{A}.&lt;/math&gt;
In the case of position and momentum, the commutator is the [[canonical commutation relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i \hbar.&lt;/math&gt;

The physical meaning of the non-commutativity can be understood by considering the effect of the commutator on position and momentum [[eigenstate]]s. Let &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a right eigenstate of position with a constant eigenvalue {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. By definition, this means that &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}|\psi\rangle = x_0 |\psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt; Applying the commutator to &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}] | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x}\hat{p}-\hat{p}\hat{x}) | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) \hat{p} \, | \psi \rangle = i \hbar | \psi \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|Î}} is  the [[identity matrix|identity operator]].

Suppose, for the sake of [[proof by contradiction]], that &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is also a right eigenstate of momentum, with constant eigenvalue {{mvar|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If this were true, then  one could write
:&lt;math&gt;(\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) \hat{p} \, | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) p_0 \, | \psi \rangle = (x_0 \hat{I} - x_0 \hat{I})  p_0 \, | \psi \rangle=0.&lt;/math&gt;
On the other hand, the above canonical commutation relation requires that
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}] | \psi \rangle=i \hbar | \psi \rangle \ne 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum eigenstate.

When a state is measured, it is projected onto an eigenstate in the basis of the relevant observable. For example, if a particle's position is measured, then the state amounts to a position eigenstate. This means that the state is ''not'' a momentum eigenstate, however, but rather it can be represented  as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates. In other words, the momentum must be less precise. This precision may be quantified by the [[standard deviation]]s,  
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x=\sqrt{\langle \hat{x}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{x}\rangle^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p=\sqrt{\langle \hat{p}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{p}\rangle^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

As in the wave mechanics interpretation above, one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two, quantified by the uncertainty principle.

==Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relations==
The most common general form of the uncertainty principle is the ''[[Howard Percy Robertson|Robertson]] uncertainty relation''.&lt;ref name="Robertson1929"&gt;{{Citation|last=Robertson|first=H. P.|title=The Uncertainty Principle|journal=Phys. Rev.|year=1929|volume=34|pages=163–64|bibcode = 1929PhRv...34..163R |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.34.163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an arbitrary [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian operator]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{O}}&lt;/math&gt; we can associate a standard deviation

:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\mathcal{O}} = \sqrt{\langle \hat{\mathcal{O}}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{\mathcal{O}}\rangle^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where the brackets &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathcal{O}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; indicate an [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]]. For a pair of operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;, we may define their ''[[commutator]]'' as

:::&lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{B}\hat{A},&lt;/math&gt;

In this notation, the Robertson uncertainty relation is given by

::: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_A \sigma_B \geq \left| \frac{1}{2i}\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right| = \frac{1}{2}\left|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right|,&lt;/math&gt;

|The derivation shown here incorporates and builds off of those shown in Robertson,&lt;ref name="Robertson1929" /&gt; Schrödinger&lt;ref name="Schrodinger1930" /&gt; and standard textbooks such as Griffiths.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2005"&gt;{{Citation|last=Griffiths|first=David|title=Quantum Mechanics|year=2005|publisher=Pearson|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; For any Hermitian operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt;, based upon the definition of [[variance]], we have

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 = \langle(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

we let &lt;math&gt;|f\rangle=|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and thus

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 = \langle f\mid f\rangle\, .&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for any other Hermitian operator &lt;math&gt; \hat{B} &lt;/math&gt; in the same state

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_B^2 = \langle(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi\rangle = \langle g\mid g\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; |g\rangle=|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The product of the two deviations can thus be expressed as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2\sigma_B^2 = \langle f\mid f\rangle\langle g\mid g\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

In order to relate the two vectors &lt;math&gt;|f\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|g\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, we use the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]&lt;ref name="Riley2006"&gt;{{Citation | last = Riley | first = K. F. | author2 = M. P. Hobson and S. J. Bence | title = Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering | publisher = Cambridge | year = 2006 | pages = 246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid f\rangle\langle g\mid g\rangle \geq |\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2, &lt;/math&gt;

and thus Eq. ({{EquationNote|1}}) can be written as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A^2\sigma_B^2 \geq |\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Since &lt;math&gt; \langle f\mid g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is in general a complex number, we use the fact that the modulus squared of any complex number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;|z|^2=zz^{*}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;z^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The modulus squared can also be expressed as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; |z|^2 = \Big(\operatorname{Re}(z)\Big)^2+\Big(\operatorname{Im}(z)\Big)^2 = \Big(\frac{z+z^\ast}{2}\Big)^2 +\Big(\frac{z-z^\ast}{2i}\Big)^2. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

we let &lt;math&gt;z=\langle f\mid g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z^{*}=\langle g \mid f \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and substitute these into the equation above to get

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2 = \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle+\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2}\bigg)^2 + \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2i}\bigg)^2 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is written out explicitly as

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle = \langle(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

and using the fact that &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt; are Hermitian operators, we find

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle f\mid g\rangle &amp; = \langle\Psi|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A}\rangle)(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B}\rangle)\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; = \langle\Psi\mid(\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{A}\langle \hat{B}\rangle - \hat{B}\langle \hat{A}\rangle + \langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle)\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; = \langle\Psi\mid\hat{A}\hat{B}\Psi\rangle-\langle\Psi\mid\hat{A}\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Psi\rangle
-\langle\Psi\mid\hat{B}\langle \hat{A}\rangle\Psi\rangle+\langle\Psi\mid\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; =\langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle+\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; =\langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we have

:::&lt;math&gt;
\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle+\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle = \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle+\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle+\langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle = \langle \{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle -2\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

We now substitute the above two equations above back into Eq. ({{EquationNote|4}}) and get
:::&lt;math&gt;
|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2=\Big(\frac{1}{2}\langle\{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle - \langle \hat{A} \rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{1}{2i} \langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle\Big)^{2}\, .
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above into Eq. ({{EquationNote|2}}) we get the Schrödinger uncertainty relation

:::&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_A\sigma_B \geq \sqrt{\Big(\frac{1}{2}\langle\{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle - \langle \hat{A} \rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{1}{2i} \langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle\Big)^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Examples===

Since the Robertson and Schrödinger relations are for general operators, the relations can be applied to any two observables to obtain specific uncertainty relations. A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.
* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] &lt;math&gt;[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar&lt;/math&gt; implies the Kennard inequality from above:
:: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:
:: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{J_i} \sigma_{J_j} \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \big|\langle J_k\rangle\big|,&lt;/math&gt;
: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes angular momentum along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for &lt;math&gt;[J_x, J_y] = i \hbar \varepsilon_{xyz} J_z&lt;/math&gt;, a choice &lt;math&gt;\hat{A} = J_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{B} = J_y&lt;/math&gt;, in angular momentum multiplets, ''ψ'' = |''j'', ''m''〉, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, &lt;math&gt;\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) ≥ ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j'' ≥ ''m'', among others.
*{{anchor|Time–energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]]. Nevertheless, in 1945, [[Leonid Mandelshtam|L. I. Mandelshtam]] and [[Igor Tamm|I. E. Tamm]] derived a non-relativistic '''''time–energy uncertainty relation''''', as follows.&lt;ref&gt;L. I. Mandelshtam, I. E.

:: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_E \frac{\sigma_B}{\left| \frac{\mathrm{d}\langle \hat B \rangle}{\mathrm{d}t}\right |} \ge \frac{\hbar}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
: where σ&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard deviation of the energy operator (Hamiltonian) in the state {{mvar|ψ}}, σ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; stands for the standard deviation of ''B''. Although the second factor in the left-hand side has dimension of time, it is different from the time parameter that enters the [[Schrödinger equation]]. It is a ''lifetime'' of the state {{mvar|ψ}} with respect to the observable ''B'': In other words, this is the ''time interval'' (Δ''t'') after which the expectation value &lt;math&gt;\langle\hat B\rangle&lt;/math&gt; changes appreciably.
: An informal, heuristic meaning of the principle is the following: A state that only exists for a short time cannot have a definite energy. To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time–energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.&lt;ref&gt;The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

: The same linewidth effect also makes it difficult to specify the [[rest mass]] of unstable, fast-decaying particles in [[particle physics]].

===Energy–time uncertainty principle{{anchors|Energy–time uncertainty principle}}===
Other than the position–momentum uncertainty relation, the most important uncertainty relation is that between energy and time. The energy–time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson–Schrödinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \Delta E \Delta t \gtrsim h,&lt;/math&gt;

but it was not always obvious what &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked "To violate the time–energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!"&lt;ref name="C Jansson"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One ''false'' formulation of the energy–time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; requires a time interval &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &gt; h/\Delta E&lt;/math&gt;. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.

Another common misconception is that the energy–time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated—energy can be "borrowed" from the universe as long as it is "returned" within a short amount of time.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2005"/&gt;   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron–positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.

In 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time–energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of "events".&lt;ref&gt;see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/&lt;/ref&gt;

===A counterexample===
Suppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, which we may take to lie in the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;. Define "position" and "momentum" operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt; by

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\psi(\theta)=\theta\psi(\theta),\quad \theta\in [0,2\pi],&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\psi=-i\hbar\frac{d\psi}{d\theta},&lt;/math&gt;

where we impose periodic boundary conditions on &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the definition of &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; depends on our choice to have &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; range from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. These operators satisfy the usual commutation relations for position and momentum operators, &lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=i\hbar&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi-\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi=i\hbar\psi&lt;/math&gt; whenever both &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi&lt;/math&gt; are defined, and the space of such &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a dense subspace of the quantum Hilbert space. See  {{Citation | last = Hall | first = B. C. | title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians | publisher = Springer | year = 2013 | pages = 245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now let &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; be any of the eigenstates of &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;, which are given by &lt;math&gt;\psi(\theta)=e^{2\pi in\theta}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that these states are normalizable, unlike the eigenstates of the momentum operator on the line. Note also that the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, since &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; ranges over a bounded interval. Thus, in the state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the uncertainty of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is zero and the uncertainty of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is finite, so that 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A\sigma_B=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Although this result appears to violate the Robertson uncertainty principle, the paradox is resolved when we note that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is not in the domain of the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt;, since multiplication by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; disrupts the periodic boundary conditions imposed on &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hall2013"/&gt; Thus, the derivation of the Robertson relation, which requires &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi&lt;/math&gt; to be defined, does not apply. (These also furnish an example of operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations but not the [[Canonical commutation relation#The Weyl relations|Weyl relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hall | first = B. C. | title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians | publisher = Springer | year = 2013 | pages = 285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

For the usual position and momentum operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; on the real line, no such counterexamples can occur. As long as &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p&lt;/math&gt; are defined in the state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle holds, even if &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; fails to be in the domain of &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; or of &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hall | first = B.

===Quantum harmonic oscillator stationary states===
{{Main article|Quantum harmonic oscillator|Stationary state}}
Consider a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). It is possible to express the position and momentum operators in terms of the [[creation and annihilation operators]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat x = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}(a+a^\dagger)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat p = i\sqrt{\frac{m \omega\hbar}{2}}(a^\dagger-a).&lt;/math&gt;

Using the standard rules for creation and annihilation operators on the eigenstates of the QHO,
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\dagger}|n\rangle=\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a|n\rangle=\sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle, &lt;/math&gt; 
the [[variance]]s may be computed directly,
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \frac{\hbar}{m\omega} \left( n+\frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \hbar m\omega \left( n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\, .&lt;/math&gt;
The product of these standard deviations is then
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \hbar \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}.~&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the above Kennard bound&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt; is saturated for the [[ground state]] {{math|''n''{{=}}0}}, for which the probability density is just the [[normal distribution]].

In a quantum harmonic oscillator of characteristic angular frequency ω, place a state that is offset from the bottom of the potential by some displacement ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\left(\frac{m \Omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \Omega (x-x_0)^2}{2\hbar}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
where Ω describes the width of the initial state but need not be the same as ω. Through integration over the [[Propagator#Basic Examples: Propagator of Free Particle and Harmonic Oscillator|propagator]], we can solve for the {{Not a typo|full time}}-dependent solution. After many cancelations, the probability densities reduce to
:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi(x,t)|^2 \sim \mathcal{N}\left( x_0 \cos{(\omega t)} , \frac{\hbar}{2 m \Omega} \left( \cos^2(\omega t) + \frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi(p,t)|^2 \sim \mathcal{N}\left( -m x_0 \omega \sin(\omega t), \frac{\hbar m \Omega}{2} \left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where we have used the notation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt; to denote a normal distribution of mean μ and variance σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Copying the variances above and applying [[list of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identities]], we can write the product of the standard deviations as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma_x \sigma_p&amp;=\frac{\hbar}{2}\sqrt{\left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)} \\
&amp;= \frac{\hbar}{4}\sqrt{3+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-1\right) \cos{(4 \omega t)}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From the relations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \ge 2, \quad |\cos(4 \omega t)| \le 1,&lt;/math&gt;

we can conclude the following: (the right most equality holds only when Ω&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ω'') .
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{4}\sqrt{3+\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-1\right)} = \frac{\hbar}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Coherent states===
{{Main article|Coherent state}}
A coherent state is a right eigenstate of the [[annihilation operator]],
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a}|\alpha\rangle=\alpha|\alpha\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
which may be represented in terms of [[Fock state]]s as
:&lt;math&gt;|\alpha\rangle =e^{-{|\alpha|^2\over2}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty {\alpha^n \over \sqrt{n!}}|n\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

In the picture where the coherent state is a massive particle in a QHO, the position and momentum operators may be expressed in terms of the annihilation operators in the same formulas above and used to calculate the variances,
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 m \omega},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \frac{\hbar m \omega}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, every coherent state saturates the Kennard bound

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2 m \omega}} \, \sqrt{\frac{\hbar m \omega}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

with position and momentum each contributing an amount &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\hbar/2}&lt;/math&gt; in a "balanced" way. Moreover, every [[squeezed coherent state]] also saturates the Kennard bound although the individual contributions of position and momentum need not be balanced in general.

===Particle in a box===
{{Main article|Particle in a box}}
Consider a particle in a one-dimensional box of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Particle in a box#Wavefunctions|eigenfunctions in position and momentum space]] are
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(x,t) =
\begin{cases}
A \sin(k_n x)\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\omega_n t}, &amp; 0 &lt; x &lt; L,\\
0, &amp; \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_n(p,t)=\sqrt{\frac{\pi L}{\hbar}}\,\,\frac{n\left(1-(-1)^ne^{-ikL} \right) e^{-i \omega_n t}}{\pi ^2 n^2-k^2 L^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega_n=\frac{\pi^2 \hbar n^2}{8 L^2 m}&lt;/math&gt; and we have used the [[de Broglie relation]] &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k&lt;/math&gt;. The variances of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated explicitly:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2=\frac{L^2}{12}\left(1-\frac{6}{n^2\pi^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2=\left(\frac{\hbar n\pi}{L}\right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

The product of the standard deviations is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{n^2\pi^2}{3}-2}.&lt;/math&gt;
For all &lt;math&gt;n=1, \, 2, \, 3,\, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{n^2\pi^2}{3}-2}&lt;/math&gt; is greater than 1, so the uncertainty principle is never violated. For numerical concreteness, the smallest value occurs when &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, in which case

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi^2}{3}-2} \approx 0.568 \hbar &gt; \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Constant momentum===
{{Main article|Wave packet}}
[[File:Guassian Dispersion.gif|360 px|thumb|right|Position space probability density of an initially Gaussian state moving at minimally uncertain, constant momentum in free space]]
Assume a particle initially has a [[momentum space]] wave function described by a normal distribution around some constant momentum ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; according to

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p) = \left(\frac{x_0}{\hbar \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \exp{\left(\frac{-x_0^2 (p-p_0)^2}{2\hbar^2}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

where we have introduced a reference scale &lt;math&gt;x_0=\sqrt{\hbar/m\omega_0}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; describing the width of the distribution−−cf. [[nondimensionalization]]. If the state is allowed to evolve in free space, then the time-dependent momentum and position space wave functions are

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(p,t) = \left(\frac{x_0}{\hbar \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \exp{\left(\frac{-x_0^2 (p-p_0)^2}{2\hbar^2}-\frac{ip^2 t}{2m\hbar}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t) = \left(\frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \frac{e^{-x_0^2 p_0^2 /2\hbar^2}}{\sqrt{1+i\omega_0 t}} \cdot \exp{\left(-\frac{(x-ix_0^2 p_0/\hbar)^2}{2x_0^2 (1+i\omega_0 t)}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; \langle p(t) \rangle = p_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p(t) = \hbar / x_0 \sqrt{2},&lt;/math&gt; this can be interpreted as a particle moving along with constant momentum at arbitrarily high precision. On the other hand, the standard deviation of the position is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \frac{x_0}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1+\omega_0^2 t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
such that the uncertainty product can only increase with time as
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x(t) \sigma_p(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{1+\omega_0^2 t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Additional uncertainty relations==

===Mixed states===
The Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relation may be generalized in a straightforward way to describe [[density matrix|mixed states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiger|first=Nathan|title=Quantum Uncertainty and Conservation Law Restrictions on Gate Fidelity|url=http://www.physics.byu.edu/Thesis/view.aspx?id=270|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A^2 \sigma_B^2 \geq \left(\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{tr}(\rho\{A,B\}) - \operatorname{tr}(\rho A)\operatorname{tr}(\rho B)\right)^2 +\left(\frac{1}{2i} \operatorname{tr}(\rho[A,B])\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

===The Maccone–Pati uncertainty relations===
The Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relation can be trivial if the state of the system is chosen to be eigenstate of one of the observable. The stronger uncertainty relations proved by Maccone and Pati give non-trivial bounds on the sum of the variances for two incompatible observables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maccone|first1=Lorenzo|last2=Pati|first2=Arun K.|title=Stronger Uncertainty Relations for All Incompatible Observables|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=31 December 2014|volume=113|issue=26|page=260401|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.260401|arxiv=1407.0338|bibcode=2014PhRvL.113z0401M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For two non-commuting observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; the first stronger uncertainty relation is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_{A}^2 + \sigma_{ B}^2 \ge \pm i \langle \Psi\mid [A, B]|\Psi \rangle  + \mid \langle \Psi\mid(A \pm i B)\mid{\bar \Psi} \rangle|^2, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{A}^2 = \langle \Psi |A^2 |\Psi \rangle - \langle \Psi \mid A \mid \Psi \rangle^2   &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{B}^2 = \langle \Psi |B^2 |\Psi \rangle - \langle \Psi \mid B \mid\Psi \rangle^2 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|{\bar \Psi} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is a normalized vector that is orthogonal to the state of the system &lt;math&gt;|\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and  one should choose the sign of  &lt;math&gt;\pm i \langle \Psi\mid[A, B]\mid\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; to make this real quantity a positive number.

The second stronger uncertainty  relation is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 \ge \frac{1}{2}| \langle {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \mid(A + B)\mid \Psi \rangle|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;| {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is a state orthogonal to &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.
The form of &lt;math&gt;| {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \rangle  &lt;/math&gt; implies that the right-hand side of the new uncertainty relation 
is nonzero unless &lt;math&gt;| \Psi\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; is an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;(A + B)&lt;/math&gt;.  One may note that &lt;math&gt;|\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; can be an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;( A+ B)&lt;/math&gt; without being an eigenstate of either
&lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;. However,  when &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is an eigenstate of one of the two observables the Heisenberg–Schrödinger uncertainty relation becomes trivial. But the lower bound in the new relation is nonzero 
unless &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is an eigenstate of both.

===Phase space===
In the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics, the Robertson–Schrödinger relation follows from a positivity condition on a real star-square function. Given a [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution|Wigner function]] &lt;math&gt;W(x,p)&lt;/math&gt; with [[Moyal product|star product]] ★ and a function ''f'', the following is generally true:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T. |last2= Zachos | first2= C. | title = Negative Probability and Uncertainty Relations| journal = Modern Physics Letters A  | volume = 16 | issue = 37 | pages = 2381–2385 | doi = 10.1142/S021773230100576X | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = hep-th/0105226 |bibcode = 2001MPLA...16.2381C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f^* \star f \rangle =\int (f^* \star f) \, W(x,p) \, dx \, dp \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing &lt;math&gt;f=a+bx+cp&lt;/math&gt;, we arrive at

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f^* \star f \rangle =\begin{bmatrix}a^* &amp; b^* &amp; c^* \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star p \rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \langle p \star x \rangle &amp; \langle p \star p \rangle \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a \\ b \\ c\end{bmatrix} \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this positivity condition is true for ''all'' ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', it follows that all the eigenvalues of the matrix are positive. The positive eigenvalues then imply a corresponding positivity condition on the [[determinant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\det\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star p \rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \langle p \star x \rangle &amp; \langle p \star p \rangle \end{bmatrix} = \det\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x^2 \rangle &amp; \left\langle xp + \frac{i\hbar}{2} \right\rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \left\langle xp - \frac{i\hbar}{2} \right\rangle &amp; \langle p^2 \rangle \end{bmatrix} \ge 0,&lt;/math&gt;

or, explicitly, after algebraic manipulation,

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 = \left( \langle x^2 \rangle - \langle x \rangle^2 \right)\left( \langle p^2 \rangle - \langle p \rangle^2 \right)\ge \left( \langle xp \rangle - \langle x \rangle \langle p \rangle \right)^2 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

===Systematic and statistical errors===

The inequalities above focus on the ''statistical imprecision'' of observables as quantified by the standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Heisenberg's original version, however, was dealing with the ''systematic error'', a disturbance of the quantum system produced by the measuring apparatus, i.e., an [[Observer effect (physics)|observer effect]].

If we let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_A&lt;/math&gt; represent the error (i.e., [[accuracy|inaccuracy]]) of a measurement of an observable ''A'' and &lt;math&gt;\eta_B&lt;/math&gt; the disturbance produced on a subsequent measurement of the conjugate variable ''B'' by the former measurement of ''A'', then the inequality proposed by Ozawa&lt;ref name="Ozawa2003"/&gt; — encompassing both systematic and statistical errors — holds:
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_A\, \eta_B + \varepsilon_A \, \sigma_B + \sigma_A \, \eta_B \,\ge\,  \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6

|border colour = #0073CF

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, as originally described in the 1927 formulation, mentions only the first term of Ozawa inequality, regarding the ''systematic error''.   Using the notation above to describe the ''error/disturbance'' effect of ''sequential measurements'' (first ''A'', then ''B''), it could be written as
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{A} \, \eta_{B} \, \ge \,   \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;

The formal derivation of the Heisenberg relation is possible but far from intuitive. It was ''not'' proposed by Heisenberg, but formulated in a mathematically consistent way only in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.160405| title = Proof of Heisenberg's Error-Disturbance Relation| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 111| issue = 16| year = 2013| last1 = Busch | first1 = P. | last2 = Lahti | first2 = P. | last3 = Werner | first3 = R.

Using the same formalism,&lt;ref name="Sen2014"/&gt; it is also possible to introduce the other kind of physical situation, often confused with the previous one, namely the case of ''simultaneous measurements'' (''A'' and ''B'' at the same time):
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_A \, \varepsilon_B  \, \ge  \, \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;

|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
The two simultaneous measurements on ''A'' and ''B'' are necessarily&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Björk | first1 = G. | last2 = Söderholm | first2 = J. | last3 = Trifonov | first3 = A. | last4 = Tsegaye | first4 = T. | last5 = Karlsson | first5 =  A. |

It is also possible to derive an uncertainty relation that, as the Ozawa's one, combines both the statistical and systematic error components, but keeps a form very close to the Heisenberg original inequality.  By adding Robertson&lt;ref name="Sen2014"/&gt; 
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{A} \, \sigma_{B}  \, \ge  \, \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;

and Ozawa relations we obtain

The four terms can be written as: 
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varepsilon_A + \sigma_A) \, (\eta_B + \sigma_B) \, \geq \,  \left|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right| .&lt;/math&gt;
Defining:
:: &lt;math&gt;\bar \varepsilon_A \, \equiv \, (\varepsilon_A + \sigma_A)&lt;/math&gt;
as the ''inaccuracy'' in the measured values of the variable ''A'' and

=== Quantum entropic uncertainty principle ===

For many distributions, the standard deviation is not a particularly natural way of quantifying the structure.

The probability distribution functions associated with the position wave function {{math|''&amp;psi;(x)''}} and the momentum wave function {{math|''&amp;phi;(x)''}} have dimensions of inverse length and momentum respectively, but the entropies may be rendered dimensionless by

:&lt;math&gt;H_x = - \int |\psi(x)|^2 \ln (x_0\,|\psi(x)|^2 ) \,dx =-\left\langle \ln (x_0\mid\psi(x)|^2 ) \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} are some arbitrarily chosen length and momentum respectively, which render the arguments of the logarithms dimensionless. Note that the entropies will be functions of these chosen parameters. Due to the [[Wavefunction#Relation between wave functions|Fourier transform relation]] between the position wave function {{math|''&amp;psi;(x)''}} and the momentum wavefunction {{math|''&amp;phi;''(''p'')}}, the above constraint can be written for the corresponding entropies as
{{Equation box 1

where {{mvar|h}} is [[Planck's constant]].

Depending on one's choice of the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} product, the expression may be written in many ways. If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is chosen to be {{mvar|h}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If, instead,  {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is chosen to be {{mvar|ħ}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log (e\,\pi)&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are chosen to be unity in whatever system of units are being used, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e\,h }{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|h}} is interpreted as a dimensionless number equal to the value of Planck's constant in the chosen system of units.

The quantum entropic uncertainty principle is more restrictive than the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. From the inverse logarithmic Sobolev inequalities&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=D. |last=Chafaï |title=Gaussian maximum of entropy and reversed log-Sobolev inequality|arxiv=math/0102227 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-36107-7_5 |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-540-00072-3 |pages=194–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_x \le \frac{1}{2} \log ( 2e\pi \sigma_x^2 / x_0^2 )~,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_p \le \frac{1}{2} \log ( 2e\pi \sigma_p^2 /p_0^2 )~,&lt;/math&gt;
(equivalently, from the fact that normal distributions maximize the entropy of all such with a given variance), it readily follows that this entropic uncertainty principle is ''stronger than the one based on standard deviations'', because

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2} \exp\left(H_x + H_p - \log \left(\frac{e\,h}{2\,x_0\,p_0}\right)\right) \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}~.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, is a consequence of the quantum entropic uncertainty principle, but not vice versa.  A few remarks on these inequalities. First, the choice of [[base e]] is a matter of popular convention in physics. The logarithm can alternatively be in any base, provided that it be consistent on both sides of the inequality.  Second, recall the [[Shannon entropy]] has been used, ''not'' the quantum [[von Neumann entropy]].  Finally, the normal distribution saturates the inequality, and it is the only distribution with this property, because it is the [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] among those with fixed variance (cf. [[differential entropy#Maximization in the normal distribution|here]] for proof).

!Entropic uncertainty of the normal distribution
|-
|We demonstrate this method on the ground state of the QHO, which as discussed above saturates the usual uncertainty based on standard deviations. The length scale can be set to whatever is convenient, so we assign

:&lt;math&gt;x_0=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\psi(x) &amp;= \left(\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{2\hbar}\right)} \\
&amp;= \left(\frac{1}{2\pi x_0^2}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{4x_0^2}\right)} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability distribution is the normal distribution
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

with Shannon entropy
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x &amp;= - \int |\psi(x)|^2 \ln (|\psi(x)|^2 \cdot x_0 ) \,dx \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)} \ln \left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)}\right] \, dx \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{u^2}{2}\right)} \left[\ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{u^2}{2}\right] \, du\\
&amp;= \ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{1}{2}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A completely analogous calculation proceeds for the momentum distribution. Choosing a standard momentum of &lt;math&gt;p_0=\hbar/x_0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p) = \left(\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\varphi(p)|^2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}} \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_p &amp;= - \int |\varphi(p)|^2 \ln (|\varphi(p)|^2 \cdot \hbar / x_0 ) \,dp \\
&amp;= -\sqrt{\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)} \ln \left[\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}\right] \, dp \\
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -2v^2\right)} \left[\ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + 2v^2 \right] \, dv \\
&amp;= \ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is therefore the limiting value

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x+H_p &amp;= \ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{1}{2} + \ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\\
&amp;= 1 + \ln \pi = \ln(e\pi).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A measurement apparatus will have a finite resolution set by the discretization of its possible outputs into bins, with the probability of lying within one of the bins given by the Born rule. We will consider the most common experimental situation, in which the bins are of uniform size. Let ''δx'' be a measure of the spatial resolution. We take the zeroth bin to be centered near the origin, with possibly some small constant offset ''c''. The probability of lying within the jth interval of width ''δx'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_j]= \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x-c}^{(j+1/2)\delta x-c}| \psi(x)|^2 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

To account for this discretization, we can define the Shannon entropy of the wave function for a given measurement apparatus as

: &lt;math&gt;H_x=-\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j].&lt;/math&gt;

Under the above definition, the entropic uncertainty relation is

:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p&gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{\delta x \delta p}{h} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here we note that {{math|''δx''&amp;nbsp;''δp''/''h''}} is a typical infinitesimal phase space volume used in the calculation of a [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]]. The inequality is also strict and not saturated. Efforts to improve this bound are an active area of research.

|We demonstrate this method first on the ground state of the QHO, which as discussed above saturates the usual uncertainty based on standard deviations.
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\left(\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{2\hbar}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability of lying within one of these bins can be expressed in terms of the [[error function]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\operatorname P[x_j] &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x}^{(j+1/2)\delta x} \exp\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{\hbar}\right) \, dx \\
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x\sqrt{m \omega / \hbar}}^{(j+1/2)\delta x\sqrt{m \omega / \hbar}} e^{u^2} \, du \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\hbar}}\right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\hbar}}\right) \right]\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The momentum probabilities are completely analogous.

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[p_j] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta p \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar m \omega}}\right)- \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar m \omega}}\right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

For simplicity, we will set the resolutions to

:&lt;math&gt;\delta x = \sqrt{\frac{h}{m \omega}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta p = \sqrt{h m \omega}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the probabilities reduce to

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_j] = \operatorname P[p_j] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

The Shannon entropy can be evaluated numerically.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x = H_p &amp;= -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j] \\
&amp;= -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right] \ln \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right]
&amp;\approx 0.3226\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is indeed larger than the limiting value.
:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p \approx 0.3226 + 0.3226 = 0.6452 &gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln 1 \approx 0.3069&lt;/math&gt;

Note that despite being in the optimal case, the inequality is not saturated.

!Sinc function example
|-
|An example of a unimodal distribution with infinite variance is the [[sinc function]]. If the wave function is the correctly normalized uniform distribution,
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(x)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2a}} &amp; \text{for } |x| \le a, \\[8pt]
0 &amp; \text{for } |x|&gt;a
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
then its Fourier transform is the sinc function,
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)=\sqrt{\frac{a}{\pi \hbar}} \cdot \operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{a p}{\hbar}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
which yields infinite momentum variance despite having a centralized shape. The entropic uncertainty, on the other hand, is finite. Suppose for simplicity that the spatial resolution is just a two-bin measurement, ''δx''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'', and that the momentum resolution is ''δp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''a''.

Partitioning the uniform spatial distribution into two equal bins is straightforward. We set the offset ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2 so that the two bins span the distribution.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_0] = \int_{-a}^0 \frac{1}{2a} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_1] = \int_0^a \frac{1}{2a} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_x = -\sum_{j=0}^{1} \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j] = -\frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{1}{2} = \ln 2&lt;/math&gt;

The bins for momentum must cover the entire real line. As done with the spatial distribution, we could apply an offset. It turns out, however, that the Shannon entropy is minimized when the zeroth bin for momentum is centered at the origin. (The reader is encouraged to try adding an offset.) The probability of lying within an arbitrary momentum bin can be expressed in terms of the [[sine integral]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\operatorname P[p_j] &amp;= \frac{a}{\pi \hbar} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta p}^{(j+1/2)\delta p} \operatorname{sinc}^2\left(\frac{a p}{\hbar}\right) \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{2\pi (j-1/2)}^{2\pi (j+1/2)} \operatorname{sinc}^2(u) \, du \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\pi} \left[ \operatorname {Si} ((4j+2)\pi)- \operatorname {Si} ((4j-2)\pi) \right]\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The Shannon entropy can be evaluated numerically.
:&lt;math&gt;H_p = -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[p_j] \ln \operatorname P[p_j] = -\operatorname P[p_0] \ln \operatorname P[p_0]-2 \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \operatorname P[p_j] \ln \operatorname P[p_j] \approx 0.53&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is indeed larger than the limiting value.
:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p \approx 0.69 + 0.53 = 1.22 &gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln 1 \approx 0.31&lt;/math&gt;

==Harmonic analysis==
{{main article|Fourier transform#Uncertainty principle}}
In the context of [[harmonic analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the uncertainty principle implies that one cannot at the same time localize the value of a function and its [[Fourier transform]]. To wit, the following inequality holds,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 |f(x)|^2\,dx\right)\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \xi^2 |\hat{f}(\xi)|^2\,d\xi\right)\ge \frac{\|f\|_2^4}{16\pi^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Further mathematical uncertainty inequalities, including the above [[entropic uncertainty]], hold between a function {{mvar|f}} and its Fourier transform {{math| ƒ̂}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=V.|last1=Havin|first2= B.|last2=Jöricke|title=The Uncertainty Principle in Harmonic Analysis|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Signal processing {{anchor|Gabor limit}}===
In the context of [[signal processing]], and in particular [[time–frequency analysis]], uncertainty principles are referred to as the '''Gabor limit''', after [[Dennis Gabor]], or sometimes the ''Heisenberg–Gabor limit''. The basic result, which follows from "Benedicks's theorem", below, is that a function cannot be both [[time limited]] and [[band limited]] (a function and its Fourier transform cannot both have bounded domain)—see [[Bandlimiting#Bandlimited versus timelimited|bandlimited versus timelimited]]. Thus

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t \cdot \sigma_f \ge \frac{1}{4\pi} \approx 0.08 \text{ cycles}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_f&lt;/math&gt; are the standard deviations of the time and frequency estimates respectively &lt;ref&gt;Matt Hall, [https://agilescientific.com/blog/2014/1/15/what-is-the-gabor-uncertainty-principle.html "What is the Gabor uncertainty principle?"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Stated alternatively, "One cannot simultaneously sharply localize a signal (function {{mvar|f}} ) in both the [[time domain]] and [[frequency domain]] ({{math| ƒ̂}}, its Fourier transform)".

When applied to filters, the result implies that one cannot achieve high temporal resolution and frequency resolution at the same time; a concrete example are the [[Short-time Fourier transform#Resolution issues|resolution issues of the short-time Fourier transform]]—if one uses a wide window, one achieves good frequency resolution at the cost of temporal resolution, while a narrow window has the opposite trade-off.

Alternate theorems give more precise quantitative results, and, in time–frequency analysis, rather than interpreting the (1-dimensional) time and frequency domains separately, one instead interprets the limit as a lower limit on the support of a function in the (2-dimensional) time–frequency plane. In practice, the Gabor limit limits the ''simultaneous'' time–frequency resolution one can achieve without interference; it is possible to achieve higher resolution, but at the cost of different components of the signal interfering with each other.

===DFT-Uncertainty principle===
There is an uncertainty principle that uses signal sparsity (or the number of non-zero coefficients).&lt;ref name="Donoho"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Donoho |first1=D.L. |last2=Stark |first2=P.B |year=1989 |title=Uncertainty principles and signal recovery |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=906–931 |doi=10.1137/0149053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\left \{ \mathbf{ x_n } \right \} := x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of ''N'' complex numbers and &lt;math&gt;\left \{ \mathbf{X_k} \right \} := X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_{N-1},&lt;/math&gt; its [[discrete Fourier transform]].

===Hardy's uncertainty principle===
The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] formulated the following uncertainty principle:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=G.H.|last=Hardy|authorlink=G. H. Hardy|title=A theorem concerning Fourier transforms|journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society|volume=8|year=1933|issue=3|pages=227–231|doi=10.1112/jlms/s1-8.3.227}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not possible for {{mvar|f}} and {{math| ƒ̂}} to both be "very rapidly decreasing". Specifically, if {{mvar|f}} in &lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; is such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)|\leq C(1+|x|)^Ne^{-a\pi x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;|\hat{f}(\xi)|\leq C(1+|\xi|)^Ne^{-b\pi \xi^2}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;C&gt;0,N&lt;/math&gt; an integer),

then, if {{math|1=''ab'' &gt; 1, ''f'' = 0}}, while if {{math|1=''ab'' = 1}}, then there is a polynomial {{mvar|P}} of degree {{math| ≤ ''N''}} such that

::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=P(x)e^{-a\pi x^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This was later improved as follows: if &lt;math&gt;f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt; is such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|f(x)||\hat{f}(\xi)|\frac{e^{\pi|\langle x,\xi\rangle|}}{(1+|x|+|\xi|)^N} \, dx \, d\xi &lt; +\infty ~,&lt;/math&gt;
then
::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=P(x)e^{-\pi\langle Ax,x\rangle} ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|P}} is a polynomial of degree {{math|(''N'' − ''d'')/2}} and {{mvar|A}} is a real {{math|''d''×''d''}} positive definite matrix.

This result was stated in Beurling's complete works without proof and proved in Hörmander&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=L.|last=Hörmander|authorlink=Lars Hörmander|title=A uniqueness theorem of Beurling for Fourier transform pairs|journal= Ark.

==History==
[[Werner Heisenberg]] formulated the uncertainty principle at [[Niels Bohr]]'s institute in Copenhagen, while working on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08.htm American Physical Society online exhibit on the Uncertainty Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heisenbergbohr.jpg|thumb|Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr]]
In 1925, following pioneering work with [[Hendrik Kramers]], Heisenberg developed [[matrix mechanics]], which replaced the ad hoc [[old quantum theory]] with modern quantum mechanics. The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.

Heisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.

In March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously—the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known. Heisenberg wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;It can be expressed in its simplest form as follows: One can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two important factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles—its position and its velocity. It is impossible to determine accurately ''both'' the position and the direction and speed of a particle ''at the same instant''.&lt;ref&gt;Heisenberg, W., ''Die Physik der Atomkerne'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1952, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his celebrated 1927 paper, "Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik" ("On the Perceptual Content of Quantum Theoretical Kinematics and Mechanics"), Heisenberg established this expression as the minimum amount of unavoidable momentum disturbance caused by any position measurement,&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"/&gt; but he did not give a precise definition for the uncertainties Δx and Δp. Instead, he gave some plausible estimates in each case separately. In his Chicago lecture&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"&gt;{{Citation |first=W. |last=Heisenberg |year=1930 |title=Physikalische Prinzipien der Quantentheorie  |language=de|location=Leipzig |publisher=Hirzel }} English translation ''The Physical Principles of Quantum Theory''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; he refined his principle:

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\Delta x \, \Delta p\gtrsim h&lt;/math&gt;|1}}

[[Earle Hesse Kennard|Kennard]]&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt; in 1927 first proved the modern inequality:

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x\sigma_p\ge\frac{\hbar}{2}&lt;/math&gt;|2}}

where {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''h''|2{{pi}}}}}}, and {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the standard deviations of position and momentum. Heisenberg only proved relation ({{EquationNote|2}}) for the special case of Gaussian states.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

===Terminology and translation===
Throughout the main body of his original 1927 paper, written in German, Heisenberg used the word, "Ungenauigkeit" ("indeterminacy"),&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927" /&gt;
to describe the basic theoretical principle. Only in the endnote did he switch to the word, "Unsicherheit" ("uncertainty"). When the English-language version of Heisenberg's textbook, ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', was published in 1930, however, the translation "uncertainty" was used, and it became the more commonly used term in the English language thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Cassidy |year=2009 |title=Beyond Uncertainty: Heisenberg, Quantum Physics, and the Bomb |location= New York |publisher=Bellevue Literary Press |page=185 |isbn= |bibcode=2010PhT....63a..49C |last2=Saperstein |first2=Alvin M. |volume=63 |journal=Physics Today |doi=10.1063/1.3293416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heisenberg's microscope===
[[File:Heisenberg gamma ray microscope.svg|thumb|200px|right|Heisenberg's gamma-ray microscope for locating an electron (shown in blue). The incoming gamma ray (shown in green) is scattered by the electron up into the microscope's aperture angle ''θ''. The scattered gamma-ray is shown in red. Classical [[optics]] shows that the electron position can be resolved only up to an uncertainty Δ''x'' that depends on ''θ'' and the wavelength ''λ'' of the incoming light.]]
{{Main article|Heisenberg's microscope}}

The principle is quite counter-intuitive, so the early students of quantum theory had to be reassured that naive measurements to violate it were bound always to be unworkable. One way in which Heisenberg originally illustrated the intrinsic impossibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by utilizing the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] of  an imaginary microscope as a measuring device.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

He imagines an experimenter trying to measure the position and momentum of an [[electron]] by shooting a [[photon]] at it.&lt;ref name=GreensteinZajonc2006&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Greenstein|author2=Arthur Zajonc|title=The Quantum Challenge: Modern Research on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics|year=2006|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-2470-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49–50}}
:Problem 1 – If the photon has a short [[wavelength]], and therefore, a large momentum, the position can be measured accurately. But the photon scatters in a random direction, transferring a large and uncertain amount of momentum to the electron. If the photon has a long [[wavelength]] and low momentum, the collision does not disturb the electron's momentum very much, but the scattering will reveal its position only vaguely.

:Problem 2 – If a large [[aperture]] is used for the microscope, the electron's location can be well resolved (see [[Rayleigh criterion]]); but by the principle of [[conservation of momentum]], the transverse momentum of the incoming photon affects the electron's beamline momentum and hence, the new momentum of the electron resolves poorly. If a small aperture is used, the accuracy of both resolutions is the other way around.

The combination of these trade-offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to [[Planck's constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tipler |first=Paul A. |first2=Ralph A. |last2=Llewellyn |title=Modern Physics |edition=3rd |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Co. |year=1999 |isbn=1-57259-164-1 |chapter=5–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heisenberg did not care to formulate the uncertainty principle as an exact limit (which is elaborated below), and preferred to use it instead, as a heuristic quantitative statement, correct up to small numerical factors, which makes the radically new noncommutativity of quantum mechanics inevitable.

==Critical reactions==
{{Main article|Bohr–Einstein debates}}

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle were, in fact, seen as twin targets by detractors who believed in an underlying [[determinism]] and [[Scientific realism|realism]]. According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the [[quantum state]] describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.

[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr–Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.

===The ideal of the detached observer===
[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle "the ideal of the detached observer" (phrase translated from the German):
{{blockquote|"Like the moon has a definite position" Einstein said to me last winter, "whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made." I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.
*Letter from Pauli to Niels Bohr, February 15, 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Enz, Charles P.|editor2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Writings on physics and philosophy by Wolfgang Pauli|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|page=43|postscript=; translated by Robert Schlapp|isbn=3-540-56859-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueTd4g7pc5MC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
===Einstein's slit===
The first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:

:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.

Bohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|Δ''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|Δ''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.

A similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Einstein's box===
Bohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that "Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]]."&lt;ref name="Gamow"&gt;Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.&lt;/ref&gt; Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. "We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; "Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle."&lt;ref name="Gamow" /&gt;

Bohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, "since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,"&lt;ref&gt;Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt; because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].
"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

===EPR paradox for entangled particles===
Bohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=452 |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the "natural basic assumption" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from "locally changing deterministic quantities" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.

In 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be "hidden" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's "basic assumption" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.

While it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables are not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption—that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Popper's criticism ===
{{main article|Popper's experiment}}
[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = [[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]] | publisher = Hutchinson &amp; Co. | year = 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as "statistical scatter relations".&lt;ref name="Popper1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarvie2006"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment, | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory. This directly contrasts with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which is [[Determinism|non-deterministic]] but lacks local hidden variables.

In 1934, Popper published ''Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen'' (''Critique of the Uncertainty Relations'') in ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'',&lt;ref name="Popper1934"&gt;{{Citation | title = Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen (Critique of the Uncertainty Relations) | journal = Naturwissenschaften | year = 1934 | first = Karl | last = Popper | author2 = Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | volume = 22 | issue = 48 | pages = 807–808 | doi=10.1007/BF01496543|bibcode = 1934NW.....22..807P | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|Logik der Forschung]]'' (translated and updated by the author as ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' in 1959), outlining his arguments for the statistical interpretation. In 1982, he further developed his theory in ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Heisenberg's] formulae are, beyond all doubt, derivable ''statistical formulae'' of the quantum theory. But they have been ''habitually misinterpreted'' by those quantum theorists who said that these formulae can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the ''precision of our measurements''. [original emphasis]&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K. ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', Unwin Hyman Ltd, 1982, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Popper proposed an experiment to [[Falsifiability|falsify]] the uncertainty relations, although he later withdrew his initial version after discussions with [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker|Weizsäcker]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]; this experiment may have influenced the formulation of the [[EPR paradox|EPR experiment]].&lt;ref name="Popper1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehra2001"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mehra | first1 = Jagdish | last2 = Rechenberg | first2 = Helmut | title = The Historical Development of Quantum Theory | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-387-95086-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Many-worlds uncertainty ===
{{main article|Many-worlds interpretation}}

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] originally outlined by [[Hugh Everett III]] in 1957 is partly meant to reconcile the differences between Einstein's and Bohr's views by replacing Bohr's [[wave function collapse]] with an ensemble of deterministic and independent universes whose ''distribution'' is governed by [[wave function]]s and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Thus, uncertainty in the many-worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge of what goes on in the other universes.

=== Free will ===

Some scientists including [[Arthur Compton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.74.1911.172| title = The Uncertainty Principle and Free Will| journal = Science| volume = 74| issue = 1911| pages = 172| year = 1931| last1 = Compton | first1 = A. H. | pmid=17808216|bibcode = 1931Sci....74..172C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Heisenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/459164a| title = Is free will an illusion?| journal = Nature| volume = 459| issue = 7244| pages = 164–165| year = 2009| last1 = Heisenberg | first1 = M. |bibcode = 2009Natur.459..164H }}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the uncertainty principle, or at least the general probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, could be evidence for the two-stage model of free will. One critique, however, is that apart from the basic role of quantum mechanics as a foundation for chemistry, [[Quantum biology|nontrivial biological mechanisms requiring quantum mechanics]] are unlikely, due to the rapid [[decoherence]] time of quantum systems at room temperature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biosystems.2004.07.001| pmid = 15555759| title = Does quantum mechanics play a non-trivial role in life?| journal = Biosystems| volume = 78| issue = 1–3| pages = 69–79| year = 2004| last1 = Davies | first1 = P. C. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard view, however, is that this decoherence is  overcome by both screening and decoherence-free subspaces found in biological cells.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==The second law of thermodynamics==

There is reason to believe that violating the uncertainty principle also strongly implies the violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Hanggi, S. Wehner, A violation of the uncertainty principle also implies the violation of the second law of thermodynamics; 2012, arXiv:1205.6894v1 (quant-phy).&lt;/ref&gt;
