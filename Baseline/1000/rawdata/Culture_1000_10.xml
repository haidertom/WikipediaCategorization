'''Artificial cranial deformation''' or '''modification''', '''head flattening''', or '''head binding''' is a form of [[body alteration]] in which the [[human skull|skull]] of a human being is deformed intentionally. It is done by distorting the normal growth of a child's skull by applying force. Flat shapes, elongated ones (produced by binding between two pieces of [[wood]]), rounded ones (binding in [[cloth]]), and [[cone|conical]] ones are among those chosen. Typically, it is carried out on an [[infant]], as the skull is most pliable at this time. In a typical case, headbinding begins approximately a month after birth and continues for about six months.

==History==
[[File:Elongated skull IMG 6686-6689.jpg|thumb|right|Elongated skull of a young woman, probably an [[Alans|Alan]].]]
Intentional cranial deformation predates [[written history]]; it was practised commonly in a number of cultures that are widely separated geographically and chronologically, and still occurs today in a few places, including [[Vanuatu]].

The earliest suggested examples were once thought to include the Proto-[[Neolithic]] ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' component ([[ninth millennium BC]]) from [[Shanidar Cave]] in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name="MeiklejohnSolecki92"&gt;Meiklejohn, Christopher; Anagnostis Agelarakis; Peter A.

In the [[Old World]], [[Huns]] also are known to have practised similar cranial deformation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zum.de/Faecher/G/BW/Landeskunde/rhein/kultur/museen/speyer/ausstell/hunnen/hunnin.htm Facial reconstruction of a Hunnish woman], Das Historische Museum der Pfalz, [[Speyer]]&lt;/ref&gt; as were the people known as the [[Alans]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Bachrach|Bachrach, Bernard S.]] (1973) ''A History of the Alans in the West: From Their First Appearance in the Sources of Classical Antiquity Through the Early Middle Ages'', pp. 67-69, Minneapolis, MN, USA: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Late Antiquity]] (AD 300–600), the [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribes]] who were ruled by the Huns, the [[Gepids]], [[Ostrogoths]], [[Heruli]], [[Rugii]], and [[Burgundians]] adopted this custom.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In western Germanic tribes, artificial skull deformations rarely have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Pany, Doris &amp; Karin Wiltschke-Schrotta, "Artificial cranial deformation in a migration period burial of Schwarzenbach,  Lower Austria," ''ViaVIAS'', no. 2, pp. 18-23, Vienna, AUT: Vienna Institute for Archaeological Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of cranial deformation was brought to [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]] by the tribes who created the [[Kushan Empire]]. Men with such skulls are depicted in various surviving sculptures and friezes of that time, such as the Kushan prince of Khalchayan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lebedynsky |first=Iaroslav|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Les Saces|year=2006 |publisher=Editions Errance |location=Paris |isbn=2-87772-337-2}}, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Americas, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= http://www.mesoweb.com/features/tiesler/media/headshaping.pdf |title= Head Shaping and Dental Decoration Among the Ancient Maya: Archeological and Cultural Aspects |author= Tiesler, Vera (Autonomous University of Yucatan) |date= |year= 1999 | conference= 64th Meeting of the Society of American Archaeology |conference-url= |editor= |others= |volume= |edition= |book-title= |publisher= |location= Chicago, IL, USA |id= |isbn= |bibcode= |oclc= |doi= |access-date= 1 August 2015 |ref= |separator= |postscript= |pages= 1–6 |at= |trans-title= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tiesler |first= Vera |date=2012 |title= Studying cranial vault modifications in ancient Mesoamerica |journal= [[Journal of Anthropological Sciences]] |volume= 90|issue= |pages= 1–26|id=  |doi= |jstor=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Tiesler, Vera | author2= Ruth Benítez | last-author-amp= yes |date=2001 |title= Head shaping and dental decoration: Two biocultural attributes of cultural integration and social distinction among the Ancient Maya," ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology, Annual Meeting Supplement,'' '''32''', p. 149.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inca society|Inca]], and certain tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|North American natives]] performed the custom. In North America the practice was known, especially among the [[Chinookan]] tribes of the Northwest and the [[Choctaw]] of the Southeast. The Native American group known as the [[Flathead Indians]], in fact, did not practise head flattening, but were named as such in contrast to other [[Salish peoples|Salishan]] people who used skull modification to make the head appear rounder.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Other tribes, including both Southeastern tribes like the [[Choctaw]]&lt;ref&gt;Elliott Shaw, 2015, "Choctaw Religion," at ''Overview Of World Religions,'' Carlisle, CMA, GBR: University of Cumbria Department of Religion and Ethics, see [http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/nam/choctaw.html], accessed 1 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Charles (1976). ''The Southeastern Indians.'' University of Tennessee Press. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and Northwestern tribes like the [[Chehalis (tribe)|Chehalis]] and [[Nooksack (tribe)|Nooksack Indians]], practiced head flattening by strapping the infant's head to a [[cradleboard]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The practice of cranial deformation was also practiced by the [[Lucayan people]] of the [[Bahamas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oa.1180/abstract |title=Lucayan–Taíno burials from Preacher's cave, Eleuthera, Bahamas - Schaffer |date=2010 |accessdate=2013-06-06 |doi=10.1002/oa.1180 |volume=22 |journal=International Journal of Osteoarchaeology |pages=45–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was also known among the [[Aboriginal Australians]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In Africa, the [[Mangbetu people|Mangbetu]] stood out to European explorers because of their elongated heads. Traditionally, babies' heads were wrapped tightly with cloth in order to give them this distinctive appearance. The practice began dying out in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Friedrich Ratzel]] reported in 1896 that deformation of the skull, both by flattening it behind and elongating it toward the vertex, was found in isolated instances in [[Tahiti]], [[Samoa]], [[Hawaii]], and the [[Paumotu]] group, and that it occurred most frequently on Mallicollo in the New Hebrides (today [[Malakula]], [[Vanuatu]]), where the skull was squeezed extraordinarily flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ratzel, Friedrich |title=The History of Mankind |publisher=MacMillan, London |date=1896 |url=http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/american_pacific/oceania/dress-ornament.htm |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706145317/http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/american_pacific/oceania/dress-ornament.htm |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:« déformation toulousaine » MHNT.jpg|thumb|220 px|upright|Deliberate deformity of the skull, "Toulouse deformity", band visible in photograph is used to induce shape change.]]
In the region of [[Toulouse]] (France), these cranial deformations persisted sporadically up until the early twentieth century;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Delaire | first1 = MMJ | last2 = Billet | first2 = J | year = 1964 | title = Considérations sur les déformations crâniennes intentionnelles | url = | journal = Rev Stomatol | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 535–541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janot | first1 = F | last2 = Strazielle | first2 = C | last3 = Awazu Pereira | first3 = Da Silva | last4 = Cussenot | first4 = O | year = 1993 | title = Adaptation of facial architecture in the Toulouse deformity | url = | journal = Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy | volume = 15| issue = | page = 1038 | doi = 10.1007/BF01629867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, rather than being intentionally produced as with some earlier European cultures, Toulousian Deformation seemed to have been the unwanted result of an ancient medical practice among the French peasantry known as ''bandeau'', in which a baby's head was tightly wrapped and padded in order to protect it from impact and accident shortly after birth. In fact, many of the early modern observers of the deformation were recorded as pitying these peasant children, whom they believed to have been lowered in intelligence due to the persistence of old European customs.&lt;ref name="Dingwall31ch2"&gt;Eric John Dingwall, Eric John (1931) "Later artificial cranial deformation in Europe (Ch. 2)," in ''Artificial Cranial Deformation: A Contribution to the Study of Ethnic Mutilations,'' pp. 46-80, London, GBR:Bale, Sons &amp; Danielsson, see {{cite web|url=http://www.bioanth.org/Dingwall/Dingwell.1931.Chapter.II.pdf|title=Chapter 2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912113206/http://www.bioanth.org/Dingwall/Dingwell.1931.Chapter.II.pdf|archivedate=2014-09-12|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2014-02-20|df=}}{{page needed|date=August 2015}} and [https://books.google.com/books?id=a6yRQAAACAAJ]{{page needed|date=August 2015}}, both accessed 1 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of binding babies' heads in Europe in the twentieth century, though dying out at the time, was still extant in France, and also found in pockets in [[western Russia]], the [[Caucasus]], and in [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref name=Dingwall31ch2/&gt;{{rp|46}}  The reasons for the shaping of the head varied over time and for different reasons, from aesthetic to pseudoscientific ideas about the brain's ability to hold certain types of thought depending on its shape.&lt;ref name=Dingwall31ch2/&gt;{{rp|51}}

==Methods and types==
[[Image:Maya cranial deformation.gif|thumb|right|Methods used by the Mayan people to shape a child's head]]
Deformation usually begins just after birth for the next couple of years until the desired shape has been reached or the child rejects the apparatus.&lt;ref name=Dingwall31ch2/&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;Trinkaus, 1982.{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anton and Weinstein, 1999.{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no broadly established classification system of cranial deformations, and many scientists have developed their own classification systems without agreeing on a single system for all forms observed.&lt;ref name=Hoshower95&gt;Hoshower et al., 1995.{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an individual system is that of E.V. Zhirov, who described three main types of artificial cranial deformation—round, fronto-occipital, and sagittal—for occurrences in Europe and Asia, in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;E.V. Zhirov (1941).{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}

==Motivations and theories==
One modern theory is cranial deformation was likely performed to signify group affiliation,&lt;ref name=Hoshower95/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerszten95&gt;Gerszten and Gerszten, 1995.{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tubbs, Salter, and Oaks, 2006.{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to demonstrate [[status symbol|social status]]. Such motivations may have played a key role in [[Maya civilization|Maya]] society,&lt;ref name=Gerszten95/&gt; aimed at creating a skull shape that is aesthetically more pleasing or associated with desirable attributes. For example, in the [[Nahai]]-speaking area of [[Tomman Island]] and the south south-western [[Malakula]]n (Australasia), a person with an elongated head is thought to be more intelligent, of higher [[social status|status]], and closer to the world of the spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141013-why-we-reshape-childrens-skulls |title=Why early humans reshaped their children's skulls |author=Colin Barras |work=BBC Earth |date=13 October 2014&lt;!-- meta tag article:published_time --&gt; |accessdate=15 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rivero and Tschudi's fetus with naturally elongated head.jpg|thumb|Dr. Leopold Müller: [[Lithography]] of a [[fetus]], in the intrauterine position, with the typical Huanca skull shape (Lamina VI a.) in the Spanish version of the 'Peruvian Antiquities' (1851) which was found in a mummy of a pregnant woman.&lt;ref name="Tschudi 1852"&gt;Mariano Eduardo Rivero, Juan Diego de Tschudi: ''Antigüedades Peruanas.'' Textband. Imprenta Imperial de la Corte y de Estado, Viena 1851, ([https://archive.org/stream/b24876574#page/n5/mode/2up Digitalisat]).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historically, there have been a number of various theories regarding the motivations for these practices.

It has also been considered possible that the practice of cranial deformation originates from an attempt to emulate those groups of the population in which elongated head shape was a natural condition. For example, Rivero and [[Johann Jakob von Tschudi|Tschudi]] describe a mummy containing a foetus with an elongated skull, describing it thus:
{{Quote|the same formation [i.e. absence of the signs of artificial pressure] of the head presents itself in children yet unborn; and of this truth we have had convincing proof in the sight of a foetus, enclosed in the womb of a mummy of a pregnant woman, which we found in a cave of Huichay, two leagues from Tarma, and which is, at this moment, in our collection. Professor D’Outrepont, of great Celebrity in the department of obstetrics, has assured us that the foetus is one of seven months’ age. It belongs, according to a very clearly defined formation of the cranium, to the tribe of the [[Huanca people|Huancas]]. We present the reader with a drawing of this conclusive and interesting proof in opposition to the advocates of mechanical action as the sole and exclusive cause of the phrenological form of the Peruvian race.&lt;ref name=RiveroTschudi51&gt;Rivero and Tschudi (1852) ''Antigüedades peruanas'' (''Peruvian Antiquities''), issue 1851/1852.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Bellamy.JPG|thumb|upright|Lithographs of skulls by J. Basire]]
 
P.F. Bellamy makes a similar observation about the two elongated skulls of infants, which were discovered and brought to England by a "Captain Blankley" and handed over to the Museum of the Devon and Cornwall Natural History Society in 1838. According to Bellamy, these skulls belonged to two infants, female and male, "one of which was not more than a few months old, and the other could not be much more than one year."&lt;ref name="Bellamy1842"&gt;Bellamy, P. F. (1842) "A brief Account of two Peruvian Mummies in the Museum of the Devon and Cornwall Natural History Society, in ''Annals and Magazine of Natural History,'' '''X''' (October).[https://archive.org/stream/cbarchive_36786_abriefaccountoftwoperuvianmumm1840/abriefaccountoftwoperuvianmumm1840_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;  He writes,
 
{{quote|It will be manifest from the general contour of these skulls that they are allied to those in the Museum of the College of Surgeons in London, denominated Titicacans. Those adult skulls are very generally considered to be distorted by the effects of pressure; but in opposition to this opinion Dr. Graves has stated, that "a careful examination of them has convinced him that their peculiar shape cannot be owing to artificial pressure;" and to corroborate this view, we may remark that the peculiarities are as great in the child as in the adult, and indeed more in the younger than in the elder of the two specimens now produced: and the position is considerably strengthened by the great relative length of the large bones of the cranium; by the direction of the plane of the occipital bone, which is not forced upwards, but occupies a place in the under part of the skull; by the further absence of marks of pressure, there being no elevation of the vertex nor projection of either side; and by the fact of there being no instrument nor mechanical contrivance suited to produce such an alteration of form (as these skulls present) found in connexion with them.&lt;ref&gt;P. F. Bellamy: A brief Account of two Peruvian Mummies in the Museum of the Devon and Cornwall Natural History Society. In: The Annals and Magazine of Natural History. Bd. 10, No. 63, 1842, p. 95–100.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Health effects==
There is no statistically significant difference in [[cranial capacity]] between artificially deformed skulls and normal skulls in Peruvian samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin Frieß|author2=Michel Baylac|title=Exploring artificial cranial deformation using elliptic Fourier analysis of procrustes aligned outlines|date=2003|volume=122|issue=1|page=18|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.10286/full|accessdate=2014-03-05|doi=10.1002/ajpa.10286|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|pmid=12923900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12023">In [[literary theory]] and [[aesthetics]], '''authorial intent''' refers to an [[author]]'s [[intention|intent]] as it is encoded in his or her [[Work of art|work]]. '''Authorial intentionalism''' is the view, according to which an author's intentions should constrain the ways in which it is properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;A. Huddleston, "The Conversation Argument for Actual Intentionalism", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'' '''52'''(3):241–256 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary theory==
===New Criticism===
{{main|New Criticism}}
[[New Criticism]], as espoused by [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[W. K. Wimsatt]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and others, argued that authorial intent is irrelevant to understanding a work of literature. Wimsatt and [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue in their essay "The Intentional Fallacy" that "the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art".&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimsatt|first=W. K.|last2=Beardsley|first2=M. C.|date=1946|title=The Intentional Fallacy|jstor=27537676|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=54|issue=3|pages=468–488}} Revised and republished in {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Verbal_Icon.html?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC|title=The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry|date=1954|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813128579|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author, they argue, cannot be reconstructed from a [[writing]]—the text is the primary source of [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]], and any details of the author's desires or life are secondary. Wimsatt and Beardsley argue that even details about the work's composition or the author's intended meaning and purpose that might be found in other documents such as journals or letters are "private or idiosyncratic; not a part of the work as a linguistic fact" and are thus secondary to the trained reader's rigorous engagement with the text itself.&lt;ref name="WimsattBeardsley" /&gt;

Wimsatt and Beardsley divide the evidence used in making interpretations of poetry (although their analysis can be applied equally well to any type of art){{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} into three categories:

; Internal (or public) evidence: Internal evidence refers to what is presented within a given work. This internal evidence includes strong familiarity with the conventions of language and literature: it "is discovered through the semantics and syntax of a poem, through our habitual knowledge of the language, through grammars, dictionaries, and all the literature which is the source of dictionaries, in general through all that makes a language and culture". Analyzing a work of art based on internal evidence will not result in the intentional fallacy.
   
; External (or private) evidence: What is not literally contained in the work itself is external to that work, including all private or public statements that the artist has made about the work of art, whether in conversations, letters, journals, or other sources. Evidence of this type is directly concerned with what the artist may have intended to do even or especially when it is not apparent from the work itself. Analyzing a work of art based on external evidence will likely result in the intentional fallacy.

; Intermediate evidence:  The third type of evidence, intermediate evidence, includes "private or semiprivate meanings attached to words or topics by an author or by a coterie of which he is a member." Also included are "the history of words" and "the biography of an author, his use of a word, and the associations which the word had for him." Wimsatt and Beardsley argue for the use of intermediate evidence rather than external evidence in the interpretation of a literary work, but they recognize that these two types of evidence "shade into one another so subtly that it is not always easy to draw a line between" the two.

Thus, a text's internal evidence—the words themselves and their meanings—is open for literary analysis. External evidence—anything not contained within the text itself, such as statements made by the poet about the poem that is being interpreted—does not belong to literary criticism. Preoccupation with the authorial intent "leads away from the poem." According to Wimsatt and Beardsley, a poem does not belong to its author but rather "is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public."

===Psychoanalytic criticism===
{{main|Psychoanalytic literary criticism}}
In [[psychoanalytic criticism]], the author's biography and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] state were seen as part of the text, and therefore the author's intent could be revived from a literary text—although the intent might be an unconscious one.

===Cambridge School Contextualism===
{{main|Cambridge School (intellectual history)}}

The [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|Cambridge School]] of contextualist [[hermeneutics]], a position most elaborated by [[Quentin Skinner]], in the first instances distinguishes linguistic meaning from speech-acts: that is to say, things which the performance of an utterance ''does''. Consider the following. Typically, the ceremony of marriage concludes upon the exchange of the utterance "I do". In such a case, to utter "I do" is not merely to report an internal disposition, but to perform an action, namely, to ''get'' married. The intended force of "I do" in such a circumstance is only ever retrievable through understanding something about the complex social activity of marriage. Indeed, to understand a speech-act is to understand what conventions are regulating its significance. Since actions are always publicly legible—they are done by the speech itself—this presupposes no knowledge about the author's mental states. The task is always thus: with as much contextual information as possible, can we establish which conventions a text was interacting with, and by inference to the best explanation, what the author's intent was.

===Post-structuralism===
{{main|Post-structuralism}}
In [[post-structuralism]], there are a variety of approaches to authorial intent. For some of the theorists deriving from [[Jacques Lacan]], and in particular theories variously called ''[[écriture féminine]]'', gender and sex predetermine the ways that texts will emerge, and the language of textuality itself will present an argument that is potentially counter to the author's conscious intent.

===Marxist criticism===
{{main|Marxist literary criticism}}
For [[Marxist]] literary theorists, the author's intent is always a code for a particular set of ideologies in the author's own day.  For Marxists (especially those of the [[Soviet realism]] type), authorial intent is manifest in the text and must be placed in a context of liberation and the [[materialist dialectic]].  However, Marxist-derived theorists have seen authorial intent in a much more nuanced way.  [[Raymond Williams]], for example, posits literary productions always within a context of emerging, resistant, and synthetic ideological positions.  The author's intent is recoverable from the text, but there are always encoded within it several separate positions.  The author might be arguing consciously for empire, but hidden within that argument will be a response to a counterargument and a presentation of an emerging synthesis.  Some members of the [[reception theory]] group ([[Hans Robert Jauss]], in particular) have approximated the Marxist view by arguing that the forces of cultural reception reveal the ideological positions of both author and readership.

===Reader response===
{{main|Reader response}}
[[Reader response]] critics view the authorial intent variously.  In general, they have argued that the author's intent itself is immaterial and cannot be fully recovered.  However, the author's intent will shape the text and limit the possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s of a work.  The reader's ''impression'' of the author's intent is a working force in interpretation, but the author's actual intent is not.

===Weak intentionalism===
Weak intentionalism combines intentionalism with insights from reader response. [[Mark Bevir]]  in ''The Logic of the History of Ideas'' sees meanings as necessarily intentional but suggests that the relevant intentions can be those of readers as well as those of authors. Weak intentionalists privilege intentionality to emphasize that texts do not have meanings in themselves. They believe that meanings are always meanings for people—albeit the relevant people, whether authors or readers.

==In textual criticism==
Authorial intention is of great practical concern to some [[textual critic]]s. These are known as intentionalists and are identified with the Bowers-Tanselle school of thought. Their editions have as one of their most important goals the recovery of the author's intentions (generally final intentions). When preparing a work for the press, an editor working along the principles outlined by [[Fredson Bowers]] and [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] will attempt to construct a text that is close to the author's final intentions. For transcription and typesetting, authorial intentionality can be considered paramount.

An intentionalist editor would constantly investigate the [[document]]s for traces of authorial intention. On one hand, it can be argued that the author always intends whatever the author writes and that at different points in time the same author might have very different intentions. On the other hand, an author may in some cases write something he or she did not intend. For example, an intentionalist would consider for emendation the following cases:

*The authorial manuscript misspells a word: an error in intention, it is usually assumed. Editorial procedures for works available in no 'authorized editions' (and even those are not always exempt) often specify correcting such errors.
*The authorial manuscript presents what appears to be a misformat of the text: a sentence has been left in run-on form. It is assumed that the author might have regretted not beginning a new paragraph, but did not see this problem until afterwards, until rereading.
*The authorial manuscript presents a factual error.

In cases such as these where the author is living, they would be questioned by the editor who would then adhere to the intention expressed. In cases where the author is deceased, an intentionalist would attempt to approach authorial intention. The strongest voices countering an emphasis on authorial intent in scholarly editing have been [[D. F. McKenzie]] and [[Jerome McGann]], proponents of a model that accounts for the "social text," tracing material transformations and embodiments of works while not privileging one version over another.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5978">'''Bundling''', or '''tarrying''', is the traditional practice of wrapping two people in a bed together, usually as a part of [[courting]] behavior. The tradition is thought to have originated either in the [[Netherlands]] or in the [[British Isles]] and later became common in [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial United States]],&lt;ref&gt;History of Sex, Love and Sexuality 1750 America and Bundling, The People's Almanac [http://www.trivia-library.com/a/history-of-sex-love-sexuality-1750-america-and-bundling.htm 1975 - 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Stiles | first=Henry Reed | year=2005 | title=Bundling: Its Origin, Progress and Decline | edition=reprint | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | isbn=978-1-4179-8628-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Pennsylvania Dutch Country]]. Some [[Nebraska Amish]] may still practice it. When used for courtship, the aim is to allow [[intimacy]] without [[sexual intercourse]].

==Origin==
It is possible the precedent for bundling came from the [[Bible|biblical]] story of Ruth and Boaz, in which Ruth, a young widow, and Boaz, an older wealthy landowner, spend a night together in a grain storage room while not touching; the pair later get married.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Ruth.3:9-14;Ruth.4:13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courtship practice==
Traditionally, participants were adolescents, with a boy staying at the residence of the girl. They were given separate blankets by the girl's parents and expected to talk to one another through the night. Occasionally a ''bundling board'' or bundling sack was placed between the boy and girl to discourage sexual conduct.

== In United States ==
In [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial United States]], [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and other preachers condemned bundling;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marsden|first=George|title=Jonathan Edwards: A Life|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300129946|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeGd_Ry34_MC&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;ots=gv6GO_MWjE&amp;dq=%22jonathan%20edwards%22%20bundling&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jonathan%20edwards%22%20bundling&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet the practice continued into the period of the early Republic, when if beds were scarce, travelers occasionally were permitted to bundle with locals.  This seemingly strange practice allowed extra money to be made by renting out half a bed.  Some hotels rented rooms for the night, shared by many occupants, and sharing a bed entailed an additional fee.

It is possible that, as late as the mid-19th century, bundling was still practiced in [[New York (state)|New York]] state and perhaps in [[New England]], though its popularity was waning.  The court case of ''Graham v. Smith'', 1 Edm.Sel.Cas. 267 (N.Y. 1846), for example, initially argued before Judge Edmunds in the Orange Circuit Court of New York, concerned the [[Seduction (tort)|seduction]] of a 19-year-old woman; testimony in the case established that bundling was a common practice in certain rural social circles at the time. By the 20th century, bundling seems to have disappeared almost everywhere, except for the more conservative   [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] [[Subgroups of Amish|affiliations]], where it is still in use in the 21st century, regardless of location.&lt;ref&gt;Shachtman, pp. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The writer [[Washington Irving]], in chapter 7 of ''[[Knickerbocker's History of New York]]'' as well as other of his works, refers to bundling as a Yankee practice.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This amazing increase may, indeed, be partly ascribed to a singular custom prevalent among them, commonly known by the name of bundling—a superstitious rite observed by the young people of both sexes, with which they usually terminated their festivities, and which was kept up with religious strictness by the more bigoted part of the community.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In the media==
Gabriel Edward Martin, [[Heath Ledger]]'s character in the 2000 film ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'', is bundled when he spends an overnight visit at the home of  Anne Patricia Howard ([[Lisa Brenner]]), the girl that he is courting.

[[Anna Gunn]]'s character in the HBO series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' mentions removing a bundling board from their bed in Season 2, Episode 2.

In the TV series [[Salem (TV series)|''Salem'']] during Season 1, Episode 7, "Our Own Private America", adolescent teens are seen bundling. The girl breaks the sack.

In the TV serie [[A Discovery of Witches (TV series)|A Discovery of Witches]] during Season 1, episode 5, Matthew de Clairmont and Diana Bishop discuss the "bundling" custom.

The '''Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs''' ('''ECA''') of the [[United States Department of State]] fosters mutual understanding between the people of the [[United States]] and the people of other countries around the world.  It is responsible for the [[United States Cultural Exchange Programs]].

The current [[Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs]] is [[Marie Royce]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://eca.state.gov/highlight/marie-royce-sworn-assistant-secretary-state-educational-and-cultural-affairs Marie Royce Sworn In as Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1940, [[Nelson Rockefeller]] began the exchange of persons program with Latin America, as the Coordinator of Commercial and Cultural Affairs for the American Republics.  This program sent 130 journalists from Latin America to the United States.  In 1942, The [[United States Office of War Information]] (OWI) was created out of the United States Government's need for a centralized location for information.  OWI was disbanded under the Truman administration, though a small element of the original structure was maintained within the State Department as the Office of International Information and Cultural Affairs (OIC), which was renamed the Office of International Information and Educational Exchange.

In 1948, the [[Smith-Mundt Act]] sought to "promote a better understanding of the United States in other countries, and to increase mutual understanding."  The educational and cultural exchange aspects of the State Department were removed from the [[Bureau of Public Affairs]] and entered the newly created Bureau of Educational and Cultural Relations (CU) in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Mission of ECA|url=http://eca.state.gov/about-bureau/history-and-mission-eca|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Fulbright-Hays Act]] to establish a program to “strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and other nations”.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/iegps/fulbrighthaysact.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, the United States International Communication Agency (USICA) absorbed the bureau with the understanding that USICA was in charge of United States [[public diplomacy]].  [[Ronald Reagan]] renamed USICA to the [[United States Information Agency]] in 1982, and in 1999, USIA was absorbed by the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs|url=http://exchanges.state.gov/ivlp/history.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catharsis''' (from Greek {{lang|el|[[wikt:κάθαρσις|κάθαρσις]]}} {{transl|el|''katharsis''}} meaning "purification" or "cleansing") is the purification and purgation of emotions—particularly pity and fear—through art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA217 |title=catharsis |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1995 |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any extreme change in emotion that results in renewal and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2XgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= | last = Berndtson | first = Arthur | title = Art, Expression, and Beauty | publisher = Krieger | year = 1975 | page = 235|isbn=9780882752174 | quote=The theory of catharsis has a disarming affinity with the expressional theory, since it emphasizes emotion, asserts a change in emotion as a result of aesthetic operations, and concludes on a note of freedom in relation to the emotion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvZYaJmH6LcC&amp;dq= | title=Looking for an Argument: Critical Encounters with the New Approaches to the Criticism of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries | first=Richard | last=Levin |year=2003 | page=42 | quote=Catharsis in Shakespearean tragedy involves ... some kind of restoration of order and a renewal or enhancement of our positive feelings for the hero.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a metaphor originally used by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]],'' comparing the effects of [[tragedy]] on the mind of a spectator to the effect of a [[cathartic]] on the body.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b 1449b]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/99492/catharsis |title=catharsis (criticism) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic uses==
Catharsis is a term in [[drama|dramatic art]] that describes the effect of tragedy (or [[comedy]] and quite possibly other artistic forms)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Catharsis in Healing, Ritual, and Drama | first=Thomas J. | last = Scheff | authorlink=Thomas J. Scheff | isbn=0-595-15237-6|publisher=University of California Press | year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; principally on the audience (although some have speculated on characters in the drama as well). Nowhere does [[Aristotle]] explain the meaning of "catharsis" as he is using that term in the definition of tragedy in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1449b21-28). G.&amp;nbsp;F. Else argues that traditional, widely held interpretations of catharsis as "purification" or "purgation" have no basis in the text of the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', but are derived from the use of catharsis in other Aristotelian and non-Aristotelian contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Catharsis | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | first = Leon | last = Golden | volume = 93 | pages = 51–60 | jstor = 283751 | doi = 10.2307/283751}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, a number of diverse interpretations of the meaning of this term have arisen. The term is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of [[anagnorisis]].

D.&amp;nbsp;W. Lucas, in an authoritative edition of the ''Poetics'', comprehensively covers the various nuances inherent in the meaning of the term in an Appendix devoted to "Pity, Fear, and Katharsis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aristotle: Poetics|last=Lucas|first=D. W.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1977|isbn=978-0198140245|pages=276–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas recognizes the possibility of catharsis bearing some aspect of the meaning of "purification, purgation, and 'intellectual clarification'" although his discussion of these terms is not always, or perhaps often, in the precise form with which other influential scholars have treated them. Lucas himself does not accept any one of these interpretations as his own but adopts a rather different one based on "the Greek doctrine of Humours" which has not received wide subsequent acceptance. Purgation and purification, used in previous centuries, as the common interpretations of catharsis are still in wide use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catharsis in Psychotherapy | first1=Michael P. | last1=Nichols | first2=Melvin | last2=Zax |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, New York|year=1977|isbn=978-0470990643}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in the twentieth century, the interpretation of catharsis as "intellectual clarification" has arisen as a rival to the older views in describing the effect of catharsis on members of the audience.

===Purgation and purification===
In his works prior to the ''Poetics,'' Aristotle had used the term ''catharsis'' purely in its medical sense (usually referring to the evacuation of the ''katamenia''—the [[menstrual]] fluid or other reproductive material).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Belifiore | first = Elizabeth S. | title = Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion | page = 300 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, however, he employs it as a medical [[metaphor]].
[[F. L. Lucas]] maintains, therefore, that ''purification'' and ''cleansing'' are not proper translations for ''catharsis''; that it should rather be rendered as ''[[Purgatory|purgation]]''. "It is the human soul that is purged of its excessive passions."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L. ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's Poetics'', p.&amp;nbsp;24&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald F. Else made the following argument against the "purgation" theory: "It presupposes that we come to the tragic drama (unconsciously, if you will) as patients to be cured, relieved, restored to psychic health. But there is not a word to support this in the "Poetics", not a hint that the end of drama is to cure or alleviate pathological states. On the contrary it is evident in every line of the work that Aristotle is presupposing 'normal' auditors, normal states of mind and feeling, normal emotional and aesthetic experience."&lt;ref&gt;Else, Gerald F. ''Aristotle's Poetics: The Argument'', p. 440. Cambridge, Massachusetts (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] sidesteps the medical attribution. He translates ''catharsis'' as a purification, an experience that brings pity and fear into their proper balance: "In real life", he explained, "men are sometimes too much addicted to pity or fear, sometimes too little; tragedy brings them back to a virtuous and happy mean."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L. ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's Poetics'', p.&amp;nbsp;23. Hogarth, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;
Tragedy is then a corrective; through watching tragedy, the audience learns how to feel these emotions at proper levels.

===Intellectual clarification===
In the twentieth century a paradigm shift took place in the interpretation of catharsis with a number of scholars contributing to the argument in support of the intellectual clarification concept.&lt;ref&gt;The following works can be usefully consulted in this regard: L. Golden, "Aristotle on Tragic and Comic Mimesis," Atlanta, 1992; S. Halliwell, "Aristotle's Poetics," London, 1986; D. Keesey, "On Some Recent Interpretations of Catharsis, "The Classical World", (1979) 72.4, 193–205.&lt;/ref&gt; The clarification theory of catharsis would be fully consistent, as other interpretations are not, with Aristotle's argument in chapter 4 of the ''Poetics'' (1448b4-17) that the essential pleasure of [[mimesis]] is the intellectual pleasure of "learning and inference".

It is generally understood that Aristotle's theory of mimesis and catharsis are responses to [[Plato]]'s negative view of artistic mimesis on an audience. Plato argued that the most common forms of artistic mimesis were designed to evoke from an audience powerful emotions such as pity, fear, and ridicule which override the rational control that defines the highest level of our humanity and lead us to wallow unacceptably in the overindulgence of emotion and passion. Aristotle's concept of catharsis, in all of the major senses attributed to it, contradicts Plato's view by providing a mechanism that generates the rational control of irrational emotions. All of the commonly held interpretations of catharsis, purgation, purification, and clarification are considered by most scholars to represent a homeopathic process in which pity and fear accomplish the catharsis of emotions like themselves. For an alternate view of catharsis as an [[Allopathic medicine|allopathic]] process in which pity and fear produce a catharsis of emotions unlike pity and fear, see E. Belfiore, ''Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion.'' Princeton, 1992, 260 ff.

===Literary analysis of catharsis===
The following analysis by [[E. R. Dodds]], directed at the character of [[Oedipus]] in the paradigmatic Aristotelian tragedy, ''[[Oedipus Rex]],'' incorporates all three of the aforementioned interpretations of catharsis: purgation, purification, intellectual clarification:{{quote|...what fascinates us is the spectacle of a man freely choosing, from the highest motives a series of actions which lead to his own ruin. Oedipus might have left the plague to take its course; but pity for the sufferings of his people compelled him to consult Delphi. When Apollo's word came back, he might still have left the murder of Laius uninvestigated; but piety and justice required him to act. He need not have forced the truth from the reluctant Theban herdsman; but because he cannot rest content with a lie, he must tear away the last veil from the illusion in which he has lived so long. Teiresias, Jocasta, the herdsman, each in turn tries to stop him, but in vain; he must read the last riddle, the riddle of his own life. The immediate cause of Oedipus' ruin is not "fate or "the gods"—no oracle said that he must discover the truth—and still less does it lie in his own weakness; what causes his ruin is his own strength and courage, his loyalty to Thebes, and his loyalty to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=E. R. | last=Dodds | authorlink=E. R. Dodds | title=On Misunderstanding the 'Oedipus Rex' | journal=Greece and Rome |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1966 |pages=37–49 |jstor=642354 | doi=10.1017/s0017383500016144}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Attempts to subvert catharsis===
There have been, for political or aesthetic reasons, deliberate attempts made to subvert the effect of catharsis in theatre.
For example, [[Bertolt Brecht]] viewed catharsis as a pap (pabulum) for the [[bourgeois]] theatre audience, and designed dramas which left significant emotions unresolved, intending to force social action upon the audience. Brecht then identified the concept of catharsis with the notion of identification of the spectator, meaning a complete adhesion of the viewer to the dramatic actions and characters. Brecht reasoned that the absence of a cathartic resolution would require the audience to take political action in the real world, in order to fill the emotional gap they had experienced vicariously. This technique can be seen as early as his [[agit-prop]] play ''[[The Measures Taken]],'' and is mostly the source of his invention of an ''epic theatre'', based on a [[distancing effect]] (Verfremdungseffekt) between the viewer and the representation or portrayal of characters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht, Bertold]], "La dramaturgie non aristotélicienne", ''Théâtre épique, théâtre dialectique'', éd. Jean-Marie Valentin, Paris, Éditions de L'Arche, 1999, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=="Catharsis" before tragedy==
Catharsis before the sixth-century rise of tragedy is, for the [[Western World]], essentially a historical footnote to the Aristotelian conception. The practice of [[Ritual purification|purification]] had not yet appeared in [[Homer]], as later Greek commentators noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Walter | last = Burkert | authorlink = Walter Burkert | year = 1992 | title = The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age | page = 56 | publisher = Harvard University Press | ref=harv}} This sub-section depends largely on Burkert.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Aithiopis]]'', an [[epic (poetry)|epic]] set in the [[Epic Cycle|Trojan War cycle]], narrates the purification of [[Achilles]] after his murder of [[Thersites]]. Catharsis describes the result of measures taken to cleanse away blood-guilt—"blood is purified through blood",{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=56}} a process in the development of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] culture in which the [[Delphi|oracle of Delphi]] took a prominent role. The classic example—[[Orestes]]—belongs to tragedy, but the procedure given by [[Aeschylus]] is ancient: the blood of a sacrificed piglet is allowed to wash over the blood-polluted man, and running water washes away the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert notes parallels with a bilingual [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ritual text: "the knowledgeable specialist, the sacrificial piglet, slaughter, contact with blood, and the subsequent cleansing with water" {{harvtxt|Burkert|1992|page=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The identical ritual is represented, Burkert informs us, on a ''[[krater]]'' found at Canicattini, wherein it is shown being employed to cure the daughters of [[Proetus]] from their madness, caused by some ritual transgression.{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=57}} To the question of whether the ritual obtains [[atonement (penal substitution view)|atonement]] for the subject, or just [[healing]], Burkert answers: "To raise the question is to see the irrelevance of this distinction".{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=57}}

==Therapeutic uses==&lt;!-- 'Cathartic method' redirects here --&gt;
In [[psychology]], the term was first employed by [[Sigmund Freud]]'s colleague [[Josef Breuer]] (1842–1925), who developed a '''cathartic method'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; of treatment using [[hypnosis]] for persons suffering from intensive [[hysteria]]. While under hypnosis, Breuer's patients were able to recall [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] experiences, and through the process of expressing the original emotions that had been repressed and forgotten, they were relieved of their hysteric symptoms. Catharsis was also central to Freud's concept of [[psychoanalysis]], but he replaced hypnosis with [[Free association (psychology)|free association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Strickland | editor-first=Bonnie | editor-link=Bonnie Strickland | title=Catharsis | publisher=Gale | year=2001 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[cathexis|catharsis]]'' has also been adopted by modern [[psychotherapy]], particularly Freudian psychoanalysis, to describe the act of expressing, or more accurately, ''experiencing'' the deep emotions often associated with events in the individual's past which had originally been repressed or ignored, and had never been adequately addressed or experienced.

There has been much debate about the use of catharsis in the reduction of anger. Some scholars believe that "blowing off steam" may reduce physiological stress in the short term, but this reduction may act as a reward mechanism, reinforcing the behavior and promoting future outbursts.&lt;ref name="Bushman1999"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.76.3.367 | title = Catharsis, aggression, and persuasive influence: self-fulfilling or self-defeating prophecies? | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | date = March 1999 | first = B.

== Social catharsis ==
Emotional situations can elicit physiological, behavioral, cognitive, expressive, and subjective changes in individuals. Affected individuals often use social sharing as a cathartic release of emotions. Bernard Rimé studies the patterns of social sharing after emotional experiences. His works suggest that individuals seek social outlets in an attempt to modify the situation and restore personal homeostatic balance.

Rimé found that 80–95% of emotional episodes are shared. The affected individuals talk about the emotional experience recurrently to people around them throughout the following hours, days, or weeks. These results indicate that this response is irrespective of emotional valence, gender, education, and culture. His studies also found that social sharing of emotion increases as the intensity of the emotion increases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotion Elicits the Social Sharing of Emotion: Theory and Empirical Review|journal = Emotion Review|year=2009|issn = 1754-0739|pages = 60–85|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/1754073908097189|first = Bernard|last = Rimé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages ===
[[Émile Durkheim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The elementary forms of the religious life, a study in religious sociology | last = Durkheim | first = Émile |url = https://archive.org/details/elementaryformso00durk | publisher = George Allen &amp; Unwin | translator-first = Joseph Ward | translator-last = Swain | year = 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed emotional stages of social sharing:
# Directly after emotional effects, the emotions are shared. Through sharing, there is a reciprocal stimulation of emotions and emotional communion.
# This leads to social effects like social integration and strengthening of beliefs.
# Finally, individuals experience a renewed trust in life, strength, and self-confidence.

=== Motives ===
Affect scientists have found differences in motives for social sharing of positive and negative emotions.

'''(1) Positive emotion'''

A study by Langston&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Capitalizing on and coping with daily-life events: Expressive responses to positive events|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 1112–1125|volume = 67|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1112|first = Christopher A.|last = Langston}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that individuals share positive events to capitalize on the positive emotions they elicit. Reminiscing the positive experience augments positive affects like temporary mood and longer-term well-being. A study by Gable et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Do You Do When Things Go Right? The Intrapersonal and Interpersonal Benefits of Sharing Positive Events|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 228–245|volume = 87|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.87.2.228|first = Shelly L.|last = Gable|first2 = Harry T.|last2 = Reis|first3 = Emily A.|last3 = Impett|first4 = Evan R.|last4 = Asher|pmid=15301629}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed Langston's "capitalization" theory by demonstrating that relationship quality is enhanced when partners are responsive to positive recollections. The responsiveness increased levels of intimacy and satisfaction within the relationship. In general, the motives behind social sharing of positive events are to recall the positive emotions, inform others, and gain attention from others. All three motives are representatives of capitalization.

'''(2) Negative emotion'''

Rimé studies suggest that the motives behind social sharing of negative emotions are to vent, understand, bond, and gain social support. Negatively affected individuals often seek life meaning and emotional support to combat feelings of loneliness after a tragic event.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The grapevine effect ===
If emotions are shared socially and elicits emotion in the listener then the listener will likely share what they heard with other people. Rimé calls this process "secondary social sharing". If this repeats, it is then called "tertiary social sharing".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Collective catharsis ===
Collective emotional events share similar responses. When communities are affected by an emotional event, members repetitively share emotional experiences. After the 2001 New York and the 2004 Madrid terrorist attacks, more than 80% of respondents shared their emotional experience with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social sharing of emotion, post-traumatic growth, and emotional climate: Follow-up of Spanish citizen's response to the collective trauma of March 11th terrorist attacks in Madrid| journal = European Journal of Social Psychology| year=2009|issn = 1099-0992|pages = 1029–1045|volume = 40|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.700|first = Bernard|last = Rimé|first2 = Darío|last2 = Páez|first3 = Nekane|last3 = Basabe|first4 = Francisco|last4 = Martínez}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rimé, every sharing round elicits emotional reactivation in the sender and the receiver. This then reactivates the need to share in both. Social sharing throughout the community leads to high amounts of emotional recollection and "emotional overheating".

Pennebaker and Harber&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Social Stage Model of Collective Coping: The Loma Prieta Earthquake and The Persian Gulf War|journal = Journal of Social Issues | year = 1993 |issn = 1540-4560|pages = 125–145|volume = 49|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1993.tb01184.x|first = James W.|last = Pennebaker|first2 = Kent D.|last2 = Harber}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined three stages of collective responses to emotional events.

In the first stage, a state of "emergency" takes place in the first month after the emotional event. In this stage, there is an abundance of thoughts, talks, media coverage, and social integration based on the event.

In the second stage, the "plateau" occurs in the second month. Abundant thoughts remain, but the amount of talks, media coverage, and social integration decreases.

In the third stage, the "extinction" occurs after the second month. There is a return to normalcy.

=== Effect on emotional recovery ===
This cathartic release of emotions is often believed to be therapeutic for affected individuals. Many therapeutic mechanisms have been seen to aid in emotional recovery. One example is "interpersonal emotion regulation", in which listeners help to modify the affected individual's affective state by using certain strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Social Regulation of Emotion: An Integrative, Cross-Disciplinary Model|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=20|issue=1|pages=47–63|year=2016|issn = 1879-307X|pmid = 26564248|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2015.09.003|first = Crystal|last = Reeck|first2 = Daniel R.|last2 = Ames|first3 = Kevin N.|last3 = Ochsner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive writing is another common mechanism for catharsis. Joanne Frattaroli&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental disclosure and its moderators: A meta-analysis|journal = Psychological Bulletin|pages = 823–865|volume = 132|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.132.6.823|first = Joanne|last = Frattaroli}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a meta-analysis suggesting that written disclosure of information, thoughts, and feelings enhances mental health.

However, other studies question the benefits of social catharsis. Finkenauer and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Flashbulb memories and the underlying mechanisms of their formation: Toward an emotional-integrative model|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1998|issn = 0090-502X|pages = 516–531|volume = 26|issue = 3|doi = 10.3758/BF03201160|first = Catrin|last = Finkenauer|first2 = Olivier|last2 = Luminet|first3 = Lydia|last3 = Gisle|first4 = Abdessadek|last4 = El-Ahmadi|first5 = Martial Van Der|last5 = Linden|first6 = Pierre|last6 = Philippot|pmid=9610122}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that non-shared memories were no more emotionally triggering than shared ones. Other studies have also failed to prove that social catharsis leads to any degree of emotional recovery. Zech and Rimé&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Is talking about an emotional experience helpful? effects on emotional recovery and perceived benefits|journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy|year = 2005|issn = 1099-0879|pages = 270–287|volume = 12|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/cpp.460|first = Emmanuelle|last = Zech|first2 = Bernard|last2 = Rimé}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked participants to recall and share a negative experience with an experimenter. When compared with the control group that only discussed unemotional topics, there was no correlation between emotional sharing and emotional recovery.

Some studies even found adverse effects of social catharsis. Contrary to the Frattaroli study, Sbarra and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Expressive Writing Can Impede Emotional Recovery Following Marital Separation|url = http://cpx.sagepub.com/content/1/2/120|journal = Clinical Psychological Science|year = 2013|issn = 2167-7026|pmc = 4297672|pmid = 25606351|pages = 120–134|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/2167702612469801|first = David A.|last = Sbarra|first2 = Adriel|last2 = Boals|first3 = Ashley E.|last3 = Mason|first4 = Grace M.|last4 = Larson|first5 = Matthias R.|last5 = Mehl}}&lt;/ref&gt; found expressive writing to greatly impede emotional recovery following a marital separation. Similar findings have been published regarding trauma recovery. A group intervention technique is often used on disaster victims to prevent trauma-related disorders. However, meta-analysis showed negative effects of this cathartic "therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Single session debriefing after psychological trauma: a meta-analysis|journal = Lancet|year = 2002|issn = 0140-6736|pmid = 12241834|pages = 766–771|volume = 360|issue = 9335|doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09897-5|first = Arnold A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26147">The '''Clore Leadership Programme''' is the first initiative of its kind in the UK aimed at developing and strengthening leadership across the cultural and creative sectors. The Programme was initiated in 2003 by the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/ Clore Duffield Foundation] and is sustained by a partnership between private philanthropy and public funding. The organisation invests in individuals, drawing on their creative potential to raising the game in the arts and creative sectors.

The Programme awards its flagship Clore Fellowships annually to exceptional individuals drawn from across the UK and beyond, and runs a choice of programmes tailored to the leadership needs of arts professionals at different stages of their career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cloreleadership.org/page.aspx?p=31&lt;/ref&gt; The participants are drawn from a range of specialisms including the visual and performing arts, film and digital media, libraries, museums, archives and heritage, and cultural policy. In the last 10 years, over 250 fellowships have been awarded and nearly 1000 leaders have attended the Short Courses, enabling the participants to form a well-networked and connected arts leadership sector. Graduates of the scheme dot the salient points of the cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Arts Industry, 16 May 2008, By Simon Tait&lt;/ref&gt;

The Programme has inspired other initiatives in the UK and beyond, in particular the [http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/ Clore Social Leadership Programme].

==Background==
Initiated by the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/ Clore Duffield Foundation], and sustained by the Foundation's generous support, the Programme is the UK's first cross-disciplinary leadership programme for the cultural and creative sector. It was established as an independent organisation in 2004, after Dame [[Vivien Duffield]] had instigated research into the need for leadership training in the cultural programme.&lt;ref&gt;Arts Industry, 16 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; That research discovered that leadership development was often a question of accident rather than design, and that – without getting in the way of serendipity – it was time to put some of the design in place.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2011/dec/14/culture-leaders-clore-leadership&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the vision of its Founding Director [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]], the Programme focused initially on the Fellowship Programme, aimed at shaping creative leaders through in-depth learning, and tailored as far as possible to the needs, aspirations and circumstances of between 20 and 30 individuals a year. The structure of the Fellowship programme is based on recommendations which were made to the Clore Duffield Foundation by John Holden and [[Robert Hewison]], (see [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/cms/user_files/files/CLP%20Task%20Force%20Final%20Report%20Full.pdf their report]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, and the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/cms/user_files/files/CLP%20Task%20Force%20Final%20Report%20Summary.pdf Executive Summary]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}). The course is unique outside the US, and includes workshops and residential courses, an extended placement, individually-selected training, mentoring and coaching, as well as opportunities for research and the development of skills.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was first established, the Clore Leadership Programme has been a pioneer in leadership development, a source of expert advice and an inspirational example for other initiatives in the UK and beyond, including the [http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/ Clore Social Leadership Programme].

Developments in the Programme since 2004 have included:

•	Intensive fortnight-long residential Short Courses

•	A Board Development programme, to strengthen governance in the cultural sector

•	The extension of the Fellowships to a small number of international participants

•	One- and two-day follow-up courses (Clore Plus)

•	An association with the University of Hong Kong to create Asia’s first Advanced Cultural Leadership Programme 
 
•	One-week courses for Emerging Leaders

•	The creation of consortia of large-scale national cultural organisations, to support the Fellowship programme

•	The introduction of leadership development days, run in partnership with other organisations

==Founders==
The founding Director of the Clore Leadership Programme was [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]], who from 1997–2001 had been Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.  In July 2008 he stepped down and was succeeded as Director by Sue Hoyle. The current Chair is [[Sandy Nairne]], former Director of the National Portrait Gallery.

==Courses==
From freelancers, entrepreneurs to heads of established institutions, the Clore Leadership Programme nurtures dynamic and diverse leaders. Each year, the Programme awards fellowships and designs programmes tailored to the varied leadership needs of arts professionals at different stages of their career. These include awarding the Clore Fellowship (annually), and running four residential Short Courses (each runs for a fortnight), an Emerging Leaders’ Course (a week’s residential programme) and a number of Clore Plus days (follow-up courses for those who have been through the various programmes at Clore). The Programme also works in partnership with others to deliver leadership development days.

===The Clore Fellowship Programme===

The flagship [http://www.cloreleadership.org/fellowships.aspx Clore Fellowship] is offered to arts and creative industries’ practitioners drawn primarily from the UK. The Fellowship spans a year of intense activity, and includes residential courses, group workshops, projects, and a customised programme of personal and professional development. Each Fellow embarks on a programme of tuition, research, training and secondment, tailored to their specific cultural sector, interests and aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 19 Jan 2008, By Peter Aspden&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main features that distinguishes Clore from other leadership programmes is the cross-cultural element. People doing the programme are drawn from the arts and culture sector in its widest sense, and Fellows are seconded to other cultural organisations rather than other libraries or organizations similar to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Impact, Journal of Career Development Group | Summer 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clore Leadership Programme offers a number of [http://www.cloreleadership.org/page.aspx?p=53 International Fellowships] to exceptional individuals from prioritised countries outside the UK. These include Chevening Scholarships on the Clore Leadership Programme funded by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office in countries such as India, China, Jordan and Egypt, and the Hong Kong Scholarships on the Clore Leadership Programme funded by the [http://www.hab.gov.hk/ Home Affairs Bureau] of the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

The Clore Duffield Foundation supports the core costs of the Fellowship programme. Individual fellowships are supported by a range of public funders, philanthropic foundations, Consortia partners  and international partners, and are awarded to 25 and individual participants every year. The Programme also  occasionally accepts self-funded Fellowships.

===Short Course on Cultural Leadership===
[http://www.cloreleadership.org/short-courses.aspx Short Courses] offer numerous opportunities every year for ambitious and creative individuals to undergo a two-week intensive residential training course structured to deliver essential knowledge and skills required by cultural leaders today. The Short Course Programme is supported by [http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ Arts Council England], through a three-year commissioned grant to develop resilient leadership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cloreleadership.org/short-courses.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emerging Leaders’ Course===
The [http://www.cloreleadership.org/page.aspx?p=36 Emerging Leaders Programme] is a 5-day residential course aimed at people in the early stages of their career. This Programme is funded by [http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ Arts Council England] through a commissioned grant to develop resilient leadership.

==Partners==

==Impact and Alumni==

The Clore Fellows and course participants have gone from strength to strength, steering new projects, establishing innovative arts organisations, enabling higher growth and assuming key leadership positions in the arts sectors all over the world. The results have been extraordinarily successful — Clore graduates are now in top jobs at the likes of the Royal Academy and the Arts Council.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt; Innumerable cultural leaders from the UK and abroad have walked through its doors and on to better jobs, including Gavin Reid, previously a trumpet player, who since undertaking the programme is now Director of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/observations-clore-leadership-programme-provides-a-step-up-for-future-royal-ballet-supremos-1764846.html&lt;/ref&gt; The programme is rooted in the belief that organisations which deliberately foster leadership and support their future leaders, do better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalartsmanager.com/2014/05/22/wheres-next-generation-music-leaders/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529214430/http://www.internationalartsmanager.com/2014/05/22/wheres-next-generation-music-leaders/ |archivedate=2014-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other luminaries include Axel Rüger, formerly Curator of Dutch Paintings for the National Gallery, who has made the leap to Director of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam while Moira Sinclair, previously Director of Vital Arts, an arts and health initiative, is now Executive Director, Arts Council London.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/observations-clore-leadership-programme-provides-a-step-up-for-future-royal-ballet-supremos-1764846.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is predicted that their expertise will  play a major role in helping the arts weather the stormy years ahead.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clore Leadership Programme draws on the creative potential of leaders to raise the game in the arts and creative sectors. The idea behind initiating the Programme was to transform the cultural sector as a whole through the actions of emerging leaders and the work they do, both individually and collaboratively. As [[Nick Merriman]],  Director, Manchester Museum, University of Manchester, said:  “It (Clore Leadership Programme) has helped everyone take investment in leadership much more seriously and to think realistically about succession planning.” &lt;ref&gt;Museums Journal, June 2013, by John Holt&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside leadership development, the Programme has also had a positive impact on the sustainability of the entire sector  and is seen to have been a key player in “a silent revolution in the arts in Britain, where they are now incomparably better managed than they’ve ever been before.” &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;  “Thirty years ago, when faced with severe cuts, the sector almost collapsed. This is not the case now and that reflects the quality of the leadership we have. Clore has been a key part of that," said Mark Taylor, Director of the Museums Association.&lt;ref&gt;Museums Journal, June 2013, by John Holt&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clore Leadership Programme has not only succeeded in creating a cadre of creative and cultural leaders,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artsprofessional.co.uk/magazine/270/article/generous-leadership&lt;/ref&gt; but has stimulated investment in leadership on the part of governments, agencies, foundations and charities. The Programme has inspired other initiatives in the UK and beyond, including the Clore Social Leadership Programme for leaders from the social sector, Asia’s first [http://www.culture.hku.hk/ Advanced Cultural Leadership Programme] in Hong Kong, and a capacity-building course for arts managers in South Asia ([http://www.arthinksouthasia.org/ ARThink South Asia Fellowship]) created by a graduate of the Clore Programme.

__toc__
Even if the main role of clothing is to protect from the cold, [[protective clothing]] also exists to protect from heat, such as for metallurgical workers or firemen. As regards thermal comfort, only the first case is considered.

== Mechanisms of insulation ==

There are three kinds of [[heat transfer]]: [[thermal conduction|conduction]] (exchange of heat through contact), [[convection]] (movement of fluids), and [[thermal radiation|radiation]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Air has a low [[thermal conductivity]] but is very mobile. There are thus two elements that are important in protecting from the cold{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}:

* stopping the wind from penetrating and replacing the layer of warm air close to the body;{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* setting up a layer of still air which serves as insulation, by the use of [[fibre]]s ([[wool]], [[fur]], et cetera).{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Another important factor is [[humidity]]. Water is a better conductor of heat than air, thus if clothes are damp — because of [[sweat]], rain, or immersion — water replaces some or all of the air between the fibres of the clothing, causing thermal loss through conduction and/or evaporation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Thermal insulation is thus optimal with three layers of clothing:
* a layer near the body for hygiene (changed more often than the other clothing), whose role is to get rid of sweat so it does not remain in contact with the skin;{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* an outer close-knit or closely woven layer as a [[wind breaker]], usually thin — if there is a risk of precipitation this should be impermeable, the ideal being a textile that stops water droplets but allows water vapor to pass so as to remove evaporated sweat (a textile of this sort is said to "breathe");{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* and between the two, a "thick" layer that traps the air and prevents contact between the skin and the wind-breaking layer (which, as it is thin, gets close to the ambient temperature).{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The three layers of air between the skin and the exterior layer also play an insulating role. If the clothing is squeezed tight (as by the straps of a backpack), insulation will be poorer in those places.&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix

== Units and measurement ==

Clothing insulation may be expressed in '''clo''' units.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Fundamentals"&gt;Thermal Comfort chapter, Fundamentals volume of the ''[[ASHRAE Handbook]]'', [[ASHRAE]], Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The clo has the same [[Dimensional analysis|dimensions]] as the [[R-value (insulation)|R value]] used to describe insulation used in residential and commercial construction.  The clo value is also similar in magnitude to the R value:
: 1 clo = 0.155 [[kelvin|K]]·[[square metre|m²]]·[[watt|W⁻¹]] ≈ 0.88 R (where R means [[Foot (length)|ft]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·[[Fahrenheit|°F]]·[[Hour|hr]]/[[British thermal unit|Btu]])
This is the amount of insulation that allows a person at rest to maintain thermal equilibrium in an environment at 21[[°C]] (70[[°F]]) in a normally ventilated room (0.1&amp;nbsp;m/s air movement).

There are a number of ways to determine clothing insulation provided by clothes, but the most accurate according to [[ASHRAE]] Fundamentals are measurements on [[Thermal manikin|heated manikins]] and on active subjects. Equations may then be used to calculate the thermal insulation.
Because clothing insulation cannot be measured for most routine engineering applications, tables of measured values for various clothing ensembles can be used.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Fundamentals" /&gt;
According to ASHRAE-55 2010 standard, there are three methods for estimating clothing insulation using the tables provided.
* If the ensemble in question matches reasonably well with one on [[Clothing insulation#Clothing ensembles and garments|Table 1]], the indicated value of intrinsic clothing insulation can be used;
* It is acceptable to add or subtract garments on [[Clothing insulation#Clothing ensembles and garments|Table 2]] from the ensembles in [[Clothing insulation#Clothing ensembles and garments|Table 1]] to estimate the insulation of ensembles that differ in garment composition;
* It is possible to define a complete clothing ensemble as a combination of individual garments using [[Clothing insulation#Clothing ensembles and garments|Table 2]].&lt;ref name="Ashrae 55 Standard"/&gt;

Another unit which is used is the "'''[[tog (unit)|tog]]'''":
: 1 tog = 0.1 [[kelvin|K]]·[[square metre|m²]]·[[watt|W⁻¹]] ≈ 0.645 clo
: 1 clo = 1.55 togs
The word "togs" is a British slang term for clothes.&lt;ref name=tog&gt;

== Further considerations and examples ==

Other factors that influence the clothing insulation are posture and activity. Sitting or lying change the thermal insulation due to the compression of air layers in the clothing, but at the same time - depending on the materials that are made of - chairs and bedding can provide considerable insulation. While it is possible to determine the increase of insulation provided by chairs, sleeping or resting situations are more difficult to evaluate unless the individual is completely immobile.&lt;ref name="Ashrae 55 Standard"/&gt;
Body motion decreases the insulation of a clothing ensemble by pumping air through clothing openings and/or causing air motion within the clothing. This effect varies considerably depending on the nature of the motion and of the clothing. Accurate estimates of clothing insulation for an active person are therefore not available, unless measurements are made for the specific condition (e.g., with a walking manikin).
A rough estimate of the clothing insulation for an active person is:

I&lt;sub&gt;cl, active&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt; ×(0.6+0.4/M)         1.2 met &lt; M &lt; 2.0 met

where M is the metabolic rate in met units and I&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt; is the insulation without activity. For metabolic rates less than or equal to 1.2 met, no adjustment is recommended.&lt;ref name="Ashrae 55 Standard"/&gt;

Clothing insulation is correlated with outdoor air temperature, indoor operative temperatures, relative humidity and also by the presence of a dress code in the environment in question.
Recent studies have developed dynamic predictive clothing insulation models that allow more precise thermal comfort calculation, energy simulation, HVAC sizing and building operation than previous practice. As a matter of fact, usually simplifications are used (0.5 clo in the summer, 1.0 in the winter). This may lead to systems that are incorrectly sized and/or operated. A model that is able to predict how building occupants change their clothing would greatly improve HVAC system operation.&lt;ref name="Schiavon &amp; Lee, 2012"/&gt;

As mentioned, clothing adaptation has an important role in achieving thermal comfort and is probably the most effective adjustment that occupants can make to adapt themselves in a thermal environment. Moreover, clothing variability may also depend on factors unrelated to thermal conditions, such as for a dress code or social influences, style preferences that may differ due to gender or work position. According to ASHRAE-55 standard, only if individuals are freely making adjustments in clothing to suit their thermal preferences, it is acceptable to use a single representative average value for everyone.&lt;ref name="Ashrae 55 Standard"/&gt;

Some basic insulation values can be considered as examples of typical conditions&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130607022244/http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/studentdownloads/DEA3500pdfs/Thermcomfort.pdf Notes for course "Human Factors: Ambient Environment"] by Prof. Alan Hedge, [[Cornell University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temperature of thermal equilibrium ==

The ambient temperature at which someone's body will be at thermal equilibrium depends on the rate of heat generation per unit area ''P'' and the [[thermal insulance]] of the clothing ''R''. The empirical formula is:&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix

In fiction, '''continuity''' is consistency of the characteristics of people, plot, objects, and places seen by the reader or viewer over some period of time. It is relevant to several media.

Continuity is particularly a concern in the production of film and television due to the difficulty of rectifying an error in continuity after shooting has wrapped up. It also applies to other art forms, including novels, comics, and [[video games]], though usually on a smaller scale.  It also applies to fiction used by persons, corporations, and governments in the public eye.

Most productions have a [[script supervisor]] on hand whose job is to pay attention to and attempt to maintain continuity across the chaotic and typically non-linear production shoot. This takes the form of a large amount of paperwork, photographs, and attention to and memory of large quantities of detail, some of which is sometimes assembled into the [[Bible (writing)|story bible]] for the production. It usually regards factors both within the scene and often even technical details including meticulous records of camera positioning and equipment settings. The use of a [[Polaroid camera]] was standard but has since been replaced by [[digital camera]]s. All of this is done so that, ideally, all related shots can match, despite perhaps parts being shot thousands of miles and several months apart. It is an inconspicuous job because if done perfectly, no one will ever notice.
 
In comic books, continuity has also come to mean a [[canon (fiction)|set of contiguous events]], sometimes said to be "set in the same [[fictional universe|universe]]."

==Continuity errors==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Futurama]] --&gt;
Most continuity errors are subtle and minor, such as changes in the level of drink in a character's glass or the length of a cigarette, and can be permitted with relative indifference even to the final cut. Others can be more noticeable, such as sudden drastic changes in appearance of a character. Such errors in continuity can ruin the illusion of realism and affect [[suspension of disbelief]].

In cinema, special attention must be paid to continuity because films are rarely shot in the order in which they are presented. The shooting schedule is often dictated by location permit issues. For example, a character may return to [[Times Square]] in New York City several times throughout a movie, but as it is extraordinarily expensive to close off Times Square, those scenes will likely be filmed all at once to reduce permit costs. Weather, the ambience of natural light, cast and crew availability, or any number of other circumstances can also influence a shooting schedule.

=== {{anchor|Attempts to prevent continuity errors in film}} Measures against continuity errors in film ===

Film production companies use various techniques to prevent continuity errors. First would be to film all the shots for a particular scene together, and all shots of consecutive scenes together (if the scenes take place together, with no break between them in the film's timeline). This allows actors to remain in costume, in character, and in the same location (and with the same weather, if shooting on location).

The second major technique is for costume designers, production designers, prop masters, and make-up artists to take instant photographs of actors and sets at the beginning and end of each day's shooting (once made possible by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] cameras, now done with digital cameras and cell phones as well). This allows the various workers to check each day's clothing, set, props, and make-up against a previous day's.

The third is to avoid shooting on location entirely, but instead film everything on a studio set. This allows weather and lighting to be controlled (as the shooting is indoors), and for all clothing and sets to be stored in one place to be hauled out the next day from a secure location.

===Editing errors===
Editing errors can occur when a character in a scene references a scene or incident that has not occurred yet, or of which they should not yet be aware.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

An example of an editing error can be seen in the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), where a scene of people climbing a slope at the start is seen from below and then replayed from above.

===Visual errors===
Visual errors are instant ''discontinuities'' occurring in visual media such as film and television. Items of clothing change colors, shadows get longer or shorter, items within a scene change place or disappear, etc.

One of the earliest examples of a ''visual error'' appears in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[1914 in film|1914]] movie ''[[The Property Man]]''. Here, in a supposedly smooth step from one room to another, [[the Tramp]] loses his hat in one room, but it is instantly back on his head as he enters the next room. Rather "loose" plots and a lack of [[continuity editing]] made most early films rife with such errors.

Another example occurs in the [[1998 in film|1998]] film ''[[Waking Ned]]'', when two of the film's characters, Jackie and Michael, are walking through a storm towards Ned's house. The umbrella they are under is black during their conversation as they walk towards the house (filmed from slightly above and to the front), yet after cutting to a lower shot (filmed from behind Jackie), Michael walks onscreen from the right holding an [[umbrella]] that is not black but beige, with a brown band at the rim.

Yet another glaring example of poor continuity occurs in the Disney film ''[[Pete’s Dragon]]'' (filmed in 1976). During the song "Brazzle Dazzle Day" when Lampie (Mickey Rooney), Pete (Sean Marshall), and Nora (Helen Reddy) climb the stairs to the top of the lighthouse, Pete's shirt beneath his overalls is orange. But after descending to the bottom again and coming out of the lighthouse door, his shirt is now grey.

Though visual continuity errors are logically confined to visual media, parallel mistakes can occur in text. In "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]" in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', a door is ripped off its hinges only to be slowly closed again in the next scene.

===Plot errors===
{{main|Plot hole}}

A plot error, or a plot hole as it's commonly known, reflects a failure in the consistency of the created fictional world. A character might state he was an only child, yet later mention a sibling. In the TV show ''[[Cheers]]'', Frasier Crane's wife Lilith mentions Frasier's parents are both dead. When the character was spun off into ''[[Frasier]]'', his father became a central character with, in a case of [[retroactive continuity]], the explanation that Frasier was embarrassed about his father's lowbrow attitudes and thus claimed his death. This is a frequent occurrence in sitcoms, where networks may agree to continue a show, but only if a certain character is emphasized, leading other minor characters to written out of the show with no further mention of the character's existence, while the emphasized character (usually a [[breakout character]], as in the case of [[Frasier Crane]]) develops a more complete back story that ignores previous, more simplified back stories.

===Homeric Nod===
{{Wiktionary|Homer nods}}
A '''Homeric nod''' (sometimes heard as 'Even Homer nods') is a continuity error. It has its origins in [[Homer]]ic [[epic poetry|epic]].

The [[proverbial phrase]] for it was coined by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars poetica]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Lines 358-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''... et idem'' &lt;br /&gt; ''indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... and yet I also become annoyed whenever the great Homer [[wikt:nod|nod]]s off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are numerous continuity errors in Homer that resemble "nods", as for example:

*In ''[[Iliad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Book V Lines 576-579&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menelaos]] kills a minor character, Pylaimenes, in combat; who is later&lt;ref&gt;Book XIII Lines 643-659&lt;/ref&gt; still alive to witness the death of his son.
*In ''Iliad'' 9.165-93 three characters, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoinix]], [[Odysseus]], and [[Telamonian Aias|Aias]] set out on an embassy to [[Achilleus]]; however, at line 182 the poet uses a verb in the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form to indicate that there are only two people going; at lines 185ff. verbs in the [[plural]] form are used, indicating more than two; but another dual verb appears at line 192 ("the two of them came forward").

In modern [[Homeric scholarship]] many of Homer's "nods" are explicable as the consequences of the poem being retold and improvised by generations of oral poets. So in the second case cited above, it is likely that two different versions are being conflated: one version with an embassy of three people, another with just two people.

[[Alexander Pope]] was inclined to give Homeric nods the benefit of the doubt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those oft are Stratagems which Errors seem,&lt;br /&gt;Nor is it Homer Nods, but We that Dream. - ''[[Essay on Criticism]]'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Modern usage====
In his online column, ''Best of The Web Today'', [[James Taranto]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' often used the phrase "Homer Nods" as the title of a retraction or correction.

===Aging discrepancies===
The practice of accelerating the age of a television character (usually a child or teenager) in conflict with the timeline of a series and/or the real-world progression of time is popularly known as [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome]], or SORAS.&lt;ref name="Rising Stars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3215940&amp;fSectionId=434&amp;fSetId=204 |title=Soaps' rising stars |first=Kim |last=Clayton-Millar |date=April 24, 2006 |work=Tonight |publisher=Independent News &amp; Media |accessdate=December 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children unseen on screen for a time might reappear portrayed by an actor several years older than the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=S. Elizabeth |title=The Audience in Everyday Life: Living in a Media World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtkAqUHwtrIC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=%22soap+opera+sudden+aging+syndrome%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IrVYVYSWxl&amp;sig=dKEAjt43NsvvEgea73UF-lIt1zw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V0sjS6SHCIj-nAeZ9JzuCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22soap%20opera%20sudden%20aging%20syndrome%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 12, 2009 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-94259-4 |page=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually coinciding with a recast, this rapid aging is typically done to open up the character to a wider range of storylines, and to attract younger viewers.&lt;ref name="Rising Stars"/&gt; A recent example of this occurring is in the BBC's ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' series, in which Mordred is initially played by a young child in Season 4, yet suddenly grows up into his late teens in time for the start of Season 5, with the rest of the characters aging by only three years.

The reverse can also happen. On ''[[Lost (TV Series)]]'', the character of 10-year-old [[Walt Lloyd]] was played by 12-year-old [[Malcolm David Kelley]]. The first few seasons took place over the course of just a few months, but by that point Lloyd looked much older than 10. In his remaining few appearances, special effects were used to make him look younger, or the scene took place years later.

==Deliberate continuity errors==

Sometimes a work of fiction may deliberately employ continuity errors, usually for comedy. For example, the [[Marx Brothers]]' classic film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', at the climax of the film, the camera shows a [[shot (filmmaking)|shot]] of [[Groucho Marx]] speaking a line, followed by a shot of something else happening, followed by another shot of Groucho. Each time, Groucho's hat changes, usually to something more outrageous than before (a [[Napoleon]]ic hat, a [[Prussia]]n hat, etc.).

==Dealing with errors==
When continuity mistakes have been made, explanations are often proposed by either writers or fans to smooth over discrepancies. Fans sometimes make up explanations for such errors that may or may not be integrated into [[canon (fiction)|canon]]; this has come to be colloquially known as ''fanwanking'' (a term originally coined by the author [[Craig Hinton]] to describe excessive use of continuity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=AHistory: An Unauthorized History of the ''Doctor Who'' universe |last=Parkin |first=Lance |authorlink=Lance Parkin  |year=2007 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]] |location=Des Moines, Iowa |isbn=978-0-9759446-6-0 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often when fans do not agree with one of the events in a story (such as the death of a favorite character), they will choose to ignore the event in question so that their enjoyment of the franchise is not diminished. When the holder of the intellectual property discards all existing continuity and starts from scratch it is known as [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooting]]. Fans call a less extreme literary technique that erases one episode the [[reset button technique|reset button]]. See also [[Canon (fiction)#Fanon|fanon]].

Discrepancies in past continuity are sometimes made deliberately; this is known as [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ning. Retcons are also sometimes used to either correct or cover up a perceived error. These changes may be made either by the same writer who made it, or more commonly by an author that has taken over the creative lead of a corporate owned show or publication.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Not to be confused with the continuance of a reality (continuality).

==Real time programs vs traditional films==
Television programs like ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', in which actors have to appear as if it is the same day for 24 consecutive episodes, have raised public recognition of continuity. However, traditional films have frequently had much of the same sort of the issues to deal with; film shoots may last several months and as scenes are frequently shot out of story sequence, footage shot weeks apart may be edited together as part of the same day's action in the completed film. In some ways, ''24'' presents a simpler situation, as costumes and hairstyles generally should ''not'' change very frequently; in many feature films a range of different hairstyles and costumes must be created, changed, and then recreated exactly, as various scenes are shot.

The '''Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage''' is a [[UNESCO]] [[multilateral treaty|treaty]] adopted by the UNESCO General Conference on 17 October 2003. The convention entered into force in 2006, after thirtieth instruments of ratification by UNESCO Member States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2018, 178 states have ratified, approved or accepted the convention.&lt;ref name = ratifications&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=17116&amp;language=E States Parties to the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

===Layout of the Convention===
The Convention contains following provisions:

I. General Provisions

II.  Organs of the Convention

III.  Safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage at the national level

IV. Safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage at the international level

V.  International cooperation and assistance

VI.  Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund

VII.  Reports

VIII.  Transitional clause

IX.  Final clauses

===Purposes of the Convention===

Unlike other UNESCO conventions, this convention begins with stating its purposes, which are;
{{quote|(a)	to safeguard the intangible cultural heritage;
(b)	to ensure respect for the intangible cultural heritage of the communities, groups and individuals concerned;

(c)	to raise awareness at the local, national and international levels of the importance of the intangible cultural heritage, and of ensuring mutual appreciation thereof;
(d)	to provide for international cooperation and assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Definition===
{{Main|Intangible cultural heritage}}

Intangible cultural heritage refers to "traditions or living expressions inherited from our ancestors and passed on to our descendants, such as oral traditions, performing arts, social practices, rituals, festive events, knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe or the knowledge and skills to produce traditional crafts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01851-EN.pdf What is Intangible Cultural Heritage] p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention defines it as follows:

{{quote|Intangible Cultural Heritage means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, and skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention, consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 2
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Function===
The Convention works on both national and international levels.
At the national level, State Parties are supposed to ‘take necessary measures to ensure the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage present in its territory.” These measures include identification of the intangible cultural heritage that exists in its territory, adoption of appropriate policies, promotion of education and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 11&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, in taking these measures, each state parties must “endeavor to ensure the widest possible participation of communities, groups, and, where appropriate, individuals that create, maintain and transmit such heritage, and to involve them actively in its management”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 15&lt;/ref&gt;

At the international level, this Convention promotes international cooperation, which includes “the exchange of information and experience, joint initiatives, and the establishment of a mechanism of assistance” to other State Parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lists'''

The Committee to the Convention publishes and keeps up to date two lists of intangible cultural heritage, which are
*the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]]
*the [[List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 16,17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund'''

The Convention establishes Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund, the use of which is decided by the Committee. The fund mainly consists of the contributions by State Parties and funds by the General Conference of UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===
One of the first international occasions that mentioned the preservation of 'intangible heritage' was the World Conference on Cultural Policies in Mexico City in 1982.&lt;ref name="Working towards the 2003 Convention"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention] p.6&lt;/ref&gt; This Conference defined cultural heritage as including “both tangible and intangible works through which the creativity of people finds expression,” and asked UNESCO and Member States to take measures for protecting this kind of heritage.&lt;ref name="Working towards the 2003 Convention"/&gt;

In 1989, UNESCO adopted the Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore as the first legal instrument towards the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention] p.7&lt;/ref&gt; This Recommendation reflected the ideas of the earlier Conference in Mexico City. UNESCO conducted some promotional programs for raising awareness of this Recommendation, but was not very successful.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; However, in the late 90's, there was a conference held for the assessment of this Recommendation, which pointed out some problems to be considered in drafting the Convention. In this sense, this Recommendation served as an important step.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention] p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, UNESCO launched the program of Proclamation of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, intending to raise awareness of the importance of intangible heritage. This program proclaimed a total of 90 masterpieces between 2001 and 2005, and caused the movement toward the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00103 Proclamation of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity (2001–2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation===

According to the request of Member States, a preliminary study, undertaken by Director-General, on how could the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage be conducted, recommended to create a new document that set an international standard.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2001, the General Conference adopted another instrument, [[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity]], which also includes articles dealing with the preservation of ’heritage in all forms’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13179&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity] Article 7&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration and its Action Plan presented basic idea of the coming convention and helped to develop it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of many meetings for two years, the draft Convention was brought into the General Conference and adopted in 2003.

==Criticism==
*The definition of intangible cultural heritage has been criticized as potentially incomplete. For example, in a 2004 article in ''[[Museum International]]'', [[Richard Kurin]] says that because the Convention does not recognize cultural activities not compatible with international human rights instruments, some activities, such as [[female genital mutilation]], that groups may themselves consider critical to their culture, are not eligible. Similarly, Kurin notes that since many group's culture is defined in opposition to other cultures, the requirement for "mutual respect" may leave out traditional songs and stories that glorify "empire, victorious kings, religious conversion, or alternatively resistance to perceived injustice, martyrdom and defeat".&lt;ref name=Kurin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurin|first=Richard|title=Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage in the 2003 UNESCO Convention: a critical appraisal|journal=Museum International|date=1 May 2004|volume=56|issue=1–2|pages=66–77|doi=10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kurin also notes that the definition can be more expansive than intended by its designers, who originally planned only to protect "traditional cultural activities". He says that it is robust enough to encompass more modern forms of culture, including things like "[[rap music]], [[Australian cricket]], modern dance, post-modernist architectural knowledge, and [[karaoke bars]]".&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt;
*Richard Kurin has argued that dividing culture into individual units is inconsistent with modern academic views of cultures.&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt; Additionally, Michael Brown has argued that Convention's focus on cataloging is based on an outdated belief that listing the details of a culture has some connection to preservation of that culture.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Michael F.|title=Heritage Trouble: Recent Work on the Protection of Intangible Cultural Property|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2005|volume=12|issue=01|doi=10.1017/S0940739105050010|url=http://lanfiles.williams.edu/~mbrown/Brown,%20Heritage%20Trouble,%20IJCP,%202005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; States are also encouraged to enact programs to safeguard intangible cultural heritages, though any such work must be done in cooperation with the local practitioners. This aspect has also been criticized, since it is unclear how a state can safeguard a cultural practice by force, particularly if there is insufficient interest from local practitioners.&lt;ref name =Kurin/&gt;

'''Cultural assimilation''' is the process in which a [[minority group]] or [[culture]] comes to resemble those of a dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Boyer |first1=P |title=Cultural Assimilation |journal=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences |date=2001 |pages=3032–3035 |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/00364-8|isbn=9780080430768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is used to refer to both individuals and groups; the latter case can refer to a range of social groups, including [[ethnic minorities]], [[immigrants]], [[indigenous peoples]], and other marginalized groups such as [[sexual minorities]] who adapt to being culturally dominated by another societal group.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Cultural assimilation may involve either a quick or a gradual change depending on circumstances of the group. Full assimilation occurs when members of a society become indistinguishable from those of the dominant group. 

Whether it is desirable for a given group to assimilate is often disputed by both members of the group and those of the dominant society. Cultural assimilation does not guarantee social alikeness.

though as this article states, geographical and other natural barriers between cultures even if started by the same dominant culture will be culturally different.&lt;ref&gt;Parisi, Domenico, Federico Cecconi, and Francesco Natale. "Cultural change in spatial environments: the role of cultural assimilation and internal changes in cultures." ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'' 47.2 (2003): 163–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A place, state, or ethnicity can spontaneously adopt a different culture because of its political relevance or its perceived cultural superiority. An example is the [[Latin]] language and [[Roman culture]] being gradually adopted by most of the people subjugated by [[Ancient Rome]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Cultural assimilation can happen either spontaneously or forcibly (''see [[forced assimilation]]''). A culture can spontaneously adopt a different culture. Also, older, richer, or otherwise more dominant cultures can forcibly absorb subordinate cultures.

The term assimilation is often used with regard to not only indigenous groups but also immigrants settled in a new land. A new culture and new attitudes toward the origin culture are obtained through contact and communication. Assimilation assumes that a relatively-tenuous culture gets to be united to one unified culture. That process happens by contact and accommodation between each culture. The current definition of assimilation is usually used to refer to immigrants, but in [[multiculturalism]], cultural assimilation can happen all over the world and within varying social contexts and is not limited to specific areas. For example, a shared language gives people the chance to study and work internationally, without being limited to the same cultural group. People from different countries contribute to diversity and form the "global culture" which means the culture combined by the elements from different countries. That "global culture" can be seen as a part of assimilation, which causes cultures from different areas to affect one another.

== Immigrant assimilation ==
Immigrant assimilation is a complex process in which immigrants not only fully integrate themselves into a new country but also lose aspects, perhaps even all of their heritage. Social scientists rely on four primary benchmarks to assess immigrant assimilation: [[socioeconomic status]], geographic distribution, [[second language]] attainment, and [[exogamy|intermarriage]].&lt;ref name="Waters" /&gt;  William A.V. Clark defines immigrant assimilation as "a way of understanding the social dynamics of American society and that it is the process that occurs spontaneously and often unintended in the course of interaction between majority and [[minority groups]]."&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=W. |year=2003 |title=Immigrants and the American Dream: Remaking the Middle Class |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-880-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Americanization (immigration)}}

Between 1880 and 1920, the United States took in roughly 24 million immigrants.&lt;ref name="Waters"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Waters |first=Mary C. |last2=Jiménez |first2=Tomás R. |title=Assessing Immigrant Assimilation: New Empirical and Theoretical Challenges |journal=[[Annual Review of Sociology]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=105–125 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100026 |url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3203280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This increase in immigration can be attributed to many historical changes. The beginning of the 21st century has also marked a massive era of immigration, and sociologists are once again trying to make sense of the impacts that immigration has on society and on the on immigrants themselves.&lt;ref name="Waters"/&gt;

Assimilation had various meanings in American sociology. [[Henry Pratt Fairchild]] associates American assimilation with Americanization or the ''[[melting pot]]'' theory. Some scholars also believed that assimilation and acculturation were synonymous. According to a common point of view, assimilation is a "process of interpretation and fusion" from another group or person. That may include memories, behaviors and sentiments. By sharing their experiences and histories, they blend into the common cultural life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/ecology-and-environmentalism/environmental-studies/assimilation|title=Assimilation facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Assimilation|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long history of immigration in the established gateways means that the place of immigrants in terms of [[social class|class]], [[race (classification of human beings)|racial]], and [[ethnic]] hierarchies in the traditional gateways are more structured or established, but on the other hand, the new gateways do not have much immigration [[history]] and so the place of immigrants in terms of class, racial, and ethnic hierarchies is less defined, and immigrants may have more influence to define their position. Secondly, the size of new gateways may influence immigrant assimilation. Having a smaller gateway may influence the level of [[racial segregation]] among immigrants and native-born people. Thirdly, the difference in institutional arrangements may influence immigrant assimilation. Traditional gateways, unlike new gateways, have many institutions set up to help immigrants such as legal aid, bureaus, social organizations. Finally, Waters and Jimenez have only speculated that those differences may influence immigrant assimilation and the way researchers that should assess immigrant assimilation.&lt;ref name="Waters"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6975">[[Cultural identity]] refers to a person's sense of belonging to a particular [[culture]] or group.  This process involves learning about and accepting [[traditions]], [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[language]], [[religion]], [[ancestry]], [[aesthetics]], thinking patterns, and [[social structure]]s of a culture.  Normally, people internalize the beliefs, values, norms, and social practices of their culture and identify themselves with that culture.  The culture becomes a part of their [[self-concept]] (Lustig, 2013).  However, some studies have noted that existing cultural identity theory may not account for the fact that different individuals and groups may not react to or interpret events, happenings, attitudes, etc. in the same ways as other individuals or groups.

Myron Lustig notes that cultural identities are central to a person’s sense of self.  That is because cultural identities “are central, dynamic, and multifaceted components of one’s self concept” (Lustig, 133).  Lustig also points out that cultural identities are dynamic, and they exist within a changing social context.  As a result, a person’s identity changes as do one’s ongoing experiences in life (Lustig, 135).  Other researchers describe cultural identity as referring to the content of values as guiding principles, to meaningful symbols, and to life styles that individuals share with others, though not necessarily within recognizable groups (Boski et al., 2004).  In addition, Boski et al. point out that most books and studies have ignored cultural identity as a theoretical construct in the field of [[cross-cultural psychology]].  Instead, books and journals report works on the theme of social identity.  [[Social identity]] is described as a sense of “We-ness,” or attachment to a group that one is a member of, and by comparison to others.  The sense of “We-ness” remains culturally empty, however.  Even with natural groups, it is portrayed in trait-attributes, “which is not different from those used to characterize individuals” (Boski et al., 2004).  There is, however, research evidence about the social (ethnic) vs. cultural distinction (Sanchez-Burks et al., 2000).  This study found that the task-oriented cultural style was generally more favored than the task-plus interpersonal alternative, particularly among Anglo-American participants, for whom ethnicity did not matter.  Mexican and Latino participants, however, showed some degree of favoritism toward ethnically similar participants (Sanchez-Burks et all, 2000).

It seems that there are different viewpoints regarding cultural and social identities.  Cultural identity is defined as the identity of a group or culture or of an individual as far as one is influenced by one’s belonging to a group or culture.  Further, Cultural identity is similar to, and overlaps with, [[identity politics]].  New forms of identification have been suggested to break down the understanding of the individual as a whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers.  Such identifiers can result from various conditions including: location, gender, race, history, nationality, language, sexuality, religious beliefs, ethnicity, aesthetics, and even food.  In places like the U.S. and Canada, where the people are ethnically diverse, social unity is primarily based on common social values and beliefs.  However, some critics of cultural identity declare that cultural identity based upon difference is a divisive force in society.  In addition, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the social norms as presented by the media.  Therefore, instead of learning behavior and knowledge from cultural or religious groups, people may be learning social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity.  Language may also be an important factor in culture identity.  The communication that comes with sharing a language promotes connections and roots to ancestors and cultural histories.

	When young people are severed from the ideals and positively sanctioned statuses, feelings of alienation or social isolation may develop.  These feelings can result in undesired treatment and status.  This process results in personal marginalization, and it may lead to social marginalization which includes that person’s relative economic, employment, educational, and cultural loss compared to those around him.  This provides a second source of alienation from mainstream society.  This can cause an individual to experience extreme discomfort called ego identity discomfort.  Because external sources have too much control, the individual cannot construct a personal definition of him/her self.  The person is then motivated to identify with an alternative social group such as a drug subcultural group.  Such groups provide opportunities to resolve identity problems.   Identification with such a group reduces the person’s ego identity discomfort, or it helps to solve identity problems.  Scholars today are focusing on the basic elements of social organization (race, ethnicity, gender, and social class) in their theory and research.  In the case of drug subcultures, it is reported that Anderson (1998) discovered that the composition of the drug subcultural groups differed between blacks and whites.  Blacks described neighborhood and school based groups as securing an improved social status and reputation.  On the other hand, Anderson (1998) found that the drug subcultural groups reported by whites differed.  These groups were located at nightclubs, bars, colleges, high schools and around the neighborhood.  Some of these groups were “other” activity oriented, such as college groups or the entertainment industry, and these groups had a “very strong” interest in drugs.  Whites reported using many different drugs, from alcohol and cocaine to marijuana and heroin.  These differences are significant, and such differences could alter the cultural identity theory. This is because different groups, such as blacks and whites, perceive events and problems in different ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2290">The '''cultural mulatto''' is a concept introduced by [[Trey Ellis]] in his 1989 essay, ''The New Black Aesthetic''. While the term "[[mulatto]]" typically refers to a person of mixed black and white ancestry, a cultural mulatto is defined by Ellis as a black person who is highly educated and usually a part of the middle or [[Upper middle class|upper-middle class]], and therefore [[Cultural assimilation|assimilates]] easily into traditionally white environments. 

== Overview ==
Ellis writes, "Just as a genetic mulatto is a black person of mixed parents who can often get along fine with his white grandparents, a cultural mulatto, educated by a multi-racial mix of cultures, can also navigate easily in the white world" (235).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trey-ellis/whos-afraid-of-me_b_981005.html|title = The New Black Aesthetic Revisited|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural mulattoes are skillful code-switchers and they may be equally comfortable around blacks as around whites. Members of the New Black Aesthetic are typically cultural mulattoes. Their ability for easy interaction with both blacks and whites is what ultimately allows cultural mulattoes opportunities for class and status [[Social mobility|upward mobility]].

== Examples ==
Examples of cultural mulattoes offered by Ellis include:
* [[Bill Cosby]]'s daughters&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trey-ellis/obama-cultural-mulatto_b_41576.html|title = Obama: Cultural Mulatto|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural retention''' is the act of retaining the [[culture]] of a specific [[ethnicity|ethnic]] group of people, especially when there is reason to believe that the culture, through inaction, may be lost. Many African-American, European and Asian organizations have cultural retention programs in place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5976">The '''Cybernetic Culture Research Unit''' ('''Ccru''') was a student-run interdisciplinary collective founded in 1995 out of the [[University of Warwick]]'s philosophy department.&lt;ref name="divus.cc"&gt;[http://divus.cc/london/en/article/nick-land-ein-experiment-im-inhumanismus Mackay, Robin. "Nick Land: An Experiment in Inhumanism." ''Divus''. 27 February 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was associated with the work of [[Sadie Plant]] and [[Nick Land]].

==History==
The collective's research was closely tied to the work of philosophers [[Sadie Plant]] (around whom it was founded), [[Nick Land]], and their colleagues throughout the 1990s, and in particular the emerging [[cyberfeminist]] thinking that would lead to the ''Virtual Futures'' conferences at Warwick in the middle of the decade.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Simon Reynolds, '[http://energyflashbysimonreynolds.blogspot.com.au/2009/11/renegade-academia-cybernetic-culture.html Reynolds, Simon. "Renegade Aacdemia"]', unpublished feature for Lingua Franca, 1999. Accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Plant would abandon her academic post and affiliation with the Ccru in 1997, during which time it came under the direction of Land. Under his leadership, the collective became increasingly experimental and unorthodox in its work, with its output (which included writing, performance events, and collaborative art) crossing [[post-structuralism]], [[cybernetics]], [[science-fiction]], [[rave culture]], and [[occult studies]].&lt;ref name="divus.cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2015, a collection of Ccru pieces entitled ''Ccru: Writings 1997-2003'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ccru-Writings-1997-2003-ebook/dp/B00X96VLF0/|title=Ccru: Writings 1997-2003|accessdate= September 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members and affiliates==
Although it only existed in an official capacity for little over two years—following the departure of Plant, the University of Warwick would deny any relationship to the renegade collective—the Ccru's cultural impact has been significant.&lt;ref name="dazeddigital.com"&gt;[http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/10459/1/nick-land-mind-games Fisher, Mark. "Nick Land: Mind Games."

Accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were affiliated with the Ccru during and after its time as part of the University of Warwick Philosophy department include philosophers [[Iain Hamilton Grant]], [[Ray Brassier]] and [[Reza Negarestani]]; cultural theorists [[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Mark Fisher]] and [[Kodwo Eshun]]; publisher and philosopher Robin Mackay; digital media theorists Luciana Parisi and [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]]; electronic music artist and [[Hyperdub]] label head Steve Goodman, aka [[Kode9]]; writer and theorist Anna Greenspan; novelist [[Hari Kunzru]]; and artists [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], among others.&lt;ref name="divus.cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dazeddigital.com"/&gt; Land and the Ccru collaborated frequently with the experimental art collective 0[rphan&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;d[rift&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Maggie Roberts and Ranu Mukherjee),{{r|orphan}} notably on ''Syzygy'', a month-long multidisciplinary residency at Beaconsfield Contemporary Art gallery in South London, 1999, and on 0[rphan]d[rift&gt;]'s ''Cyberpositive'' (London: Cabinet, 1995), a schizoid work of cut-and-paste cyberphilosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orphandriftarchive.com/neofuture/ctm13-berlin.php|title=0rphan Drift :: Neo Future &gt; CTM13 Berlin|website=www.orphandriftarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The role played by Land, Plant, and the Ccru in the development of what has come to be known as [[accelerationism]] is profound, and its legacy is apparent in contemporary debates concerning the viability of the theory in its various guises.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Mackay and Armen Avanessian, '[http://www.urbanomic.com/Publications/Accelerate/Accelerate-Introduction.pdf Introduction]' to ''#Accelerate: The Accelerationist Reader'', (Falmouth: Urbanomic, 2014) pp.1-46&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that accelerationism as it was deployed by the Ccru should be distinguished from the term more frequently associated with [[Nick Srnicek]] and Alex Williams’ ‘Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics’.{{r|mani}}&lt;ref&gt;Nick Srnicek &amp; Alex Williams, ‘[http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/ #Accelerate: Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics],’ Dark Trajectories: Politics of the Outside, ed. Joshua Johnson (Hong Kong, NAME, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Land himself makes this distinction clear in his commentary on the manifesto.{{r|land}}

The '''''Dii Consentes''''', also as '''''Di''''' or '''''Dei Consentes''''' (once '''''Dii Complices'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]] III.40&lt;/ref&gt;), was a list of twelve major deities, [[List of Roman deities|six gods and six goddesses]], in the [[Religion in ancient Rome|pantheon of Ancient Rome]]. Their gilt statues stood in the [[Roman Forum|Forum]], later apparently in the [[Porticus Deorum Consentium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Ball Platner]], ''The Topography and Monuments of Ancient Rome'' (1904), pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gods were listed by the poet [[Ennius]] in the late 3rd century BC in a paraphrase of an unknown Greek poet:&lt;ref&gt;Ennius, fragment 45 = [[Apuleius]], ''De deo Socratis'', 2.28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''[[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], [[Minerva]], [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]],''
:''[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], [[Apollo]]''

[[Livy]]&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 22#10|XXII.10.9]].&lt;/ref&gt; arranges them in six male-female pairs: Jupiter-Juno, Neptune-Minerva, Mars-Venus, Apollo-Diana, Vulcan-Vesta and Mercury-Ceres. Three of the Dii Consentes formed the [[Capitoline Triad]]: Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.

==Background==
The grouping of twelve deities has origins older than the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] or Roman sources. The Greek grouping may have Anatolian, more precisely [[Lycia]]n origins. A group of twelve [[Hittite mythology|Hittite gods]] is known both from [[cuneiform]] texts and from artistic representation. The Hittite Twelve are all male, with no individualizing features. They have a possible reflex in a Lycian group of twelve gods in the [[Roman Empire]] period. By 400 BC, a precinct dedicated to twelve gods existed at the marketplace in [[Xanthos]] in Lycia.{{sfnp|Long|1987|pages=144-186}}

[[Herodotus]] also refers to a group of twelve gods in Egypt, but this finds no confirmation in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] sources. The Greek cult of the [[Twelve Olympians]] can be traced to 6th century BC [[Athens]] and probably has no precedent in the [[Mycenaean period]]. The altar to the Twelve Olympians at Athens is usually dated to the [[eponymous archon|archonship]] of the younger Pesistratos, in 522/521 BC. By the 5th century BC there are well-attested [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] of the Twelve Olympians in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and at the [[Yoros Castle#History|Hieron]] on the [[Bosphorus]].{{sfnp|Long|1987|pages=144-186}}

The references to twelve [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan deities]] are due to later Roman authors, writing long after [[Interpretatio graeca|the influence of the Greek pantheon]] had become dominant, and must be regarded with skepticism. [[Arnobius]] states that the [[Etruscans]] had a set of six male and six female deities which they called ''consentes'' and ''complices'' because they rose and set together, implying an [[astronomical]] significance, and that these twelve acted as councillors of Jupiter.{{sfnp|Long|1987|page=232}} Scholarly evaluation of this account is dependent on the hypothesis that the Etruscans originally immigrated to [[Italy]] from [[Anatolia]]. In this case, the Etruscan Twelve might have been cognate to the Hittite Twelve. It is, however, just as possible that the Etruscan Twelve were simply an adaptation of the Greek Twelve just like the Roman Twelve.{{sfnp|Long|1987|page=232}}

The '''dramatistic pentad''' forms the core structure of [[dramatism]], a method for examining motivations that the renowned [[literary critic]] [[Kenneth Burke]] developed.  Dramatism recommends the use of a [[metalinguistic]] approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five [[rhetoric]]al elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the "dramatistic pentad." Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its [[Character (arts)|character]]s. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their [[world view]].

Burke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book "A Grammar of Motives". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines "questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, "The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pentad also closely follows the journalistic '[[Five Ws]]': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states "Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information." &lt;ref&gt;"The Five Ws of Online Help". by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L. Retrieved April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical elements of the dramatistic pentad==
The dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them," to read them "at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other," and "in a wider context than any of them recognizes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=Francis|title=Kenneth Burke's A Grammar of Motives|date=1957|publisher=Doubleday Anchor Books|location=NY|pages=193–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act===
Act, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question "what?", is related to the world view of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene===
Scene, which is associated with the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of an act and answers the questions "when?" and "where?", is related to the world view of [[materialism]] and minimal or non-existent [[free will]]. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agent===
Agent, which answers the question "by whom?", reflects the world view of [[philosophical idealism]]. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” &lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Agency===
Agency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question "how?", implies a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Purpose===
Purpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question "why?", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.

==Ratios within the dramatistic pentad==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.

This is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1307}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|page=1308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. 
Likewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Act ratio===
The scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.&lt;ref name="Burke1978"&gt;Burke,Kenneth."Questions and Answers about the Pentad". National Council of Teachers of English, 1978, p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Agent ratio===
A relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.&lt;ref name="Burke1978" /&gt;

===Act-Agent ratio===
While requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.

==A sixth element==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Situation|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010"&gt;Anderson, F. D., &amp; Althouse, M. T. (2010). “Five Fingers or Six? Pentad or Hexad”. KB Journal, 6(2). Retrieved October 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude is defined as "the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act." The attitude, like the agency, would answer the “how?”.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. (1965). “Permanence and Change”. 1954. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010" /&gt; While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining “another soul” or an “extra existence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew|title=Disciplining The Master: Finding the Via Media for Kenneth Burke|journal=American Communication Journal|date=2001|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have read this as Burke’s desire not to “dispose of” ambiguity, but rather to “study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.”&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.

'''Elegant decay''' is the cultural agreement that some places, and structures, become gradually more elegant, notable, or beautiful as they decay, or fall into [[ruin]], due to their historical, architectural, or cultural significance. Although such reverence is subjective, it is true that certain cities, regions or even countries are more susceptible to the general concept due to past opulence, or their lengthy or enduring history or culture.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

[[File:Rome Palatine Hill.jpg|thumb|360px|The path to the summit of [[Palatine Hill]], [[Rome]], Italy]]

Contrary to the general interpretation that places or structures are more noteworthy in their newness, or older structures hold more value and interest after being historically restored to their original state, the concept of elegant decay is that in the slow degradation of the structures an inherent elegance, or beauty, emerges due to past historic importance. In recent times, this concept has been exploited by those seeking to stimulate tourism.

==History==
[[File:Venice Windows.jpg|thumb|360px|A wall in [[Venice]], Italy, slowly crumbles into a canal.]]

With its rich history, and centuries of past prestige and prominence, [[Western Europe]] has many places where elegant decay is notable and celebrated. One of the most salient is Italy, due to its lengthy historic prominence in prehistoric, ancient, medieval, and modern times. The most celebrated of Italian cities in elegant decay is arguably [[Venice]], largely due to the whole city slowly crumbling and sinking into its lagoon.{{CN|date=October 2017}}

Although Western Europe holds many instances of elegant decay today, the New World also has places of crumbled reverence as well. Most notable in the United States may be the city and region around [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], with its historic fusion of cultures and important contributions to American expansion. In the concept of elegant decay, there sometimes appears to be an element of impending doom to such places and structures, as Venice slowly sinks, and New Orleans is under constant threat from hurricanes.

Elegant decay is different in concept and plan than [[ruin value]], in which structures are planned to look beautiful as ruins from the early planning stages. The concept of elegant decay is related to the concept of [[patina]].

'''European Culture and Economy''', shortened as '''ECUE''', is an interdisciplinary postgraduate program that is distinct from [[European studies|European Studies]]. Both focus on European politics and developments. After receiving the academic degree [[Master of Arts]], graduates of ECUE may engage in various business fields, however, especially [[European Union|EU]]-related professions are targeted.

==History==
The [[Ruhr University Bochum]] in Germany is currently the only university to offer European Culture and Economy as a path of study.&lt;ref&gt;http://studieren.de/hochschule.0.html?&amp;tx_assearchengine_pi2&lt;/ref&gt; It is a small branch, approximately 30 students are accepted each year. It was first introduced in the winter term of 1999/2000 and has since become an established [[Master's degree|Masters]]&lt;nowiki /&gt;programme. Initially, ECUE was a way of giving arts scholars a fundamental understanding of economics, politics and intercultural competences. In its early stages, the program was supported financially by the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD) as well as [[German Rectors' Conference]] (HRK).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordrheinwestfalendirekt.de/broschuerenservice/download/173/auslandserfahrung.pdf p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, its level of quality was confirmed by ACQUIN,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acquin.org/de/akkreditiert/akkreditiertstudiengang.php?id=12845&amp;titel_studiengang=europ%C3%A4ische+kultur+und+wirtschaft&amp;standort=&amp;hochschule=&amp;sonstiger_hochschulname=&amp;fachausschuesse=&lt;/ref&gt; a German Quality Assurance Institute. Students of ECUE are intended to qualify as ''specialized generalist'' and be prepared for careers in international companies and institutions. The expected duration of study is four terms.

==Curriculum==
The curriculum puts an emphasis on examining the European area from an economic, cultural, political and sociological perspective. During Colloquia and an obligatory excursion (to Brussels), the interrelations of the disciplines are linked and investigated. Additionally, the students' intercultural competences and research methods are trained.

Seminars of the following disciplines are included in the program:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ecue/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Law]]
* [[Economics]]
* [[History]]
* [[Political science]]
* [[Sociology]]
* [[Cultural studies]]
* [[Philosophy]]

The interdisciplinary and intercultural approach teaches students to analyze European topics from a cultural, economical and political angle. Next to interdisciplinary, ECUE stresses international relations. Many of the available places are assigned to foreign students.&lt;ref&gt;Handbuch Europa in NRW (p. 59,60)&lt;/ref&gt; So far, students of 30 different nations (Africa, U.S.A., Asia, many European countries) were able to successfully complete the program.

==Admission==
To be granted admission to the program, a very good to excellent [[Bachelor's degree]] is required. Furthermore, students must possess a good proficiency in the teaching languages, English and German.
Further, a term abroad or an internship are possible ways to organize the program.

'''Fashion''' is a popular [[style (disambiguation)|style]], especially in [[clothing]], [[footwear]], [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], [[makeup]], [[hairstyle]] and body.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which people present themselves. A fashion can become the prevailing style in behaviour or manifest the newest creations of [[designer]]s, [[technologist (disambiguation)|technologist]]s, [[engineer]]s, and [[design management|design manager]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fashion (2012, March 29).

Because the more technical term ''costume'' is regularly linked{{by whom|date=July 2018}} to the term "fashion", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like [[Costume party|fancy-dress]] or [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] wear, while the word "fashion" often refers to clothing, including the study of clothing.  Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are [[androgynous]].&lt;ref&gt;Undressing Cinema: Clothing and identity in the movies – Page 196, [[Stella Bruzzi]] – 2012
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
For a discussion of the use of the terms "fashion", "dress", "clothing", and "costume" by [[professional]]s in various disciplines, see: Valerie Cumming, ''Understanding Fashion History'', "Introduction", Costume &amp; Fashion Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-89676-253-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

High-flying [[trendsetter]]s in fashion can aspire to the label ''[[haute couture]]''. But if one disapproves of a fashion, one can attempt to dismiss it as a mere [[fad]].

==Clothing fashions==
{{Main|History of Western fashion}}

Early Western travelers, traveling whether to  India, Persia, Turkey or China, would frequently remark on the absence of change in fashion in those countries. The Japanese ''[[shōgun]]''{{'}}s secretary bragged (not completely accurately) to a Spanish visitor in 1609 that [[Japanese clothing]] had not changed in over a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 312–313&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is considerable evidence in [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]] of rapidly changing fashions in [[Han Chinese clothing|Chinese clothing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Timothy Brook]]: "[[The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China]]" (University of California Press 1999); this has a whole section on fashion.&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes in costume often took place at times of economic or social change, as occurred in ancient Rome and the medieval [[Caliphate]], followed by a long period without major changes. In 8th-century [[Moorish Spain]], the musician [[Ziryab]] introduced to [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Salim al-Hassani|al-Hassani]], Woodcok and Saoud (2004), ''Muslim Heritage in Our World'', FSTC publishing, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|Bias source per discussions at RS noticeboard|failed=y|date=March 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Terrasse, H. (1958) 'Islam d'Espagne' une rencontre de l'Orient et de l'Occident", Librairie Plon, Paris, pp.52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sophistication|sophisticate]]d clothing-styles based on seasonal and daily fashions from his native Baghdad, modified by his own inspiration.  Similar changes in fashion occurred in the 11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], who introduced clothing styles from [[Central Asia]] and the [[Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: A–K|author=Josef W. Meri &amp; Jere L. Bacharach|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2006|isbn=0415966914|page=162}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning in Europe of continual and increasingly rapid change in clothing styles can be fairly reliably dated. Historians, including [[James Laver]] and [[Fernand Braudel]], date the start of Western fashion in clothing to the middle of the [[1300–1400 in fashion|14th century]],&lt;ref&gt;Laver, James: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', Abrams, 1979, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="braudel"&gt;Fernand Braudel, ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th–18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life", p317, William Collins &amp; Sons, London 1981''&lt;/ref&gt; though they tend to rely heavily on contemporary imagery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fashion in Medieval France|last=Heller|first=Sarah-Grace|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|year=2007|isbn=9781843841104|location=Cambridge; Rochester, N.Y.|pages=49–50|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and illuminated manuscripts were not common before the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=CMvTkgVRYvMC&amp;pg=PA28|title=English Medieval Narrative in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries|last=Boitani|first=Piero|date=1986-07-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521311496|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most dramatic early change in fashion was a sudden drastic shortening and tightening of the male over-garment from calf-length to barely covering the buttocks,&lt;ref name="conceitom.com.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conceitom.com.br/jeans/#more-1226|title=Jeans Calças Modelos Ideais|date=19 November 2014|work=Conceito M.|accessdate=26 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419063504/http://www.conceitom.com.br/jeans/#more-1226|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes accompanied with stuffing in the chest to make it look bigger. This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers and one of the popular historical fashion was Often referred to as the "Plume Boom," the popularity of wearing real feathers in hats reached its peak in the early 20th century. According to The Smithsonian, women adorned their hats with feathers, wings, and even full taxidermied birds. This caused a huge decline in the bird population, and even led to the exinction of some. Often referred to as the "Plume Boom," the popularity of wearing real feathers in hats reached its peak in the early 20th century. According to The Smithsonian, women adorned their hats with feathers, wings, and even full taxidermied birds. This caused a huge decline in the bird population, and even led to the exinction of some. 

The pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex. [[Art history|Art historians]] are therefore able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from [[Ancien Régime]] [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 317–324&lt;/ref&gt; Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of [[early modern Europe]] led to the [[bourgeoisie]] and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites – a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 313–315&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ADurerNuremburgVenetianWomen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht Dürer]]'s drawing contrasts a well turned out ''bourgeoise'' from [[Nuremberg]] (left) with her counterpart from Venice. The Venetian lady's high [[chopine]]s make her look taller.]]&lt;!-- This image is referenced in the article. Please don't remove.--&gt;

In the 16th century, national differences were at their most pronounced.  Ten 16th century portraits of German or Italian gentlemen may show ten entirely different hats. [[Albrecht Dürer]] illustrated the differences in his actual (or composite) contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century (''illustration, right''). The "Spanish style" of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid-17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, 317–321&lt;/ref&gt;

Though different  textile colors and patterns changed from year to year,&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Peter. ''Baroque and Rococo Silks''.&lt;/ref&gt; the cut of a gentleman's coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady's dress was cut, changed more slowly. Men's fashions were largely derived from military models, and changes in a European male silhouette were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of foreign styles such as the "Steinkirk" [[cravat]] or necktie.

[[File:MA-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Marie Antoinette]], wife of Louis XVI, was a leader of fashion. Her choices, such as this 1783 white [[muslin]] dress called a ''chemise a la Reine'', were highly influential and widely worn.&lt;ref name=dam&gt;{{cite book|last=Ribeiro|first=Aileen|title=Dress and Morality |year=2003 |publisher=Berg |isbn=9781859737828 |pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Though there had been distribution of dressed dolls from France since the 16th century and [[Abraham Bosse]] had produced engravings of fashion in the 1620s, the pace of change picked up in the 1780s with increased publication of French engravings illustrating the latest Paris styles. By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were); local variation became first a sign of provincial culture and later a badge of the conservative peasant.&lt;ref&gt;James Laver and Fernand Braudel, op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

Although tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations, and the textile industry certainly led many trends, the [[history of fashion design]] is normally understood to date from 1858 when the English-born [[Charles Frederick Worth]] opened the first true ''[[haute couture]]'' house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by government for the fashion houses that met the standards of industry.  These fashion houses have to adhere to standards such as keeping at least twenty employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers and also old fashion is becoming trendy nowadays but with a trendy taste .&lt;ref&gt;Claire B. Shaeffer (2001).

Taunton Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the idea of the [[fashion designer]] as a celebrity in his or her own right has become increasingly dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkins|first1=Ilya|title=Poiret, Dior and Schiaparelli: Fashion, Femininity and Modernity.|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=9780857853288|page=10|edition=English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kT-Xcu-aWxQC&amp;pg=PA10|chapter=Introduction: Reputation, Celebrity and the "Professional" Designer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of unisex dressing originated in the 1960s when designers such as [[Pierre Cardin]] and [[Rudi Gernreich]] created garments, such as stretch jersey tunics or leggings, meant to be worn by both males and females. The impact of unisex expands more broadly to encompass various themes in fashion including androgyny, mass-market retail, and conceptual clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Jennifer. "Unisex Clothing".

Some men's styles blended the sensuality and expressiveness despite the conservative trend, the growing gay-rights movement and an emphasis on youth allowed for a new freedom to experiment with style, fabrics such as wool crepe, which had previously been associated with women's attire was used by designers when creating male clothing.&lt;ref&gt;"Clothing for Men".

The four major current [[fashion capital]]s are acknowledged to be Paris, Milan, New York City, and London, which are all headquarters to the greatest fashion companies and are renowned for their major influence on global fashion. [[Fashion week]]s are held in these cities, where designers exhibit their new clothing collections to audiences.  A succession of major designers such as [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] have kept Paris as the center most watched by the rest of the world, although ''haute couture'' is now subsidized by the sale of [[ready-to-wear]] collections and perfume using the same branding.

Modern [[Western culture|West]]erners have a wide number of choices available in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect his or her personality or interests. When people who have high cultural [[Social status|status]] start to wear new or different clothes, a fashion trend may start. People who like or respect these people become influenced by their personal style and begin wearing similarly styled clothes. Fashions may vary considerably within a society according to age, [[social class]], generation, occupation, and geography and may also vary over time. If an older person dresses according to the fashion young people use, he or she may look ridiculous in the eyes of both young and older people. The terms ''fashionista'' and ''[[fashion victim]]'' refer to someone who slavishly follows current fashions.

One can regard the system of sporting various fashions as a fashion language incorporating various fashion statements using a grammar of fashion. (Compare some of the work of [[Roland Barthes]].)

In recent years, Asian fashion has become increasingly significant in local and global markets. Countries such as China, Japan, India, and Pakistan have traditionally had large textile industries, which have often been drawn upon by Western designers, but now Asian clothing styles are also gaining influence based on their own ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lemire, B., &amp; Riello, G (2008). "East &amp; West: Textiles and Fashion in Early Modern Europe". ''Journal of Social History'', 41(4), 887–916.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of global fashion industry is a product of the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved from http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the mid-19th century, most clothing was [[Made to measure|custom-made]]. It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. By the beginning of the 20th century—with the rise of new technologies such as the [[sewing machine]], the rise of global capitalism and the development of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail outlets such as department stores—clothing had increasingly come to be [[mass production|mass-produced]] in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices.

Although the fashion industry developed first in Europe and America, {{as of | 2017 | lc = on}}, it is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold worldwide. For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in Vietnam, finished in Italy, and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally. The fashion industry has long been one of the largest employers in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry#toc296474&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment declined considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for world [[textile industry|production of textiles]] and [[Clothing industry|clothing]] are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/cheap-clothes-2012-6/|title=How Bargain Fashion Chains Will Keep Themselves Cut-Rate -- New York Magazine|work=NYMag.com|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fashion industry consists of four levels:

# the production of raw materials, principally fibers and textiles but also leather and fur.
# the production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others.
# retail sales
# various forms of advertising and promotion

These levels consist of many separate but interdependent sectors. These sectors are Textile Design and Production, [[Fashion Design]] and Manufacturing, Fashion Retailing, Marketing and Merchandising, [[Fashion Show]]s, and Media and Marketing. Each sector is devoted to the goal of satisfying consumer demand for apparel under conditions that enable participants in the industry to operate at a profit.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296476/Fashion-design-and-manufacturing, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296477/Fashion-retailing-marketing-and-merchandising, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry/296479/Media-and-marketing&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion trend ==
{{main|Fashion trend|2010s in fashion}}
Fashion trends are influenced by several factors including cinema, celebrities, climate, creative explorations, political, economical, social and technological. Examining these factors is called a [[PEST analysis]]. Fashion forecasters can use this information to help determine growth or decline of a particular trend. Fashion trends change daily, it can not stay unchanged

=== Political influences ===
[[File:Shinzō Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|upright|Advisor to US President and businesswoman [[Ivanka Trump]] (right) along with [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinzo Abe]] wearing Western-style [[business suit]]s, 2017]]

Not only did political events make a huge impact on fashion trends but also the political figure played a critical role in forecasting the fashion trend. For example, First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] was a fashionable icon of the early 1960s who led formal dressing trend. By wearing a Chanel suit, a structural Givenchy shift dress or a soft color Cassini coat with huge buttons, it created her elegant look and led a delicate trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=5J3PDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q=First%20Lady%20Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20was%20a%20fashionable%20icon%20of%20the%20early%201960s|title=Women in Fashion|last=Rissman|first=Rebecca|date=2016-08-15|publisher=ABDO|isbn=9781680774856|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, political revolution also made much impact on the fashion trend. For example, during the 1960s the economy had become wealthier, divorce rate was increasing and government approved the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. This revolution inspired younger generation to rebellion. In 1964, the leg-baring miniskirt has become a major fashion trend of the 1960s. Given that fashion designers began to experiment with the shapes of garment, loose sleeveless, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. In this case, mini-skirt trend became an icon of the 1960s.

Moreover, political movement built an impressive relationship with fashion trend. For instance, during Vietnam war, the youth of America made a movement that affected the whole country. In the 1960s, the fashion trend was full of fluorescent colors, prints patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirt became a protest outfit of the 1960s. This trend was called Hippie and it is still affecting current fashion trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/political-economic-factors-influenced-fashion-1960s-12014.html|title=Political &amp; Economic Factors That Influenced Fashion in the 1960s {{!}} The Classroom {{!}} Synonym|website=classroom.synonym.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology influences ===

Technology plays a large role in most aspects of today's society. Technological influences are growing more apparent in the fashion industry. Advances and new developments are shaping and creating current and future trends.

Developments such as wearable technology have become an important trend in fashion and will continue with advances such as clothing constructed with solar panels that charge devices and [[E-textiles|smart fabrics]] that enhance wearer comfort by changing color or texture based on environmental changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apparel.edgl.com/news/Top-6-Tech-Trends-in-the-Fashion-Industry94135|title=Top 6 Tech Trends in the Fashion Industry|last=Communications|first=Edgell|website=apparel.edgl.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fashion industry is seeing how [[3D printing]] technology has influenced designers such as [[Iris van Herpen|Iris Van Herpen]] and [[Kimberly Ovitz]]. These designers have been heavily experimenting and developing 3D printed couture pieces. As the technology grows, the 3D printers will become more accessible to designers and eventually consumers, which could potentially shape the fashion industry entirely.

Internet technology such as online retailers and social media platforms have given way for trends to be identified, marketed and sold immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Wang|first2=Huchen|title=Examining hedonic and utilitarian motivations for m-commerce fashion retail app engagement|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management|volume=20|issue=4|pages=487–506|doi=10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Styles and trends are easily conveyed online to attract the trendsetters. Posts on Instagram or Facebook can easily increase awareness about new trends in fashion, which subsequently may create high demand for specific items or brands,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thinkrunway.com/2013/09/the-impact-of-technology-on-fashion.html|title=The Impact of Technology on Fashion Today|website=Site Name|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310132948/http://www.thinkrunway.com/2013/09/the-impact-of-technology-on-fashion.html|archivedate=2016-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; new "buy now button" technology can link these styles with direct sales.

[[Machine vision]] technology has been developed to track how fashions spread through society. The industry can now see the direct correlation on how fashion shows influence street-chic outfits. The effects can now be quantified and provide valuable feedback to fashion houses, designers and consumers regarding trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/541091/how-machine-vision-is-about-to-change-the-fashion-world/|title=How Machine Vision Is About to Change the Fashion World|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military technology has played an important role in the fashion industry. The camouflage pattern in clothing was developed to help military personnel be less visible to enemy forces.  A trend emerged in the 1960s and camouflage fabric was introduced to street wear. The camouflage fabric trend disappeared and resurfaced several times since then. Camouflage started to appear in high fashion by the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bergfashionlibrary.com|title=Home : Berg Fashion Library|website=www.bergfashionlibrary.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designers such as Valentino, Dior and Dolce &amp; Gabbana combined camouflage into their runway and ready-to-wear collections.

=== Social influences ===

Clothing is much more than fashion, it is a style of life an expression of ones self. Social media is one of the biggest platforms to exhibit and connect fashion trends with millions of people all at once worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/social-media-influences-fashion|title=Social Media Influences on Fashion|work=Social Media Today|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion trend goes beyond the aesthetic values, it emerges as an expressive tool for designers to deliver their message about the society. With the influence of social media, celebrities and bloggers, their voice are easily being heard and have impact on fashion and trend at any time.
Fashion and music are inseparable. [[Prabal Gurung]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.notjustalabel.com/editorial/music-and-fashion|title=Music and Fashion|website=www.notjustalabel.com|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted the importance of music to his shows, saying "each season we want to tell a story for 10 minutes…. the perfect harmony between cloths and music allows this". Music is a representation of fashion that expresses the abstract design concept into relatable harmony for viewers.

Fashion relates to social and cultural context of an environment. According to Matika,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaynews.co.zw/does-pop-culture-influence-fashion/|title=Does pop culture influence fashion?|website=www.sundaynews.co.zw|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Elements of popular culture become fused when a person's trend is associated with a preference for a genre of music…like music, news or literature, fashion has been fused into everyday lives." Fashion is not only seen as pure aesthetic values; fashion is also a medium for performers to create an overall atmosphere and express their opinions altogether through music video. The latest music video ‘Formation’ by Beyoncé, according to Carlos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/13396069/beyonce-music-video-givenchy-gucci-miu-miu/|title=The Fashion in Beyoncé's New Video Is as Powerful as Its Politics|last=Carlos|first=Marjon|website=Vogue|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The pop star pays homage to her Creole root.... tracing the roots of the Louisiana cultural nerve center from the post-abolition era to present day, Beyoncé catalogs the evolution of the city's vibrant style and its tumultuous history all at once. Atop a New Orleans police car in a red-and-white Gucci high-collar dress and combat boots, she sits among the ruins of Hurricane Katrina, immediately implanting herself in the biggest national debate on police brutality and race relations in modern day."

Runway show is a reflection of fashion trend and a designer's thought. For designer like Vivienne Westwood, runway show is a platform for her voice on politics and current events. For her AW15 menswear show, according to Water,&lt;ref name="Dazed"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/24335/1/vivienne-westwood-s-top-ten-political-moments|title=Vivienne Westwood's top ten political moments|last=Dazed|website=Dazed|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "where models with severely bruised faces channeled eco-warriors on a mission to save the planet." Another recent example is a staged feminist protest march for Chanel's SS15 show, rioting models chanting words of empowerment with signs like "Feminist but feminine" and "Ladies first." According to Water,&lt;ref name="Dazed" /&gt; "The show tapped into Chanel's long history of championing female independence: founder Coco Chanel was a trailblazer for liberating the female body in the post-WWI era, introducing silhouettes that countered the restrictive corsets then in favour."

=== Economic influences ===

==== Circular economy ====
As we undergo a global economic downturn{{when|date=May 2018}}, the "Spend now, think later" belief is getting less relevant in our society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaughn/Berelowitz|first=Jessica/Marian|date=2015|title=The circular economy|url=http://0-www.warc.com.library.scad.edu/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=4f8c0345-e2ef-48a2-ae79-b614a535a19d&amp;q=economy+trend+fashion&amp;CID=A105052&amp;PUB=ATTICUS|journal=Warc|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's consumer tends to be more mindful about consumption, looking for just enough and better, more durable options. People have also become more conscious of the impact their everyday consumption has on the environment and society. They're looking for ways to mediate their material desires with an aim to do more good in the world. A linear economy is slowly shifting to a circular one.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In today's linear economical system, manufacturers extract resources from the earth to make products that will soon be discarded in landfills, on the other hand, under the [[Circular economy|circular]] model, the production of goods operates like systems in nature, where the waste and demise of a substance becomes the food and source of growth for something new. Companies such as MUD Jeans, which is based in the Netherlands employs a leasing scheme for jeans. This Dutch company "represents a new consuming philosophy that is about using instead of owning," according to MUD's website. The concept also protects the company from volatile cotton prices. Consumers pay €7.50 a month for a pair of jeans; after a year, they can return the jeans to Mud,  trade them for a new pair and start another year-long lease, or keep them. MUD is responsible for any repairs during the lease period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another ethical fashion company, [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] set up the first multi-seller branded store on EBay in order to facilitate secondhand sales; consumers who take the Common Threads pledge can sell in this store and have their gear listed on Patagonia.com's "Used Gear" section.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== China's domestic spending ====
Consumption as a share of gross domestic product in China has fallen for six decades, from 76 percent in 1952 to 28 percent in 2011. China plans to reduce [[tariff]]s on a number of consumer goods and expand its 72-hour transit visa plan to more cities in an effort to stimulate domestic consumption.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ap|first=Tiffany|date=November 2015|title=China Makes Moves to Boost Consumption|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/retail-news/markets/china-consumption-beijing-import-tax-10286320/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement of import tax reductions follows changes in June 2015, when the government cut the tariffs on clothing, cosmetics and various other goods by half. Among the changes — easier tax refunds for overseas shoppers and accelerated openings of more duty-free shops in cities covered by the 72-hour visa scheme. The 72-hour visa was introduced in Beijing and Shanghai in January 2013 and has been extended to 18 Chinese cities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to reports at the same time, Chinese consumer spending in other countries such as Japan has slowed even though the yen has dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Amanda|date=14 March 2016|title=Tokyo Fashion Week Starts in Challenging Economy|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/business-news/sourcing-global-markets/japan-fashion-week-fall-2016-10388614-10388614/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is clearly a trend in the next 5 years that the domestic fashion market will show an increase.

=== Consumers' needs ===

Consumers all have different needs and demands that have to be suited. A person's needs change frequently.  An important factor to take into consideration when thinking of consumers' needs is the key demographics of the customer. Gender, age, income, and even profession can help a company better understand the needs of their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/consumer-needs-marketing-997.html|title=Consumer Needs &amp; Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a woman who is pregnant could be looking for diapers, baby strollers, and maternity clothes. Her needs would differ greatly from a woman with children that just went off to college or a teen entering high school.

Often consumers need to be told what they want. Fashion companies have to do their research to ensure they know their customers' needs before developing solutions. Steve Jobs said, "You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You cannot start with the technology and try to figure out where you are going to sell it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://strategyn.com/customer-needs/|title=Strategyn|website=Strategyn|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best way to understand the consumers' needs and therefore predict fashion trends is through [[market research]]. There are two research methods: primary and secondary.&lt;ref name="Consumer Research Methods"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/cb_Research_Methods.html|title=Consumer Research Methods|website=www.consumerpsychologist.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews, observation, and/or focus groups.

Benefits of primary research is specific information about a fashion brand's consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended. A negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions.  Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group.&lt;ref name="Consumer Research Methods"/&gt; Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants.

Knowing the needs of the consumers will increase a fashion companies' sales and profits. Through research and studying the consumers' lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion brands know what trends the consumers are ready for.

==Media==

Fashion breathes on media and medium .
The media plays a significant role when it comes to fashion. For instance, an important part of fashion is [[fashion journalism]]. Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites, social networks, and [[fashion blog]]s. In recent years, fashion blogging and [[YouTube]] videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one's style on a website or Instagram account. Through these media outlets readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs of various fashion designs and became even more influential than in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher=Fairchild Publications|isbn=9781501303869|doi=10.5040/9781501303869.ch-014|title = Marketing Fashion|year = 2012|chapter = Fashion Advertising, Sales Promotion, and Public Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cities throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought after and had a profound effect on public taste in clothing. Talented illustrators drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]'', which was founded in 1912 by [[Lucien Vogel]] and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/books/features/lithographs/gazette-du-bon-ton.shtml|title=Gazette du Bon Ton: A Journal of Good Taste|website=www.abebooks.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', founded in the United States in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and, most importantly, the advent of cheap color printing in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women's magazines, followed by men's magazines in the 1990s. One such example of ''Vogue'''s popularity is the younger version, ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the "fashionista on a budget". [[Haute couture]] designers followed the trend by starting [[ready-to-wear]] and [[perfume]] lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this trend are: ''[[Fashion Theory (journal)|Fashion Theory]]'' (1997)  and ''[[Vestoj]]'' (2009). Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as ''[[Fashion Television]]'' started to appear. ''[[FashionTV]]'' was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and new media channels. The Fashion Industry is beginning to promote their styles through Bloggers on social media's. Vogue specified Chiara Ferragni as "blogger of the moment" due to the rises of followers through her Fashion Blog, that became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Fateh, Azhar. “How Social Media Is Changing Fashion?” The Huffington Post, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 19 Jan. 2017, Retrieved From www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-social-media-is-changing-fashion_us_587edd29e4b06a0baf64918f.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City came to a close, ''[[The New Islander]]'''s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. "Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as ''Vogue'' always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting parkas come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January", she writes. "Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying."&lt;ref&gt;Tax, Genevieve.

The fashion industry has been the subject of numerous films and television shows, including the reality show ''[[Project Runway]]'' and the drama series ''[[Ugly Betty]]''. Specific fashion brands have been featured in film, not only as [[product placement]] opportunities, but as bespoke items that have subsequently led to trends in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, S.B.N., Hussein, Y., Jones, N. Designing for the famous – psychology of building a brand in haute couture shoe design and fashion. Design Principles &amp; Practices: An International Journal 2011;5(5):1–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Videos in general have been very useful in promoting the fashion industry. This is evident not only from television shows directly spotlighting the fashion industry, but also movies, events and music videos which showcase fashion statements as well as promote specific brands through product placements.

==Public relations and social media==
[[File:Ines Sainz.jpg|thumb|upright|A Mexican sports reporter wearing [[little black dress]] and knee-high boots]]

Fashion [[public relations]] involves being in touch with a company's audiences and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media and initiating messages that project positive images of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, G., &amp; Perlman, S.

Building brand awareness and credibility is a key implication of good public relations. In some cases, great hype is built about new designers' collections before they are released into the market, due to the immense exposure generated by practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Westfield, A. M.

==Anthropological perspective==
Anthropology, the study of culture and human societies, studies fashion by asking why certain styles are deemed socially appropriate and others are not. A certain way is chosen and that becomes the fashion as defined by a certain people as a whole, so if a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs that style will become fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39–55 [42]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion can be described as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditisation of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion:  An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of fashion and [[anti-fashion]] is as follows:  Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time.  Anti-fashion is different depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little.  Fashion is the exact opposite of anti-fashion.  Fashion changes very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but is spread out throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. For example, Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation gown is an example of anti-fashion because it is traditional and does not change over any period whereas a gown from fashion designer Dior's collection of 1953 is fashion because the style will change every season as Dior comes up with a new gown to replace the old one. In the Dior gown the length, cut, fabric, and embroidery of the gown change from season to season.  Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion and as change in fashion. Fashion has changing modes of adornment while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. Indigenous and peasant modes of adornment are an example of anti-fashion. Change in fashion is part of the larger system and is structured to be a deliberate change in style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion:  An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, people in rich countries are linked to people in poor countries through the commoditization and consumption of what is called fashion.  People work long hours in one area of the globe to produce things that people in another part of the globe are anxious to consume. An example of this is the chain of production and consumption of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, which are produced in Taiwan and then purchased in North America. At the production end, there is nation-building a hard working ideology that leads people to produce and entices people to consume with a vast amount of goods for the offering{{clarify|date=June 2015}}. Commodities are no longer just utilitarian but are fashionable, be they running shoes or sweat suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skoggard|first=Ian|title=Transnational Commodity Flows and the Global Phenomenon of the Brand|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=57–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change from anti-fashion to fashion because of the influence of western consumer-driven civilization can be seen in eastern Indonesia. The ikat textiles of the Ngada area of eastern Indonesia are changing because of modernization and development. Traditionally, in the Ngada area there was no idea similar to that of the Western idea of fashion, but anti-fashion in the form of traditional textiles and ways to adorn oneself were widely popular. Textiles in Indonesia have played many roles for the local people.  Textiles defined a person's rank and status; certain textiles indicated being part of the ruling class.  People expressed their ethnic identity and social hierarchy through textiles.  Because some Indonesians bartered ikat textiles for food, the textiles constituted economic goods, and as some textile design motifs had spiritual religious meanings, textiles were also a way to communicate religious messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In eastern Indonesia, both the production and use of traditional textiles have been transformed as the production, use and value associated with textiles have changed due to modernization.  In the past, women produced the textiles either for home consumption or to trade with others.  Today, this has changed as most textiles are not being produced at home. Western goods are considered modern and are valued more than traditional goods, including the sarong, which retain a lingering association with [[colonialism]].  Now, sarongs are used only for rituals and ceremonial occasions, whereas western clothes are worn to church or government offices. Civil servants working in urban areas are more likely than peasants to make the distinction between western and traditional clothes. Following Indonesia's independence from the Dutch, people increasingly started buying factory made shirts and sarongs. In textile-producing areas the growing of cotton and production of naturally colored thread became obsolete. Traditional motifs on textiles are no longer considered the property of a certain social class or age group. Wives of government officials are promoting the use of traditional textiles in the form of western garments such as skirts, vests and blouses.  This trend is also being followed by the general populace, and whoever can afford to hire a tailor is doing so to stitch traditional ikat textiles into western clothes. Thus, traditional textiles are now fashion goods and are no longer confined to the black, white and brown colour palette but come in array of colours. Traditional textiles are also being used in interior decorations and to make handbags, wallets and other accessories, which are considered fashionable by civil servants and their families. There is also a booming tourist trade in the eastern Indonesian city of Kupang where international as well as domestic tourists are eager to purchase traditionally printed western goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|page=41 and 45–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of traditional textiles for fashion is becoming big business in eastern Indonesia, but these traditional textiles are losing their ethnic identity markers and are being used as an item of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia):  Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnationa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property==
In the fashion industry, [[intellectual property]] is not enforced as it is within the [[film industry]] and [[music industry]]. Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA{{which|date=March 2014}} that "Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://outspoken.wpshower.com/2013/06/design-details-by-larger-companies-is-what-often/|title=Design details by larger companies is what often {{!}} Outspoken|website=outspoken.wpshower.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To take inspiration from others' designs contributes to the fashion industry's ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, [[WGSN (fashion forecaster)|WGSN]] has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry's success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies.

Since fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a trademark or logo can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer's brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag.

In 2005, the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&amp;deptid=8 IPFrontline.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510220626/http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&amp;deptid=8 |date=2007-05-10 }}: Intellectual Property in Fashion Industry, WIPO press release, December 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insme.org/page.asp?IDArea=1&amp;page=sanleucio INSME announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090258/http://www.insme.org/page.asp?IDArea=1&amp;page=sanleucio |date=2007-09-29 }}: WIPO-Italy International Symposium, 30 November – 2 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==

There has been great debate about politics' place in fashion and traditionally, the fashion industry has maintained a rather apolitical stance.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Week’s Anti-Trump Runway Politics|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/fashion-week-runway-politics|website=The New Yorker|date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the U.S.'s political climate in the surrounding months of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], during 2017 [[fashion week]]s in [[London Fashion Week|London]], [[Milan Fashion Week|Milan]], [[New York Fashion Week|New York]], [[Paris Fashion Week|Paris]] and [[São Paulo Fashion Week|São Paulo]] amongst others, many designers took the opportunity to take political stances leveraging their platforms and influence to reach the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fashionista.com/2017/12/fashion-politics-protests-statements-issues-2017|title=7 Ways Fashion Joined the Political Conversation in 2017|work=Fashionista|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/new-york-fashion-week-political-statements-runway-974742|title=Fashion Gets Political: On and Off the Runway Statements|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aiming to “amplify a greater message of unity, inclusion, diversity, and feminism in a fashion space”, Mara Hoffman invited the founders of the ''Women's March on Washington'' to open her show which featured modern silhouettes of utilitarian wear, described by critics as “Made for a modern warrior” and “Clothing for those who still have work to do”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are fashion and politics the perfect fit?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-38987248|date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prabal Gurung]] debuted his collection of T-shirts featuring slogans such as “The Future is Female”, “We Will Not Be Silenced”, and “Nevertheless She Persisted”, with proceeds going to the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]], [[Planned Parenthood]], and Gurung's own charity, “Shikshya Foundation Nepal”.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; Similarly, ''The Business of Fashion'' launched the ''#TiedTogether'' movement on Social Media, encouraging member of the industry from editors to models, to wear a white bandana advocating for “unity, solidarity, and inclusiveness during fashion week”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here's Why You'll See White Bandanas Everywhere During Fashion Month|url=http://www.instyle.com/awards-events/fashion-week/white-bandana-tied-together-movement|website=InStyle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One fashion cause is [[trashion]], which is using trash to make clothes, jewelery, and other fashion items in order to promote awareness of pollution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5898">In [[sociology]], '''feminization''' is the shift in [[gender role]]s and [[sex role]]s in a society, group, or organization towards a focus upon the [[feminine]]. It can also mean the incorporation of women into a group or a profession that was once dominated by men. &lt;ref name="douglas"&gt;Ann Douglas (1977). ''The Feminization of American Culture''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux {{ISBN|0-374-52558-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/jfemistudreli.27.1.75.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Introduction of feminization ==
Defining the term "feminization" can be complicated due to its meaning being unstable, as it can be portrayed as either a social process or as a critique of a process. Feminization has two basic meanings. The first concerns a person who was not initially feminine but becomes feminine later in their life through the perceptions of both the individual and those around them. According to gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], a person's gender is not solely an act of will or self-description, as it is also shaped by the people who describe, categorize, and treat the person according to their own perceptions of their gender. The second meaning of the term feminization describes when a person who originally had feminine qualities begins to incorporate more feminine attributes into their personality in some way, shape, or form. The term has often been used to describe females, however over time it shifted to where the term can be used to describe the process of someone or something becoming more feminine by adopting feminine qualities.&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Imhoff | first = Sarah | title = The myth of American Jewish feminization | journal = Jewish Social Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 126&amp;ndash;152 | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | doi = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | jstor = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | date = Spring–Summer 2016 | url = https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/21871/The%20Myth%20of%20American%20Jewish%20Feminization.pdf?sequence=1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of poverty ==
Women are more likely than men to live below the poverty line, a phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty. The 2015 poverty rates for men and women in the U.S. were 10% and 15% respectively. Women are less likely to pursue advanced degrees  and tend to have low paying jobs. It has been argued that even with the same level of education and occupational role, women earn much less than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/followup/session/presskit/fs1.htm|title=Beijing +5 – Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century Twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, 5-9 June 2000|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources have disputed the idea of a wage gap in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/harvard-prof.-takes-down-gender-wage-gap-myth/article/2580405|title=Harvard prof. takes down gender wage gap myth|last=Schow|first=Ashe|website=The Washington Examiner|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of the labor force ==
Feminization of the labor force in present day associations is inescapable in that females make up half of the labor force and the revelation of them as a potential profitable asset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/anisha-motwani/the-feminization-of-workp_b_8258716.html|title=Why The Feminisation Of The Workplace Is Good News For Everyone|work=Huffington Post India|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post war there has been almost a movement of women flowing into the workforce in the North America and Europe economies with women making considerable advances in balancing the workforce when comparing women and men's job status and pay rates. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/1320929|title=Feminization of the labor force : paradoxes and promises in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization and the living wage movement ==
Feminists of the modern day living wage movement began in Baltimore, Maryland in the early 1990's right in the very heart and depths of the struggling urban poor. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around this same time, Baltimore churches became involved in providing the poor with needed social services. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even though national prosperity and rising stock markets seemed to be showing growth, more and more full-time workers were relying on soup kitchens, low-income housing assistance, and thrift store purchases for clothing. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their jobs did not pay enough to keep families above the poverty line. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whole communities became known as the "working poverty."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Helga Grabstein.jpg|thumb|Helga Festival Gravestone]]

Calling „'''Helga!'''“ is a [[running gag]] at German concerts and festivals.

== Ritual==
A person may call for a ''[[Helga]]'',&lt;ref name="Neon"&gt;[http://www.neon.de/kat/freie_zeit/musik/88151.html Das Festival] auf neon.de&lt;/ref&gt; others answer and come to a chorus like group effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/de/music/faq/ &lt;2004-04-14&gt; Allgemeine Musiknewsgruppen-FAQ] auf faqs.org&lt;/ref&gt; „Helga ist tot!“ (Helga is dead) denies the helgaing request.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Thiel: [http://www.einslive.de/musik/extras/2011/06/festival_abc.jsp Das Festival-ABC] auf einslive.de&lt;/ref&gt; Further allegations se gravestones, memorials or graffiti. The background is unknown, some reports point to a rather rainy [[Hurricane Festival]] in [[Scheeßel]], where a high pressure cyclone called Helga was called for but didn't arrive in time. The call was namegiver for an annual prize for German festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festivalguide.de/derhelga/ Der Helga]&lt;/ref&gt; and is being  used by a service company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/wunderbar/festival-rituale-oliver-uschmann-ueber-crowdsurfing-und-helga-rufe-a-828387-4.html Rituale auf Festivals: Götter im Dixi, erhöret uns], Spiegel 2012

'''Skull symbolism''' is the attachment of [[symbol]]ic meaning to the [[human skull]]. The most common symbolic use of the skull is as a representation of death and mortality.

Humans can often recognize the buried fragments of an only partially revealed [[Human skull|cranium]] even when other bones may look like shards of stone.  The human brain has a specific region for recognizing faces,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangor.ac.uk/news/BrainArea.htm (University of Wales, Bangor) "New function identified for an area of the brain"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206061817/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/news/BrainArea.htm |date=December 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is so attuned to finding them that it can see faces in a few [[Smiley|dots and lines]] or [[Emoticon|punctuation marks]]; the human brain cannot separate the image of the human skull from the familiar human face. Because of this, both the death and the now past life of the skull are symbolized.

Moreover, a human skull with its large eye sockets displays a degree of [[neoteny]], which humans often find [[cuteness|visually appealing]]—yet a skull is also obviously [[death|dead]]. As such, human skulls often have a greater visual appeal than the other bones of the [[human skeleton]], and can fascinate even as they repel. Our present society predominantly associates skulls with death and evil. However, to some ancient societies it is believed to have had the opposite association, where objects like crystal skulls represent "life": the honoring of humanity in the flesh and the embodiment of consciousness.

[[Unicode]] reserves character U+1F480 (💀) for a human skull [[pictogram]].

==Examples==

The skull that is often engraved or carved on the head of early [[New England]] tombstones might be merely a symbol of mortality, but the skull is also often backed by an angelic pair of wings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prairieghosts.com/grave_symbols.html Tony Taylor, "The Mystery of Graveyard Art &amp; Symbols"]&lt;/ref&gt; lofting mortality beyond its own death.
[[Image:Allisvanity.jpg|right|thumb|250px|alt=lady at round mirror and dressing table resembling a skull "All is Vanity" by C. Allan Gilbert|''All is Vanity'' by [[C. Allan Gilbert]], 1873-1929]]
One of the best-known examples of skull symbolism occurs in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', where the title character recognizes the skull of an old friend: "Alas, poor [[Yorick]]! I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest. . ." Hamlet is inspired to utter a bitter soliloquy of despair and rough ironic humor.

Compare Hamlet's words "Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft" to [[Talmudic]] sources: "...Rabi Ishmael [the High Priest]... put [the severed head of a martyr] in his lap... and cried: oh sacred mouth!...who buried you in ashes...!". The skull was a symbol of [[Melancholia|melancholy]] for Shakespeare's contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s ''[[Melencolia I|Melencolia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Elizabethan]] [[England]], The Death's-Head [[Human skull|Skull]], usually a depiction without the lower jawbone, was emblematic of bawds, rakes, Sexual Adventurers and prostitutes; The term Deaths-Head was actually parlance for these rakes, and most of them wore half-skull rings to advertise their station, either professionally or otherwise. The original Rings were wide silver objects, with a half-skull decoration not much wider than the rest of the band; This allowed it to be rotated around the finger to hide the skull in polite company, and to reposition it in the presence of likely conquests.

[[Image:Calavera.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Sugar skull given for the Day of the Dead, made with chocolate and amaranth from Mexico|Sugar skull given for the Day of the Dead, made with [[chocolate]] and [[amaranth]]]]Skulls and skeletons are the main symbol of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[holiday]], [[Day of the Dead]].

[[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] painters of the 16th century elaborated moral allegories for their patrons, and ''memento mori'' was a common theme. The theme carried by an inscription on a rustic tomb,  "[[Et in Arcadia ego]]"&amp;mdash;"I too [am] in [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]]", if it is Death that is speaking&amp;mdash;is made famous by two paintings by [[Nicholas Poussin]], but the motto made its pictorial debut in [[Guercino]]'s version, 1618-22 (in the [[Galleria Barberini]], Rome): in it, two awestruck young shepherds come upon an inscribed plinth, in which the inscription &lt;small&gt;ET IN ARCADIA EGO&lt;/small&gt; gains force from the prominent presence of a wormy skull in the foreground.

Next to [[Mary Magdalene]]'s dressing-mirror, in a convention of Baroque painting {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, the Skull has quite different connotations and reminds the viewer that the Magdalene has become a symbol for repentance. In [[C. Allan Gilbert]]'s much-reproduced lithograph of a lovely [[Gibson Girl]] seated at her fashionable toilette, an observer can witness its transformation into an alternate image. A ghostly echo of the worldly Magdalene's repentance motif lurks behind this turn-of-the 20th century icon.

The skull becomes an [[icon]] itself when its painted representation becomes a substitute for the real thing. [[Simon Schama]] chronicled the ambivalence of the Dutch to their own worldly success during the [[Dutch Golden Age]] of the first half of the 17th century in ''[[The Embarrassment of Riches]].'' The possibly frivolous and merely decorative nature of the [[still life]] genre was avoided by [[Pieter Claesz]] in his ''[[Vanitas]]'' (illustration, below right): Skull, opened case-watch, overturned emptied wineglasses, snuffed candle, book: "Lo, the wine of life runs out, the spirit is snuffed, oh Man, for all your learning, time yet runs on: Vanity!" The visual cues of the hurry and violence of life are contrasted with [[eternity]] in this somber, still and utterly silent painting.
[[Image:Pieter Claesz 002b.jpg|left|thumb|250px|alt=Skull on table ''Vanitas'', by Pieter Claesz, painted in 1630 from the Mauritzhuis, The Hague|''Vanitas'', by Pieter Claesz, 1630 (Mauritzhuis, The Hague)]]

When the skull appears in Nazi SS insignia, the death's-head (''[[Totenkopf]]'') represents loyalty unto death. However, when [[tattoo]]ed on the forearm its [[apotropaic]] power helps an [[outlaw motorcycle club|outlaw biker]] cheat death.&lt;ref&gt;Margo DeMello, ''Bodies of Inscription: A Cultural History of the Modern Tattoo Community'', (Duke University Press) 2000, ch. "Creation of Meaning" explores the semiotics of modern tattooing.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]] signify "Poison" when they appear on a glass bottle containing a white powder, or any container in general. But it is not the same [[emblem]] when it flies high above the deck as the [[Jolly Roger]]: there the pirate death's-head epitomizes the pirates' ruthlessness and despair; their usage of death imagery might be paralleled with their occupation challenging the natural order of things.&lt;ref&gt;"In Virginia in 1720 one of the six pirates facing the gallows  "called for a Bottle of Wine, and taking a Glass of it, he drank Damnation to the Governour and Confusion to the Colony", which the Rest pledg'd". ([[Marcus Rediker]], "Under the Banner of King Death": The Social World of Anglo-American Pirates, 1716 to 1726" ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, '''38'''.2 (April 1981:203-227) p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; "Pirates also affirmed their unity symbolically", Marcus Rediker asserts, remarking the skeleton or skull symbol with bleeding heart and hourglass on the black pirate ensign, and asserting "it triad of interlocking symbols— death, violence, limited time—simultaneously pointed to meaningful parts of the seaman's experience, and eloquently bespoke the pirates' own consciousness of themselves as preyed upon in turn. Pirates seized the symbol of mortality from ship captains who used the skull 'as a marginal sign in their logs to indicate the record of a death'"&lt;ref&gt;Rediker 1981:221, and 223, quoting S. Charles Hill, "Episodes of piracy in Eastern waters", ''Indian Antiquary'' '''49''' (1920:37).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ECB Hazard Symbol T.svg|ECB Hazard Symbol T|left|thumb|173px|Today, humans typically note the skull and crossbones sign as the almost universal symbol for [[toxicity]].]]

When a skull was worn as a trophy on the belt of the Lombard king [[Alboin]], it was a constant grim triumph over his old enemy, and he drank from it. In the same way a skull is a warning when it decorates the palisade of a city, or deteriorates on a pike at a [[Tower of London|Traitor's Gate]]. The [[Skull Tower]], with the embedded skulls of Serbian rebels, was built in 1809 on the highway near [[Niš]], Serbia, as a stark political warning from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government.  In this case the skulls ''are'' the statement:  that the current owner had the power to kill the former. "Drinking out of a skull the blood of slain (sacrificial) enemies is mentioned by [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] and [[Livy]],&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch is referring to Livy xxiii.24, of events of 216 BCE: "Postumius died there fighting with all his might not to be captured alive. The Gauls stripped him of all his spoils and the [[Boii]] took his severed head in a procession to the holiest of their temples.There it was cleaned and the bare skull was adorned with gold, as is their custom. It was used thereafter as a sacred vessel on special occasions and as a ritual drinking-cup by their priests and temple officials."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Solinus]] describes the Irish custom of bathing the face in the blood of the slain and drinking it."&lt;ref&gt;J.A. MacCulloch, ''The Religion of the Ancient Celts'' 1911:239f.&lt;/ref&gt; The rafters of a traditional [[Jívaro]] medicine house in Peru,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.head-hunter.com/account.html F.W. Up De Graff. ''Head hunters of the Amazon: Seven Years of Exploration and Adventure'', New York: Garden City 1925 p. 273-283]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321230147/http://www.head-hunter.com/account.html |date=March 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in New Guinea. The temple of [[Kali]] is veneered with skulls, but the goddess Kali offers life through the welter of blood. The late medieval and Early Renaissance Northern and Italian painters place the skull where it lies at the foot of the [[Cross]] at [[Golgotha]] ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for ''the place of the skull''). But for them it has become quite specifically the skull of [[Adam]].

The [[Serpent (symbolism)|Serpent]] crawling through the eyes of a skull is a familiar image that survives in contemporary [[Goth subculture]]. The serpent is a [[chthonic]] god of knowledge and of immortality, because he sloughs off his skin. The serpent guards the Tree in the Greek [[Hesperides|Garden of the Hesperides]] and, later, a Tree in the [[Garden of Eden]]. The serpent in the skull is always making its way through the socket that was the eye: knowledge persists beyond death, the emblem says, and the serpent has the secret.

The skull speaks. It says ''"[[Et in Arcadia ego]]"'' or simply ''"[[Vanitas]]."''  In a first-century mosaic tabletop from a [[Pompeii]]an [[triclinium]] (now in Naples), the skull is crowned with a [[carpenter's square]] and [[plumb bob|plumb-bob]], which dangles before its empty eyesockets (Death as the great leveller), while below is an image of the ephemeral and changeable nature of life: a butterfly atop a wheel&amp;mdash;a table for a philosopher's ''[[symposium]]''.

Similarly, a skull might be seen crowned by a chaplet of dried roses, a "''[[Carpe diem]]''", though rarely as bedecked as Mexican printmaker [[José Guadalupe Posada]]'s [[La Catrina|Catrina]].
In [[Mesoamerican architecture]], [[Tzompantli|stacks of skulls]] (real or sculpted) represented the result of [[human sacrifice in Aztec culture|human sacrifices]].
The skull speaks in the catacombs of the Capuchin brothers beneath the church of [[Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini|Santa Maria della Concezione]] in Rome,&lt;ref name="Cappucini"&gt;[http://www.cappucciniviaveneto.it/cappuccini_ing.html The Crypt: Church of the Immaculate].

:''Noi eravamo quello che voi siete, e quello che noi siamo voi sarete.''
:"We were what you are; and what we are, you will be."

An old [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] folktale&lt;ref&gt;William R. Bascom: ''[[Ifá]] Divination: Communication Between Gods and Men in West Africa'' (Indiana) {{ISBN|0-253-20638-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; tells of a man who encountered a skull mounted on a post by the wayside.  To his astonishment, the skull spoke.  The man asked the skull why it was mounted there.  The skull said that it was mounted there for talking.  The man then went to the [[monarch|king]], and told the king of the marvel he had found, a talking skull.  The king and the man returned to the place where the skull was mounted; the skull remained silent.  The king then commanded that the man be [[beheading|beheaded]], and ordered that his head be mounted in place of the skull.

In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist iconography, skull symbolism is often used in depictions of [[wrathful deities]] and of [[dakinis]].

"'''Im schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon'''" ("In [[Ashkelon]]'s Black Whale") is a popular academic [[commercium song]]. It was known as a beer-drinking song in many German speaking ancient universities. [[Joseph Victor von Scheffel]] provided the lyrics under the title '''''Altassyrisch''''' ([[Assyria|Old Assyrian]]) 1854, the melody is from 1783 or earlier&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lieder-archiv.de/im_schwarzen_walfisch_zu_askalon-notenblatt_600700.html Lieder-Archiv (de) (Song Archive)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Content ==
The lyrics reflect an endorsement of the [[bacchanalia]]n mayhem of student life, similar as in [[Gaudeamus igitur]]. The song describes an [[Assyria|old Assyrian]] [[drinking binge]] of a man in an inn with some references to the [[Classics]]. The desks are made of marble and the large invoice is being provided in [[cuneiform]] on bricks. However the carouser has to admit that he left his money already in Nineveh. A Nubian house servant kicks him out then and the song closes with the notion, that (compare John 4:44) a prophet has no honor in his own country, if he doesn't pay cash for his consumption.  [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] has translated the poems among other works of Scheffel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], Gaudeamus! Humorous Poems by Joseph Viktor von Scheffel, [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35848?msg=welcome_stranger#bibrec Ebook-Nr. 35848 on gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Each stanza begins with the naming verse "Im Schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon", but varies the outcome. The "Im" is rather prolonged with the melody and increases the impact. Some of the stanzas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Im schwarzen Wallfisch zu Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
Da trank ein Mann drei Tag',
&lt;br&gt;
Bis dass er steif wie ein Besenstiel
&lt;br&gt;
Am Marmortische lag.
&lt;br&gt;

'In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
A man drank day by day,
&lt;br&gt;
Till, stiff as any broom-handle,
&lt;br&gt;
Upon the floor he lay.
&lt;br&gt;

...

In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
The waiters brought the bill,
&lt;br&gt;
In arrow-heads on six broad tiles
&lt;br&gt;
To him who thus did swill.
&lt;br&gt;

...

In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
No prophet hath renown;
&lt;br&gt;
And he who there would drink in peace
&lt;br&gt;
Must pay the money down.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In typical manner of Scheffel, it contains an anachronistic mixture of various times and eras, parodistic notions on current science,&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to German Poetry: A Dual-Language Book, Gustave Mathieu, Guy Stern Courier Dover Publications, 31.05.2012, including as well a translation 
&lt;/ref&gt; as e.g. [[Historical criticism]] and interpretations of the [[Book of Jonah]] as a mere shipwrecking narrative. According to Scheffel, the guest didn't try to get back in the inn as „Aussi bini, aussi bleibi, wai Ascalun, ihr grobi Kaibi“ (I been out, I stay so, you rude Aschkelon calves). There are various additional verses, including political parodist ones and verses mocking different sorts of fraternities.
The song has been used as name for traditional inns and restaurants, e.g. in Heidelberg and [[Bad Säckingen]]. In Bad Säckingen the name was used on several (consecutive) inns and was namegiver for the still existing club "Walfisch Gesellschaft Säckingen" (Walfischia), honoring Scheffel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotel-restaurant-schwarzer-walfisch.de/de/geschichte.html Hotel-Restaurant “Zum Schwarzen Walfisch” Bad Säckingen]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematics International ==
There is one version just and only one for mathematics, called 'International'.&lt;ref&gt;History of Mathematics: A Supplement C. Smoryński, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ancient times, upon the door &lt;br&gt;
Of Plato, there was writt'n: &lt;br&gt;
“To each non-mathematicus &lt;br&gt;
The entrance is forbidd'n.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The same stanza is available in further 13 languages, including Greek (Μελαίνῃ τῇ ἐν Φαλαίνᾳ - Melaínē (black) tē (the) en (in) Phalaína (whale)) and Volapük, which are sung one after the other.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5967">'''Individualistic culture''' is a society which is characterized by [[individualism]], which is the prioritization or emphasis, of the individual over the entire group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Individualistic cultures are oriented around the self, being independent instead of identifying with a group mentality. They see each other as only loosely linked, and value personal goals over group interests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Individualistic cultures tend to have a more diverse population and are characterized with emphasis on personal achievements, and a rational assessment of both the beneficial and detrimental aspects of relationships with others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Individualistic cultures have such unique aspects of communication as being a low power-distance culture and having a low-context communication style. Highly individualistic cultures include the U.S., Australia, Great Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Company of Others: An Introduction to Communication|last=Rothwell|first=J.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=65–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low power distance==
Power distance is defined to be the degree to which unequal distribution of power is accepted in a culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low power distance cultures challenge authority, encourage a reduction of power differences between management and employees, and encourage the use of power legitimately. Low power distance is more likely to occur in an individualistic culture, because in a collectivist culture, people protect the well being of the group and established order&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; so they would be less likely to challenge authority or people in power. Even though individualistic cultures are more likely to be low power distance, these cultures don't expect to completely eliminate power difference. People within this low power distance culture, however, are more likely to respond to such imbalances in power with more negative emotional responses than in the alternative, high power distance cultures. Low power distance cultures include Austria, Israel, Denmark, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, and Sweden. The U.S. ranks 38th on the scale.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Low-context communication style==
Individualistic cultures are also more likely to have a low-context communication style. This means that communication is precise, direct, and specific.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hidden Differences: Doing Business with the Japanese|last=Hall|first=Edward|publisher=Anchor Press/Doubleday|year=1987|isbn=0385238835|location=University of California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in high-context communication, reading between the lines is not necessary in low-context communication. This explicit communication is used in order to prevent any form of misunderstanding between cultures.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ability to articulate the thoughts and opinions one holds as well as to express them eloquently are encouraged, as is persuasive speaking. Low-context communication is all content and no relationship dimension.

== Emotion display and display rules ==
Individualistic cultures tend to prioritize the individual person over the group,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture's Consequences|last=Hofstede|first=Geert|publisher=SAGE|year=2001|isbn=0803973241|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this can be seen in how the display rules vary from a collectivist culture compared to an individualistic culture. Display rules are the rules that exist in different cultures that determine how emotion should be displayed publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekman|first=Paul|date=1975|title=Facial Areas and Emotional Information|url=|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=25|pages=21–29|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1975.tb00577.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an individualistic culture, self-expression is highly valued, making the display rules less strict and allowing people to display intense emotion such as: happiness, anger, love, etc. While in a collectivist culture, moderation and self-control is highly valued for the well being of the group, and collectivist cultures therefore tend to restrain from showing emotion in public.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Conflict strategies ==
Conflict strategies are methods used to resolve different problems. There are different approaches to resolving conflict, and depending the culture a person is brought up in, the more likely it is for them to use a certain approach. Since individualistic culture sets greater value to personal achievement, contrary to collectivist cultures who value harmony,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=H.S|date=2006|title=The effects of national culture and face concerns on intention to apologize|url=|journal=Journal of Intercultural Communication Research|volume=3|pages=183–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is more likely for a person from an individualistic culture to use competition as their method of resolving conflict. When using competition as an approach to resolving conflict, a person is more confrontational and seeks to achieve his or her own goals with no regard of the goals of others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sillars|first=A.|date=1980|title=Attributions and communication in roommate conflicts|url=|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=47|pages=180–200|doi=10.1080/03637758009376031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this approach a person seeks domination, which means to get others to do what the person wants instead of what they initially wanted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the contrary, a collectivist culture would more likely use a less confrontational approach such as accommodation to end the conflict with compromise so that each party is benefited.

==Conflict==
An intergenerational conflict is either a conflict situation between teenagers and adults or a more abstract conflict between two generations, which often involves all inclusive{{dubious|reason= colleague probably meant "all-inclusive"|date=July 2018}}prejudices against another generation.

Intergenerational conflict also describes cultural, social, or economic discrepancies between generations, which may be caused by shifts in [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] or [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] between younger and older generations. An example are changes to an [[inter-generational contract]] that may be necessary to reflect a change in [[demographics]]. It is associated with the term "[[generation gap]]".

==Contract==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2008}}
An inter-generational contract is a dependency between different generations based on the assumption that future generations, in honoring the ''contract'', will provide a service to a generation that has previously done the same service to an older generation.

The most common use of the term is in [[Social security|statutory pension insurance provisions]] and refers to the consensus to provide [[pension]] for the retired generations through payments made by the working generations.

==Cycle of violence==
Intergenerational [[cycles of violence]] occur when violence is passed from father or mother to son or daughter, parent to child, or sibling to sibling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abusivelove.com/abuse_types_1_11.htm Intergenerational Cycle Of Abuse] AbusiveLove.com. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  It often refers to violent behavior learned as a child and then repeated as an adult, therefore continuing on in a perceived cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, A. A. (2005). The Relationship Between Adolescent Physical Abuse and Criminal Offending: Support for an Enduring and Generalized Cycle of Violence. ''Journal of Family Violence.'' 20(5):279-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equity==

{{main|Intergenerational equity}}
Intergenerational equity, in the sociological and psychological context, is the concept or idea of [[Social justice|fairness]] or [[justice]] in relationships between [[children]], [[youth]], [[adults]] and [[Old age|seniors]], particularly in terms of treatment and interactions. It has been studied in environmental and sociological settings.&lt;ref&gt;Foot, D. &amp; Venne, R. (2005) "Awakening to the Intergenerational Equity Debate in Canada." ''Journal of Canadian Studies.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of institutional [[investment management]], intergenerational equity is the principle that an [[endowed institution]]'s spending rate must not exceed its [[after-inflation rate]] of [[compound return]], so that investment gains are spent equally on current and future constituents of the endowed assets. This concept was originally set out in 1974 by [[economist]] [[James Tobin]], who wrote that, "The trustees of endowed institutions are the guardians of the future against the claims of the present. Their task in managing the endowment is to preserve equity among generations."&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, James.  (1974) "[http://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v64y1974i2p427-32.html What is Permanent Endowment Income?]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversations about intergenerational equity occur across several fields.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) [http://www.globalepe.org/values_ie.html EPE Values: Intergenerational Ethics] Earth and Peace Education Associates International website.&lt;/ref&gt; They include [[transition economics]],&lt;ref&gt;(2005) [http://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/pie/Japanese/seminar/A6-workshop0503/index.html "Economics of Intergenerational Equity in Transition Economies"] 10–11 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[social policy]], and [[government budget|government budget-making]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. (2003) [http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rp/2002-03/03RP07.htm Research Paper no. 7 2002-03 Intergenerational Equity: Issues of Principle in the Allocation of Social Resources Between this Generation and the Next]. Social Policy Group for the Parliament of Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;  Intergenerational equity is also explored in [[Environmentalism|environmental]] concerns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index165.html Gosseries, A. (2008) “Theories of intergenerational justice: a synopsis”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''1''' (1) ]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[sustainable development]],&lt;ref&gt;(2005) [http://www.fathom.com/course/21701763/session3.html Understanding Sustainable Development] Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[global warming]] and [[climate change]]. 

Conversations about intergenerational equity are also relevant to [[social justice]] arenas as well, where issues such as [[health care]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, A. (1997) "Intergenerational equity: An exploration of the 'fair innings' argument." ''Health Economics. 6''(2):117-32.&lt;/ref&gt; are equal in importance to [[youth rights]] and [[youth voice]] are pressing and urgent. There is a strong interest within the legal community towards the application of intergenerational equity in law.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brein, M. (n.d.) ''Not, 'Is it Irreparable?' But, 'Is it Unnecessary?' Thoughts on a Practical Limit for Intergenerational Equity Suits.'' Eugene, OR: Constitutional Law Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intergenerational policies==
{{main|Intergenerational policy}}
An intergenerational policy is a public policy that incorporates an intergenerational approach to addressing an issue or has an impact across the generations. Approaching policy from an intergenerational perspective is based on an understanding of the [[interdependence]] and reciprocity that characterizes the relationship between the generations.  

An intergenerational approach to public policy recognizes that generations share basic needs including adequate income, access to quality health care and social services, educational and employment opportunities, and a safe place to live.  Further, policies that are supportive of any age group must build on the common concerns of all generations.&lt;ref&gt;Generations United.  (2010) "[http://ipath.gu.org/Guidi8151317.asp Guiding Principles]"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Inter-generational ministry}}
Intergenerational ministry is a model of [[religious ministry (Christian)|Christian ministry]] which emphasizes relationships between age groups and encourages mixed-age activities.

Inter-generational ministry stands in contrast with other modes of ministry more traditionally seen in [[local church]]es, such as Sunday schools and youth ministries.

In [[Sunday school]], children, youths, and sometimes adults, are instructed by [[teacher]]s who are, typically, adults. Classes are usually divided by age groups, as in secular schools. In [[youth ministry|youth ministries]], teens or young adults (especially college age) gather in groups presided over by a "youth minister". These groups, which are often part of [[parachurch]] organizations, focus on peer fellowship and instruction of their members.

These modes of ministry segregate members by age, and presuppose a hierarchical ministry in which more experienced, more educated, and generally older members minister didactically to their charges. Inter-generational activities, by contrast, emphasize a mixture of ages, and de-emphasize formal teacher-pupil relationships.

Inter-generational ministry is one of a number of movements which have arisen in response over concerns that young adults very commonly cease participation in church, and often do not return. Proponents of the inter-generational ministry movement hold that the hierarchical and [[didactic]] roles found in traditional church ministries deprive teens and young adults of a sense of purpose and involvement, since their role in these ministries is passive and subordinate, and since they are often kept separate from adult activities{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. Therefore, they propose that younger members should take active roles in the ministry of the local church, and that church activities should involve and encourage participation from members across a wide range of ages.

A second thread in the inter-generational ministry movement is that of family involvement. Concerns over [[divorce]], abuse and other family disruptions led to criticism of how traditional church activities typically segregate family members according to age, thus de-emphasizing family relationships. Inter-generational activities were seen as a means to involve families as units, thus reinforcing family bonds.

Studies {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} show that children attending [[Sunday Schools]] and youth programs are less likely to continue church involvement, compared to those who attended worship with parents, and are integrated into a community (e.g., Mark de Vries ''Family-Based Youth Ministry'', 2004). Those children who continue church involvement as adults often have a ‘nominal faith’ (e.g. George Barna ''Transforming children into Spiritual Champions'', 2003).

Proponents of this mode of ministry claim it is a [[Bible|Biblical]] model - particularly when the ministry is located within the [[family]] in accordance with the 'relational' [[Judaism|Hebrew]] model described in Deuteronomy 6.

[[File:Visitbamiyan.JPG|thumb|VisitBamiyan was created in August 2009 to market [[Bamiyan]] to the rest of the world.]]

'''International tourism advertising''' is [[tourism]]-related marketing on the part of a private or public entity directed towards audiences abroad, and might target potential travelers and non-travelers alike.  Wholly private firms such as travel agencies, hotel chains, cruise agencies, [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations (NGOs)]] often run their own advertising campaigns to market their existence, mission, or services and/or goods offered to the consumer, and these advertisements seldom carry intentional political messages.

On the other hand, advertising distributed by governments themselves, such as through tourism ministries or government-owned private sector enterprises, is sometimes intended to convey more than simply the value of the product, service, or experience; governments can use tourism ads as a channel for communicating directly to the public of other countries because tourism is a common and internationally encouraged industry and the advertising of it is subject to minimal content regulation.

As the global travel market continues to expand with yearly increasing flights among international destinations, advertising efforts on the part of the major actors in this market are also increasing. [[Advertising]] campaigns to promote travel to destinations abroad are particularly prevalent in western countries where the general public's expenditures on tourism tend to be consistently high, even in light of the [[Late-2000s recession|economic recession]]. 

Many advertisers, which include both private entities and foreign governments themselves, share the intended goal of increasing their own revenue by popularizing their service (e.g., airline or hotel chain) or destination to boost receipts from travelers; however, some travel campaigns have additional or alternative purposes, such as promoting good public sentiments or improving existing ones towards them among the target audience.  Sometimes, states may use the branding of a product or service, itself, as a means of conveying a specific message without explicitly stating the message; this tactic is often used to soften the implied message itself, thus allowing the brander to sidestep or minimize controversy and/or opposition.

==Types==
Tourism advertising can take many forms, utilize a wide array of advertising tactics, and be driven by a scope of private or public intents. ''Destination advertising'' is designed to make a location itself seem more appealing, while ''travel services advertising'' seeks to gain an audience's buy-in for the tourism-related service or product. Below are some instances of international tourism advertising overlapping with states' political, economic, and/or social interests.

===Destination advertising===
A great degree of ads promoting foreign countries are produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often serve as [[Public diplomacy|vehicles for political statements and/or depictions]] of the destination country's desired foreign public perception(s).  Following are only a few of the many examples of government-produced tourism destination advertising that also serve political or social functions.

====Bahamas====
The Bahamas are commonly considered to be a focal point of leisure and recreational travel in the Caribbean and the island nation advertises itself as such.  Television ads and website produced by the government of the Bahamas specifically foster the image of the islands providing a care-free, exciting, culturally rich, and even romantic experience for travelers; a recent slogan for the marketing campaign was "It's better in the Bahamas" to reinforce the contrast between the desired perception as a low-stress getaway and the hectic nature of whatever living environment tourists would be leaving behind.  The Bahamas have, however, actually traditionally seen high violent crime rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahamasb2b.com/news/2010/11/pm-addresses-issue-of-rising-violent-crime-4224.html|title=PM Addresses Issue Of Rising Violent Crime|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the tourism marketing attempts to focus the audience's attention on the azure water and beaches and draw it away from any negative elements of life there.  [[Perception management|Managing perceptions]] is a common part of advertising of many consumer products and services, focusing the audience's mind solely on the desirable aspects of whatever is being sold and away from any possible drawbacks or consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahamas.com/ |title=Official tourism website of the Bahamas |publisher=Bahamas.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
The common impression of [[India]] in the West has long been either negative—including perceptions of widespread poverty, lack of sophisticated hygiene, and violent ethnic and religious clashes—or ambivalent, so the Indian government's Ministry of Tourism began a marketing campaign, "Incredible !ndia," to emphasize the country's rich culture, historic sites, tourist attractions, and general sense of excitement and dynamism to western audiences.  Tourism is an extremely lucrative and growing global industry so it is no surprise that India, a developing nation, is striving to capitalize on that market to boost its economy.  In addition, India is also looking to strengthen its international security and diplomatic ties while broadening and deepening its trade relationships, especially with the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/itp/us-india.asp |title=U.S.-India Trade Relations, U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service, 4 August 2010 |publisher=Fas.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; so it is in India's interest to promote a positive light for itself among the American and western voting populations in order to garner future international support and aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incredibleindia.org/index.html |title=Indian Ministry of Tourism's official advertising website |publisher=Incredibleindia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kazakhstan====
After the 2006 release of the [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] comedy ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan|Borat]]'', which depicts a politically incorrect and socially oblivious fictional Kazakhi reporter who travels throughout the United States interviewing and meeting Americans from various walks of life, the government of [[Kazakhstan]] was highly offended by the depiction of its less than two-decade-old country and [[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan#Criticism by Kazakhstan|criticized the film]] and its creator as being defamatory and slanderous.  The issue of preserving Kazakhstan's public image in light of the movie was of such high importance that Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] had it listed as a main issue when he traveled to the U.S. in September 2006 to meet with then-President [[George W. Bush]].  Coupled with Nazarbeyev's visit, according to Kazakhstan embassy spokesman Roman Vassilenko, the Kazakh government staged a large-scale public relations "blitz," including "running four-page ads in The New York Times and U.S. News and World Report and commercials on CNN and the local ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6276973 |title=Kazakhstan Embassy Responds to Borat, 16 October 2006 |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as launching TV ads to promote tourism to Kazakhstan.  These travel ads specifically featured cultural and historical features of the country as well as views of its developed infrastructure, specifically to counter the type of impression given by the Borat character to the West that Kazakhstan is socially and physically underdeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kazakhembus.com/index.php?page=travel-tourism |title=Kazakh Embassy's official travel &amp; tourism website |publisher=Kazakhembus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
Recently in 2010 the Tourism Board of [[Mexico]], a public office that aggregates the resources and interests of the federal, state, and municipal governments, launched a tourism advertising campaign in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]—Mexico's two [[North American Free Trade Agreement|North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)]] partners—geared towards renovating common public political and social perceptions of Mexico, including impressions of poverty, government and law enforcement corruption, petty and organized crime and drug trading, and illegal immigration into the U.S.; the new campaign's purpose is expressly demonstrated by its marketing slogan, "Mexico, the place you thought you knew."  The print and television ads feature views of Mexico's beaches, natural wonders, cultural festivities, and historical artifacts like Mayan pyramids and Spanish churches in order to provide a counterbalance to the less preferable popular preconceptions.  The Tourism Board's stated goal of the advertising surge is to "generat[e] more than three [positive] impressions per person" among the North American audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Otilia Otlacan |url=http://www.adoperationsonline.com/2010/08/18/mexico-tourism-board-launches-advertising-campaign-in-north-america/ |title=Mexico Tourism Board Launches Advertising Campaign in North America, 18 August 2010 |publisher=Adoperationsonline.com |date=2010-08-18 |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The eventual goal is likely to increase tourism revenue for the country, but, for now, the Tourism Board is focusing on [[Public diplomacy|managing perceptions]] among the general populations of Mexico's two major neighboring trade partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmexico.com/wb/Visitmexico/Visi_Home?show=regions%2F|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20110720100348/http://www.visitmexico.com/wb/Visitmexico/Visi_Home?show=regions%2F|deadurl=yes|title=::- VISIT MEXICO -:: Home|date=20 July 2011|archivedate=20 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Destination slogans====

Many countries use slogans in their international tourism advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.familybreakfinder.co.uk/holidays/map-every-countrys-tourism-slogan/|title=Map Shows Every Country's Tourism Slogan|website=www.familybreakfinder.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Destination slogans aim to promote a positive identity for the country. Academic studies of these slogans have identified several common themes such as the physical beauty of the location or the positive experiences travellers can expect to have there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/100085/GRADU-1479373517.pdf?sequence=1|title="Be Our Guest" – A Linguistic Study of Destination Slogans|last=Häkkinen|first=Minttu-Maari|date=October 2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel services advertising===

Additionally, a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which also advertise separately from the destinations, themselves, are owned by their respective governments, such as the [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airline]] ([[Dubai]]), [[Qatar Airways]] ([[Qatar]]), [[China Airlines]] ([[Taiwan]]/[[Republic of China]]), and [[Air China]] ([[People's Republic of China]]).

====China Airways and Air China====
[[China Airlines]] is the official flag carrier airline of [[Taiwan]].  The Taiwanese government refers to its state as the Republic of China and considers itself to be the legitimate, non-Communist leadership-in-exile of all of China since the Communist overthrow in the mid-1950s.  The name of the airline carries the message of the long-lasting and ongoing cultural and [[Cross-Strait relations|political conflict]] between Communist "mainland" [[People's Republic of China|China (PRC)]] and Taiwan, that the Republic of China is the "true" China and that the state commonly referred to as "China" is illegitimate and usurped control of the country from the rightful leadership.  Similarly, the PRC counters this message by having named one of its largest international carriers "[[Air China]]" to reinforce the PRC's claim to be the legitimate of the "two Chinas."  The implicit conflict between the two states is likely lost on the majority of the general public outside the [[East Asia|immediate region]], such as the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], but the strategic use of using advertising and targeting the international community through tourism is apparent on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china-airlines.com/en/index.htm |title=Official global website of China Airlines |language=zh |publisher=China-airlines.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507051752/http://www.china-airlines.com/en/index.htm |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airchina.com/ |title=Official global website of Air China |publisher=Airchina.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emirates====
Through advertising for the Emirates airline, one of the major themes that Dubai promotes is its evolving status as a geographic and economic player in the Middle East.  Emirates advertising describes Dubai as "the perfect hub for an expanding global network" and illustrates this claim in the airline's "Centre of the World" television ad.  On the other hand, Dubai subtly promotes an official stance of multinationalism and a stated intent to cater to the comfort of travelers from abroad in the Emirates' "Multinational Cabin Crew" television ad.  These positions, among others, are portrayed via visually and audibly appealing commercials which are designed to relate to the target audience(s) and make the ads' messages maximally amenable to global viewers.  Emirates additionally adds to its effort to appeal to the West through its sponsorship of the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal Football Club]], including constructing the team's new venue, [[Emirates Stadium]], which opened in July 2006 and prominently displays the Emirates branding on the exterior; in this way, any depictions of the stadium will result in de facto advertising and reinforce the public recognition of the Emirates company as one that is associated with western sports and culture. In May 2013 three Arsenal players, Kieran Gibbs, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Carl Jenkinson took an A380 flight simulator challenge. Swapping their usual airline passenger seats and stepping into the cockpit, the players attempted to land an A380 in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaichronicle.com/2013/05/28/arsenals-trio-attempts-to-land-an-a380-in-dubai/|title=Arsenal's trio attempts to land an A380 in Dubai|author=Editor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emirates, along with the aviation services company [[Dnata]], is owned by the parent company [[The Emirates Group]] which, in turn, is wholly owned by the Government of Dubai.  The chairman and CEO of The Emirates Group, HH Sheikh [[Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], is the younger brother of the former ruler of Dubai, HH Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], and uncle of the current ruler, HH Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum]].  In 1985, Sheikh Ahmed was appointed President of the Dubai Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), the governing body for airline regulation and airport control and operation.  The DCA was restructured and expanded in 2007, thus creating the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) which has since been the airline regulatory authority in the Emirate and the Dubai Airports company which owns and operates Dubai’s airports, Dubai International and the currently under-construction Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International.&lt;ref name="theemiratesgroup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theemiratesgroup.com/english/our-company/leadership/hh-sheikh-ahmed-bin-saeed-al-maktoum.aspx |title=HH Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, The Emirates Group (Leadership profiles), 2010 |publisher=Theemiratesgroup.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dubai International]] (IATA: DXB) is a primary international hub in the Middle East, offering flights to every continent except Antarctica.  As of November 2010, DXB is the 6th busiest airport in the world for cargo traffic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-212-219-227_666_2__ |title=Year to date Cargo Traffic, Airports Council International, 11 November 2010 |publisher=Airports.org |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 14th highest passenger throughput of all international airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-212-218-222_666_2__ |title=Year to date passenger traffic, Airports Council International, 11 November 2010 |publisher=Airports.org |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2012-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111152406/http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-212-218-222_666_2__ |archivedate=11 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Ahmed currently simultaneously holds the positions of Chairman and CEO of Emirates Airline &amp; Group, which includes the Emirates airline and Dnata air services company, Chairman of the Dubai Airports company, and President of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority.&lt;ref name="theemiratesgroup.com"/&gt;  Because Dubai's government leadership is directly involved and intertwined with private-sector enterprises, including the Emirates airline and many other facets of the tourism industry, the government there necessarily has a vested interest in the public perception of Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emirates.com |title=Official global website of Emirates |publisher=Emirates.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2014}}

{{Hindu scriptures}}
'''Kalpa''' ({{lang-sa|कल्प}}) means "proper, fit" and is one of the six disciplines of the [[Vedanga|Vedānga]], or ancillary science connected with the [[Vedas]] – the scriptures of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca339/&gt; This field of study focused on procedures and ceremonies associated with Vedic [[ritual]] practice.{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|p=313}}&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca339&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Kalpa" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 339&lt;/ref&gt;

The major texts of Kalpa Vedanga are called ''Kalpa Sutras'' in Hinduism.{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|1963|p=252}} The scope of these texts includes Vedic rituals, rites of passage rituals associated with major life events such as birth, wedding and death in family, as well as personal conduct and proper duties in the life of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC |year=1999 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |isbn=978-0-87779-044-0|pages=629 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Kalpasutras texts have experienced interpolation, changes and consequent corruption over their history, and Apasthamba Kalpasutra ancillary to the [[Yajurveda]] may be the best preserved text in this genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle |title=The Dharmasutras: The Law Codes of Ancient India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0YTQ9Ty8r4C |year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-160604-5 |pages=xxv-xxviii with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalpa Sutras are also found in other Indian traditions such as [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moriz Winternitz|title=A History of Indian Literature: Buddhist literature and Jaina literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lgz1eMhu0JsC|year=1988 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-0265-0|pages=412–413, 444–446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Kalpa is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means "proper, fit, competent, sacred precept", and also refers to one of the six [[Vedanga]] fields of study.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamskalpa&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA212|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Vedanga context, the German Indologist [[Max Muller]] translates it as "the Ceremonial".&lt;ref name="Müller1860p169"&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Max Müller |title=A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHCe48QSZaUC&amp;pg=PA169 |year=1860|publisher=Williams and Norgate |pages=169–170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is widely used in other contexts, such as "cosmic time" (one day for Brahma, 4.32 billion human years),&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Kalpa" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 338&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for precepts or procedures that are "proper, fit" in medicine or another profession.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamskalpa/&gt;

==History==
The Kalpa field of study traces it roots to the [[Brahmana]] layer of texts in the Vedas,&lt;ref name="WinternitzSarma1996p252"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moriz Winternitz|author2=V. Srinivasa Sarma|title=A History of Indian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRfuJFRV_O8C |year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0264-3 |pages=252–262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however its texts are more focussed, clear, short and practical for ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Müller1860p169"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith1998p121"/&gt; Kalpa Sutras are related to the ''Karma kanda'' or rituals parts of the Veda, in contrast to the [[Upanishads]] which are the ''Jnana kanda'' or the knowledge part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kireet Joshi|title=The Veda and Indian Culture: An Introductory Essay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CJlM2nhlt0C |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0889-8 |pages=97–98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holdrege2012p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara A.

This field of study emerged to serve the need of priests as they officiated over domestic ceremonies such as weddings and baby naming rites of passage, so that the rituals were efficient, standardized and appeared consistent across different events.&lt;ref name="WinternitzSarma1996p252"/&gt; They also helped the audience and the individuals integrate within customs and cultural practices, state Winternitz and Sarma, from "the moment when he is received in his mother's womb to the hour of his death", and beyond during his cremation.&lt;ref name="WinternitzSarma1996p252"/&gt;

The rituals related ancient texts are of two kinds: (1) the ''Śrautasūtras'', which are based on the ''[[śruti]]'', and (2) the ''Smārtasūtras'', or rules based on the ''[[smriti]]'' or tradition. The first versions of the Kalpa Sutras text were probably composed by the 6th-century BCE, and they were attributed to famous Vedic sages out of respect for them in the Hindu traditions or to gain authority.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca339/&gt; These texts are written aphoristic [[sutra]]s style, and therefore are taxonomies or terse guidebooks rather than detailed manuals or handbooks for any ceremony.&lt;ref name="Smith1998p121"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian K. Smith |title=Reflections on Resemblance, Ritual, and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nkruE6UCz54C |year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1532-2 |pages=120–137 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as Monier-Williams classified only ''Shrautasutras'' as part of Kalpa Vedanga, stating that the ''Smartasutras'' did not relate to Srauta or Vedic ceremonies, but instead focused on domestic events such as rites of passage when a baby is born and to ''Samayachara'' or "conventional everyday practices" that are part of every human being's life.&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams1876p195"&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=Indian Wisdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgBAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA195|year=1876|publisher=W.

===Śrauta Sutras===
[[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|260px|The verses 1-2 of ''Baudhayana Shulba Sutra'' state that the squares of any rectangle's width and length add up to the square of its diagonal.{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|p=18 with note 13}} This is known in western literature as the [[Pythagorean theorem]].]]
The '''Śrautasūtras''' (Shrauta-sutra) form a part of the corpus of  [[Sanskrit]] [[sutra|sūtra]] literature. Their topics include instructions relating to the use of the śruti corpus in ritual ('kalpa') and  the correct performance of these rituals. Some early Śrautasūtras were composed in the late Brahmana period (such as the Baudhyanana and Vadhula Sūtras), but the bulk of the Śrautasūtras are roughly contemporary to the Gṛhya corpus of domestic sūtras, their language being late [[Vedic Sanskrit]], dating to the middle of the first millennium BCE (generally predating [[Pāṇini]]).

The [[Shulba Sutras|{{IAST | Śulbasûtra}}]] (or ''Shulva-sutras'') deal with the mathematical methodology to construct [[Vedi (altar)|altar]] geometries for the Vedic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pradip Kumar Sengupta|title=History of Science and Philosophy of Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwO-f53m5BQC|year=2010|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-81-317-1930-5|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanskrit word "Shulba" means cord, and these texts are "rules of the cord".{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|p=17}} They provide, states Kim Plofker, what in modern mathematical terminology would be called "area preserving transformations of plane figures", tersely describing geometric formulae and constants.{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|p=17}} Five ''Shulba Sutras'' texts have survived through history, of which the oldest surviving is likely the Baudhayana Shulba Sutra (800-500 BCE), while the one by Katyayana may be chronologically the youngest (~300 BCE).{{Sfn|Kim Plofker|2009|pp=17-18}}

===Smarta Sutras===
The '''Gṛhyasūtras''' "domestic sūtras" are a category of [[Sanskrit]] texts prescribing Vedic rituals, mainly relating to [[Sanskara (rite of passage)|rites of passage]] such as [[Hindu wedding|rituals of wedding]], [[birth]] celebration, [[namegiving]] and coming of age (puberty).&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Oldenberg, trans., Max Müller, ed. [[Sacred Books of the East]] Vol. XXIX, [https://archive.org/details/grihyastrasrul01oldeuoft "The Grihya-sûtras, rules of Vedic domestic ceremonies"], part 1, Oxford, The Clarendon press 1886&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Oldenberg, trans., Max Müller, trans. Sacred Books of the East Vol. XXX, [https://archive.org/details/grihyastrasrul02oldeuoft "The Grihya-sûtras, rules of Vedic domestic ceremonies"], part 2, Oxford, The Clarendon press 1892&lt;/ref&gt; Their language is late [[Vedic Sanskrit]], and they date to around roughly 500 BCE, contemporary with the Śrautasūtras. They are named after Vedic [[shakha]]s.

{{quote|'''Vedic sacrifice rituals at a wedding'''&lt;br&gt;West of the (sacred) fire, a stone (for grinding corn and condiments) is placed and northeast a water jar. The bridegroom offers an oblation, standing, looking towards the west, and taking hold of the bride's hands while she sits and looks towards the east. If he wishes only for sons, he clasps her thumbs and says, "I clasp thy hands for the sake of good fortune"; the fingers alone, if he wishes only for daughters; the hairy side of the hand along with the thumbs if wishes for both (sons and daughters). Then, whilst he leads her towards the right three times around the fire, and round the water jar, he says in a low tone,&lt;br&gt;"I am he, thou are she; thou art she, I am he,&lt;br&gt;I am the heaven, thou art the earth; I am the [[Samaveda|Saman]], thou art the [[Rigveda|Rig]].&lt;br&gt;Come let us marry, let us possess offspring,&lt;br&gt;united in affection, well disposed to each other,&lt;br&gt;let us live for a hundred years".&lt;br&gt;

The '''Dharmasūtras''' are texts dealing with custom, rituals, duties and law. They include the four surviving written works of the ancient Indian tradition on the subject of dharma, or the rules of behavior recognized by a community. Unlike the later [[dharmaśāstra]]s, the dharmasūtras are composed in prose. The oldest dharmasūtra is generally believed to have been that of [[Apastamba Dharmasutra|Apastamba]], followed by the dharmasūtras of [[Gautama Dharmasutra|Gautama]], [[Baudhayana sutras|Baudhayana]], and an early version of [[Vashistha]]. It is difficult to determine exact dates for these texts, but the dates between 500–300 BCE have been suggested for the oldest dharmasūtras.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Approaches to literary space ==

=== The past approach ===
Space in the 20th century was regarded as a part of various literary spheres, such as the narrative situation. It changed only in the last decade of the period. Since then literary space has been treated as an independent and unique entity, semantic centre of the work, while such notions as the time of action or characters became its particularizations.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 195-97.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== The modern approaches ===
==== Yuri Lotman ====

The first person to approach the issue of literary space from the semiotic point of view was [[Yuri Lotman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Universe of the Mind: A Semiotic Theory of Culture|last=Lotman|first=Yuri|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=Bloomington:|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lotman, artistic space is only a model of real space, not its copy. He argued that the information provided by the text about space is incomplete and, consequently, space also is not complete. Being discontinued (what is not mentioned in the text does not exist), space cannot be reconstructed by the implied reader (Lotman 1977, &lt;nowiki&gt;''Przestrzeń artystyczna w prozie Gogola''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, p.213).

What is more, Lotman broached in his literary studies the question of the relationship between space in the text and space of the real world. He claimed both space organisations are governed by cultural stereotypes and conventions, which serve as kind of a &lt;nowiki&gt;'mediator' between them. However, while additional senses are imposed on textual space by cultural codes, extratextual space uses the reworked ones. Through textual hints (described customs, clothing, etc.) literary space can refer to more general knowledge of the implied reader of the empirical reality. The aim of this measure is to make possible the association of the fictional world with the experiential one not calling it as if ''&lt;/nowiki&gt;by name”.&lt;ref&gt;Lotman, Yuri (1977). &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Przestrzeń artystyczna w prozie Gogola.” ''Semiotyka kultury''. Eds. E .Janus and M. R. Mayenowa. Warszawa: PIW. pp. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilizing extratextual patterns, the author of a literary work creates their own vision of the world and they do it through the use of description. Limited just like description&lt;ref&gt;Lotman, Yuri (1977). &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Przestrzeń artystyczna w prozie Gogola.” ''Semiotyka kultury''. Eds. E .Janus and M. R. Mayenowa. Warszawa: PIW. pp. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;, such an authorial model does not exist beyond the textual frames and is composed of relations resulting from senses imposed on space. Those, in turn, may suggest non-spatial meanings (e.g. ''up'' is better, ''down'' is worse as in the case of a social hierarchy of [[H. G. Wells|H.G. Wells]]' ''[[The Time Machine]]'' and the Morlocks and the Eloi):&lt;blockquote&gt;''Literary space represents an author's model of the world, expressed in the language of spatial representation. In a literary work, space models different relations of the world-picture: temporary, social, ethical and others. […] in the literary models of the world―space sometimes metaphorically adopts meanings of relations in the modelled world-structure, that are themselves not spatial at all.''&lt;ref&gt;Lotman, Yuri (1977). ''The Structure of the Artistic Text.'' pp.&amp;nbsp;218''.'' &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Janusz Sławiński ====

[[:pl:Janusz_Sławiński_(filolog)|Janusz Sławiński]] considered the presented reality to be the most fundamental code modelling space, understood as the principles organising the thematic-compositional plane of a single literary work.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; This reality is the construction of words, the result of all the linguistic as well as stylistic choices which are made by the implied author, and as such, does not exist beyond the text. It is vital not only to imagine space but also to follow the narration, the description, and the course of action, since all those may shape the fictitious reality by imposing the additional meanings on it.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 198-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary/cultural conventions constitute the second space-modelling code. This system is more abstract one than the previous one. It does not refer to how an individual work shapes space but how it is conventionally done by a given epoch, genre, etc. So, for instance, one of the main features of Gothic novels are elements of the supernatural and the sublime&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/gothic-literature/supernatural-sublime-characteristic.html|title=The Supernatural and the Sublime|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, therefore, texts are full of ghosts, vampires and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 198-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language is the last of codes shaping space. Every language models space in a different manner. The language of geography, for example, differentiates [[Cardinal direction|cardinal and intercardinal directions]], among others, west or north-east, while geometry uses [[Relative direction|relative directions]], for instance, left/right/backward(s)/forward(s). In short, it can be said that language organises space in a way, defines it, and provides terms for various types of spatial arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 200-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Sławiński put an emphasis on description, scenery and superimposed senses, three interrelated planes influencing space (Sławiński 2000, p. 205)

The descriptive plane is the aspect of narration and consists of words. It is especially crucial to space when it is introduced to the implied reader. The spatial relationship would be impossible to define without description. It describes space directly or implies it, developing together with characters' movements.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; This 'development' makes the description a dynamic notion in a sense that it creates meanings. Certain elements of the description relate to each other not only on the grammatical but also semantic level. For example, there are relations between words and phrases. Added-on meanings imposed on particular fragments of a text are, for instance, the consequence of such relations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 207-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to description, scenery is considered to be a static entity as it results from description. Description producing scenery may consist of a single block of text or scenery can be the effect of numerous descriptive references in such a text put together.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superimposed senses are the last plane. They are a structure caring added-on meanings. They are not conditioned in any way and are type of a subcode which shapes non-spatial relationships and values (Sławiński 2000, p. 212).

==== Mieczysław Porębski ====

According to [[:pl:Mieczysław_Porębski|Mieczysław Porębski]] space can be divided into three types, namely, extratextual, intertextual and intratextual.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Porębski, Mieczysław (1978). &lt;nowiki&gt;''O wielości przestrzeni''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ''Przestrzeń i literatura''. Wrocław: Ossolineum. pp. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The first is where works of art are stored. It is physical, 3-dimensional and, therefore, can be ''experienced'' by readers (e.g. libraries). The second type is space only in a metaphorical sense, a set of conventions, of common fields of references for a certain piece of writing. It may refer either to other texts or literary traditions (just like [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''The Hobbit'' by the appearance of dwarves alludes to, for instance, fairy tales), or both, and as such, intertextual space is an abstract notion. The last space differentiated by Porębski is, intratextual space, is what can be called 'an intentional space' since it is implied&lt;ref&gt;Ingarden, Roman''. The Literary Work of Art.''&lt;/ref&gt; and, provoked by the text itself, exists only in the implied reader's imagination.

Porębski derived three subspaces from the intratextual space: physical, symbolical and mathematical ones.&lt;ref&gt;Porębski, Mieczysław (1978). &lt;nowiki&gt;''O wielości przestrzeni''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ''Przestrzeń i literatura''. Wrocław: Ossolineum. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;The physical space is considered to be an intricate structure, not ordered. What is more, it is 3-dimensional to characters and infinite (lines of length, etc. can be prolonged as much as one wishes them to). The symbolical type of space&lt;ref&gt;Porębski, Mieczysław (1978). &lt;nowiki&gt;''O wielości przestrzeni''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ''Przestrzeń i literatura''. Wrocław: Ossolineum. p. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; is the way in which culture arranges it. It is the most primary type of spatial organisation, and it is so crucial due to its metaphysical and eschatological dimension but only when some additional meanings are endows otherwise semantically neutral space. The mathematical type of space can be divided further into topological and geometrical spaces. The former shows how space is perceived in both cultural and mythological way, having much in common with a symbolical space, the latter uses map features, e.g. distances, symmetries, proportions, etc.

A '''loanword''' (also '''loan word''' or '''loan-word''') is a [[word]] adopted from one [[language]] (the donor language) and incorporated into another language without [[translation]]. This is in contrast to [[cognate]]s, which are words in two or more languages that are similar because they share an [[Etymology|etymological]] origin, and [[calque]]s, which involve translation.

== Examples and related terms ==
A loanword is distinguished from a [[calque]] (loan translation), which is a word or phrase whose [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] or [[idiom]] is adopted from another language by [[translation]] into existing words or word-forming roots of the recipient language.

Examples of loanwords in the [[English language]] include ''[[Coffeehouse|café]]'' (from French ''café'', which literally means "coffee"), [[bazaar]] (from Persian ''bāzār'', which means "market"), and [[kindergarten]] (from German ''Kindergarten'', which literally means  "children's garden").

In a bit of [[autological word|heterological]] irony, the word ''calque'' is a loanword from the French [[noun]], derived from the [[verb]] ''calquer'' (to trace, to copy);&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Calque Calque, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt; the word ''loanword'' is a calque of the [[German language|German]] word ''Lehnwort'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Loans of multi-word phrases, such as the English use of the French term ''[[déjà vu]]'', are known as adoptions, adaptations, or lexical borrowings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Strictly speaking, the term ''loanword'' conflicts with the ordinary meaning of ''loan'' in that something is taken from the donor language without it being something that is possible to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

==From the arts==

Most of the [[List of musical terms|technical vocabulary of classical music]] (such as [[concerto]], [[allegro (music)|allegro]], [[tempo]], [[aria]], [[opera]], and [[soprano]]) is borrowed from [[Italian language|Italian]],&lt;ref&gt;Shanet 1956: 155.&lt;/ref&gt; and that of [[ballet]] from [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;Kersley &amp; Sinclair 1979: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic classification==

The studies by Werner Betz (1949, 1939), [[Einar Haugen]] (1950, also 1956), and [[Uriel Weinreich]] (1953) are regarded as the classical theoretical works on loan influence.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the two survey articles by Oksaar (1996: 4f.), Stanforth (2002) and Grzega (2003, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The basic theoretical statements all take Betz’s nomenclature as their starting point. Duckworth (1977) enlarges Betz’s scheme by the type “partial substitution” and supplements the system with English terms. A schematic illustration of these classifications is given below.&lt;ref&gt;The following comments and examples are taken from Grzega, Joachim (2004), ''Bezeichnungswandel: Wie, Warum, Wozu?'', Heidelberg: Winter, p. 139, and Grzega, Joachim (2003), [http://www1.ku-eichstaett.de/SLF/EngluVglSW/grzega1032.pdf “Borrowing as a Word-Finding Process in Cognitive Historical Onomasiology”], ''[http://www.onomasiology.de Onomasiology Online]'' 4: 22&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression "foreign word" used in the illustration below is, however, an incorrect translation of the German term ''Fremdwort'', which refers to loanwords whose pronunciation, spelling, and possible inflection or gender have not yet been so much adapted to the new language that they cease to feel foreign. Such a separation of loanwords into two distinct categories is not used by linguists in English in talking about any language. In addition, basing such a separation mainly on spelling as described in the illustration is (or, in fact, was) not usually done except by German linguists and only when talking about German and sometimes other languages that tend to adapt foreign spellings, which is rare in English unless the word has been in wide use for a very long time.

According to the linguist Suzanne Kemmer, the expression "foreign word" can be defined as follows in English: "[W]hen most speakers do not know the word and if they hear it think it is from another language, the word can be called a foreign word. There are many foreign words and phrases used in English such as bon vivant (French), mutatis mutandis (Latin), and Schadenfreude (German)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Words/loanwords.html Loanwords] by Prof. S. Kemmer, Rice University&lt;/ref&gt; This is however not how the term is (incorrectly) used in this illustration:

[[File:Loanword classification tree 3.gif|center]]

On the basis of an importation-substitution distinction, Haugen (1950: 214f.) distinguishes three basic groups of borrowings: “(1) ''Loanwords'' show morphemic importation without substitution.... (2) ''Loanblends'' show morphemic substitution as well as importation.... (3) ''Loanshifts'' show morphemic substitution without importation”. Haugen later refined (1956) his model in a review of Gneuss’s (1955) book on Old English loan coinages, whose classification, in turn, is the one by Betz (1949) again.

Weinreich (1953: 47ff.) differentiates between two mechanisms of lexical interference, namely those initiated by simple words and those initiated by compound words and phrases. Weinreich (1953: 47) defines ''simple words'' “from the point of view of the bilinguals who perform the transfer, rather than that of the descriptive linguist. Accordingly, the category ‘simple’ words also includes compounds that are transferred in unanalysed form”. After this general classification, Weinreich then resorts to Betz’s (1949) terminology.

== Popular and learned loanwords ==
There is a distinction between "popular" and "learned" loanwords. Popular loanwords are transmitted orally. Learned loanwords are first used in written language, often for scholarly, scientific, or literary purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=znFmBZ2D8rEC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GW-MWpUf80&amp;sig=Mz1omR5ym9Re_HSiZ8sQymEn7-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz3YzyvsjTAhUMC8AKHXLWDn8Q6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22popular%20and%20learned%20loanwords%22&amp;f=false|title=The Origins and Development of the English Language|last=Algeo|first=John|date=2009-02-02|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1428231455|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some English loanwords remain relatively faithful to the donor language's phonology even though a particular [[phoneme]] might not exist or have contrastive status in English. For example, the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word ''[[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]]'' is used by geologists to specify lava that is relatively thick, chunky, and rough. The Hawaiian spelling indicates the two [[glottal stop]]s in the word, but the English pronunciation, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|(|ʔ|)|ɑː}}, contains at most one. In addition, the English spelling usually removes the [[ʻokina]] and [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] diacritics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elbert|first1=Samuel H.|last2=Pukui|first2=Mary Kawena|title=Hawaiian Dictionary|place=Honolulu|publisher=University of Hawaiʻi Press|year=1986|edition=Revised and enlarged|isbn=0-8248-0703-0|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of English affixes, such as ''un-'', ''-ing'', and ''-ly'', were present in older forms in Old English. However, a few English affixes are borrowed. For example, the  English verbal suffix [[-ize|''-ize'' (American English) or ''ise'' (British English)]] comes from Greek -ιζειν (''-izein'') via Latin ''-izare''.

==In languages other than English==

===Transmission in the Ottoman Empire===
During more than 600 years of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the literary and administrative language of the empire was [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]], with many [[Persian (language)|Persian]], and [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] loanwords, called [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], considerably differing from the everyday spoken Turkish of the time. Many such words were exported to other languages of the empire, such as [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. After the empire fell after [[World War I]] and the [[Republic of Turkey]] was founded, the Turkish language underwent an extensive [[language reform]] led by the newly founded [[Turkish Language Association]], during which [[List of replaced loanwords in Turkish|many adopted words]] were replaced with new formations derived from [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] roots. That was part of the ongoing cultural reform of the time, in turn a part in the broader framework of [[Atatürk's Reforms]], which also included the introduction of the new [[Turkish alphabet]].

Turkish also has taken many words from [[French (language)|French]], such as ''pantolon'' for ''trousers'' (from French ''pantalon'') and ''komik'' for ''funny'' (from French ''comique''), most of them pronounced very similarly. Word usage in modern Turkey has acquired a political tinge: [[right-wing]] publications tend to use more Arabic or Persian originated words, [[left-wing]] ones use more adopted from European languages, while centrist ones use more native Turkish root words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Geoffrey|title=The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success|place=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-925669-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch words in Indonesian===
Almost 350 years of Dutch presence in what is now [[Indonesia]] have left significant linguistic traces. Though very few Indonesians have a fluent knowledge of Dutch, the Indonesian language inherited many words from Dutch, both in words for everyday life and as well in scientific or technological terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Sneddon (2003), p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar argues that 20% of [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] words can be traced back to Dutch words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/ies/050208/ |title=A Hidden Language – Dutch in Indonesia [eScholarship&amp;#93; |publisher=Repositories.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loan words in Japanese===

{{Main|Gairaigo}}

===Romance Languages===
A large percentage of the lexicon of [[Romance languages]], themselves descended from [[Vulgar Latin]], consists of loanwords (later learned or scholarly borrowings) from Latin. These words can be distinguished by lack of typical sound changes and other transformations found in descended words, or by meanings taken directly from [[Classical Latin|Classical]] or [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] that did not evolve or change over time as expected; in addition, there are also semi-learned terms which were adapted partially to the Romance language's character. Latin borrowings can be known by several names in Romance languages: in Spanish, for example, they are usually referred to as "cultismos"&lt;ref&gt;http://aliso.pntic.mec.es/agalle17/latin/verba/definiciones.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=FtxywY_6g4UC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=semi+cultismos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=roJj7t4YpC&amp;sig=z1LCniOlEaGfTOSzsVMwOXayKnM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjL0P2XlujdAhWHTd8KHUgNBMgQ6AEwCnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=semi%20cultismos&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;, and in Italian as "latinismi". 

Latin is usually the most common source of loanwords in these languages, such as in Italian, Spanish, French, etc.&lt;ref&gt;cscanada.net/index.php/sll/article/download/9579/10252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00437956.1968.11435535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/francophonie/HIST_FR_s92_Emprunts.htm#3._Lapport_des_langues_anciennes_au_fran%C3%A7ais_&lt;/ref&gt;, and in some cases the total number of loans may even outnumber inherited terms&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/157203089/Diccionario-Critico-Etimologico-castellano-A-CA-Corominas-Joan-pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (although the learned borrowings are less often used in common speech, with the most common vocabulary being of inherited, orally transmitted origin from Vulgar Latin). This has led to many cases of etymological [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] in these languages.

For most Romance languages, these loans were initiated by scholars, clergy, or other learned people and occurred in Medieval times, peaking in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance era&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/francophonie/HIST_FR_s92_Emprunts.htm#3._Lapport_des_langues_anciennes_au_fran%C3%A7ais_&lt;/ref&gt;- in Italian, the 14th century had the highest number of loans&lt;ref&gt;cscanada.net/index.php/sll/article/download/9579/10252&lt;/ref&gt;. In the case of Romanian, the language underwent a "re-Latinization" process later than the others (see [[Romanian lexis]], {{section link|Romanian language|French, Italian, and English loanwords}}), in the 18th and 19th centuries, partially using French and Italian words (many of these themselves being earlier borrowings from Latin) as intermediaries&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dex.ro/&lt;/ref&gt;, in an effort to modernize the language, often adding concepts that did not exist until then, or replacing words of other origins. These common borrowings and features also essentially serve to raise mutual intelligibility of the Romance languages, particularly in academic/scholarly, literary, technical, and scientific domains. Many of these same words are also found in English (through its numerous borrowings from Latin and French) and other European languages.

In addition to Latin loanwords, many words of Ancient Greek origin were also borrowed into Romance languages, often in part through scholarly Latin intermediates, and these also often pertained to academic, scientific, literary, and technical topics. Furthermore, to a lesser extent, Romance languages borrowed from a variety of other languages; in particular English has become an important source in more recent times. Study of the origin of these words and their function and context within the language can illuminate some important aspects and characteristics of the language, and can reveal insights on the general phenomenon of lexical borrowing in linguistics as a method of enriching a language&lt;ref&gt;https://www.e-periodica.ch/cntmng?pid=rlr-001:1969:33::530&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Cultural aspects==
According to [[Hans Henrich Hock]] and Brian Joseph, "languages and dialects ... do not exist in a vacuum": there is always linguistic contact between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|pages=241–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The contact influences what loanwords are integrated into the lexicon and which certain words are chosen over others.

==Changes in meaning and pronunciation==

In some cases, the original meaning shifts considerably through unexpected logical leaps.  The English word ''Viking'' became Japanese バイキング ''baikingu'' meaning 'buffet', because Imperial Viking was the first restaurant in Japan to offer [[buffet]]-style meals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20050524aj.html]  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15095">'''Local history''' is the study of [[history]] in a geographically local context and it often concentrates on the [[local community]]. It incorporates [[cultural history|cultural]] and [[social history|social]] aspects of history. Local history is not merely national history writ small but a study of past events in a given geographical but one that is based on a wide variety of [[documentary evidence]] and placed in a [[Comparative contextual analysis|comparative context]] that is both regional and national.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Local History, 2nd ed.|last=Kammen|first=Carol|last2=Wilson|first2=Amy|publisher=AltaMira Press|year=2012|isbn=9780759120488|location=Lanham, MD|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historic plaques are one form of documentation of significant occurrences in the past and [[Oral history|oral histories]] are another. 

Local history is often documented by local historical societies or groups that form to preserve a local historic building or other historic site. Many works of local history are compiled by amateur historians working independently or archivists employed by various organizations. An important aspect of local history is the publication and cataloguing of documents preserved in local or national records which relate to particular areas.

In a number of countries a broader concept of '''local lore''' is known, which is a comprehensive study of everything pertaining to a certain locality: history, ethnography, geography, natural history, etc. 

==Local contexts==
Local history tends to be less documented than other types, with fewer books and artifacts than that of a country or continent. Many local histories are recorded as oral tales or stories and so are more vulnerable than more well known issues. Artifacts of local history are often collected in local history museums, which may be housed in a historic house or other building. Individual historic sites are inherently local, although they may have national or world history importance as well. Many however have little overall historical impact but add depth to the local area.

===Australia===

In Australia, local history is focussed on specific cities and suburbs or country towns and regions. In cities, local history might concentrate on a [[Central business district|CBD]] and its bordering suburbs, on a specific suburb or [[Local government in Australia|municipality]], or on an agglomeration of suburbs and municipalities (because local government boundaries have changed over time). Outside the larger cities, local history often examines regional towns and surrounding areas.

Records are typically stored at state libraries, municipal libraries, historical societies and public record offices. For example, the [[State Library of Victoria]] holds extensive local history records for [[Melbourne]] and other places in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Many other [[List of libraries in Melbourne|Melbourne libraries]] have local history collections, along with the [[Public Record Office Victoria]] and the [[Royal Historical Society of Victoria]]. In [[New South Wales]], the [[Royal Australian Historical Society]] has studied local history as part of its remit since its founding in 1901. It holds local history records along with the [[State Library of NSW]] and other state and local libraries and archives.

Historians have examined the ways local history has been written in Australia since the nineteenth century. Early on, the emphasis was on pioneer and settler history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hirst |first=John |date=1978 |title=The pioneer legend |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10314617808595595 |journal=Historical Studies |volume=18 |issue=71 |pages=316–337 |doi=10.1080/10314617808595595 |access-date=2017-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creative ways that local history contributed to making community has also been argued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=Tom |date=1996 |title=Hunters and Collectors: The Antiquarian Imagination in Australia |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521483492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, local history, [[urban history]], [[public history]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] were closely connected in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davison |first=Graeme |date=2000 |title=The use and abuse of Australian history |location=St. Leonards, N.S.W |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |isbn=1864487208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{see also|English local history|British Association for Local History}}
The [[British Association for Local History]] in the United Kingdom encourages and assists in the study of local history as an academic discipline and as a leisure activity by both individuals and groups. Most historic counties in England have record societies and archaeological and historical societies which coordinate the work of historians and other researchers concerned with that area.

Local history in the UK took a long time to be accepted as an academic discipline. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it was widely regarded as an [[antiquarian]] pursuit, suitable for country parsons. The [[Victoria County History|Victoria History of the Counties of England]] project begun in 1899 in honour of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] with the aim of creating an encyclopaedic history of each of the [[historic counties of England]]. The project is coordinated by the [[Institute of Historical Research]] at the [[University of London]]. The first academic post related to local history was at [[Reading University]] which appointed a research fellow in local history in 1908. There was a department of local history (but without a professor) at [[Leicester University]] from 1947. [[H. P. R. Finberg]] was the first Professor of English Local History. He was appointed by Leicester in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|pages=46–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local history continues to be neglected as an academic subject within universities. Academic local historians are often found within a more general department of history or in continuing education.

Local history is rarely taught as a separate subject in British schools. In 1908, a Board of Education circular had urged that schools should pay attention "to the history of the town and district" in which they were situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the Ministry of Education suggested schools should use local material to illustrate national themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the current [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]], pupils at level 4 are expected to "show their knowledge and understanding of local, national and international history".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100418051729/http://curriculum.qcda.gov.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/subjects/key-stage-3/history/Level-descriptions/index.aspx National Curriculum - level descriptions]&lt;/ref&gt;'''

The [[Alan Ball Local History Awards]] were established in the 1980s to recognize outstanding contributions in local history publishing in the UK (both in print and in [[new media]]), and to encourage the publishing of such works by [[public library|public libraries]] and [[local authority#United Kingdom|local authorities]].&lt;ref name=clip2010&gt;[http://www.cilip.org.uk/get-involved/special-interest-groups/local-studies/activities/pages/alanball.aspx Local Studies Alan Ball Local History Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506050104/http://www.cilip.org.uk/get-involved/special-interest-groups/local-studies/activities/pages/alanball.aspx |date=2011-05-06 }} [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]], published 2011-11-02, accessed 2012-05-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Local history can become a crucial component to policy-making and serve as a marketable resource and this is demonstrated in the case of [[Northern Ireland]]. Aside from its contribution to local development, local history is being used as a non-contentious meeting ground in addressing conflicting traditions by reinforcing shared past rather than adversarial political history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Family and Local History|last=Hey|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780191044939|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{see also|American urban history}}
In the United States, local history is usually concentrated on any history of the place and people from a particular [[village]] or [[township]]. Several villages and townships would comprise one county or county history. Library records are often divided by State, then county, then township/local history. The American Local History Network (ALHN) in the United States provides a focus for accessing independent genealogical and historical resources.

In the United States, 79,000 historic sites are identified as listings on its [[National Register of Historic Places]]. State and local municipalities often have additional landmark designations to cover sites of more purely local interest.

In addition, many regional and state [[historical societies]] maintain regional history and actively seek out missing historical collections.

A new form of local history is the movement of "[[If This House Could Talk]]" projects in various urban neighborhoods in the United States. These small scale locally generated history events encourage an interest in history and provide for open ended participation by the general public. However, there is often no vetting or third party review of the factual evidence that is presented, and therefore such presentations may require oversight by professional third party history organizations if they are to be transcribed into ongoing collections of local history.

=== Slavic countries ===

In several Slavic countries there is a related study which may be translated from the local languages as "country lore" or "local lore". In addition to history, it also incorporates other local studies, such as local geography, nature, and ethnography.

In the USSR, Russia and Russian-speaking post-Soviet states local lore is known as ''krayevedenie'' ([[:ru:Краеведение|Краеведение]]). It is taught in primary schools. There are also local lore museums known as ''krayevedcheskie muzei''. In modern Russia the concept of "regional studies" ( Регионоведение) is also considered.&lt;ref&gt;Ю. Н. Гладкий, А. И. Чистобаев. ''Регионоведение. Учебник для студентов высших учебных заведений'' (''Regional Studies. A Texbook for Higher Education Students'') Moscow, Гардарики, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ukraine]], the study of local history and regional ethnography is known as ''krayeznavstvo'' ({{lang-uk|[[:uk:краєзнавство|краєзнавство]]}}. The National Union of Local Lore Researchers of Ukraine is a professional society for researchers of ethnology and local studies in Ukraine. It was founded in 1925 and has 3,000 members in 17 chapters.&lt;ref name="nsku"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nsku.org.ua/?page_id=5606 | title=Історія Національної спілки краєзнавців України | publisher=National Union of Local Lore Researchers of Ukraine | accessdate=20 January 2015 | language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society has published its journal ''Краєзнавство'' since 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Краєзнавство'' | url=http://nsku.org.ua/?page_id=5603 | accessdate=20 January 2015 | language=Ukrainian }} Individual issues of the journal are available from [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Krajeznavstvo Wikimedia Commons]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Poland]], the corresponding concept is called ''[[:pl:Krajoznawstwo|krajoznawstwo]]'', the term known since 1902. In modern Poland various organized ''krajoznawstwo'' activities are carried out by [[PTTK|Polskie Towarzystwo Turystyczno-Krajoznawcze]], ineptly translated as "Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6360">[[File:Battle of Montiel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Knights in battle: The process of ''mos Teutonicus'' was often used to preserve and bring home the bodies of aristocratic warriors who fell in distant lands.]]

'''Mos Teutonicus''' (Latin: ''the Germanic custom'') was a postmortem [[Funeral|funerary custom]] used in [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]] as a means of transporting, and solemnly disposing of, the bodies of high status individuals. The process involved the removal of the flesh from the body, so that the bones of the deceased could be transported hygienically from distant lands back home.

== Background ==

During the [[Second Crusade|Second Crusade for the Holy Land]] it was not thought fit for [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] who fell in battle, or died of natural causes, to be buried away from their homeland in Muslim territory.&lt;ref name= Keen&gt;{{cite book |last=Keen |first=Maurice |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=Chivalry |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |date=September 10, 1986 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 0300033605}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transportation of the whole body back from foreign parts over long distances was impractical and unhygienic due to decomposition, which was often accelerated by the climate.

German aristocrats were particularly concerned that burial should not take place in the Holy Land, but rather on home soil.&lt;ref name=Schafer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scäfer |first1=Von Dietrich |last2= |first2= |year=1920 |title=Mittelalter Brauch by Der Überführung von Leichen |journal=Sitzungsbrichte der preussischen Akademie der Wissenschafter |volume=XXVI |issue=|pages=478–489 |publisher=Akademie der Wissenschafter |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Florence|Florentine]] chronicler [[Boncompagno da Signa|Boncompagno]] was the first to connect the procedure specifically with German aristocrats, and coins the phrase ''mos Teutonicus'', meaning ‘the Germanic custom.’{{#tag:ref|Boncompagno refers to the practice in a derogatory manner, placing ''mos Teutonicus'' in a passage with [[Jewish]] and [[Rome|Roman]] burial customs designed to preserve the dignity and honour of the body. He claims the Germans (''teutonici'') [[dismember]] the bodies of their most eminent people.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; |group=note}}

English and French aristocrats generally preferred [[embalming]] to ''mos Teutonicus'', involving the burial of the entrails and [[heart]] in a separate location from the corpse.&lt;ref name=Westerhof&gt;{{cite book |last=Westerhof |first=Danielle |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=Death and the Noble Body in Medieval England |publisher= Boydell Press |date=October 16, 2008 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 1843834162}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the advantages of ''mos Teutonicus'' was that it was relatively economical in comparison with embalming, and was more hygienic.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

Corpse preservation was very popular in mediaeval society.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Elizabeth A. R. |last2= |first2= |year=1981 |title=Death and the Human Body in the Late Middle Ages: The Legislation of Boniface VIII on the division of the Corpse |journal=Viator |volume=XII |issue=|pages=223 to 270 |publisher=UCLA: Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies  |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decaying body was seen  as a representative of something sinful and evil.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;  Embalming and ''mos Teutonicus'', along with tomb effigies, were a way of giving the corpse an illusion of stasis and removed the uneasy image of putrification and decay.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

In 1270, the body of [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX]], who died in [[Tunis]], which was [[Muslim]] territory, was subject to the process of ''mos Teutonicus'' for its transportation back to [[France]].&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

== Process ==

The process of ''mos Teutonicus'' began with the [[cadaver]] being [[dismembered]]&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; to facilitate the next stage in the process, in which the body parts were [[boiled]] in water or wine&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; for several hours.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; The boiling had the effect of separating the flesh from the [[Human skeleton|bone]]. Any residual was scraped from the bones, leaving a completely clean [[skeleton]].&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; Both the flesh and [[Viscus|internal organs]] could be buried immediately, or [[Meat preservation|preserved]] with [[salt]] in the same manner as animal meat.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; The bones, and any preserved flesh, would then be transported back to the deceased's home for ceremonial interment.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt;

Mediaeval society generally regarded entrails as ignoble&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; and there was no great solemnity attached to their disposal, especially among German aristocrats.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt;

== Prohibition of the practice ==

Although the Church had a high regard for the practice, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] was known to have an especial repugnance of ''mos Teutonicus'' because of his ideal of bodily integrity.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; In his bull of 1300, ''[[De Sepulturis]]'', Boniface forbade the practice.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt; The [[papal bull]] issued which banned this practice was often misinterpreted as prohibition against human dissection. This probably hindered the research of some anatomists as they feared repercussions and punishment as a result of medical autopsies but ''[[De Sepulturis]]'' only prohibited the act of ''mos Teutonicus,'' not dissection in general.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2980">The '''Ninety-Two Resolutions''' were drafted by [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] and other members of the ''[[Parti canadien|Parti patriote]]'' of [[Lower Canada]] in 1834. The resolutions were a long series of demands for political reforms in the [[United Kingdom|British]]-governed colony.

Papineau had been elected speaker of the legislative assembly of [[Lower Canada]] in 1815. His party constantly opposed the unelected colonial government, and in 1828 he helped draft an early form of the resolutions, essentially a list of grievances against the colonial administration. To ensure that the views of the Legislative Assembly be understood by the [[British House of Commons]], the ''Parti patriote'' had sent its own delegation to London in order to submit a memoir and a petition signed by 87,000 people.

On February 28, 1834, Papineau presented the Ninety-Two Resolutions to the Legislative Assembly which were approved and sent to [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/92-resolutions/&lt;/ref&gt;. The resolutions included, among other things, demands for an elected Legislative Council and an Executive Council responsible before the house of representatives. Under the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], the government of Lower Canada was given an elected legislative assembly, but members of the upper houses were appointed by the Governor of the colony. 

In the resolutions, the elected representatives once again reiterated their loyalty to the British Crown, but expressed frustration that the government of London had been unwilling to correct the injustices caused by the past governments of the colony.

Papineau's resolutions were ignored for almost three years; meanwhile, the Legislative Assembly did all it could to oppose the un-elected upper houses while avoiding outright rebellion. [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|British Colonial Secretary]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]] eventually responded to them by issuing ten resolutions of his own (the [[Russell Resolutions]]). All of the Legislative Assembly's demands were rejected. {{wikisource|The Ninety-Two Resolutions of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada|The Ninety-Two Resolutions}}

The ten resolutions reached Canada in 1837, and many of Papineau's reformists began to agitate for a rebellion. See the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]].

'''Placentophagy''' (from 'placenta' + [[Greek language|Greek]] ''φαγειν'', to eat; also referred to as placentophagia) is the act of [[mammals]] [[eating]] the [[placenta]] of their young after childbirth.

{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The placenta contains small amounts of [[oxytocin]] which eases birth stress and causes the smooth muscles around the [[mammary]] cells to contract and eject milk.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} There have been no studies of whether placentophagy provides hormonal effects in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marraccini and Gorman|title=Exploring Placentophagy in Humans: Problems and Recommendations|journal=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women’s Health|date=July–August 2015|volume=60|issue=4|pages=371–379|doi=10.1111/jmwh.12309|pmid=26255799|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51524fdbe4b0574a80b6aabe/t/56e078312fe131546a7075b5/1457551410380/2015_-_Marisa_E_Marraccini_-_ExploringPlacentophagyinHumansProblemsandRecommend%5Bretrieved_2016-03-09%5D.pdf|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a school of thought that holds that placentophagy naturally occurred to hide any trace of childbirth from predators in the wild.  Many placental mammals participate in placentophagy, including [[herbivore]]s; exceptions include mainly [[human]]s, [[Pinnipedia]], [[Cetacea]], and [[camel]]s.  Placentophagy has been observed in [[Insectivora]], [[Rodent]]ia, [[Chiroptera]], [[Lagomorpha]], [[Carnivora]], [[Perissodactyla]], [[Artiodactyla]] (with the camel as a noted exception), and [[Primates]]. [[Marsupials]], which are an order of [[metatherian]] (pouched) mammals, resorb rather than deliver the placenta, and therefore cannot engage in placentophagia; they do, however, vigorously lick birth fluids as they are excreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Some research has shown that ingestion of the placenta can increase the pain threshold in pregnant rats. Rats that consumed the placenta experienced a modest amount of elevation of naturally occurring opioid-mediated analgesia. Endogenous opioids, such as endorphin and dynorphin, are natural chemicals, related to the opium molecule, that are produced in the central nervous system. Production of these endogenous opioids is increased during the birthing process. They have the ability to raise the threshold of pain tolerance in the mother. When coupled with ingested placenta or amniotic fluid, the opioid effect on pain threshold is dramatically increased. Rats that were given meat instead of the placenta showed no increase in the pain threshold. There are no studies that show any benefits of placenta ingestions in humans. There have been no scientific studies which show that placentophagy enhances analgesia in humans or that it has any other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

''A [[Rapa das Bestas|rapa das bestas]]'' is the name given to the annual ''curro'' (roundup) of wild horses celebrated the first friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday of July in Sabucedo, [[Pontevedra]], [[Spain]].

Across more than 200&amp;nbsp;km² of hillside currently more than six-hundred horses roam freely in fourteen droves, referred to in Galician as ''bestas'' (mares) and ''garañones'' (stallions). The festival involves bringing the horses down from the hillside, gathering them into an enclosure, cutting their manes and tails, and tagging them, nowadays with a microchip. The ''curro'' in Sabucedo is the most renowned of all and is set apart from the rest by unique characteristics, the most important of which is that neither ropes, sticks, nor other such instruments are used to subdue the animals.
The ''aloitadores'', those responsible for restraining the horses whilst the ''rapa'' takes place, use only their body strength and raw skill to complete the job. Another interesting feature of the ''rapa'' is the ''Bajada''– the process of rounding up the horses and leading them into Sabucedo – a part of the celebration joined by hundreds of local residents and visitors from further afield. Another element of the tradition is the celebration of a poignant mass, held very early on the Saturday morning, before going up the hill. During the mass, the congregation pray to San Lorenzo, the patron saint of Sabucedo, to keep those participating from any harm.

According to the scholar Manuel Cabada,&lt;ref&gt;''A Rapa das bestas de Sabucedo. Historia e antropoloxía dunha tradición'' (Vigo, Ir Indo, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; the ''rapa'' is a rite of passage from childhood to adolescence for those who seize a foal for the first time, guided and assisted by the older generation. 
The town of [[A Estrada]] is twinned with [[Almonte, Spain|Almonte]], located in the province of [[Huelva]], due to a similar celebration that takes place called ''Saca de las Yeguas''.

== History ==

Records show that the tradition of the ''bajada'', the subsequent ''rapa'' and the marking of the young foals dates back to the beginning of the 18th century. Nevertheless, it is believed that the tradition is actually much older as scholars such as Manuel Cabada have mentioned in their writings. In fact it could even be Pre-Roman, given that various [[petroglyphs]] have been found in the area in which men are depicted on horseback. In 1963, the festival was declared of [[Fiestas of National Tourist Interest of Spain|National Touristic Interest]], and in 2007 was awarded the status of International Touristic Interest, one of only four in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to hold this prestigious title.

'''Ritualism''', in the history of [[Christianity]], refers to an emphasis on the [[ritual]]s and [[liturgical]] ceremony of the church, in particular of [[Holy Communion]].
[[File:BC St. Ignatius apse window 3.jpg|right|thumb|Image of a [[thurible]] in a stained glass window, St. Ignatius Church, [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], [[Massachusetts]]]]
In the [[Church of England|Anglican church]] in the 19th century, the role of ritual became a contentious matter. The debate over ritual was also associated with struggles between [[High Church]] and [[Low Church]] movements.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Defining ritualism and the arguments generated by it==
In [[Anglicanism]], the term "ritualist" is controversial (i.e. rejected by some of those to whom it is applied). It was often used to describe the second generation of the [[Oxford Movement]]/[[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]]/[[High Church]] revival of the 19th century which sought to reintroduce into the [[Church of England]] a range of [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[liturgical]] practices. The term is also used to describe those who follow in their tradition.

Arguments about ritualism in the Church of England were often shaped by opposing (and often unannounced) attitudes towards the concept of ''[[sola scriptura]]'' and the nature of the authority of the [[Bible]] for Christians.

===Common arguments of some Anglicans in favour of ritualism===
Those who support the ritualist outlook in the Church of England have often argued that the adoption of key elements of [[Roman Catholic]] ritual:
* gives liturgical expression to the [[ecclesiological]] belief that the Church of England is more Catholic than Protestant;
* gives liturgical expression to a belief in the [[Real Presence]] and concomitantly that the [[Eucharist]] is the most important act of church worship and should be the norm;
* is the most effective vehicle for giving expression to the worship of [[heaven]] as it is described in the [[Book of Revelation]] in which the use of white robes and [[incense]] in a setting of considerable beauty is described;
* is a liturgical expression of the story in the book of [[Gospel of Matthew]] of the response of the [[Magi]] to the [[birth of Jesus]] who brought the gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] as an act of [[adoration]];
* enables worshippers to use all of their senses in order to [[worship]] – worship with the whole person, not just the mind;
* is "[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational]]" – by placing an emphasis on liturgical action and physical objects, it draws attention to the importance that Christians should attach to the fact that they believe that, in [[Jesus]], "the Word became flesh" ({{bibleverse||John|1}}): those things are part of what God makes and saves, and not repudiated by Him;
* is the most effective form of worship for cultures that are either highly visual or in which [[literacy]] rates are low;
* is beautiful and an expression of the human response to God that calls on humans to offer their best in worship – a way of expressing the value ("worth") that they place on God : worship is, [[etymologically]], "worth-ship"

===Common arguments of some Anglicans against ritualism===
[[File:John Charles Ryle Vanity Fair 26 March 1881.jpg|thumb|150px|[[John Charles Ryle|Bishop Ryle of Liverpool]] – a leading critic of ritualism [http://www.churchsociety.org/publications/tracts/CAT004_RyleRitualism.pdf] – by [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]], 1881 (See link to his tract at the bottom of this article).]]
Those who oppose ritualism in the Church of England have generally argued that it:
* encourages [[idolatry]] in that it encourages worshippers to focus on ritual objects and actions rather than the things they are meant to symbolise;
* constitutes an attempt to wrest the Church of England from its Protestant identity;
* constitutes a downgrading of the significance of [[preaching]] and biblical exposition in regular Christian worship;
* encourages an idolatrous attitude to the Eucharist because ritualism is predicated on a belief in the Real Presence;
* uses excessive elaborations in worship that cannot be justified on the basis of the descriptions of worship in the [[Gospels]], the [[Acts of the Apostles]], or the [[Epistles]] in the [[New Testament]] – the robes used in the worship of heaven described in the Book of Revelation are plain white;
* undermines a key Protestant belief that no human actions, even worship precisely and carefully offered, can be of any value when it comes to being [[justification (theology)|justified]] in the eyes of God: worship should be an unfussy, obedient, [[penitent]], grateful, and spontaneously joyful response to the experience of [[Born again (Christianity)|being saved]] by [[sola fide|faith alone]] in [[Jesus]] – ritual and tradition are merely human inventions;
* has often impeded the understanding of the gospel by wrapping up [[Christian]] worship in indecipherable [[symbol]]ic acts.
* is not beautiful as proponents claim but rather gaudy and distracting from contemplative worship

==Ritualist controversies in the 19th century==
===Origins===
[[Image:A "fiddleback" chasuble from the church of Saint Gertrude in Maarheeze in the Netherlands.jpg|thumb|A "fiddleback" chasuble, the use of which by a priest could lead to prosecution]]
The development of ritualism in the Church of England was mainly associated with what is commonly called "second generation" Anglo-Catholicism, i.e. the Oxford Movement as it developed after 1845 when [[John Henry Newman]] left the Church of England to become a Roman Catholic. Some scholars{{who|date=December 2013}} argued that it was almost inevitable that some of the leaders of Anglo-Catholicism turned their attentions to questions of liturgy and ritual and started to champion the use of practices and forms of worship more commonly associated with Roman Catholicism. There was only limited enthusiasm amongst ritualists to introduce the widespread use of [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] in the liturgy.

[[Image:Biretta.gif|frame|left|100px|Traditional [[biretta]]]]
The leaders of the first generation of the Anglo-Catholic revival or Oxford Movement (e.g. Newman, [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], and [[John Keble]]) had been primarily concerned with [[theological]] and [[ecclesiological]] questions and had little concern with questions of [[ritual]]. They championed the view that the fundamental identity of the Church of England was Catholic rather than Protestant.  They had argued that Anglicans were bound by obedience to the use of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. "Tract 3" of the ''[[Tracts for the Times]]'' series had strenuously argued against any revision of the ''Book of Common Prayer'', viewing its use as a matter of absolute obligation. Even ''[[Tract 90]]'', which analysed the [[39 Articles]], was more concerned with the theological dimension of the issue. It gave little attention to the question of altering current liturgical practice in the Church of England.

The ecclesiological questions gave rise to an interest in giving liturgical expression to the theological conviction that the Church of England had sustained a fundamentally Catholic character after the [[English Reformation]]. In some circles, the shift of focus to the question of liturgy proved as provocative as had been the theological assertions of the first generation of Anglo-Catholicism.

The clearest illustration of the shift that took place within Anglo-Catholicism from theological to liturgical questions is to be found in Pusey's attitude towards ritualism. Pusey, the only pre-eminent first-generation leader of Anglo-Catholicism to survive into the second generation, had no sympathy with the preoccupation with ritual. However, when priests started to be prosecuted and imprisoned as a result of the [[Public Worship Regulation Act 1874]], Pusey was quick to show his support for those who were prosecuted.

===Early controversies in the 19th century===
===="Bells and smells": the controversial ritual practices====
From the 1850s to the 1890s, several [[liturgical]] practices espoused by many ritualists led to some occasional and intense local controversies – some leading to prosecutions (most notably as a result of the [[Public Worship Regulation Act 1874]]). Those considered most important by adherents of the Catholic movement were known as the "six points":
* the use of Eucharistic [[vestments]] such as the [[chasuble]], [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], [[alb]] and [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]
* the use of [[Altar bell|bell]]s at the [[Elevation (Liturgy)|elevation]] of the [[Host (Holy Communion)|host]]
* the use of a [[thurible]] and [[incense]]
* the use of "lights" (especially the practice of putting six candles on the high [[altar]])
* the use of unleavened (wafer) bread in [[Eucharist|communion]]
* eastward facing celebration of the [[Eucharist]] (when the priest celebrates facing the altar from the same side as the people, i.e. the priest faces east with the people, instead of standing at the "north side" of the "table" placed in the chancel or body of the church, as required by the 1662 Book of Common Prayer)
* making the [[sign of the cross]]
* the mixing of sacramental wine with water

Other contentious practices included:
* the use of Catholic terminology such as describing the Eucharist as the "[[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]"
* the use of liturgical [[processions]]
* the decoration of churches with statues of saints, pictures of religious scenes and [[icons]]
* the veneration of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and the practice of the invocation of the [[saints]]
* the practice of [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]]
* the use of the words of Benedictus at the end of the [[Sanctus]] in the eucharistic prayer
* the use of the words of the [[Agnus Dei]] in the Eucharist

In regard to the "North Side" celebration. At the time of the Reformation, altars were fixed against the east end of the church, and the priests would celebrate the Mass standing at the front of the altar.  Beginning with the [[rubric]]s of the Second Prayer Book of [[Edward VI]] published in 1552, and through the 1662 [[Book of Common Prayer]] (which prevailed for almost 300 years), the priest is directed to stand "at the north syde of the Table."  This was variously interpreted over the years to mean the north side of the front of a fixed communion table, the north end of a fixed table (i.e., facing south), the north side of a free-standing table (presumably facing those intending to receive the Elements who would be sitting in the quire stalls opposite), or at the north  end of a free-standing table lengthwise in the chancel, facing a congregation seated in the [[nave]]. If the last option then it would copy the practice of the Early Church when the celebrant stood before a small stone or marble table, usually rectangular, facing the nave.

The ritualist movement (see [[Cambridge Camden Society]]) also played a substantial role in promoting:
* the restoration of [[chancel]]s in [[parish church]]es
* the use of robed [[choir]]s seated in the [[chancel]] accompanied by [[pipe organ]] rather than by a [[Church music|Church band]] and seated in a [[West gallery music|west gallery]] at the back of the church.

[[Image:FatherTooth.jpeg|thumb|right|Father [[Arthur Tooth]] [[Society of the Holy Cross|SSC]] who was prosecuted for ritualist practices]]
The prosecution and conviction of [[Arthur Tooth]] in 1876, [[Sidney Faithorn Green]] in 1879 and [[Richard William Enraght]] in 1880 are good illustrative examples of the kind of issues that could be involved in controversies caused by these liturgical practices. The prosecutions (which were often instigated by the [[Church Association]]) gave considerable impetus to the foundation and work of the [[English Church Union]]. The [[Society of the Holy Cross]] (SSC) played a crucial role in championing and developing the use of elements of proscribed Catholic [[ritual]] in [[Anglicanism]].

====Perception of ritualism as a threat to English identity====
For many who opposed ritualism, the key concern was to defend what they saw as the fundamentally [[Protestant]] identity of the Church of England. Nor was this just a matter of an [[ecclesiological]] argument: for many, there was a sense that [[Catholic]] worship is somehow "un-English". Catholicism was deeply associated in many minds with cultural identities which, historically, many English people had commonly treated with suspicion, especially the Spanish, the French, and the Irish.

For an ideological defence of this position, it was argued that English identity was closely tied in with England's history as a Protestant country that, after the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], had played a key role in opposing Catholic powers in Continental Europe (especially Spain and then France). In the minds of such people, Protestantism was inextricably identified with anti-[[despotic]] values and Catholicism with [[autocracy]] that, in the religious arena, hid behind the "disguise" of such things as complicated rituals whose meaning deliberately lacked transparency. The opposition to ritualism therefore had a deeply cultural and [[symbol]]ic significance that extended far beyond purely [[theological]] concerns.

Ritualists themselves were often at pains to try and present the "Englishness" of the ritual they championed by (mostly) keeping English as the language of the liturgy and reconstructing [[Anglo-Catholicism]] as a recovery of pre-Reformation Catholic forms that were specifically English: a revival of interest in the [[Sarum Rite]] (the pre-Reformation Catholic liturgy of [[Salisbury]]) was sparked off by the Ritualist movement. This tendency was also often expressed in such details as the revival in the use of the pre-Reformation [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] forms rather than the [[Baroque]] – the Baroque was more closely linked in the minds of many with specifically continental and [[Counter Reformation]] forms.

====Ritualism and Christian Socialism====
Although ritualism had an aesthetic and ideological appeal for many in the cultural elite, and had a cognate relationship with the [[Gothic Revival]], the idea that it was inextricably linked with an inclination towards political despotism was a misapprehension. Ritualism had an appeal for many who were politically [[conservatism|conservative]] and had supporters highly placed in the establishment (e.g. [[Charles Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax|Viscount Halifax]] and [[John Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath|the 4th Marquess of Bath]]). However, the outlook of many of the ritualist [[clergy]] themselves, many of whom inevitably operated in some of the most deprived communities in England, resulted in their becoming politically radicalised by the experience – some became ardent [[Christian Socialists]].

====Anti-ritualism and "muscular Christianity"====
In the spectrum of hostility that it aroused, ritualism also provoked in some of its opponents a reaction that saw its theatricality and its aestheticism as symptoms of "[[effeminacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;David Hilliard: "UnEnglish and Unmanly: Anglo-Catholicism and Homosexuality": Victorian Studies: (Winter 1982): 181–210.&lt;/ref&gt; A typical charge was that ritualistic clergy were "man milliners", more concerned with lace and brocade than doctrine. Adverse reaction to this played a significant role in the evolution of the [[Broad Church|Broad]] and [[Low Church]] enthusiasm for "[[muscular Christianity]]".

===Ritualism and outreach to the unchurched urban poor===
One of the key ideological justifications used by many of the early ritualists, apart from the fact that it was a [[symbol]]ic way of affirming their belief in the essentially [[Catholic]] nature of [[Anglicanism]], was the argument that it provided a particularly effective medium for bringing Christianity to the poorest, "[[slum]] parishes" of the [[Church of England]].

It was argued that [[ritual]] and [[aesthetic]]ally impressive [[liturgy]] did not only provide a powerful contrast to the drabness of the lives of the poor, its emphasis on [[symbol]] and action rather than word was a more effective medium for spreading Christian faith in areas with poor [[literacy]] rates than the highly cerebral and [[logocentric]] worship that was focused on the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. This argument may have had some merits, but, very often, the respect that the most successful ritualists often gained in the highly impoverished communities they went to serve was based on the fact that they had expressed a genuine [[Pastoral care|pastoral]] concern for the poor amongst whom they lived.

The argument for ritualism in [[Anglicanism]] was also based on the analogy of the success of the Roman Catholic Church amongst the highly impoverished [[Irish diaspora|Irish migrant communities]] in the urban areas of England – it was argued by some that ritual played a key role in the growth of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] amongst the poor. However, the use of ritual probably played little more than a subsidiary role in the success of the Catholic Church in this area: its success was probably largely due to a special cultural identity that many Irish migrants felt with the Roman Catholic Church as one of the few institutions that they encountered in [[Irish diaspora|diaspora]] that was also a feature of life in their homeland.

===Legacy of the controversies===
[[Image:Edward King.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Edward King (English bishop)|Edward King]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]], by [[Leslie Ward]] 1890 – King was prosecuted for ritualist practices.]]
The ritualists use of [[vestments]] and wafer bread have become widespread, even normative, in the Church of England for much of the 20th century.

Although many members of the Church of England today still feel uncomfortable or sceptical about certain 'Catholic' or 'Romish'  liturgical practices,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} they would be astonished{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} to be told that, in the late 19th century, using [[incense]], wearing [[vestments]], putting candles on the [[altar]], the mixed cup, making the sign of the Cross over the congregation, and using unleavened (wafer) bread in the [[Eucharist]] could spark riots, put [[priest]]s in prison and even led in 1888–90 to the prosecution of a bishop – [[Edward King (English bishop)|Edward King]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]]. The lasting legacy is that the Ritualists won: the current liturgical style in its various manifestations in almost all Anglican parishes world-wide is much closer to the way Mass was celebrated 500 years ago even in Low Church and 'mid-range' parishes. What offended so many 150 years ago are the new norm and even fewer seem to care or even know about past fights.

'''''South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today''''' is the first [[non-fiction]] book in [[Blackwell Publishing]] Company’s Philosophy &amp; Pop Culture series and is edited by philosopher and ontologist, [[Robert Arp]], at the time assistant professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Southwest Minnesota State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9781405161602&amp;site=1 South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901034507/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9781405161602&amp;site=1 |date=2007-09-01 }}, Blackwell Publishing, ''Series: The Blackwell Philosophy and Pop Culture Series'', Retrieved 2008-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  The series itself is edited by [[William Irwin (philosopher)|William Irwin]], who is a professor of philosophy at [[King's College, Pennsylvania]] in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]].  The book utilizes the five classic branches of [[Western philosophy]], namely, [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[political philosophy]], and [[logic]], in order to analyze episodes of ''[[South Park]]'' as well as place the show in a context of current [[popular culture]].

The book was published December 1, 2006. The following year, ''[[South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating]]''—volume 26 of [[Open Court Publishing Company]]'s Popular Culture and Philosophy series—was published, with editing by philosopher [[Richard Hanley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencourtbooks.com/books_n/south_park.htm South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating], [[Open Court Publishing Company]], ''Volume 26 in the Popular Culture and Philosophy series'', Retrieved 2008-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
The book includes contributions from twenty-two academics in the field of philosophy.  Topics include issues of sexuality involved in depicting [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Satan]] as gay lovers, [[existentialism]] as applied to the death of [[Kenny (South Park)|Kenny]], and a debate about whether [[feminist]]s can enjoy the show due to some of its [[misogynistic]] characters.&lt;ref&gt;"South Park and Philosophy". ''Internet Bookwatch''. April 2007., Copyright 2007: Midwest Book Review.&lt;/ref&gt;  The contributors to the work utilize philosophical concepts derived from [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Freud]] and [[Sartre]] and place them in a ''South Park'' context.&lt;ref name="publishers"&gt;"South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today", Book Review., ''Publishers Weekly'', 2006., Reed Business Information.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's contributors all attempted to analyze the philosophical and cultural aspects of ''South Park'' in the work. One of the authors, [[David Koepsell]], wrote about the controversial episode dealing with [[Scientology]], entitled: "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]".&lt;ref name="arp"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Arp |editor-first=Robert |editor2=William Irwin | title = South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today | publisher = Blackwell Publishing (The Blackwell Philosophy &amp; Pop Culture Series) | date = December 1, 2006 |  pages = 27, 59, 60, 118, 120, 132, 137, 138, 140, 224 |   id = , | isbn = 1-4051-6160-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koepsell cited the fact that the series won a [[Peabody Award]] due to its willingness to criticize intolerance in April 2006 as a "special concern for criticizing and countering intolerance", and the notion that "the Church of Scientology suffers from the widely held perceptions that it seeks to silence former members and others who criticize its beliefs and practices" as the motivation behind the episode.&lt;ref name="arp" /&gt; Koepsell analyzed [[Comedy Central]]'s reaction to the episode itself, in a section of his book entitled "2005–2006: Comedy Central Caves".&lt;ref name="arp" /&gt; He mentions ''South Park's'' usage of the onscreen caption "this is what Scientologists actually believe". in the episode, noting that the same device was used in the episode "[[All About the Mormons?]]". In referencing this similar use of the onscreen caption device, Koepsell seemed to point to an inconsistency in the behavior of Comedy Central relative to the episode. He explained "By a long shot, this show was more kind to Scientology than was "All About the Mormons" to Mormonism."&lt;ref name="arp" /&gt; He noted Comedy Central had suggested it would not rebroadcast the episode for the second time, though it later announced on July 12, 2006 that it would.&lt;ref name="arp" /&gt;

== Reception ==
A review in ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' called the work an "indispensable collection of thought-provoking essays".&lt;ref&gt;"South Park and Philosophy", Book Review, ''[[The Boston Herald]]'', January 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was featured on ''The Book Show'' radio program on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]].  Host Lynne Mitchell wrote that most of the contributors to the book succeeded in teaching philosophy to the reader while discussing the various ''South Park'' episodes.  However Mitchell also commented that she was annoyed by a pretend interview by the editor with the creators of ''South Park'', which she felt was made up in "a kind of South Park pastiche".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bookshow/stories/2007/2005850.htm Learning from South Park], Lynne Mitchell, ''The Book Show'', [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], August 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''Publishers Weekly'' stated that "some of the writers' attempts at lowbrow humor can be embarrassingly off-mark", but also noted that pop-philosophy devotees and South Park fans with a philosophical bent will enjoy the book.&lt;ref name="publishers" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41406">[[image:LippenStudium1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Children]] copy with their own [[mouth]]s the words spoken by the mouths of those around them. This enables them to learn the [[pronunciation]] of words not already in their [[vocabulary]].]]
'''Speech repetition''' is the [[speech|saying]] by one individual of the spoken [[Speech production|vocalizations]] made by another individual. This requires the ability in the person making the copy to map the sensory input they [[Hearing (sense)|hear]] from the other person's vocal [[pronunciation]] into a similar motor output with their own [[vocal tract]].

Such speech input output imitation often occurs independently of speech comprehension such as in [[speech shadowing]] when a person automatically says words heard in [[earphone]]s, and the pathological condition of [[echolalia]] in which people [[reflex]]ively repeat overheard words. This links to speech repetition of words being separate in the [[human brain|brain]] to [[speech perception]]. Speech repetition occurs in the  dorsal speech processing stream while speech perception occurs in the ventral speech processing stream. Repetitions are often incorporated unawares by this route into spontaneous novel sentences immediately or after delay following  storage in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]].

In humans, the ability to map heard input vocalizations into motor output is highly developed due to this copying ability playing a critical role in a child's rapid expansion of their  [[Vocabulary#Vocabulary growth|spoken vocabulary]]. In older children and adults it still remains important as it enables the continued learning of novel words and names and [[Second language acquisition|additional languages]]. Such repetition is also necessary for the propagation of language from generation to generation. It has also been suggested that the phonetic units out of which speech is made have been selected upon by the process of vocabulary expansion and vocabulary [[cultural evolution|transmission]]s  due to  children preferentially copying words in terms of more easily imitated elementary units.

The ability to repeat and imitate speech sounds occurs separately to that of normal speech. Speech shadowing provides evidence of a 'privileged' input/output speech loop that is distinct to the other components of the speech system.&lt;ref name="McLeod"&gt;McLeod P. Posner MI. (1984).

===Effector independent===
Speech sounds can be imitatively mapped into vocal articulations in spite of vocal tract anatomy differences in size and shape due to [[gender]], [[Human development (biology)|age]] and individual [[anatomical]] variability. Such variability is extensive making input output mapping of speech more complex than a simple mapping of vocal track movements. The shape of the mouth varies widely: [[dentist]]s recognize three basic shapes of [[palate]]: trapezoid, ovoid, and triagonal; six types of [[malocclusion]] between the two [[jaw]]s; nine ways teeth relate to the [[dental arch]] and a wide range of [[maxilla]]ry and [[human mandible|mandible]] deformities.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomer HH. (1971). Speech defects associated with dental malocclusions and related abnormalities. In L. E. (Eds), Handbook of speech pathology and audiology (pp. 715-766), New York, Appleton Century. {{ISBN|978-0-13-381764-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vocal sound can also vary due to dental injury and [[dental caries]]. Other factors that do not impede  the sensory motor mapping needed for vocal imitation  are gross oral deformations such as [[hare-lip]]s, [[cleft palate]]s or amputations of the tongue tip, pipe smoking, pencil biting and teeth clinching (such as in [[ventriloquism]]). [[Paranasal sinuses]]  vary between individuals 20-fold in volume, and differ in the presence and the degree of their  asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Williams RJ. (1967). You are extra-ordinary. New York, Random House.  pp. 26-27. {{OCLC|156187572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vocal traits also vary moreover when people get upper respiratory tract infections  as the shape and size of sinus cavities is further changed with the swelling of mucous membranes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diverse linguistic vocalizations===
Vocal imitation occurs potentially in regard to a diverse range of phonetic units and types of vocalization. The world's languages use [[consonant|consonantal phone]]s that differ in thirteen imitable vocal tract [[place of articulation]]s (from the [[lip]]s to the [[glottis]]). These phones can potentially be pronounced with eleven types of imitable [[manner of articulation]]s ([[nasal stop]]s to [[lateral click]]s). Speech can be copied in regard to its [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|social accent]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Pitch accent|pitch]] and individuality (as with entertainment [[impersonator]]s). Speech can be articulated in ways which diverge considerably in speed, [[timbre]], pitch, [[loudness]] and [[emotion]]. Speech further exists in different forms such as [[song]], [[Poetry|verse]], [[Vociferation|scream]] and [[whispering|whisper]]. Intelligible speech can be produced with pragmatic intonation and in [[regional dialect]]s and [[Accent (dialect)|foreign accents]]. These aspects are readily copied: people asked to repeat speech-like words imitate not only phones but also accurately other pronunciation aspects such as [[fundamental frequency]],&lt;ref name="Kappes"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kappes | first1 = J. | last2 = Baumgaertner | first2 = A. | last3 = Peschke | first3 = C. | last4 = Ziegler | first4 = W. | title = Unintended imitation in nonword repetition | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2009.08.008 | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 140–151 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19811813| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[schwa]]-syllable expression,&lt;ref name="Kappes"/&gt; voice [[spectrum|spectra]] and lip [[kinematic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 16698051|year= 2007|author1= Gentilucci|first1= M|title= Imitation during phoneme production|journal= Neuropsychologia|volume= 45|issue= 3|pages= 608–15|last2= Bernardis|first2= P|doi= 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[voice onset time]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Mechanism==

Spoken words are sequences of motor movements organized around vocal tract gesture motor targets.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer LH. (1984). Motor programming in language production. In H. Bouma &amp; D. G. Bouwhuis, (Eds), Attention and performance, X. pp. (17-41). London, Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-86377-005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalization due to this is copied in terms of the motor goals that organize it rather than the exact movements with which it is produced. These vocal motor goals are auditory. According to James Abbs&lt;ref&gt;Abbs JH. (1986). Invariance and variability in speech production, A distinction between linguistic intent and its neuromotor implementation. In J. S. Perkell, &amp; D. H. Klatt, (Eds), Invariance and variability in speech processes (pp. 202-219). Hillsdale, NJ, Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-89859-545-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'For speech motor actions, the individual articulatory movements would not appear to be controlled with regard to three- dimensional spatial targets, but rather with regard to their contribution to complex vocal tract goals such as resonance properties (e.g., shape, degree of constriction) and or aerodynamically significant variables'. Speech sounds also have duplicable higher-order characteristics such as rates and shape of modulations and rates and shape of frequency shifts.&lt;ref&gt;Porter RJ. (1987). What is the relation between speech production and speech perception? In: Allport A, MacKay D G, Prinz W G, Scheerer E, eds. Language Perception and Production. London: Academic Press,: 85-106. {{ISBN|978-0-12-052750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such complex auditory goals (which often link—though not always—to internal vocal gestures) are detectable from the speech sound which they create.

==Neurology==

===Dorsal speech processing stream function===

Two cortical processing streams exist: a ventral one which maps sound onto meaning, and a dorsal one, that maps  sound onto motor representations. The dorsal stream projects from the posterior [[Sylvian fissure]] at the [[temporoparietal junction]], onto frontal motor areas, and is not normally involved in speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Evolution and language==
Human language is a vocabulary-based form of communication that  unlike that of other animals employs tens of thousands of lexicals and names. This requires that young humans new to language have the ability to quickly learn both the pronunciations and use of many thousands of words. If children could not repeat speech without problems,  human language could not exist.&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt;  This makes the evolution of the capacity of speech repetition a critical innovation needed for the [[origin of speech]]&lt;ref name="skoyles"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motor theory of speech imitation argues that this need for speech to be imitable not speech perception nor [[speech production]] moreover underlies the evolved nature of the [[vowel]] and consonant units of phonetics.&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt;

==Sign language==
Words in [[sign languages]], unlike those in spoken ones, are made not of sequential units but of [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] configurations of subword unit arrangements, the spatial analogue of the sonic-chronological [[morpheme]]s of spoken language.&lt;ref name="Poizner"&gt;Poizner H. Klima ES. Bellugi U. (1987). What the hands reveal about the brain. MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-66066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These words, like spoken ones, are learnt by imitation.  Indeed, rare cases of compulsive sign-language echolalia exist in otherwise language-deficient deaf autistic individuals born into signing families.&lt;ref name="Poizner"/&gt; At least some cortical areas neurobiologically active during both sign and vocal speech, such as the auditory cortex, are associated with the act of imitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''''Taijin kyofusho''''' (対人恐怖症 taijin kyōfushō, '''TKS''', for ''taijin kyofusho symptoms'') is a [[Japan]]ese [[culture-specific syndrome]]. The term taijin kyofusho translates into the disorder (sho) of fear (kyofu) of interpersonal relations (taijin).&lt;ref&gt;Slayor, A. (2012, July 20). Taijin Kyofusho in Japan and South Korea. Retrieved June 19, 2013 from [http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp204-us12/2012/07/20/taijin-kyofusho-in-japan-and-south-korea/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have taijin kyofusho are likely to be extremely embarrassed about themselves or fearful of displeasing others when it comes to the functions of their bodies or their appearances. These bodily functions and appearances include their faces, odor, actions, or even looks. They do not want to embarrass other people with their presence. This culture-bound syndrome is a [[social phobia]] based on fear and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Nobuo Kiriike. (2003, February 3). Open Trial Of Milnacipran For Taijin-Kyofusho In Japanese Patients With Social Anxiety Disorder. Retrieved June 17, 2013 from EBSCOhost.[http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;sid=dcb03d77-cc80-4fbc-b7c7-4f666f44fab1%40sessionmgr113&amp;hid=116]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms of this disorder include avoiding social outings and activities, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, panic attacks, trembling, and feelings of dread and panic when around people. The causes of this disorder are mainly from emotional trauma or psychological defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;James, R. (2006). Culture-bound syndromes: Taijin Kyofusho. In Y.

==Subcategories==
''Taijin kyofusho'' is commonly described as a form of [[social anxiety]] (social [[phobia]]), with the person dreading and avoiding social contact, and as a subtype of ''shinkeishitsu'' ([[anxiety disorder]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1363461504047933 |title=Taijin Kyofusho in University Students: Patterns of Fear and Predispositions to the Offensive Variant |year=2004 |last1=Tarumi |first1=S. |journal=Transcultural Psychiatry |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=533–46 |pmid=15709650 |last2=Ichimiya |first2=A |last3=Yamada |first3=S |last4=Umesue |first4=M |last5=Kuroki |first5=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, instead of a fear of [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]] themselves or being harshly judged by others because of their social ineptness, sufferers of ''taijin kyofusho'' report a fear of offending or harming other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=520018 |year=1979 |last1=Tanaka-Matsumi |first1=J |title=Taijin Kyofusho: Diagnostic and cultural issues in Japanese psychiatry |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=231–45 |journal=Culture, medicine and psychiatry |doi=10.1007/bf00114612}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kawai, T., Minabe, Y., ori, N., Suzuki, K., Takei, N., (2003)., Is Taijin Kyofusho a Culture-Bound Syndrome?. http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=176343&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is thus on avoiding harm to others rather than to oneself.

In the fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]), variants of ''taijin kyofusho'' (shubo-kyofu and jikoshu-kyofu) are listed under 300.3 (F42) "Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders".&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5.|year=2013|publisher=Amer. Psychiatric Pub. Incorporated.|location=Arlington, VA|isbn=9780890425541|edition=5th|pages=263–264, 837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source{{which|date=July 2014}} even breaks ''taijin kyofusho'' into two different subtypes: neurotic and offensive. The first subtype can be broken into two parts that are classical type and avoidant type. The classical type being afraid of being judged negatively because of physical signs of anxiety and feeling shame due to anxiety. The physical signs that can cause fear of being judged include sweating and tremors. The second subtype deals with people thinking something about them is offensive. Some of their fears include body odor, gas, excessive or insufficient eye contact, blushing, etc.

In the official Japanese diagnostic system, ''taijin kyofusho'' is subdivided into the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2012 |chapter=Culture specific diagnoses |chapterurl=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/328181.html |editor1-first=Sana |editor1-last=Loue |editor2-first=Martha |editor2-last=Sajatovic |title=Encyclopedia of Immigrant health |location=New York |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-5659-0}}{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sekimen-kyofu ({{lang-ja|赤面恐怖}}), the phobia of [[blushing]] (ereuthophobia)
* Shubo-kyofu ({{lang-ja|醜貌恐怖}}), the phobia of a deformed body, similar to [[body dysmorphic disorder]]
* Jikoshisen-kyofu ({{lang-ja|自己視線恐怖}}), the phobia of [[eye contact]]
* Jikoshu-kyofu ({{lang-ja|自己臭恐怖}}), the phobia of having foul [[body odor]] (also termed [[olfactory reference syndrome]], osmophobia or bromidrosiphobia)

Japan psychology also recognizes additional types of ''taijin kyofusho'' based on severity:

* Transient: This type of ''taijin kyofusho'' is short-lived and moderately severe. It most commonly appears in teens, but may occur at any time.
* Delusional: This is the most common type of ''taijin kyofusho'' and is the most similar to social phobia. It is chronic, often begins before the age of 30, and varies in severity from moderate to severe.
* Phobic with [[schizophrenia]]: This is a more complicated disorder. In such cases, rather than a phobia, ''taijin kyofusho'' is a manifestation of schizophrenic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Fritscher, L. (2013, April 01). Taijin Kyofusho. Retrieved from www.about.com. June 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
Typically, this disease is presaged by a childhood history of social inhibition and [[shyness]].&lt;ref name="Saunders, D. 2013"/&gt; It is possible that it could result from a humiliating traumatic experience, or it could emerge from a lifelong onset of the illness that only comes to the surface after time.&lt;ref name="Saunders, D. 2013"/&gt;

Clinical data indicates that more males have the condition than females, despite the fact that females scored higher on a [[social phobia]] scale than men, and report higher scores on proclivity towards feelings of embarrassment. This differs from Western society where the prevalence of females with social phobias is to some extent greater than that of males.&lt;ref name="Saunders, D. 2013"/&gt; The lifetime prevalence of the disorder falls anywhere between 3% and 13% with changes in severity occurring throughout one's lifetime. It is estimated that about 17% of individuals with taijin kyofusho have fears of releasing foul body odor.&lt;ref name="Feusner"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/da.20688 |title=Olfactory reference syndrome: Issues for DSM-V |year=2010 |last1=Feusner |first1=Jamie D. |last2=Phillips |first2=Katharine A. |last3=Stein |first3=Dan J. |journal=Depression and Anxiety |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=592–9 |pmid=20533369 |pmc=4247225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
A person may be diagnosed with taijin kyofusho if they feel as if their attitudes, behavior, and physical characteristics are inadequate in social situations. As a result of these feelings, they also experience persistent suffering in the form of emotional distress through [[shame]], embarrassment, anxiety, fear, and other tense feelings that occur when confronted with social circumstances. In addition, individuals also worry about being unable to maintain healthy relationships with others. When it comes to socializing, taijin kyofusho sufferers avoid painful social and interpersonal situations, while simultaneously being averse to doing so.&lt;ref name="Saunders, D. 2013"/&gt; Those likely to develop taijin kyofusho have more of a temperamental characteristic of being hypochondriacal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 10454167| year = 1999| author1 = Maeda| first1 = F| title = Understanding taijin kyofusho through its treatment, Morita therapy| journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research| volume = 46| issue = 6| pages = 525–30| last2 = Nathan| first2 = J. H. | doi=10.1016/S0022-3999(98)00113-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance between introversion and extroversion in hypochondriacal temperament is geared more towards introversion. The introversion causes sufferers to focus on themself and problems they have, and by fixating on their weaknesses they become more anxious and depressed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A problem with culture-bound syndromes is that they are resistant to some medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid, A., (2012). Taijin Kyofusho- "The Disorder of Fear".&lt;/ref&gt;{{better_source|date=October 2014}}}{{medical_citation_needed|date=October 2014}} The standard Japanese treatment for taijin kyofusho is [[Morita therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kora |first=T. |title=Morita Therapy |publisher=The ToDo Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[Shoma Morita]] in the 1910s as a treatment for the Japanese mental disorders taijin kyofusho and shinkeishitsu ([[Anxiety|nervousness]]). The original regimen involved patient isolation, enforced [[bed rest]], diary writing, manual labor, and lectures on the importance of self-acceptance and positive endeavor. Since the 1930s, the treatment has been modified to include out-patient and [[Group psychotherapy|group treatments]]. This modified version is known as neo-Morita therapy. Medications have also gained acceptance as a treatment option for taijin kyofusho. Other treatments include [[systematic desensitization]], which includes slowly exposing one self to the fear, and learning relaxation skills, to extinguish fear and anxiety.

[[Milnacipran]], a [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRI), is currently used in the treatment of taijin kyofusho and has been shown to be efficacious for the related [[social anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref name=amn&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13651500510029228 |title=Effect of milnacipran on insight and stress coping strategy in patients with Taijin Kyofusho |year=2005 |last1=Nagata |first1=Toshihiko |last2=Wada |first2=Akira |last3=Yamada |first3=Hisashi |last4=Iketani |first4=Toshiya |last5=Kiriike |first5=Obuo |journal=International Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=193–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary aspect of treating this disorder is getting patients to focus their attention on their body parts and sensations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Image:Tecnology Life Cycle.png|right|frame|The typical life-cycle of a manufacturing process or production system from the stages of its initial conception to its culmination as either a technique or procedure of common practice or to its demise. The Y-axis of the diagram shows the business gain to the proprietor of the technology while the X-axis traces its lifetime.]]

The '''technology life-cycle''' ('''TLC''') describes the commercial gain of a product through the expense of research and development phase, and the financial return during its "vital life". Some technologies, such as steel, paper or cement manufacturing, have a long lifespan (with minor variations in technology incorporated with time) while in other cases, such as electronic or pharmaceutical products, the lifespan may be quite short.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nInjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=The+technology+underlying+the+product+(for+example,+that+of+a+uniquely+flavoured+tea)+may+be+quite+marginal+but+the+process+of+creating+and+managing+its+life+as+a#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20technology%20underlying%20the%20product%20(for%20example%2C%20that%20of%20a%20uniquely%20flavoured%20tea)%20may%20be%20quite%20marginal%20but%20the%20process%20of%20creating%20and%20managing%20its%20life%20as%20a&amp;f=false|title=Proceedings of IAC-MEM 2015 in Vienna|last=group of authors|publisher=Czech Institute of Academic Education z.s., 2015|year=2015|isbn=9788090579156|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TLC associated with a product or technological service is different from product life-cycle (PLC) dealt with in [[product life-cycle management]]. The latter is concerned with the life of a product in the marketplace with respect to timing of introduction, marketing measures, and business costs. The ''technology'' underlying the product (for example, that of a uniquely flavoured tea) may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different. 

The technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology, the timeline of recovering cost, and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved. The TLC may, further, be protected during its cycle with [[patents]] and [[trademark]]s seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it.

The ''product'' of the technology may be a commodity such as [[polyethylene]] plastic or a sophisticated product like the [[integrated circuit]]s used in a [[smartphone]].

The development of a ''competitive product'' or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology, making it shorter. Equally, the loss of intellectual property rights through litigation or loss of its secret elements (if any) through leakages also work to reduce a technology's lifespan. Thus, it is apparent that the ''management'' of the TLC is an important aspect of technology development.

Most new technologies follow a similar technology maturity lifecycle describing the [[technological maturity]] of a product. This is not similar to a [[product life cycle management|product life cycle]], but applies to an entire technology, or a generation of a technology.

Technology adoption is the most common phenomenon driving the evolution of industries along the industry lifecycle. After expanding new uses of resources they end with exhausting the efficiency of those processes, producing gains that are first easier and larger over time then exhaustingly more difficult, as the [[mature technology|technology matures]].

==The four phases of the technology life-cycle==
The TLC may be seen as composed of four phases:
#The '''research and development  (R&amp;D)''' phase (sometimes called the "bleeding edge") when incomes from inputs are negative and where the prospects of failure are high 
#The '''ascent''' phase when out-of-pocket costs have been recovered and the technology begins to gather strength by going beyond some Point A on the TLC (sometimes called the "leading edge") 
#The '''maturity''' phase when gain is high and stable, the region, going into saturation, marked by M, and 
#The '''decline''' (or decay phase), after a Point D, of reducing fortunes and utility of the technology.

===S-curve===
The shape of the technology lifecycle is often referred to as S-curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.improvementandinnovation.com/features/article/understanding-s-curve-innovation/|accessdate=15 October 2012|title=Understanding S-curve Innovation|journal=Improvementandinnovation.com|author=Dr. Chandana Jayalath|date=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology perception dynamics==
There is usually [[technology hype]] at the introduction of any new technology, but only after some time has passed can it be judged as mere hype or justified true acclaim.
Because of the [[logistic curve]] nature of technology adoption, it is difficult to see in the early stages whether the hype is excessive.

The two errors commonly committed in the early stages of a technology's development are:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* fitting an exponential curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming eternal [[exponential growth]]
* fitting a linear curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming that take-up of the new technology is disappointing

[[Image:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|Rogers' bell curve|300px]]
Similarly, in the later stages, the opposite mistakes can be made relating to the possibilities of [[mature technology|technology maturity]] and [[market saturation]].

The [[technology adoption life cycle]] typically occurs in an S curve, as modelled in [[diffusion of innovations]] theory. This is because customers respond to new products in different ways. Diffusion of innovations theory, pioneered by [[Everett Rogers]], posits that people have different levels of readiness for adopting new [[innovation]]s and that the characteristics of a product affect overall adoption. Rogers classified individuals into five groups: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. In terms of the S curve, innovators occupy 2.5%, early adopters 13.5%, early majority 34%, late majority 34%, and laggards 16%.

The four stages of technology life cycle are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.scribd.com/doc/20309856/Technology-Management-Growth-Lifecycle Technology Management - Growth &amp; Lifecycle], Shahid kv, Sep 28, 2009, Attribution Non-commercial&lt;/ref&gt;
*Innovation stage: This stage represents the birth of a new product, material of process resulting from R&amp;D activities. In R&amp;D laboratories, new ideas are generated depending on gaining needs and knowledge factors. Depending on the resource allocation and also the change element, the time taken in the innovation stage as well as in the subsequent stages varies widely.
*Syndication stage: This stage represents the demonstration and commercialisation of a new technology, such as, product, material or process with potential for immediate utilisation. Many innovations are put on hold in R&amp;D laboratories. Only a very small percentage of these are commercialised. Commercialisation of research outcomes depends on technical as well non-technical, mostly economic factors.
*[[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]] stage: This represents the market penetration of a new technology through acceptance of the innovation, by potential users of the technology. But supply and demand side factors jointly influence the rate of diffusion.
*Substitution stage: This last stage represents the decline in the use and eventual extension of a technology, due to replacement by another technology. Many technical and non-technical factors influence the rate of substitution. The time taken in the substitution stage depends on the market dynamics.

==Licensing options==
Large corporations develop technology for their own benefit and not with the objective of licensing. The tendency to license out technology only appears when there is a threat to the life of the TLC (business gain) as discussed later.&lt;ref&gt;Bayus, B. (1998). An Analysis of Product Lifetimes in a Technologically Dynamic Industry. Management Science, 44(6), pp.763-775.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Licensing in the R&amp;D phase===
There are always smaller firms ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]) who are inadequately situated to finance the development of innovative R&amp;D in the post-research and early technology phases. By sharing incipient technology under certain conditions,  substantial risk financing can come from third parties. This is a form of quasi-licensing which takes different formats. Even large corporates may not wish to bear all costs of development in  areas of significant and high risk (e.g. aircraft development) and may seek means of spreading  it to the stage that proof-of-concept is obtained.

In the case of small and medium firms, entities such as [[venture capitalists]] or business angels, can enter the scene and help to materialize technologies. Venture capitalists accept both the costs and uncertainties of R&amp;D, and that of market acceptance, in reward for high returns when the technology proves itself. Apart from finance, they may provide networking, management and marketing support. Venture capital connotes financial as well as human capital.

Larger firms may opt for Joint R&amp;D or work in a consortium for the early phase of development. Such vehicles are called [[strategic alliance]]s – strategic partnerships.
 
With both venture capital funding and strategic (research) alliances, when business gains begin to neutralize development costs (the TLC crosses the X-axis), the ownership of the technology starts to undergo change.

In the case  of smaller firms, venture capitalists help clients enter the stock market for obtaining substantially larger funds for development, maturation of  technology, product promotion and to meet marketing costs. A major route is through [[Initial Public Offering|initial public offering]] (IPO) which invites risk funding by the public for potential high gain. At the same time, the IPOs enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre-allotted to them (subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange). When the IPO is fully subscribed, the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans, etc. if needed.

Strategic alliance partners, allied on research, pursue separate paths of development with the incipient technology of common origin but pool their accomplishments through instruments such as 'cross-licensing'. Generally, contractual provisions among the members of the consortium allow a member to exercise the option of independent pursuit after joint consultation; in which case the optee owns all subsequent development.

===Licensing in the ascent phase ===
The ascent stage of the technology usually refers to some point above Point A in the TLC diagram but actually it  commences when the R&amp;D portion of the TLC curve inflects (only that the cashflow is negative and unremunerative to Point A). The ascent is the strongest phase of the TLC because it is here that the technology is superior to alternatives and can command premium profit or gain. The slope and duration of the ascent depends on competing technologies entering the domain, although they may not be ''as successful'' in that period. Strongly patented technology extends  the duration period.

The TLC begins to flatten out (the region shown as M) when equivalent or challenging technologies come into the competitive space and begin to eat away marketshare.

Till this stage is reached, the technology-owning firm would tend to exclusively enjoy its profitability, preferring ''not'' to license it. If an overseas opportunity does present itself, the firm would prefer to set up a  controlled subsidiary rather than license a third party.

===Licensing in the maturity phase===
The maturity phase of the technology is a period of stable and remunerative income but its competitive viability can persist over the larger timeframe marked by its 'vital life'. However, there may be a tendency to license out the technology to third parties during this stage to lower risk of  decline in profitability (or competitivity) and to expand financial opportunity.

The exercise of this option is, generally, inferior to seeking participatory exploitation; in other words, engagement in [[joint venture]], typically in regions where the technology would be in the ''ascent phase'',as say, a developing country. In addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the   technology-owner a degree of control over its use. Gain flows from the two streams of investment-based and royalty incomes. Further, the vital life of the technology is enhanced  in such strategy.

===Licensing in the decline phase===
After reaching a point such as D in the above diagram, the earnings from the technology begin to decline rather rapidly. To prolong the life cycle, owners of technology might try to license it out at  some point L when it can still be attractive to firms in other markets. This, then, traces the lengthening path, LL'. Further, since the decline is the result of competing rising technologies in this space, licenses may be attracted to the general lower cost of the older technology (than what prevailed during its vital life).

Licenses obtained in this phase are 'straight licenses'. They are free of direct control from the owner of the technology (as would otherwise apply, say, in the case of a joint-venture). Further, there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology.

The utility, viability, and thus the cost of straight-licenses depends on the estimated 'balance life' of the technology. For instance, should the key patent on the technology have expired, or would expire in a short while, the residual viability of the technology may be limited, although balance life may be governed by other criteria such as [[knowhow]] which could have a longer life if properly protected.

''It is important to note that the license has no way of knowing the stage at which the prime, and competing technologies, are on their TLCs''. It would, of course, be evident to competing licensor firms, and to the originator, from the growth, saturation or decline of the profitability of their operations.

The license may, however, be able to approximate the stage by vigorously negotiating with the licensor and competitors to determine costs and licensing terms. A lower cost, or easier terms, ''may'' imply a declining technology.

In any case, access to technology in the decline phase is a large risk that the licensee accepts. (In a joint-venture this risk is substantially reduced by licensor  sharing it). Sometimes, financial guarantees from the licensor may work  to reduce such risk and can be negotiated.

There are instances when, even though the  technology declines to becoming a technique, it may still contain important knowledge or experience which the licensee firm cannot learn of without help from the originator. This  is often the  form that ''technical service'' and ''technical assistance'' contracts take (encountered often in developing country contracts). Alternatively, consulting agencies may fill this role.

== Technology development cycle ==
According to the [[Encyclopedia of Earth]], "In the simplest formulation, innovation can be thought of as being composed of research, development, demonstration, and deployment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/156452/|title=Technological Innovation|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Earth]] |accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Technology development cycle'' describes the process of a new technology through the stages of technological maturity:
#[[Research and development]]
#[[Scientific demonstration]]
#[[System deployment]]
#[[Diffusion]]

'''Travel technology''' (also called '''tourism technology''', and '''hospitality automation''') is the application of [[Information Technology]] (IT) or [[Information and Communications Technology]] (ICT) in the [[travel]], [[tourism]] and [[hospitality industry]].  One form of travel technology is [[Tracking (commercial airline flight)|flight tracking]].

Since travel implies locomotion, travel technology was originally associated with the [[computer reservations system]] (CRS) of the airlines industry, but now is used more inclusively, incorporating the broader tourism sector as well as its subset the hospitality industry. While travel technology includes the computer reservations system, it also represents a much broader range of applications, in fact increasingly so.  Travel technology includes [[virtual tourism]] in the form of [[virtual tour]] technologies.  Travel technology may also be referred to as ''e-travel'' / ''etravel'' or ''e-tourism'' / ''etourism'' ([[eTourism]]), in reference to "electronic travel" or "electronic tourism".

e-Tourism can be defined as the analysis, design, implementation and application of IT and e-commerce solutions in the [http://www.skypointindia.com/how-to-start-an-online-travel-agency-india.html travel&amp;tourism industry]; as well as the analysis of the respective economic processes and market structures and [[customer relationship management]].

From a communication science perspective, eTourism can be also defined as every application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) within both the hospitality and tourism industry, as well as within the tourism experience.

Travel technology is increasingly being used to describe systems for managing and monitoring travel, including travel tracking and [[Tracking (commercial airline flight)|flight tracking]] systems.

In other contexts, the term "travel technology" can refer to technology intended for use by travelers, such as light-weight laptop computers with universal power supplies or satellite Internet connections. That is not the sense in which it is used here.

== Applications ==
Travel technology includes many processes such as [[dynamic packaging]] which provide useful new options for consumers.  Today the [[tour guide]] can be a GPS tour guide, and the [[guidebook]] could be an [[audioguide]], [[podguide]] or [[I-Tours]], such as [[City audio guides]].  The [[biometric passport]] may also be included as travel technology in the broad sense.

[[XML|XML-based]] technologies have become increasingly important for the travel industry. XML can be used to support air reservation booking or to implement optional services and merchandising functions in the booking process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openaxisgroup.org/functions.html|title=Research Vacation Spots by category and city|author=|date=|website=www.openaxisgroup.org|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important application of XML is the establishing of direct connections between Airlines and Travel Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Michael, ''Value Creation in Travel Distribution'', 2010, {{ISBN|0557612462}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to create a generally accepted XML-standard, the Open Axis Group was founded.

=== Internet ===
The Internet has a powerful impact on hospitality and tourism. For many businesses and locations, the experience starts long before a traveler arrives--it begins with the first visit to the website, when a person sees photos of the location and gets a sense of what to expect. In the hospitality and tourism business, effective use of Internet technologies can improve revenue. Websites, blogs, online advertising, social media, online ordering and information repositories all help convince customers to choose a location or business.
Reservations Systems

Booking engines to allow easy access by consumers and travel professionals; the systems enable individuals to make reservations and compare prices. Many, like Expedia and Orbitz, are available through online interfaces. Booking engines cut costs for travel businesses by reducing call volume and give the traveler more control over their purchasing process.

=== Computer Systems ===
Because many tourism businesses are large and dispersed, they use computer systems to stay connected. Computer systems allow communication between branches and locations which makes it easier to streamline reservations and cross-company policies. They are also used internally to keep all of the staff on the same page and make it easier to access information that can improve the guest experience: guest preferences, housekeeping information and reservation details can all be kept on a single system.

=== Mobile Communication ===
Many travelers take some form of mobile communication device with them on the road, whether it is a tablet computer or a mobile phone. To keep customers advised of changes many tourism and hospitality businesses use mobile communication; they send delay notices, offer deals and sponsor location-based advertising. Depending on the type of business the communication might happen through emails, text messaging or GPS tagging, for example.

=== Technology in Travel Agency ===
The continuing evolution of information technology has had a considerable impact on the travel agency service industry. The widespread public use of the Internet has created a number of conditions that have been game-changers -- in both beneficial and detrimental ways -- to the modern travel agency. As a result, many travel agencies in the 21st century have had to make considerable adaptations to remain solvent and relevant.

The '''trivium''' is the lower division of the [[seven liberal arts]] and comprises [[grammar]], [[dialectic]], and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name="english-ety"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology |editor1=Onions, C.T. |year=1991 |page=944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trivium is implicit in ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' ("On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury") by [[Martianus Capella]], but the term was not used until the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], when it was coined in imitation of the earlier [[quadrivium]].&lt;ref&gt;Marrou, Henri-Irénée (1969). "Les arts libéraux dans l'Antiquité classique". pp. 6–27 in ''Arts libéraux et philosophie au Moyen Âge''. Paris: Vrin; Montréal: Institut d'études médiévales). pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Grammar, logic, and rhetoric were essential to a classical education, as explained in [[Plato]]'s dialogues. The three subjects together were denoted by the word ''trivium'' during the [[Middle Ages]], but the tradition of first learning those three subjects was established in [[Education in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]]. Contemporary iterations have taken various forms, including those found in certain British and American universities (some being part of the [[Classical education movement]]) and at the independent [[Oundle School]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.martinrobinson.net/writing.html. Each of these iterations was discussed in a conference at King's College London on the future of the liberal arts at schools and universities; see http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/conference.aspx and http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/2352/Oundle-School-Improving-Intellectual-Challenge&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the Latin word '''trivium''' means "the place where three roads meet" (tri + via); hence, the subjects of the trivium are the foundation for the [[quadrivium]], the upper division of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] education in the [[liberal arts]], which comprised [[arithmetic]] (number), [[geometry]] (number in space), [[music]] (number in time), and [[astronomy]] (number in space and time). Educationally, the trivium and the quadrivium imparted to the student the seven liberal arts of [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name="english-ety" /&gt;

== Description ==

'''[[Grammar]]''' teaches the mechanics of language to the student. This is the step where the student "comes to terms," defining the objects and information perceived by the five senses. Hence, the [[Law of Identity]]: ''a tree is a tree, and not a cat''.

'''[[Logic]]''' (also [[dialectic]]) is the "mechanics" of [[thought]] and of [[analysis]], the process of identifying [[Fallacy|fallacious arguments]] and statements and so systematically removing contradictions, thereby producing factual knowledge that can be trusted.

'''[[Rhetoric]]''' is the application of language in order to instruct and to persuade the listener and the reader. It is the knowledge (grammar) now understood (logic) and being transmitted outwards as wisdom (rhetoric).

[[Sister Miriam Joseph]], in ''The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric'' (2002), described the trivium as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Grammar is the art of inventing symbols and combining them to express thought; logic is the art of thinking; and rhetoric is the art of communicating thought from one mind to another, the adaptation of language to circumstance.

'''. . .'''

Grammar is concerned with the thing as-it-is-symbolized. Logic is concerned with the thing as-it-is-known. Rhetoric is concerned with the thing as-it-is-communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joseph |first=Sister Miriam |title=The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric |publisher=Paul Dry Books |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lg0a-RJcn4gC&amp;pg=PA3 |pages=3, 9 |chapter=1, The Liberal Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Ayto wrote in the ''Dictionary of Word Origins'' (1990) that study of the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) was requisite preparation for study of the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). For the medieval student, the trivium was the curricular beginning of the acquisition of the seven [[liberal arts]]; as such, it was the principal undergraduate course of study. The word ''[[wikt:trivial|trivial]]'' arose from the contrast between the simpler trivium and the more difficult quadrivium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayto |first=John |title=Dictionary of Word Origins |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1990 |page=542 |isbn=1-55970-214-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Túath''''' (plural ''túatha'') is the [[Old Irish]] term for the basic political and jurisdictional unit of Gaelic Ireland. ''Túath'' can refer to both a geographical territory as well the people who lived in that territory.&lt;ref name=RIA&gt;{{Cite book| first = | last = The Royal Irish Academy | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1990 | month = | title = Dictionary of the Irish Language | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | publisher = Greystone Press | location = Antrim, N.Ireland | isbn =0-901714-29-1 | url=http://www.dil.ie/42241| page = 612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Social structure==

In ancient Irish terms, a household was reckoned at about 30 people per dwelling. A ''[[trícha cét]]'' ("thirty hundreds"), was an area comprising 100 dwellings or, roughly, 3,000 people. A ''túath'' consisted of a number of allied ''trícha céta'', and therefore referred to no fewer than 6,000 people. Probably a more accurate number for a ''túath'' would be no fewer than 9,000 people.&lt;ref name=Dillon&gt;{{Cite book| first = Myles | last = Dillon | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1994 | month = | title = Early Irish Literature | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | publisher = Four Courts Press | location = Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland | isbn = 1-85182-177-5 | url = | nopp = true| page = xiv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ''túath'' was a self contained unit, with its own executive, assembly, courts system and defence force. ''Túatha'' were grouped together into [[confederations]] for mutual defence. There was a hierarchy of ''túatha'' statuses, depending on geographical position and connection to the ruling dynasties of the region.&lt;ref name=NKPI&gt;{{cite web|last=Ó Corráin|first=Donnchadh||title=Nationality and Kingship in Pre-Norman Ireland|url=https://celt.ucc.ie/nation_kingship.html|work=CELT|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization of ''túatha'' is covered to a great extent within the [[Brehon law]]s, Irish laws written down in the 7th century, also known as the ''Fénechas''.&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=Nerys t.|editor1-last=|editor1-first=|title= Cattle Lords and Clansmen: The Social Structure of Early Ireland|date=1994|publisher=University of Notre Dame Pess|location=|isbn= 978-0268161460|page=|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=JGIFDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT228&amp;lpg=PT228&amp;dq=gaelic+tuath+tricha+cet+organisation+medieval&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=334SDlStcJ&amp;sig=n-paEMSfvKL08slwCaviZ2nvQ3E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjphsyq78_dAhUiglwKHShTArc4ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=gaelic%20tuath%20tricha%20cet%20organisation%20medieval&amp;f=false|accessdate=|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old Irish political system was altered during and after the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Elizabethan conquest]], being gradually replaced by a system of [[barony (Ireland)|baronies]] and [[counties]] under the new colonial system. Due to a loss of knowledge, there has been some confusion regarding old territorial units in Ireland, mainly between ''trícha céta'' and ''túatha'', which in some cases seem to be overlapping units, and in others, different measurements altogether.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.historyireland.com/medieval-history-pre-1500/medieval-irish-political-and-economic-divisions/&lt;/ref&gt; The ''trícha céta'' were primarily for reckoning military units; specifically, the number of fighting forces a particular population could rally.&lt;ref name=Dillon/&gt; Some scholars equate the ''túath'' with the modern parish, whereas others equate it with the barony. This partly depends on how the territory was first incorporated into the county system. in cases where [[surrender and regrant]] was the method, the match between the old ''túath'' and the modern barony is reasonably equivalent. Whereas in cases like [[Ulster]], which involved large scale colonisation and confiscation of land, the shape of the original divisions is not always clear or recoverable.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.historyireland.com/medieval-history-pre-1500/medieval-irish-political-and-economic-divisions/&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Etymology==
	 
''Túath'' in Old Irish means both "the people", "country, territory", and "territory, petty kingdom, the political and jurisdictional unit of ancient Ireland".&lt;ref name=RIA/&gt; The word possibly derives from [[Proto-Celtic]] *''toutā'' ("tribe, tribal homeland"; cognate roots may be found in the Gaulish god name [[Toutatis]]), which is perhaps from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *''tewtéh₂'' ("tribesman, tribal citizen").{{cn|date=September 2018}} In [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] it is spelled ''tuath'', without the [[Acute accent|fada]] accent, and is usually used to refer to "rural districts" or "the country" (as in "the countryside"); however the historical meaning is still understood and employed, as well.&lt;ref name=ODonaill&gt;{{cite web|last=Ó Dónaill|first=Niall||title=Foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla|url=https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/Tuath
|work=teangleann.ie |date= 1977|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples==
*[[Cairbre Drom Cliabh]]
*[[Tir Fhiacrach Muaidhe]]
*[[Tir Olliol]]
*[[Corann]]
*[[Dartraighe]]
*[[Osraige]] - túath that later became the kingdom of the same name in the Christian era
*[[Dál Riata]] - the túath that became a confederation of túatha and eventually settled in [[Alba]], creating the modern nation of [[Scotland]]
*[[Clandonnell]], [[Glenconkeyne]], [[Killetra]], [[Melanagh]], [[Tarraghter]], and [[Tomlagh]], which all once formed the ancient territory of [[Loughinsholin]]
