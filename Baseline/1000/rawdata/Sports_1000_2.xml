The '''Amateur Sports Act of 1978''', signed by President [[Jimmy Carter]], established the [[United States Olympic Committee]] and provides for national governing bodies for each [[Olympic sports|Olympic sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=30133 |title= Jimmy Carter: "Amateur Sports Act of 1978 Statement on Signing S. 2727 Into Law. ," November 8, 1978 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act provides important legal protection for individual athletes.&lt;ref&gt;36 [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] § 220501&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Prior to the adoption of the Act in 1978, the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) represented the United States on international competition matters and regulated amateur sports generally. The AAU had adopted arbitrary rules which prohibited women from participating in running events and prohibited any runner who had raced in the same event as a runner with a shoe-company sponsorship. Congress adopted the Act in response to criticisms of the AAU, effectively removing that organization from any governance role.

The AAU now continues as a voluntary organization largely promoting youth sports. While it still has a major role in promoting track, it is now best known for sponsoring youth basketball competitions.

==Overview==
The Act charters the U.S. Olympic Committee, which in turn can charter a national governing body (NGB) for each sport, such as [[USA Swimming]], the [[United States Fencing Association]], the [[United States Ski Team]], [[USA Track &amp; Field]], [[USA Shooting]], or the [[U.S. Figure Skating]]. Each NGB in turn establishes the rules for selecting the United States Olympic Team and promotes amateur competition in that sport.

The Act requires that active athletes (defined as amateur athletes who have represented the United States in international amateur competition within the last ten years) must hold 20 percent of the voting power of any board or committee in an NGB. The Act also provides athletes with due process and appeal rights concerning eligibility disputes. 

The Act gives exclusive rights of usage of the words ''Olympic'' and ''[[Olympiad]]'' to the Olympic Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/36/220506-|title=36 U.S. Code § 220506 - Exclusive right to name, seals, emblems, and badges|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee used this act to sue other organizations which used this term "Olympics", such as the [[Gay Olympics]].&lt;ref name="mpbn.net"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mpbn.net/Home/tabid/36/ctl/ViewItem/mid/3478/ItemId/17541/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927082357/http://www.mpbn.net/Home/tabid/36/ctl/ViewItem/mid/3478/ItemId/17541/Default.aspx |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1998 Revision ==
The '''Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act''' is a [[United States]] law (codified at 36 U.S.C. Sec. 220501 et seq. of the [[United States Code]]) that charters and grants monopoly status to the [[United States Olympic Committee]], and specifies requirements for its member national [[sport governing body|governing bodies]] for individual [[sport]]s.  

The current version of the Act was sponsored by [[Ted Stevens]], then–[[United States Senator|Senator]] from [[Alaska]], and adopted in 1998.  It is a revision of the previous Amateur Sports Act of 1978 that reflects changes such as the fact that [[amateurism]] is no longer a requirement for competing in most international sports, expansion of the USOC's role to include the [[Paralympic Games]], increased athlete representation, and protection of the USOC against lawsuits involving athletes' right to participate in the [[Olympic Games]].

The United States Olympic Committee has used the law to force the "Gay Olympics" to change their name to the [[Gay Games]].&lt;ref name="mpbn.net"/&gt; The organization has threatened to use the law against the "Redneck Olympics," though it has given special dispensation to the [[Special Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/oxford-hills/story/1071387|title=Redneck Olympics faces lawsuit over name - Lewiston Sun Journal|date=9 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/oxford-hills/story/1071616|title=Redneck Olympics faces lawsuit over name - Lewiston Sun Journal|date=9 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gorra MLB.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|A typical baseball cap; this one is an [[Oakland Athletics]] cap.]]
A '''baseball cap''' is a type of soft [[cap]] with a rounded crown and a stiff peak projecting in front.

The front of the cap typically contains a design or a [[logo]] of sports team (namely a [[baseball]] team, or names of relevant companies, when used as a commercial marketing technique). The back of the cap may be "fitted" to the wearer's head size or it may have a [[plastic]], [[Hook and loop fastener|Velcro]], or [[Stretch fabric|elastic]] and [[zipper strip]], adjuster so that it can be quickly adjusted to fit different wearers. The baseball cap is a part of the traditional [[baseball uniform]] worn by players, with the brim pointing forward to shield the eyes from the sun.  Since the 1980s varieties of the cap have become a common fashion accessory, particularly in the [[United States]].

== History ==
[[File:Jackie Robinson, Brooklyn Dodgers, 1954.jpg|alt=Jackie Robinson Wearing A Brooklyn Dodgers Baseball Cap|thumb|upright|[[Jackie Robinson]] wearing a baseball cap]]
[[File:1888 Reds.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Cincinnati Reds]] players, 1888]]

In 1860, the [[Brooklyn Excelsiors]] wore the ancestor of the modern rounded-top baseball cap, which featured a long peak and a button on top, and by 1900, the "Brooklyn style" cap became popular.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2006-07-25-cap_x.htm|title=Baseball cap has endured generations as the all-American hat|accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s, latex rubber became the stiffening material inside the hat and the modern baseball cap was born. The peak, also known in certain areas as the "bill" or "brim", was designed to protect a player's eyes from the sun. Typically, the peak was much shorter in the earlier days of the baseball hat. Also, the hat has become more structured, versus the overall "floppy" cap of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The baseball cap was and still is an important means by which to identify a team. Often the logo, [[mascot]], or team's initial was placed on the cap. Usually, the cap was also fashioned in the official colors of a particular team.

The basic shape, including curved peak, is similar to some styles of 19th century sun bonnets.&lt;ref name=bonnet&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3660333.stm BBC – Happy 59th, baseball caps] 18 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Fitted baseball caps — those without an adjuster — are normally sewn in six sections, and may be topped with a matching fabric-covered [[button (clothing)|button]] (also called a squatchee) on the crown. Metal grommets or fabric eyelets are often sewn or attached near the top of each of the six sections of fabric to provide ventilation. In some cases, the rear sections of the crown are made of net-like mesh material for extra ventilation. The peak is typically stiffened by a sewn-in piece of [[paperboard]] or stiff plastic.

=== Variations ===
Baseball caps are made of many types of material and shaped in various styles for different purposes. Major and minor league baseball players wear classic-style caps made of [[wool]] (or, more recently, [[polyester]]) with their team's simple logo and colors; the logo is usually [[Embroidery|embroidered]] into the fabric. More recently there are brands that are using uncommon materials for snapback hats as for example wood brims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.capcollectors.com/feature/want-wooden-brim-strapback-weve-got-covered/|title=Want a wooden brim strapback? We've got you covered|last=Dabrowiecki|first=Jamie|date=2016-11-07|accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, baseball caps only came in standard hat sizes. Since the early 70's, they have also been available in a one-size-fits-all form, with an adjustment strap in the back. The style, commonly called snapback, has become increasingly popular as fashion accessories.&lt;ref name="mensfashion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mensfashionmagazine.com/mens-fashion-trend-snapback-caps|title=Mens Fashion Trend: Snapback Caps|accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in textiles have led to the "stretch-fit" hat, which uses Lycra or rubber to allow a hat to have a fitted style while still being "adjustable" within sizes.

[[File:Truckerhat.jpg|thumb|Trucker cap]]
The front may be soft, or may be stiffened by [[buckram]] to display a logo more clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://threadlogic.wordpress.com/2012/12/20/whats-the-difference-between-a-constructed-and-an-unconstructed-cap/|title=What's the difference between a constructed and an unconstructed cap?|last=Taxdahl|first=Jeff|date=2012-12-20|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version of the baseball cap is a plastic mesh cap with a foam front imprinted with a company logo. This style is sometimes called a [[Trucker hat|trucker cap]] or a "gimme cap" because it is given away for free as a promotional item.

Dad hats are unstructured caps with low profile, curved brim, and stripe on the back.

There are 3 major types of baseball caps:
# Snapback hat - (hat with a snap closure in the rear) with flat brim, high profile, adjustable.
# Adjustable hat - unstructured, low profile, curved brim, adjustable.
# Fitted hat - curved or flat brim, structured cap, high profile, not adjustable.

== Athletic use ==
[[File:Paul Hoover.jpg|thumb|right|In baseball, caps are worn backwards to accommodate for a [[Catcher#Equipment|face mask]] by some catchers and are worn under the mask of umpires.]]

Beginning with the 2014 season, [[MLB]] pitchers are permitted to wear a special reinforced cap to protect their heads from line drives.&lt;ref name="dailynews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.nydailynews.com/1.1594040|title=MLB approves protective cap for pitchers in time for 2014 season|accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletes in other sports wear caps with their team's logo and colors as "sideline" caps; both types are also sold as authentic team merchandise in retail stores. Other caps may simply have a maker's logo, such as [[Reebok]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Carhartt]]; these hats are often made of brushed [[cotton]]. Golfers tend to prefer the [[sports visor]] form which does not cover the head but keeps the sun out of their eyes; women also traditionally have worn visors casually but a trend in certain youth subcultures sees an increase in feminine use of full caps.

== Professional use ==

=== Military ===
[[File:US Navy 040527-N-4104L-001 Guided missile destroyer USS Russell (DDG 59), Commanding Officer, Cmdr. William Kearns III, communicates with his combat information center.jpg|thumb|left|Baseball caps worn by naval officers from the US, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.]]
Some armed forces use baseball caps as part of their uniforms, including the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Coast Guard]]. Used mostly with the utility uniform and coveralls, the baseball cap usually has a command logo on the front to denote command affiliation. Baseball caps of a particular color are worn to denote a specific function of a person or particular job.  For example, in the [[United States]] [[submarine]] force, red baseball caps are worn by drill monitors who facilitate and critique members of the boat's crew during drills. In the [[United States Army]], [[parachute rigger]]s wear red baseball caps and parachute instructors wear black baseball caps as part of their uniform. In various squadrons of the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Civil Air Patrol|civilian auxiliary]], squadron-distinctive baseball caps have been issued as headgear (or "cover") for the [[Battle Dress Uniform]], typically displaying squadron colors, squadron number, and/or squadron patch. Although the BDUs have their own cover, a [[patrol cap]] in [[M81 Woodland]], some squadrons have opted for more distinctive covers.

=== Police ===
[[File:Poliiseja ja rajavartijoita partioveneellä.jpg|thumb|right|[[Police of Finland|Finnish police]] wearing baseball caps, with [[Finnish Border Guard]] agents wearing side caps.]]
In many United States police forces, the baseball cap is worn as a more practical alternative to the traditional [[peaked cap]] or [[campaign hat]], the latter of which is generally used by [[Sheriffs in the United States|Sheriff's]] departments and [[State police (United States)|state police]] forces. This is more common on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], whereas in eastern states the traditional peaked cap is more prominent. A notable exception is the [[San Francisco Police Department]], where peaked caps are still worn regularly. In [[Slovenia]], policemen on motorcycles wear baseball caps as a part of their uniform, when they remove the helmet. The baseball cap is also commonly used by private security companies as a cheap, practical piece of uniform headgear.

There has been a marked trend in recent years among police forces and other uniformed bodies throughout the world to substitute cheap and comfortable baseball caps for peaked caps and other traditional headdresses. In Britain the baseball cap has the additional advantage of being unisex and suitable for wear by both male and female officers. During 2017 the Northamptonshire, Cheshire and Lancashire police forces adopted specially strengthened baseball caps known as "Bump Caps", to replace the helmets and bowler hats previously worn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/10/police-swap-helmets-caps-attract-transgender-officers/|title=Police swap helmets for caps to attract more transgender officers|first=Nicola|last=Harley|date=10 May 2017|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Police of Finland|Finnish Police]] uses a baseball cap ([http://www.poliisi.fi/finnish_police/police_uniforms ''seen on the image at this link'']), which is considered an official identification device and cannot be worn or even displayed by civilians, and has mostly replaced the traditional [[side cap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lansi-uusimaa.fi/artikkeli/8594-poliisilippista-on-laitonta-pitaa-esilla|title=Poliisilippistä on laitonta pitää esillä|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-5894937|title=Lakki on poliisille tärkeä turvallisuusvaruste|website=Yle Uutiset}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many armed police units around the world, notably [[SWAT]] in the United States and [[Metropolitan Police]]'s [[Specialist Firearms Command]] in the [[United Kingdom]], often wear baseball caps to shield their eyes from the sun where a full helmet would be excessive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1437">A '''Beer League''' (North American English) is a recreational league for adults to drink beer and compete in different sports. While the '''pub league''' (British English) is a form of [[sports league]] actually primarily funded by sponsorships from [[pub]]s, [[tavern]]s and [[bar (establishment)|bars]]. The bars often provide funding for a team's uniforms and equipment, and often a free drink for each player, in exchange for advertising the establishment on the uniform and usually [[naming rights]] to the team itself. Beer leagues can be of virtually any sport but are usually [[amateur sports|amateur]] and recreational in nature, not being tied to a larger competitive [[league system]], and contested by adults. The consumption of alcohol is often encouraged during the contest, as the actual competition is secondary. This is beneficial to the adults that compete in these beer league events because not only are they supporting a small business, but they are getting physical activity, all while being social. For example, with Beer League Hockey over 174,000 adults play. The special thing behind these leagues is that "It’s organized hockey in its purest form, unencumbered by money, skill, ambition, fans or advancement." &lt;ref&gt;Bonander, Ross. “Inside the World of Beer League Hockey.” DRAFT, 14 Dec. 2015,

'''''Chariots of Fire''''' is a 1981 British [[historical period drama|historical drama film]]. It tells the fact-based story of two athletes in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]: [[Eric Liddell]], a devout Scottish Christian who runs for the glory of God, and [[Harold Abrahams]], an English Jew who runs to overcome prejudice.

The film was conceived and produced by [[David Puttnam]], written by [[Colin Welland]], and directed by [[Hugh Hudson]]. [[Ben Cross]] and [[Ian Charleson]] starred as Abrahams and Liddell, alongside [[Nigel Havers]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Cheryl Campbell]], and [[Alice Krige]] in supporting roles.

It was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. It is ranked 19th in the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]]. The film is also notable for its memorable [[Chariots of Fire (album)|electronic theme tune]] by [[Vangelis]], who won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].

The film's title was inspired by the line, "Bring me my chariot of fire," from the [[William Blake]] poem adapted into the popular British hymn [[And did those feet in ancient time|"Jerusalem"]]; the hymn is heard at the end of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Dans, Peter E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=52GpN0Hzxd8C&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=colin+welland+jerusalem+%22chariots+of+fire%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3EdJTPqqKovSsAP97PFI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=colin%20welland%20jerusalem%20%22chariots%20of%20fire%22&amp;f=false ''Christians in the Movies: A Century of Saints and Sinners''.] Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2009. p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The original phrase "chariot(s) of fire" is from [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#2:11|2:11]] and [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#6:17|6:17]] in the Bible.

==Plot==
In 1919, [[Harold Abrahams]] ([[Ben Cross]]) enters the [[University of Cambridge]], where he experiences [[anti-Semitism]] from the staff, but enjoys participating in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] club. He becomes the first person to ever complete the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Trinity Great Court Run]], running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano, Sybil ([[Alice Krige]]).

[[Eric Liddell]] ([[Ian Charleson]]), born in China of Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie ([[Cheryl Campbell]]) disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running, but Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary.

When they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but [[Sam Mussabini]] ([[Ian Holm]]), a professional trainer whom he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters ([[John Gielgud]] and [[Lindsay Anderson]]), who allege it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to "play the tradesman" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for anti-Semitic and class-based prejudice.&lt;!--This is pretty well backed up by Gielgud's character's comments concerning "a Semite", "a different god" etc--&gt;

When Eric Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to eventually return to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour God, saying, "I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure."

The two athletes, after years of training and racing, are accepted to represent Great Britain in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams' Cambridge friends, Lord Andrew Lindsay ([[Nigel Havers]]), [[Aubrey Montague]] ([[Nicholas Farrell]]), and [[H. B. Stallard|Henry Stallard]] ([[Daniel Gerroll]]).

While boarding the boat to Paris for the Olympics, Liddell discovers the heats for his 100-metre race will be on a Sunday. He refuses to run the race, despite strong pressure from the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and the British Olympic committee, because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].

Hope appears when Liddell's teammate Lindsay, having already won a silver medal in the [[400 metres hurdles]], proposes to concede his place in the [[400 metres|400-metre race]] on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully agrees. His religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world.

Liddell delivers a sermon at the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] that Sunday, and quotes from [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Isaiah#Chapter 40|Isaiah 40]], ending with, "But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."

Abrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running.

Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, [[Jackson Scholz]], hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.

The British team returns home triumphant. As the film ends, onscreen text explains that Abrahams married Sybil, and became the elder statesman of British athletics. Liddell went on to missionary work in China. All of Scotland mourned his death in 1945 in Japanese-occupied China.

== Historical accuracy ==

=== Characters ===
The film depicts Abrahams as attending [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]] with three other Olympic athletes: [[H. B. Stallard|Henry Stallard]], [[Aubrey Montague]], and Lord Andrew Lindsay. Abrahams and Stallard were in fact students there and competed in the 1924 Olympics. Montague also competed in the Olympics as depicted, but he attended Oxford, not Cambridge.&lt;ref name=aubrey&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mo/evelyn-montague-1.html Aubrey Montague biography] at SportsReference.com&lt;/ref&gt; Aubrey Montague sent daily letters to his mother about his time at Oxford and the Olympics; these letters were the basis of Montague's narration in the film.

The character of Lindsay was based partially on [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], a significant figure in the history of British athletics. Although Burghley did attend Cambridge, he was not a contemporary of Harold Abrahams, as Abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and Burghley was at Cambridge from 1923 to 1927. One scene in the film depicts the Burghley-based "Lindsay" as practising hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle – this was something the wealthy Burghley did, although he used matchboxes instead of champagne glasses.&lt;ref name=rw /&gt; The fictional character of Lindsay was created when [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]], who was Britain's third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 Olympics, was not willing to be involved with the film.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 275, 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cross and Havers.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Harold Abrahams|Abrahams]] (left) and the [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Burghley]]-based Lindsay (right) attempt the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]].]]
Another scene in the film recreates the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]], in which the runners attempt to run around the perimeter of the [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], in 1927. In ''Chariots of Fire'', Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490027/Modern-day-hero-runs-away-Chariots-Fire-challenge.html "Modern-day hero runs away with Chariots of Fire challenge."] ''[[Daily Mail]]'' 27 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film, Eric Liddell is tripped up by a Frenchman in the 400-metre event of a Scotland–France international athletic meeting. He recovers, makes up a 20-metre deficit, and wins. This was based on fact; the actual race was the 440 yards at a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England, and Ireland at [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in England in July 1923. His achievement was remarkable as he had already won the 100- and 220-yard events that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Russell W.|title=God's Joyful Runner|publisher=Bridge Publishing, Inc|year=1987|page=54|isbn=0-88270-624-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also unmentioned with regard to Liddell is that it was he who introduced Abrahams to [[Sam Mussabini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0019/ |title=A Sporting Nation: Eric Liddell |publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is alluded to: In the film Abrahams first encounters Mussabini while he is watching Liddell race. The film, however, suggests that Abrahams himself sought Mussabini's assistance.

Abrahams and Liddell did race against each other once, but not quite as depicted in the film, which shows Liddell winning the final of the 100 yards against a shattered Abrahams at the 1923 AAA Championship at Stamford Bridge.  In fact, they raced only in a heat of the 220 yards, which Liddell won, five yards ahead of Abrahams, who did not progress to the final.  In the 100 yards, Abrahams was eliminated in the heats and never raced against Liddell, who won the finals of both races the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCasland|first=David|title=Pure Gold: A New Biography of the Olympic Champion Who Inspired Chariots of Fire|publisher=Discovery House|year=2001|isbn=1572931302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrahams' fiancée is misidentified as [[Sybil Gordon]], a soprano at the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].  In fact, in 1936, Abrahams married [[Sybil Evers]], who sang at the D'Oyly Carte, but they did not meet until 1934.&lt;ref name=ryan188&gt;Ryan (2012), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the film, Sybil is depicted as singing the role of Yum-Yum in ''[[The Mikado]]'', but neither Sybil Gordon nor Sybil Evers ever sang that role with D'Oyly Carte,&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/G/GordonSybil.htm Sybil Gordon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001194722/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas///whowaswho/G/GordonSybil.htm# |date=1 October 2009 }} at the ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'' website, 11 July 2002.

Liddell's sister was several years younger than she was portrayed in the film. Her disapproval of Liddell's track career was creative licence; she actually fully supported his sporting work. Jenny Liddell Somerville cooperated fully with the making of the film and has a brief cameo in the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] during Liddell's sermon.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Russell W. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2AGEFpEByIoC&amp;pg=PP4&amp;dq=eric+liddell+jenny&amp;num=100&amp;cd=4# A Lady – A Peacemaker]''. Boston: Branden Publishing Company, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the memorial service for Harold Abrahams, which opens the film, Lord Lindsay mentions that he and [[Aubrey Montague]] are the only members of the 1924 Olympic team still alive. However, Montague died in 1948, 30 years before Abrahams' death.

===1924 Olympics===
{{See also|Great Britain at the 1924 Summer Olympics}}

The film takes some liberties with the events at the 1924 Olympics, including the events surrounding Liddell's refusal to race on a Sunday. In the film, he doesn't learn that the 100-metre heat is to be held on the Christian Sabbath until he is boarding the boat to Paris. In fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance; Liddell did however face immense pressure to run on that Sunday and to compete in the 100 metres, getting called before a grilling by the British Olympic Committee, the Prince of Wales, and other [[grandee]]s,&lt;ref name=hudson/&gt; and his refusal to run made headlines around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Feg. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/361517352.html?dids=361517352:361517352&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+24%2C+1924&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=DID+YOU+KNOW+THAT--&amp;pqatl=google "DID YOU KNOW THAT ..."]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. 24 June 1924. Full headline reads, "Did You Know That Famous Scotch Sprinter Will Not Run in the Olympic 100 Metres Because The Trials Are Run on Sunday".&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to Paris, and Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which he had previously excelled. It is true, nonetheless, that Liddell's success in the Olympic 400m was largely unexpected.

The film depicts Lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400-metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400-metre race for Liddell. In fact [[David Burghley|Burghley]], on whom Lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he would go on to win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 1928 Olympics), and was not entered for the 400 metres.

The film reverses the order of Abrahams' 100m and 200m races at the Olympics. In reality, after winning the 100 metres race, Abrahams ran the [[200 metres]] but finished last, [[Jackson Scholz]] taking the gold medal. In the film, before his triumph in the 100m, Abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by Mussabini. And during the following scene in which Abrahams speaks with his friend Montague while receiving a massage from Mussabini, there is a French newspaper clipping showing Scholz and [[Charlie Paddock]] with a headline which states that the 200 metres was a triumph for the United States. In the same conversation, Abrahams laments getting "beaten out of sight" in the 200. The film thus has Abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.

Eric Liddell actually also ran in the 200m race, and finished third, behind Paddock and Scholz. This was the only time in reality that Liddell and Abrahams competed in the same race. While their meeting in the 1923 [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]] Championship in the film was fictitious, Liddell's record win in that race did spur Abrahams to train even harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |title=Recollections by Sir Arthur Marshall |publisher=Content.ericliddell.org |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215092135/http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |archivedate=15 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrahams also won a silver medal as an opening runner for the [[4 x 100 metres relay]] team, not shown in the film, and [[Aubrey Montague]] placed sixth in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], as depicted.&lt;ref name=aubrey /&gt;

====Personal inaccuracies at the Olympics====
In the film, the 100m bronze medallist is a character called "Tom Watson"; the real medallist was [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|Arthur Porritt]] of New Zealand, who refused permission for his name to be used in the film, allegedly out of modesty, and his wish was accepted by the film's producers, even though his permission was not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arthur Espie Porritt 1900–1994 |url=http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/arthur_espie_porritt.html |title=Reference to Porritt's modesty |publisher=Library.otago.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the brief back-story given for Watson, who is called up to the New Zealand team from the [[University of Oxford]], substantially matches Porritt's history. With the exception of Porritt, all the runners in the 100m final are identified correctly when they line up for inspection by the Prince of Wales.

Jackson Scholz is depicted as handing Liddell an inspirational Bible-quotation message before the 400 metres final: "It says in the Old Book, 'He that honors me, I will honor.' Good luck."&lt;ref&gt;The quoted passage is [[Books of Samuel|First Samuel]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Samuel#2:30|2:30]].&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the note was from members of the British team, and was handed to Liddell before the race by his attending masseur at the team's Paris hotel.&lt;ref name=reid&gt;Reid, Alasdair. "Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell". ''[[The Times]]''. 1 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; For dramatic purposes, screenwriter Welland asked Scholz if he could be depicted handing the note, and Scholz readily agreed, saying "Yes, great, as long as it makes me look good."&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Britain's 1924 Olympic Champs Live Again in 'Chariots of Fire'—and Run Away with the Oscars | work = [[People (American magazine)|People]] | date =10 May 1982 | volume = 17 | issue = 18 | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20082112,00.html | accessdate =22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screenwriter [[Colin Welland]], commissioned by Puttnam, did an enormous amount of research for his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning script. Among other things, he took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics, went to the National Film Archives for pictures and footage of the 1924 Olympics, and interviewed everyone involved who was still alive. Welland just missed Abrahams, who died 14 January 1978, but he did attend Abrahams' February 1978 memorial service, which inspired the present-day framing device of the film.&lt;ref name=rw /&gt; [[Aubrey Montague]]'s son saw Welland's newspaper ad and sent him copies of the letters his father had sent home – which gave Welland something to use as a narrative bridge in the film. Except for changes in the greetings of the letters from "Darling Mummy" to "Dear Mum" and the change from Oxford to Cambridge, all of the readings from Montague's letters are from the originals.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;

Welland's original script also featured, in addition to Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, a third protagonist, 1924 Olympic gold medallist [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]], who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. However, Lowe refused to have anything to do with the film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of Lord Andrew Lindsay.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 274–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Charleson]] himself wrote Eric Liddell's speech to the post-race workingmen's crowd at the Scotland v. Ireland races. Charleson, who had studied the Bible intensively in preparation for the role, told director Hugh Hudson that he didn't feel the portentous and sanctimonious scripted speech was either authentic or inspiring. Hudson and Welland allowed him to write words he personally found inspirational instead.&lt;ref&gt;Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0094702500 ''For Ian Charleson: A Tribute'']. London: Constable and Company, 1990. pp. 37–39. {{ISBN|0-09-470250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was slightly altered for the U.S. audience. A brief scene depicting a pre-Olympics [[cricket]] game between Abrahams, Liddell, Montague, and the rest of the British track team appears shortly after the beginning of the original film. For the American audience, this brief scene was deleted. In the U.S., to avoid the initial G rating, which had been strongly associated with children's films and might have hindered box office sales, a different scene was used – one depicting Abrahams and Montague arriving at a Cambridge railway station and encountering two [[World War I]] veterans who use an [[shit|obscenity]] – in order to be given a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG rating]].&lt;ref&gt;Puttnam interviewed in BBC Radio obituary of [[Jack Valenti]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Puttnam chose [[Hugh Hudson]], a multiple award-winning advertising and documentary filmmaker who had never helmed a feature film, to direct ''Chariots of Fire''. Hudson and Puttnam had known each other since the 1960s, when Puttnam was an advertising executive and Hudson was making films for ad agencies. In 1977, Hudson had also been [[second-unit]] director on the Puttnam-produced film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]''.&lt;ref name=round&gt;Round, Simon.

===Casting===
Director [[Hugh Hudson]] was determined to cast young, unknown actors in all the major roles of the film, and to back them up by using veterans like [[John Gielgud]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Ian Holm]] as their supporting cast. Hudson and producer [[David Puttnam]] did months of fruitless searching for the perfect actor to play Eric Liddell. They then saw Scottish stage actor [[Ian Charleson]] performing the role of Pierre in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s production of ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', and knew immediately they had found their man. Unbeknownst to them, Charleson had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would "fit like a kid glove".&lt;ref&gt;Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al. ''For Ian Charleson: A Tribute''. London: Constable and Company, 1990. pp. xix, 9, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Cross]], who plays Harold Abrahams, was discovered while playing Billy Flynn in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. In addition to having a natural pugnaciousness, he had the desired ability to sing and play the piano.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bencross.net/biography.html Ben Cross – Bio on Official site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022043111/http://www.bencross.net/biography.html |date=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross was thrilled to be cast, and said he was moved to tears by the film's script.&lt;ref name=wings&gt;''Wings on Their Heels: The Making of'' Chariots of Fire. (2005 video; featurette on 2005 DVD).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[20th Century Fox]], which put up half of the production budget in exchange for distribution rights outside of North America,&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 273–274.&lt;/ref&gt; insisted on having a couple of notable American names in the cast.&lt;ref name=reunion /&gt; Thus the small parts of the two American champion runners, Jackson Scholz and Charlie Paddock, were cast with recent headliners: [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]] had recently starred in ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' (also produced by Puttnam), and [[Dennis Christopher]] had recently starred, as a young bicycle racer, in the popular indie film ''[[Breaking Away]]''.&lt;ref name=wings /&gt;

All of the actors portraying runners underwent a gruelling three-month training intensive with renowned running coach Tom McNab. This training and isolation of the actors also created a strong bond and sense of camaraderie among them.&lt;ref name=wings /&gt;

=== Music ===
{{Main|Chariots of Fire (album)}}
[[File:Charleson on beach.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ian Charleson]] (foreground) and [[Ben Cross]] (left) running in the "[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]" music scene which bookends the film.]]
Although the film is a period piece, set in the 1920s, the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning original soundtrack composed by [[Vangelis]] uses a modern 1980s electronic sound, with a strong use of [[synthesizer]] and piano among other instruments. This was a bold and significant departure from earlier period films, which employed sweeping orchestral instrumentals. The [[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|title theme of the film]] has become iconic, and has been used in subsequent films and television shows during slow-motion segments.

Vangelis, a Greek-born electronic composer who moved to Paris in the late 1960s, had been living in London since 1974.&lt;ref name="dt"&gt;[http://vangeliscollector.com/telegraph112182.htm ''Daily Telegraph'' newspaper, 21 November 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; Director Hugh Hudson had collaborated with him on documentaries and commercials, and was also particularly impressed with his 1979 albums ''[[Opera Sauvage]]'' and ''[[China (Vangelis album)|China]]''.&lt;ref&gt;MacNab, Geoffrey. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/everyone-was-a-winner-when-british-talent-met-the-olympic-spirit-7640574.html "Everyone Was a Winner when British Talent Met the Olympic Spirit"]. ''[[The Independent]]''. 13 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; David Puttnam also greatly admired Vangelis's body of work, having originally selected his compositions for his previous film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbert, Julie. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gmc28iYGdMcC&amp;pg=PA426&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;dq=puttnam+vangelis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uqcm-_PfON&amp;sig=6frPR9-CwF_fxMfSjiVdlFwvKSI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MkCJT9HJOqqciALJ2bDaCw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=puttnam%20vangelis&amp;f=false ''Celluloid Symphonies: Texts and Contexts in Film Music History'']. University of California Press, 2011. p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson made the choice for Vangelis and for a modern score: "I knew we needed a piece which was anachronistic to the period to give it a feel of modernity. It was a risky idea but we went with it rather than have a period symphonic score."&lt;ref name=round /&gt; The soundtrack had a personal significance to Vangelis: After composing the iconic theme tune he told Puttnam, "My father is a runner, and this is an anthem to him."&lt;ref name=rw&gt;McLaughlin, John. [https://archive.is/20130104210643/http://www.runnersworld.com/article/printer/1,7124,s6-243-297--14187-0,00.html "In Chariots They Ran"]. ''[[Runner's World]]''. February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dt" /&gt;

Hudson originally wanted Vangelis's 1977 tune "L'Enfant",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kRS4pkrBqE "L'Enfant", from ''Opera Sauvage'']&lt;/ref&gt; from his ''Opera Sauvage'' album, to be the title theme of the film, and the beach running sequence was actually filmed with "L'Enfant" playing on loudspeakers for the runners to pace to. Vangelis finally convinced Hudson he could create a new and better piece for the film's main theme – and when he played the now-iconic "Chariots of Fire" theme for Hudson, it was agreed the new tune was unquestionably better.&lt;ref&gt;Vangelis in ''Chariots of Fire – The Reunion'' (2005 video; featurette on 2005 ''Chariots of Fire'' DVD)&lt;/ref&gt; The "L'Enfant" melody still made it into the film: When the athletes reach Paris and enter the stadium, a brass band marches through the field, and first plays a modified, acoustic performance of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsew.com/data/trivia.htm Trivia about Vangelis]&lt;/ref&gt; Vangelis's electronic "L'Enfant" track eventually was used prominently in the 1982 film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''.

Some pieces of Vangelis's music in the film did not end up on the film's soundtrack album. One of them is the background music to the race Eric Liddell runs in the Scottish highlands. This piece is a version of "Hymne", the original version of which appears on Vangelis's 1979 album, ''[[Opéra sauvage]]''. Various versions are also included on Vangelis's compilation albums ''[[Themes (Vangelis album)|Themes]]'', ''[[Portraits (So Long Ago, So Clear)|Portraits]]'', and ''[[Odyssey: The Definitive Collection]]'', though none of these include the version used in the film.

Five lively [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] tunes also appear in the soundtrack, and serve as jaunty period music which nicely counterpoints Vangelis's modern electronic score. These are: "He is an Englishman" from ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', "Three Little Maids from School Are We" from ''[[The Mikado]]'', "With Catlike Tread" from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', "The Soldiers of Our Queen" from ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', and "There Lived a King" from ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.

The film also incorporates a major traditional work: "[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]", sung by a British choir at the 1978 funeral of Harold Abrahams. The words, written by William Blake in 1804-8, were set to music by Parry in 1916 as a celebration of England. This hymn has been described as "England's unofficial national anthem",&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Blair. [http://www.answers.com/topic/sir-charles-hubert-hastings-parry ''Hubert Parry''.] [[AllMusic]] Guide, reprinted in Answers.com.&lt;/ref&gt; concludes the film and inspired its title.&lt;ref&gt;Manchel, Frank.

===Filming locations===
[[File:Chariots of Fire beach.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The beach running scene.]]
The beach scenes associated with the theme tune were filmed at West Sands, [[St Andrews]]. A plaque commemorating the filming can be found there today.

Describes Grannie Clark's Wynd, a public right-of-way over the 1st and the 18th of the Old Course, which was where the athletes were filmed running for the final titles shot.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the Cambridge scenes were actually filmed at Hugh Hudson's alma mater [[Eton College]], because Cambridge refused filming rights, fearing depictions of anti-Semitism. The Cambridge administration greatly regretted the decision after the film's enormous success.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;

[[Liverpool Town Hall]] was the setting for the scenes depicting the British Embassy in Paris.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt; The [[Colombes]] [[Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir|Olympic Stadium]] in Paris was represented by the [[The Oval (Wirral)|Oval Sports Centre]], [[Bebington]], Merseyside.&lt;ref name=where&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.wheredidtheyfilmthat.co.uk/film.php?film_id=60|title=Chariots of Fire|publisher=Where Did They Film That?|accessdate=18 February 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]] ferry terminal was used to represent the embarkation scenes set in [[Dover]].&lt;ref name=where /&gt; The railway station scenes were filmed in York, using locomotives from the [[National Railway Museum]].&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt; The scene depicting a performance of ''[[The Mikado]]'' was filmed in the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]] with members of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] who were on tour.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ian, ed.[https://books.google.com/books?id=pPj0nly_1OQC&amp;pg=PA576&amp;dq=%22savoy+theatre%22+%22chariots+of+fire%22&amp;num=100#v=onepage&amp;q=%22savoy%20theatre%22%20%22chariots%20of%20fire%22&amp;f=false ''The Complete Annotated Gilbert and Sullivan.''] Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 576.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival for the 2012 Olympics==
''Chariots of Fire'' became a recurring theme in promotions for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London. The film's theme tune was featured at the opening of the 2012 London New Years fireworks celebrating the Olympics,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1yLRK2M8YQ London Fireworks 2012 - New Year Live - BBC One]&lt;/ref&gt; and the film's iconic beach-running scene and theme tune were used in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'''s "Let's Make It Great, Britain" Olympic ads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3b-o63wd_M "Let's Make It Great, Britain"]&lt;/ref&gt; The runners who first tested the new [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] were spurred on by the ''Chariots of Fire'' theme tune,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17546859 "London 2012: Olympic Park Runners Finish Race"].

==Critical reception==
Since its release ''Chariots of Fire'' has received generally positive reviews from critics. {{as of|2017}} the film holds an 83% "Certified Fresh" rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 64 reviews, accompanied by the summary "Decidedly slower and less limber than the Olympic runners at the center of its story, the film nevertheless manages to make effectively stirring use of its spiritual and patriotic themes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chariots_of_fire]. Chariots of Fire (1981) - Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved 3 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

For its 2012 re-release, Kate Muir of ''[[The Times]]'' gave the film five stars, writing: "In a time when drug tests and synthetic fibres have replaced gumption and moral fibre, the tale of two runners competing against each other in the 1924 Olympics has a simple, undiminished power. From the opening scene of pale young men racing barefoot along the beach, full of hope and elation, backed by Vangelis's now famous anthem, the film is utterly compelling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/firstnightreviews/article3471497.ece]. "First Night Reviews: Chariots of Fire". Retrieved 3 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''disaster draft''' or '''contingency draft''' is a [[disaster recovery plan]] developed by professional sports leagues to rebuild a team's [[Schedule (workplace)|roster]] if many players are disabled or killed.

==Background==
{{see|List of accidents involving sports teams}}
Since the advent of modern mass transportation, there have been accidents that killed all or nearly all members of various sports teams. The [[Superga air disaster|1949 Torino Football Club]] had only [[Sauro Tomà|one survivor]] following a plane crash.  Two teams in the [[Canadian Football League]] lost players, returning from an all-star game, in the 1956 crash of [[Trans-Canada Air Lines Flight 810]].

Other air incidents since then have involved the [[Munich Air Disaster|1958 Manchester United football team]], [[Cal Poly football team plane crash|1960 Cal Poly football team]], [[Los Angeles Lakers#1959–1968: Move to Los Angeles and Celtics rivalry|1960 Minneapolis Lakers basketball team]] (no fatalities), [[Sabena Flight 548|1961 United States figure skating team]], [[Wichita State University football team plane crash|1970 Wichita State University football team]], [[Southern Airways Flight 932|1970 Marshall University football team]], [[Evansville basketball plane crash|1977 University of Evansville basketball team]], [[LOT Polish Airlines Flight 007|1980 United States boxing team]], [[1993 Zambia national football team air disaster|1993 Zambia national football team]], [[Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash|2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl ice hockey team]], and the [[LaMia Airlines Flight 2933|2016 Associação Chapecoense de Futebol team (Brasil)]].

As a result of these accidents, some professional sports leagues have developed [[disaster recovery plan]]s should such an incident befall one or more of their teams.

==Special procedures==
An affected team is expected to replace players using the [[minor leagues]] and by signing [[free agent]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"&gt;Eskenazi, Gerald. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/22/sports/baseball-the-plans-no-one-wants-to-use.html The Plans No One Wants to Use]." ''[[The New York Times]]'', 22 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Each league, however, has established procedures to decide whether an accident is of sufficient scale to activate contingency plans to help rebuild an affected team's roster, typically involving a special [[draft (sports)|draft]].

===Major League Baseball===
Major League Baseball's disaster plan is covered in Rule 29 of its [[Baseball business rules|official rules]].&lt;ref name="MLBRules"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The plan is triggered by an event causing the death, dismemberment, or permanent disability of at least five players from a team's active, disabled, or suspended roster during a season (including the playoffs), or at least six players during the off-season. Major League Baseball's commissioner will decide if the disabled club can continue play, in consultation with the MLB Players' Association and the club.

If the commissioner decides that the disabled club will continue to play, the commissioner may hold a Restocking Draft to allow the disabled club to select as many players as it lost, with the restriction that no more than one player can be selected from each team. Each of the non-disabled teams makes five players available for the draft taken from its active list (or if during the off-season, from its reserve list), composed of one pitcher, one catcher, one outfielder, one infielder, and one more player of any position, subject to adjustments by the commissioner based on the players lost by the disabled club. If a team has fewer than three eligible catchers, it does not have to provide a catcher to the draft. The non-disabled teams also are required to make available as many players with 60 or more days of Major League service time as of 31 August of the season preceding such draft as the number of such players lost by the disabled team.&lt;ref&gt;Major League Rules 29(b)(3)(A)(iii)'' Service. Subject to paragraph (b)(3)(A)(i) above, each Club that is not a Disabled Club shall include in its list of available players for a Restocking Draft at least as many players who have accrued no less than 60 days of Major League service time as of 31 August of the season preceding such Restocking Draft as the Disabled Club lost.''&lt;/ref&gt; Any player with no-trade rights with regards to the disabled team may not be made available unless the player waives the right.

If the commissioner decides that the disabled club cannot continue play, the commissioner will cancel the disabled club's season.

The commissioner and Players' Association can also agree upon other appropriate relief for a disabled club.

Major League Baseball's first [[expansion draft]]s of the early 1960s were based largely on the procedures first set out for the disaster draft.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===National Basketball Association===
The [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) contingency plan activates if five or more players on a team "die or are dismembered".&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="espn2001"&gt;Drehs, Wayne. "[http://espn.go.com/gen/s/2001/0328/1163463.html 'God forbid it should ever be needed']." [[ESPN.com]], 10 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A special "disaster draft" would be held in which other NBA teams could only protect five players,&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt;{{r|mizell20010923}} so that quality [[sixth man|sixth men]] would be available. No more than one player would be drafted from a team.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt;

===National Football League===
The [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s contingency plan provides for both a "near-disaster" and a "disaster".&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt; A "near-disaster" is defined as fewer than 15 players on a team being disabled, and a "disaster" is 15 or more.&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mizell20010923"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mizell|first=Hubert|title=Several pro teams have airline disaster plans in place|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/092301/Columns/Several_pro_teams_hav.shtml|accessdate=2010-09-14|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=23 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No special draft would be held for a "near-disaster"; the team would instead get preferential rights on any [[waivers (American football)|waivers]] until the end of the season.&lt;ref name="nydn2001"&gt;O'Keeffee, Michael. "[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2001/02/04/2001-02-04_just_plane_scary__oklahoma_s.html JUST PLANE SCARY Oklahoma State crash causes high anxiety] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506023513/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2001/02/04/2001-02-04_just_plane_scary__oklahoma_s.html |date=6 May 2009 }}." ''[[New York Daily News]]'', 4 February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|mizell20010923}} If a [[quarterback]] is among the fewer than 15 lost, the team would be able to draft up to two&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt; quarterbacks from all NFL teams with three available. Each team would be able to protect two, and the drafted quarterbacks would return to their original teams in the following season.&lt;ref name="nydn2001"/&gt;

For a "disaster", the [[NFL Commissioner|commissioner]] would determine whether to cancel the team's schedule for the season.&lt;ref name="nydn2001"/&gt; If the team's season is canceled, the team would have the first pick in the next regular [[NFL Draft|draft]];&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nydn2001"/&gt;{{r|mizell20010923}} a special draft would also be held in which each team would be able to protect 32 players. If not canceled, the "near-disaster" procedures would be used.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt;{{r|mizell20010923}}

===National Hockey League===
The [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) contingency plan activates if five or more players&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt;{{r|mizell20010923}} on a team "are killed or disabled".&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt; The team would select players from other NHL teams, paying with funds from a special insurance fund. Once its roster has one [[goaltender]] and 14 other players, a special draft involving the teams unaffected by the earlier selection could be held, with each team able to protect one goaltender and 10 other players.&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt;{{r|mizell20010923}}

===Major League Soccer===
Within its roster regulations, [[Major League Soccer]] has what it refers to as an "extreme hardship" provision, which can be used if "a team has less than 15 available players". However, this is a mechanism intended to be used on a "game-by-game basis", and any contingency plans that may exist for a disaster draft scenario are not public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/2011-mls-roster-rules |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430101816/http://www.mlssoccer.com/2011-mls-roster-rules |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kontinental Hockey League===
The [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) contingency plan was implemented after the [[Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash]] that killed the team's entire traveling roster. In the policy, each team makes three players eligible for the disaster draft, with the team that suffered the disaster being able to call up five players from its farm teams. There is no mention of a goaltender minimum for the draft, unlike the NFL disaster draft on quarterbacks or NHL disaster draft on goaltenders, or a mention of a team being able to surrender only one player, unlike other leagues, in the draft.&lt;ref&gt;National Post, [http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/09/08/khl-delays-games-but-season-will-go-on-for-lokomotiv/ "KHL delays games, but season will go on for Lokomotiv"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120605051818/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/09/08/khl-delays-games-but-season-will-go-on-for-lokomotiv/ |date=5 June 2012 }}, Peter Leonard, 8 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The afflicted team will have a spot in the draft lottery, thus guaranteeing that the team will pick at least as high as 4th overall in the next [[KHL Junior Draft]] and it will also be able to protect any player it wants for the next five entry drafts.

Fitness careers are distinguished from [[exercise science]] careers such as [[athletic training]], however the various types of fitness [[certification]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orangecountyfitness.org/trainers/certifications/ Accredited Organizations Offering Fitness Certifications].'', OrangeCountyFitness.org, 2010''&lt;/ref&gt;  have more and more in common: the, "distinctions...have become blurred, with more similarities than differences given the common background that all fitness professionals must possess."&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;Howley, Edward and Franks, B. Don (2007). ''Fitness Professional's Handbook'', p.ix. 5th Edition. {{ISBN|0-7360-6178-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitness professionals screen participants for [[exercise program]]s, evaluate various [[fitness component]]s, [[Medical prescription|prescribe]] exercise to improve these components, and may also help people with specific or chronic conditions.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; Fitness professionals help challenge an individual by increasing their performance, as compared to when a person would workout on their own. They also teach a person new workouts and how to improve their form, performance and help achieve goals.The key roles and duties of a fitness professional are to: motivate, assist clients and measure your heart rate and body fat levels. Trainers need to be patient, be well organized and have time management as well as interpersonal skills.“You are in a helping profession. Although you are not a social worker, psychologist or guidance counselor, neither are you simply a technician with advanced training in exercise science, biomechanics, program design and assessment methodology.”(Jim and Nettie Gavin)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/a119072712/aone|title=Gale - Enter Product Login|website=link.galegroup.com|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable fitness professionals or former fitness professionals include [[Richard Simmons]], [[Susan Powter]], [[John Sitaras]] and Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (''[[Arnold Schwarzenegger's Total Body Workout]]'').

Certified fitness professionals must maintain up-to-date on all certifications in order to instruct at particular health clubs and gyms. Often, fitness professionals will have some education in kinesiology, anatomy, and biomechanics to aid in their fitness career.

In Canada, Canadian Fitness Education Services (CFES) provides national fitness leadership program modules to take candidates through the steps in Aquafit, Group Fitness and/or Weight Training Instructor and Personal Trainer national certification.

[[Personal training]], [[Athletic training]], and [[physical therapy]] are all technically distinct specialties with different processes and requirements for certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Link|first=Alexandra|title=What's the Difference Between a Personal Trainer, Athletic Trainer and Physical Therapist?|url=http://www.acefitness.org/blog/2179/what-s-the-difference-between-a-personal-trainer|publisher=ACE Fitness|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States the main certifying agency for personal trainers is ACSM (the [[American College of Sports Medicine]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get Certified|url=http://certification.acsm.org/acsm-certified-personal-trainer|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the main certifying agency for athletic trainers is NATA (the [[National Athletic Trainers' Association]]).  Obtaining certification or licensure as a physical therapist requires that you attend and graduate from a masters or doctoral program in physical therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physical Therapist (PT) Education Overview|url=http://www.apta.org/PTEducation/Overview/|publisher=American Physical Therapy Association|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coaches ==
A coach can help amateur and professional athletes to be successful in a particular sport by teaching them the required skills needed. However, they can coach more than one sport to multiple people.Their role involves identifying an athletes strengths and weaknesses as well as their opponent.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/coaches-and-scouts.htm|title=Coaches and Scouts :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coaches also improve the physical condition of an athlete to help increase their full performance; improve form, techniques, skills and stamina. A coach must be ready to work long and irregular hours and these can include evenings, weekends and holidays. Typically, coaches are required to be 18 years old or older and have a Bachelor’s degree.&lt;ref name="bls.gov"/&gt;

== Salary and benefits ==
The median annual pay for a personal trainer in the US {{as of|2017|lc=y}} is $58,875.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.afpafitness.com/blog/personal-training-statistics-2017|title=A Career in Fitness: Personal Training Statistics &amp; Facts|author=Amy Occhipinti|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest paid college coach in 2017 was [[Nick Saban]] (University of Alabama) who earned $11.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebestschools.org/magazine/highest-paid-college-coaches/|title=The 25 Highest-Paid College Coaches of 2018 {{!}} The Best Schools|work=The Best Schools|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitness professionals receive benefits that can include healthcare, paid time off, a pension. There is also the opportunity to accelerate personal achievements and the option to work full-time or part-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/coaches-and-scouts.htm#tab-5|title=Coaches and Scouts :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, "employment of fitness trainers and instructors is projected to grow 8 percent from 2014 to 2024, about as fast as the average for all occupations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.afpafitness.com/blog/personal-training-statistics-2017|title=A Career in Fitness: Personal Training Statistics &amp; Facts|last=M.S.|first=Amy Occhipinti,|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualifications and experience required ==
Fitness professionals need to at least have a high school degree and in some fields, a bachelor’s degree in a related field. Additionally, they must learn CPR (cardiovascular resuscitation) which can be learnt American Red Cross offers classes that allow people to get a CPR class, First aid, and AED (Automated External Defibrillator) Certification. They also offer lifeguard training, swimming and water safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/search?cgid=instructor-training&amp;zip=aberdeen,%20md&amp;latitude=39.5095556&amp;longitude=-76.16411970000001&amp;zipcode=&amp;searchtype=class.|title=Instructor Certification &amp; Training Classes {{!}} Red Cross|website=Red Cross|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Football (Disorder) Act 2000''' is an [[Legislative act|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] enacted during the premiership of [[Tony Blair]]. It served as an amendment to the [[Football Spectators Act 1989]], and strengthened football banning orders (FBOs), a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] order imposed to those convicted of [[Association football|football]]-related offences. FBOs may be issued by courts in the United Kingdom, or following a complaint from a local police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/football-related-arrests-and-banning-orders-season-2014-to-2015/football-related-arrests-and-banning-orders-season-2014-to-2015|title=Football-related arrests and banning orders season 2014 to 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Gov.uk]]|publisher=|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was "rushed through Parliament" by then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] following violent clashes during [[UEFA Euro 2000]] in France.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/899120.stm|title=Hooligan bill comes into force|date=28 August 2000|newspaper=BBC|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows police in [[England and Wales]] to arrest those suspected of travelling abroad to participate in [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]] at international games, and to withhold their passports up to five days before an international fixture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Straw stated during an [[opposition day]] for his Bill that he was keen to enact the new laws in time for [[England national football team|England]]'s next international game against [[France national football team|France]] in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2000-07-13a.1181.0#g1181.2|title=Football (Disorder) Bill: 13 Jul 2000: House of Commons debates|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[TheyWorkForYou]]|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBOs, introduced by Football Spectators Act 1989, may ban an individual from football grounds in the United Kingdom for two to ten years, with provisions for individual cases. Supporters may also be barred from using [[public transport]] on matchdays, and from town centres and built-up, high-risk areas prior to and following matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inbrief.co.uk/football-law/football-banning-orders/|title=Football Banning Orders: How long do they last and how do they work?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=InBrief|language=en-GB|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1352703/Soccer-thugs-kick-off-for-the-most-violent-season-in-years.html|title=Soccer thugs kick off for 'the most violent season in years'|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=14 August 2000|website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/football_related_offences/|title=Football Related Offences and Football Banning Orders|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Crown Prosecution Service]]|access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2016}}
The '''grandfather rule''', in sports which usually only permit participants to play for the team of their country of birth, is an exception which gives participants the option to play for the country of any of their ancestors up to the grandparents.  Despite common name for the rule, grandparents of either sex can be invoked equally and it is sometimes referred to as the '''grandparent rule''' or the '''granny rule'''.

==Examples==
===Rugby league===
In [[rugby league]], the [[RLIF]] reiterated in 2008 that a player may represent a country if it is their country, or the country of their parents or any of their grandparents' birth.&lt;ref name="SS-31-07-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12196_3890777,00.html |title=World Cup rules spelled out|date=2008-07-31|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby union===
In [[rugby union]], regulation 8.1 of [[World Rugby]] stipulates that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/handbook/regulations/reg-8/reg-8 |title=Regulation 8: Eligibility to Play for National Representative Teams |work=World Rugby Regulations Relating to the Game |publisher=World Rugby |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a Player may only play for the [Team] (...) of the country with which the Player has a genuine, close, credible and established national link in which:
(a) he was born; or
(b) one parent or grandparent was born; or (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "grandparent" was at one time defined to include only blood grandparents, even for individuals who were legally adopted. However, World Rugby's current interpretation of its regulations accounts for cases in which a player, or his or her blood parent, was adopted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/handbook/regulations/reg-8/explanatory-guidelines |title=Regulation 8 Explanatory Guidelines |publisher=World Rugby |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Unless a Player has been adopted in accordance with the formal, legal requirements of the country concerned, the application of this criterion will be based on a Player’s blood parent. When a Player has been formally adopted in accordance with the applicable legal requirements of the country concerned, the birth place of the Player’s blood parent will no longer be relevant for the purposes of establishing the Player’s eligibility pursuant to Regulation 8.1(b). The relevant parent will be the parent that has formally and legally adopted the Player. In such circumstances, the relevant grandparents for the purposes of establishing a Player’s eligibility pursuant to Regulation 8.1(b) will be the Player’s adoptive rather than blood grandparents. It is not possible under Regulation 8.1(b) to assume eligibility via blood grandparents if a Player has been formally and legally adopted. In the event that one of the Player’s blood parents has been adopted, the relevant grandparents for the purpose of establishing that Player’s eligibility pursuant to Regulation 8.1(b) will be the Player’s blood parent’s adoptive parents. The term “parent” in the Regulations is limited to either a blood parent or a parent that has formally adopted a Player in accordance with the applicable legal requirements of the country concerned.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This exception is also incorporated directly into certain national regulations which govern the club-level teams from that country, as shown by regulation 9.14.2.1 of the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irishrugby.ie/downloads/IRFU_Regulations_.pdf |title=Regulation 9.14.2: Eligibility of Players |work=Regulations of the Irish Rugby Football Union |publisher=Irish Rugby Football Union |date=18 October 2016 |accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The following are the registered players who are eligible to play in the All Ireland League and Cup:
(i) A Player who qualifies to play for Ireland under World Rugby Regulations. (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Association football (soccer)===
In [[association football]], this rule can be found at the international level in the statutes of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), in articles 6 and 7.  The former states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/01/66/54/21/fifastatutes2012e.pdf|title=FIFA Statutes, July 2012 edition|accessdate=29 March 2013|publisher=''[[FIFA.com]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
if, in addition to having the relevant
nationality, he fulfils at least one of the following conditions:
a) He was born on the territory of the relevant Association;
b) His biological mother or biological father was born on the territory of
the relevant Association;
c) His grandmother or grandfather was born on the territory of the
relevant Association; (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that unlike World Rugby, which now substitutes adoptive parents for birth parents in determining national team eligibility, FIFA continues to use only biological relations for this purpose.

Among the most notable countries to have availed of the "granny rule" is the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], where the wide spread of the [[Irish diaspora]] left large numbers of potential recruits, especially in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/the-granny-rule-we-chart-who-has-come-on-board-who-shunned-us-and-the-undecided-31566207.html|title=The granny rule - We chart who has come on board, who shunned us and the undecided - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Charlton]] (manager 1986–96) was especially noted for recruiting English-born footballers who had Irish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-football-history/granny-rule.htm|title=Granny Rule in Football : Non Irish Born Footballers for Republic of Ireland : Shay Brennan : Irish Qualified : Jack Chalton|website=www.soccer-ireland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many German-born players who have Turkish ancestry have chosen to play for [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. This is partly due to Germany's strict rules on dual citizenship which forces German-Turks to choose whether to have German or Turkish citizenship by the age of 23 (in accordance with the German Citizenship Law of 1999).

===Basketball===
[[FIBA]], the international governing body for [[basketball]], requires nationality as a precondition for national team selection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-15: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but generally does not employ the grandparent rule. The method by which a player obtains citizenship is usually irrelevant to national team eligibility. The only use of the grandparent rule is to determine eligibility to represent the national team of a country's dependent territory, with two notable examples being those of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]], both [[United States|US]] [[insular area]]s with their own national federations, and whose native-born residents are US citizens by birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-26: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIBA, however, has a unique restriction on participation of naturalised players in its official competitions that has no parallel in association football or either rugby code. In FIBA competitions, a national team can have no more than one player on its roster who acquired that country's nationality by any means after reaching age 16. This restriction also applies to individuals who had the right to a second nationality at birth, but did not exercise that right until age 16 or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/internal-regulations/book3/players-and-officials.pdf |title=Article 3-21: National Status of Players |work=FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 3: Players and Officials |publisher=FIBA |date=17 June 2018 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is relevant to natives of [[Northern Ireland]], who have both [[British nationality law|British citizenship]] and [[Irish nationality law|the right to Irish citizenship]] by birth.

==Effects on teams==
A controversial rule, sports fans often debate whether this rule weakens smaller countries by creating the temptation for the best players to abandon their native country and declare elsewhere in the hopes of greater glory, or if on the contrary it helps smaller countries by giving them access to a broader range of players who wouldn't typically be considered to be picked for their country of birth.

A '''hand sack''' is any sack or similar object, typically made of [[cloth]] and filled with sand or a similar material, that is tossed on the back of the hand in a variety of games.

==Origin==
Hand sack originates from the lighter game, a game often played on college campuses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Lighter game founded in the greater Burlington Vermont area in the early 90's which spread to the music festival scene and on to college campuses nationwide.

The '''Hungarian System''', or '''Brodlowsky System''', is a type sporting tournaments setting.

During the winter of 1979, Ivan Brodlowsky, the creator of 2x Hunter Ball, defined what he called the Hungarian System of Classification, or simply the 'Brodlowsky System'. This kind of tournament organization made was a revolution in the Eastern Europe of the 80's, showing that socialists could create their own system of sport management.

In 1981, the [[Hungarian Federation of Basketball]] adopted his idea and organized the national championship following on his plan. The following year, the Ukrainian Pelota Basca tournament  used  Brodlowsky proposal, and so did the Bulgarians in their 1987 basketball competition.

Brodlowsky system survived until the end of that decade, there are still some examples of its use around the world, such as: - [[Irish Rugby Union]] (1998/99); - South African National Badminton Championship (1991 to 1995); - Mexican Casting Party (1989 to 2003); - Texas Amateur Pickleball Prize, and many more.

==The Rules==

- Traditional (League) Organisation: competitors play against all the others (usually twice - home and away);

- Number of finalists vary from 3 to 8, normally;

- Key-bouts:  These are chosen in order to promote competitors to the next stage.

The idea of 'key-bouts' is essential in this system. Brodlowsky says that teams have to qualify during the tournament, not after. Thus, it's important to determine the bouts in which competitors that occupy the first place in these moments will qualify themselves to the next stage.

==Examples==

'''Regular Tournament'''

''National Hungarian Championship – [[Basketball]] (1981)''

Number of competitors: 8
Following stage: semi-final round
Key-bouts: 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th.
 
This is the most classic example of this system, as we have four different qualified teams. After the second bout, Budapest Labda Club had two successes and occupied the first position. However, after the fourth bout, Basket Club TG was the first, and so this was another qualified.
After the sixth bout, Basket Club TG lost its first position to Grand Voyage, which couldn't maintain it until the last bout, when Magyaro Club got it. So, we have four different qualified teams: Budapest Labda Club, Basket Club TG, Grand Voyage and Magyaro Club, which played normal semi-finals after that.

'''Exception Tournament'''

''Mexican [[Casting (sport)|Casting]] Party – (2002)''

Number of competitors: 32
Following stage: quarter-final round
Key-bouts: 1st, 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, 30th, 31st, 32nd.
 
In this example, we can see that it's not necessary to choose symmetrically the key-bouts – it depends on the goals of the tournament. In this case, managers chose the three last bouts to be key-bouts, giving special attention to the consistent competitors.

The tournament had 5 qualified competitors. However, and incongruency happened: Lucas Fernandez, with only 9 victories, was qualified after the first bout; Juan de Castro, with 17 victories, after the sixth bout; but Johnny Cudanrot, in the third position and with 28 victories, couldn't classify himself.
Asked about what managers should do with this, Brodlowsky explained: “It's necessary to make an extra-match between Johnny Cudanrot and Lucas Fernandez. Why? Because Cudanrot has more winnings than half of the other qualified (actually, 3/5 of them). So, it's unfair not to give him an opportunity. In my opinion, as the creator of this system, an extra-game between Cudanrot and Fernandez is the best solution”.
Of course, Brodlowsky was heard, the game was made and a surprise happened: Fernandez won that match and all the others, turning into the champion of that season!

The course can be measured out either in meters or feet (10 m long by 5 m wide or 30&amp;nbsp;ft long by 15&amp;nbsp;ft wide)
The world record for the test was formerly held by Nick Wald (AUS) who completed the course in 10.28 seconds on 9 December 2011, until he was stripped of his title after an investigation conducted by WADA (World Anti Doping Agency) in late 2011 as he was found to have "an above average level of MDMA within his blood stream". WADA's investigation of Nick Wald led to the arrest of Dr. Henry Sestak and Dr. Dominic Mallia, for possessing and administering excessive amounts of MDMA into the bloodstream of numerous athletes.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

The world record is currently held by Miltiadis Papachatzakis (Greece). Miltiadis completed the course in 10.14 seconds on October 14 2016, in Athens, Greece. Miltiadis is believed to currently be on two strikes under the sports illicit drugs policy. Miltiadis was awarded a second strike in early 2016 for testing positive to an illicit substance during his visit to Colombia. 

Former world record holder Dan Kerr has declared that he will return to the sport when his current drug ban expires. WADA handed down Kerr a four-year ban from the sport in 2012, for administering and possessing high levels of diuretic tablets.

The '''International Association for Sports and Leisure Facilities''' (IAKS, from its original German name, ''Internationaler Arbeitskreis Sportstättenbau'') is a [[non-profit]] [[organization]] devoted to [[sports]] buildings and [[leisure]] centres.

The IAKS was founded in [[Cologne]] in 1965. It is the only [[non-profit organization]] concerned globally with the subject of [[sports]] facility development and has therefore been awarded the status of Recognized Organization by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).

The IAKS has about 1,000 members in a current 110 countries with seven sections worldwide. These are Germany, Japan, Latin America/Caribbean, Poland, Russia, Switzerland and Spain (status 2016).

==Activities==
The IAKS cooperates not only with the [[IOC]], but also with the
[[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC), [[SportAccord]], the International Council for Sports Science and Physical Education (ICSSPE) and the International Union of Architects ([[International Union of Architects|UIA]]), Sports and Leisure Programme. It also cultivates contacts with international sports federations and National Olympic Committees and has been included by the [[United Nations]] in its list of consultative NGOs of the UN Economic and Social Council ([[ECOSOC]]).

The task of the IAKS is to create a platform for the design, construction, equipping, modernization, funding and management of sports and leisure facilities as well as to participate in the establishment of standards and guidelines in Germany and Europe. The IAKS also publishes the magazine "sb", organizes conferences and exhibitions, and sponsors an international architecture prize for exemplary sports and leisure facilities, the IOC/IAKS Award, as well as the IPC/IAKS Award.

The members and partners of the IAKS are architects, engineers, enterprises and industrial associations, sports organizations, ministries of sport, education and construction, local government, and universities and other educational establishments.

One particular purpose of the IAKS is to encourage sport on a broad scale by gathering, evaluating, passing on and, if necessary, coordinating the experience, principles and research findings obtained from the design, construction, equipping and operation of sports and leisure facilities of all kinds. In doing so, it takes account of social factors in the widest sense, e.g. architecture, technology, sports science, economics and ecology. It also supports progress in this field with research and consultations.

==Congresses==
The IAKS has been holding the international IAKS Congress for the design, construction, modernization and management of sports and leisure facilities every two years since 1969. This Congress takes place in conjunction with the International Trade Fair for Amenity Areas, Sports and Pool Facilities (FSB) in Cologne, where global infrastructural trends, structural issues and practices are presented and discussded. The IAKS Congress enjoys the patronage of the IOC, IPC, GAISF and Germany's Federal [[Ministry of the Interior]].
Today the trade fair is called the International Trade Fair of Amenity Areas, Sports and Pool Facilities (FSB) and the IAKS Congress has developed into a permanent fixture.
&lt;ref name='IAKS 2007-10-31'&gt;{{cite journal|title=20th International IAKS Congress and International Fair FSB|journal=IAKS Congress papers|date=|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=20|issue=1|pages=|id= |url=http://www.iaks.info|format=|accessdate=2007-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 25th IAKS Congress for the Design, Construction, Modernization and Management of Sports and Leisure Facilities is taking place in Cologne/Germany from 7 to 10 November 2016. 
The IAKS Congress will be concerned with the latest experience, technologies, trends and prospects in sports and leisure infrastructure.

==Seminars and Events==

==IOC/IAKS Award and IPC/IAKS AWARD==
[[File:Burnaby eileen dailly pool ioc award plaque.jpg|thumb|right|A 2001 award for the Eileen Dailly Leisure Pool &amp; Fitness Centre in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada]]

[[The IOC/IAKS Award]] is the only international architecture award for sports and leisure facilities already in successful operation.

The Award has been conferred upon exemplary well designed and also functionally outstanding sports facilities every two years since 1987. The winning facilities can be newly erected or extended or modernized existing buildings. The sponsors of the competition are the IOC and the IAKS.
&lt;ref name='Impianti 2007-08-01'&gt;{{cite journal|title=I progetti vincitori dell`11° concorso internazionale 2007 indetto dal CIO/IAKS|journal=Impianti|date=|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=2/2007|pages=5–9|id= |url=http://www.assopiscine.it|format=|accessdate=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the IPC, the IAKS also awards the IPC/IAKS Award for sports facilities suitable for the disabled. The IPC/IAKS Award aims to promote the accessibility of sports facilities and all other buildings so that people with disabilities have the chance to practice or follow sport without restriction and without barriers.
&lt;ref name='Paralympian 2007-03-01'&gt;{{cite journal|title=IPC and IAKS Award Promotes Accessibility|journal=The Paralympian|date=|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=1/2007|pages=9|id= |url=http://www.paralympic.org|format=|accessdate=2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC, the IPC and the IAKS have also started the Architecture and Design Award for Students and Young Professionals on innovative designs and concepts for sports, leisure and recreational facilities.

This Award aims at young architects and designers currently studying architecture, landscape architecture, interior design and general design, and at young professionals in their first 2 years of professional practice. All participants must be under the age of 30 years.

==Publications==
The IAKS has been publishing the international magazine "sb" since 1967. It appears every two months and reports on current industry trends in international sports and leisure facility development. In addition, the IAKS has issued planning principles for the construction of different types of sports and leisure facilities.
sb is also concerned with the infrastructure of major sports events like the Olympic Games, world championships and European championships. Along with conventional sport facilities, sb also deals with special themes. Thus it is an important source of information for planners and practitioners from all areas of sports facility construction (municipalities, architects and engineers, universities, trade associations and industrial companies).
sb appears in two languages: English and German. The magazine is read mainly in Germany and the rest of Europe as well as in North, Central and South America, Africa and Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="78488">This is a '''list of the largest sports contracts'''. These figures include [[signing bonus|signing bonuses]] but exclude options, buyouts, and endorsement deals. This list does not reflect the highest annual salaries or career earnings, only the top 100 largest contracts and thus is limited to athletes in [[team sports]] and [[auto racing]]. Athletes in [[individual sport]]s, such as [[golf]], [[tennis]], and [[boxing]] are not employed by a team and usually earn money primarily through event winnings.  This list also does not necessarily reflect actual money collected by the athletes, since some contracts are eventually terminated (usually due to an athlete either retiring or invoking their opt-out clause). 

Entries in this list also require an individual citation of the contract, so a number of the highest salaried athletes (according to [[Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes|Forbes]]) are not included as their contract details have not been officially confirmed, including [[Lionel Messi]] and [[Lewis Hamilton]]. This also skews the list towards sports with salary caps where salaries are therefore public knowledge and easy to cite.

The contract figures referenced below are presented at face value, and does not reflect potential pre or post-tax treatments. For example, contracts with European sports teams are typically quoted on a post-tax basis.

==Notes==
* Contracts in the NFL are often not guaranteed, meaning that players who retire, or who are cut, do not receive their contracted salaries after their release from the team.
* [[NBA]] and [[NHL]] seasons span two calendar years.
* [[Michael Vick]] was suspended by the [[NFL]] in 2007.  The [[Atlanta Falcons]] were unsuccessful in a civil legal process to attempt to recoup $20 million of the $100 million in bonuses paid to Vick under terms of his contract extension.

==Association football==
{{Main|Association football}}
{{See also| National Football League|American Football League|Canadian Football League}}

[[Rugby football]] in Canada had its origins in the early 1860s, and over time, a unique code of football known as [[Canadian football]] developed. Both the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), the sport's top professional league, and [[Football Canada]], the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1882 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union (later reorganized as the Canadian Rugby Union). In 1909, the [[Grey Cup]] was donated by the then [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey]], to recognize the top amateur rugby football team in Canada. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the two senior leagues of the CRU (the [[Canadian Football League East Division|Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] and the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Interprovincial Football Union]]) gradually evolved from amateur to professional leagues, and found they had less and less in common with the amateur leagues, and consequently in 1956 formed a new umbrella organization, the Canadian Football Council. In 1958, the CFC left the CRU altogether and was renamed the Canadian Football League. By this time, teams from the amateur [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] had stopped challenging for the Grey Cup, and ever since, it has been exclusively awarded to CFL teams. Since 1965, [[CIS football|university teams]] have competed for the [[Vanier Cup]].&lt;ref name="Football Canada timeline"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.footballcanada.com/history_timeline.asp |title=Canadian Football Timelines (1860 – present) |accessdate=2006-12-23 |publisher=[[Football Canada]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228064050/http://www.footballcanada.com/history_timeline.asp |archivedate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian rules football==

{{Main|Australian rules football}}


Unlike other sports, Australian rules football has not resisted becoming a professional sport.

Although the sport began as amateur competition, the [[Australian Football League]] is an elite professional league and has been for nearly 80 years since its initial formation as the Victorian Football Association and then the Victorian Football League in 1897. The league changed its name to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) in 1990 amid the increasing professionalism and national expansion of the game.

The game was invented in the [[United States]] in the 1890s, in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. The first professional basketball leagues emerged in the 1920s in the [[United States]].  Prominent among these were the [[American Basketball League (1925-1955)|American Basketball League]], which formed in 1925, and the [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]], which was launched in 1937 by General Electric, Firestone and Goodyear as a way to improve their national profile.&lt;ref name="Steve Dimitry"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/6925/abl1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+07:07:30 "Steve Dimitry's Extinct Sports Leagues."]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946 the [[Basketball Association of America]] was founded by the owners of major sports arenas, particularly the [[Madison Square Garden]]. The BAA later merged with the NBL in 1949 to become the [[National Basketball Association]], the preeminent league in the world with 29 teams in the United States and one in Canada.  The [[American Basketball Association]], founded in 1967, subsequently joined the NBA in the 1976 [[ABA-NBA merger]].

The second-oldest professional basketball league in the world is the [[Philippine Basketball Association]]. The PBA was long considered to be the best league in [[Asia]], but the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] has grown tremendously in recent years. The league was born on April 9, 1975 at the [[Araneta Coliseum]], [[Cubao]], [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]].

Outside of the NBA, the top professional leagues in the world are those of [[FIBA Europe]]. According to the [[European national basketball league rankings|official league rankings]] produced by [[Euroleague Basketball (company)|Euroleague Basketball]], the body that conducts the continent-wide [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]], the top five national domestic leagues on the continent (from 1 to 5) are those [[Liga ACB]] (Spain), the [[Russian Professional Basketball League]], the [[Greek Basket League]], [[Lega Basket Serie A]] (Italy), and the [[Turkish Basketball League]].

European basketball is also characterized by its long established and well-developed transnational club competitions, most notably the Euroleague, which features top clubs from as many as 18 different domestic leagues. Two other continental club competitions, the [[ULEB Eurocup]] and [[EuroChallenge]], are also conducted annually. Europe also has transnational regional leagues, such as the [[Liga ABA]] (Adriatic League, formerly [[Yugoslavian Basketball League|Yugoslavian League]]), and [[Baltic Basketball League]] (originally limited to the Baltic states, now also including Kazakhstan).

==Cricket==
{{Main|History of English amateur cricket}}
{{See also|World Series Cricket|County cricket}}

Cricket at the highest level has developed into a fully professional international sport from which leading players can earn a large income. However professionalism has a long history in English cricket. The first professionals had appeared by the first half of the eighteenth century, when heavy gambling on the game encouraged wealthy patrons to draft the best players into their teams. They would often offer these players full-time employment as gardeners or gamekeepers on their estates. In the second half of the century, the famous Hambledon Club paid its players match fees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In the middle of the nineteenth century William Clarke's All-England Eleven was a highly successful all-professional venture which did much to popularise the game. The earliest overseas tours were also all-professional affairs.

In the early 21st century cricket is as lucrative as some other sports, and domestic cricketers typically earn several times the average salary in their country. Regular members of the [[England cricket team|English cricket team]] earn several hundred thousand [[pound sterling|pounds]] a year. However, the highest paid cricketers in the world are the star members of the [[Australia national cricket team|Australian cricket team]] or the [[India national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] who make most of their income from endorsement contracts.

==Ice hockey==
{{Main|Professional ice hockey}}
It is played with two teams, while 5 skaters and 1 goalie are allowed on the ice at a time. In NHL rules, the periods are 20 minutes long. There are three periods.

The 64-member governing body is the International Ice Hockey Federation, (IIHF). Ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924, and was in the 1920 Summer Olympics. North America's [[National Hockey League]] is the strongest professional ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic hockey.

Ice hockey sticks are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, graphite, or composites with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can curve either way as to help a left- or right-handed player gain an advantage.

There are early representations and reports of hockey-type games being played on ice in the Netherlands, and reports from Canada from the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the modern game was initially organized by students at McGill University, Montreal in 1875 and, by two years later, codified the first set of ice hockey rules and organized the first teams.

==Lacrosse==
{{Main|Lacrosse}}
Lacrosse is played mainly in [[North America]], however, countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have small lacrosse leagues. It has also expanded into both Europe and Asia, with the latter forming the Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union (APLU) in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://filacrosse.com/fil-welcomes-the-aplu/|title=Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union|accessdate=2016-02-26|publisher=[[Federation of International Lacrosse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States currently has two top-level professional lacrosse leagues in operation, [[Major League Lacrosse]] and the [[National Lacrosse League]].

==Rugby league==
{{See also|History of rugby league|Football}}

Rugby league came into existence due to the very issue of professionalism. Rugby football split into 'union' and 'league' over the issue of payment to player. Rugby league favoured payments and has thus been a professional sport since its [[1895–96 Northern Rugby Football Union season|beginnings in 1895]], when 22 clubs based in northern England [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|split]] from the more amateur-minded [[Rugby Football Union]]. The officially amateur RFU had previously brought charges of professionalism against some clubs for their use of "broken time" payments to compensate players for missing work due to matches or injuries received whilst playing. On August 29, 1895 in a meeting at the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield]], the clubs decided to break away and form the Northern Rugby Union, which later would become the [[Rugby Football League]]. The rules of rugby league were gradually changed so that now it and rugby union are distinctly different games, however rugby union has since turned professional as well. On 17 December 1967 the first professional Sunday matches of rugby league were played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Rugby union ==

{{See also|History of rugby union|Football}}

Rugby union continued with its amateur ideals past the schism between union and league and throughout much of the 20th century. This position changed in 1995. The threat of big payments from professional rugby league clubs in countries where rugby league had a significant following was becoming too great. A committee conclusion decided that the only way to end this threat, the hypocrisy of [[Shamateurism]] and keep control of rugby union was to make the sport professional. On August 26, 1995 the International Rugby Board declared rugby union an "open" game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game.

The PBR is different from the classic rodeo as it consists of only bull riding. It was founded in 1992 because a group of bull riders decided that their sport should be separated from the classic rodeo and could, as it was easily the most popular event. Riders and bulls are judged on a 50-point scale. Riders are only given a score if they stay on for the mandatory 8 seconds, while bull scores are given regardless of what the rider does.

The goal of the '''MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference''' is to provide a forum to discuss the increasing role of analytics in the sports industry. Founded in 2006, the conference is co-chaired by [[Daryl Morey]], General Manager &amp; Managing Director of Basketball Operations for the [[Houston Rockets]], and Jessica Gelman, CEO of KAGR ([[Kraft Analytics Group]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kagr.com/about/|title=About Kagr - Jessica Gelman - Partners - KAGR - Advanced analytics and Strategic Marketing|website=kagr.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who oversee [[MIT Sloan School of Management|MIT Sloan]] students (from the EMS Club){{#tag:ref|The MIT Sloan EMS Club is a student-run club that aims to help MIT Sloan students learn about its target industries as well as extend the MIT Sloan brand as a leading business school in the entertainment, media, and sports worlds.|group="nb"}} in the planning and operating of the yearly conference. It is the largest student-run conference in the world, attracting students from over 170 different schools and representatives from over 80 professional sports teams in the [[MLB]], [[NBA]], [[NFL]], [[NHL]], [[Major League Soccer|MLS]], and [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fasulo |first=Nick |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2011/3/4/2030635/mit-sloan-sports-analytics-conference-malcolm-gladwell |title=MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, Day 1: Explaining The 10,000 Hour Rule, And More |publisher=SBNation.com |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference is held in the [[Boston]] area and while its location has moved from the [[Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT campus]] to higher capacity convention centers, it has always occurred during February or March. One of the largest student run conferences in the country, it has been sold out every year and has become the premier venue for [[sports analytics]] discussion. [[ESPN]] has been the presenting sponsor since 2010 and the conference has garnered national attention through media outlets such as ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', [[NBC Sports]], [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], ESPN's ''[[Pardon the Interruption]]'', and ''[[Forbes]]''. ESPN columnist [[Bill Simmons]] has nicknamed the conference Dorkapalooza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=4011524 |title=Simmons: Don't deny NBA stat geeks the truth |publisher=EPSN.com |date=2011-04-04 |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference was ranked #3 by [[Fast Company (magazine)|''Fast Company'' magazine]] in its 2012 ranking of the world's most innovative sports companies behind only the NFL and [[Major League Baseball Advanced Media|MLB Advanced Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2012/industry/sports |title=The World's 50 Most Innovative Companies in Sports 2012 |publisher=Fast Company |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2017 Conference==
On March 3-4 at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference (SSAC) entered its second decade of existence, and did so together with 3,500 attendees united by their passion for sports, statistical analysis, and business. After a record 39 panels, 39 Competitive Advantage talks, 7 interactive events, and the conference’s first ever esports exhibition, SSAC lived up to this year’s conference theme: Elevate the Game.

Conference Co-Chair Jessica Gelman kicked things off Friday morning, moderating the Titans of the Sports Industry panel featuring Michael Rubin, Jared Smith, Michael Spillane, and Casey Wasserman. The discussants set the bar high with a candid conversation about taking a business global and the role of analytics in building a successful company. In the afternoon 275K people tuned in through Facebook Live to watch 538’s Nate Silver interview NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.

Another Friday highlight was the all-star lineup of executives Billy Beane, Sam Hinkie, SSAC Co-Chair Daryl Morey, and Farhan Zaidi taking the stage to discuss the role of cognitive bias in decision making. That wasn’t Morey’s only strong performance of the day. He was one of the last people standing against Chess Grandmaster Susan Polgar, who knocked out 10 opponents in under an hour in SSAC’s first ever chess simulation.

On Day 2, Nate Silver sat down with Mark Cuban, one of the biggest personalities in the NBA, to discuss everything from sports to his political aspirations. Their back-and-forth entertained more than the capacity crowd in the Hynes Center, reaching 330K people on Facebook Live.

Other popular panels featured looks at the role of sustainability in sports, disruptors in the sports industry—featuring Bob Bowman, Bobby Kotick, Jonathan Kraft, and Jason Robins—engaging the modern fan, and a discussion of negotiating strategies with Warren Legarie, Daryl Morey, Bob Myers, and Deepak Malhotra.  During the Getting the Scoop panel, Adam Schefter managed to give a live demonstration, breaking some NFL news mid-panel.

Competitive Advantage talks by John D’Angelo, [[Larry Coon]], Meeta Singh, and Eric Joyce and Cam Lawrence on, respectively, preventing Tommy John surgery, understanding the new NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement, the impact of sleep on sports performance, and analytics’ role in NHL draft strategy generated significant interest. Over two days leaders from across the sports landscape provided attendees insight on some of the most critical issues in the industry today. Attendees were also treated to 9 workshops on topics ranging from coding in SQL to data scraping and optimization.

The Research Papers Competition presented by Wasserman remains a key source of innovation where groundbreaking researchers from around the world redefine sports analytics. Top prize went to John Drazan, Amy Loya, Benjamin Horne, and Ron Eglash for their work on using sports analytics to stimulate youth interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

The entrepreneurial spirit was alive and well at the Startup Competition &amp; Trade Show, with 24 companies aiming to disrupt the sports industry.  In addition, 2017 marked the introduction of the Accelerator Competition presented by Reebok. The judges were so impressed with the participants that both Nix Biotech and Open Gym walked away with the top prize and the opportunity to grow their businesses with Reebok’s support. Additional events—a dedicated esports room that hosted a ProAm tournament, drone racing, and a chess simulation with Polgar—helped make this the most interactive SSAC yet.

Finally, it wouldn’t be SSAC without a nod to the individuals who have used analytics to transform the sports world. Oakland A’s Executive Vice President Billy Beane, whose Moneyball approach to baseball has made an impact far beyond the diamond, took home the Alpha Award for Lifetime Achievement. The 2016 World Champion Chicago Cubs were named Best Analytics Organization. Bob Myers and the Golden State Warriors took the Best Transaction prize for bringing [[Kevin Durant]] to the Bay Area just three months before Durant added an NBA Championship and Finals MVP to his resume. Finally, Q30 and its anti-concussion Q-Collar earned an Alpha Award for Best Innovation.

The excitement was hardly limited to the people in the Hynes Convention Center. SSAC’s social media footprint was massive throughout the two days. The conference’s live streams reached over 650K people. SSAC’s Snapchat filter was viewed by over 22.8K accounts. The conference made its mark on Twitter, with #SSAC17 trending No. 1 nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sloansportsconference.com/archive/annual/2017-annual-recap/|title=2017 Annual Recap - MIT Sloan Analytics Conference|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While league luminaries, front-office decision-makers and industry leaders spoke about how they are employing analytics in decision-making on the panel stage, the next major advances in sports analytics were shared through research papers, Competitive Advantage presentations, Evolution of Sport talks, Tradeshow competition and the First Pitch MBA case competition. Second Spectrum Inc. won best research paper for the second time in the conference's history based on defining basketball’s rebounding statistic into three separate quantifiable skills.&lt;ref name="mitsloan.mit.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secondspectrum.com/|title=Second Spectrum|website=www.secondspectrum.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Carr won the EoS competition for his work on "Broadcasting Live Sports Automatically Using Robotic Cameras." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/10476432/mit-sloan-sports-analytics-papers-redefine-analytics-espn-magazine|title=ESPN: Summaries of Sloan research papers|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swingbyte, Inc. was judged to be the top presenter at the startup trade show, marketing a product that gives golfers real-time swing analysis on their phones. The team from the University of Wisconsin School of Business captured Aramark’s First Pitch MBA case competition on the analytics of the fan experience, and best transaction was awarded to the three-team trade between the Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Chicago White Sox. New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson was given the Lifetime Achievement Alpha Award for his career in baseball, including his role on the forefront of applying sabermetrics in the front office while GM of the Athletics and mentor to Billy Beane and his subsequent tenures as GM of the San Diego Padres and New York Mets. The conference continued to be a hotbed for recruiting and hiring within the industry. The introduction of a resume review session, "Career Conversations" between students and business leaders, and a panel on breaking into the sports world highlighted the opportunities and interest of the next generation of sports professionals who will carry forward the revolution.

===2015===
[[File:2015 Conference.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|2015 Conference]]
“This year it has been incredible to see the growth of sports analytics both in breadth and depth” conference chair Jessica Gelman exclaimed to kick off the 2015 Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. Continuing as the preeminent sports industry conference, SSAC15 also grew in breadth and depth as it pushed out the limits of data analytics and sport, delivering two days of groundbreaking innovation and discussion. The conference welcomed three commissioners: NBA Commissioner [[Adam Silver]], MLB Commissioner [[Rob Manfred]], and MLS Commissioner [[Don Garber]], once again highlighting the growing acceptance of sports analytics.

The much anticipated 2015 conference brought together leading sports innovators, influencers and technologies at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center February 27–28. The ninth annual conference drew more than 3,200 attendees (a 50% growth from 2014), representing over 100 professional teams and 300 sports industry organizations. Featuring 29 panels and 15 Competitive Advantage presentations, the conference delved into themes for every fan and industry professional with topics ranging from early analytic adopters, player contract negotiations, entrepreneurship, sports betting, the future of sports media, the value of digital media for fan engagement, adapting and expanding the game for the modern fan and the future of sports analytics. Attendees enjoyed insights from [[Shane Battier]] and [[Sue Bird]] equating data analytics to another tool in their arsenal similar to a jump shot or strength training; Commissioner Silver, [[Jonathan Kraft]] and Marie Donoghue shared their unique vision on media rights and the ever-changing landscape of fan consumption; and SSAC veterans Brian Burke, [[Nate Silver]], RC Buford and [[Scott Pioli]] got into heated discussions about how much to attribute  the  improvement of sports to analytics and how analytics will contribute to the future of sport over the next 5–10 years  Other conference speakers included industry veterans such as [[Wyc Grousbeck]], [[Sean Payton]], [[Oliver Luck]], [[Bob Myers]], [[Jackie MacMullan]] and many more. 
[[File:FutureofSportsMedia-FULL.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|2015 Conference]]
The SSAC research paper competition continued to remain at the forefront of sports analytics research and showcased some of the most exciting and cutting-edge developments in the theory and practice of sports analytics. Several teams of researchers and academics presented their findings to a panel of expert judges, who produced a split outcome, with two teams sharing the first-place prize. The first team, a group of statisticians at Harvard University, introduced “Counterpoints,” a framework for quantifying basketball players’ defensive contributions based on their ability to suppress and alter shots. The second team, a duo of analysts at Baseball Info Solutions, developed a method to quantify and more finely assign credit for pitch framing to catchers, batters, pitchers and umpires.

The conference featured two inaugural and fully interactive events: the Data Science and Visualization Zone presented by Booz Allen Hamilton and the SSAC Hackathon presented by ESPN’s Stats &amp; Info Group. The Data Science and Visualization Zone included groundbreaking technological demos, conversation areas, and presentations. The SSAC Hackathon featured students from top universities competing for a coveted internship with ESPN as well as professionals from industry leading companies. Participants analyzed and presented innovative ways to visualize NFL data in order to improve the fan and media experience.

The conference continued to be a leading recruiting and hiring tool for the sports industry. Lines were out the door early Saturday morning for “Career Conversations” as students met 1-1 with sports business leaders to learn about roles in the sports industry, followed by a panel on breaking into the coveted industry.

SSAC 2015 built on the successes of previous years’ conferences and continued to pioneer the field of sports analytics. With its original content, invited speakers and showcase of advanced technological innovations, SSAC 2015 once again set the industry conference standard in sports analytics.

==2016==
“We had 175 folks at that first conference…this year we have more speakers than we had attendees [at that first conference]” said conference chair Jessica Gelman in her opening remarks of the 2016 Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. As the conference celebrated its 10th year—-its #DecadeOfData—-Gelman and fellow co-chair Daryl Morey reflected on the roots of the preeminent sports industry conference—fondly referred to as the “Super Bowl of Analytics” and “Dork-a-Palooza”—and the massive growth of both the conference and the sports analytics industry as a whole in those ten short years. 

The much anticipated 10th anniversary conference brought together leaders from across the sports community—from teams to players, innovators and influencers—at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center on March 11-12. The 2016 conference, presented by ESPN, grew to new heights in both size and content with nearly 4,000 attendees (20% growth from 2015), over 1,500 students from over 320 academic institutions, 130 teams and leagues and 300 industries attending more content than ever before. The conference featured 6 more panels, double the number of Competitive Advantage talks, the introduction of workshops, and the first ever Facebook live stream of a panel, which reached over 312,000 viewers. Attendees contributed record-breaking conference interactions over the course of the weekend, with over 15,000 posts utilizing the hashtag #SSAC16, over 60 million impressions and over 13,000 accounts viewing the conference snapchat filter.
The conference opened with a reference to its earliest inspiration: a Moneyball reunion panel with Bill James, Michael Lewis and Paul DePodesta. Throughout the rest of the weekend, industry leaders covered topics ranging from new scientific developments in panels on sports science and wearable technology, to sports business panels on modern sports finance and the future of the front office, to one-on-ones with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Nate Silver. Attendees were treated to insights from Jonathan Kraft, Michael Rubin and Jared Smith on the ways sports organizations are connecting in a more personalized manner and generating targeted content faster to enhance the fan experience. Jackie MacMullan closed the conference by moderating a high-energy discussion on player retention, building a winner and the overall future of the front office between Nick Caserio, Jeff Luhnow, Bob Myers and Daryl Morey. Other conference speakers included Stan Kroenke, Sam Kennedy, Wyc Grousbeck, Shane Battier, Steve Pagliuca, Vivek Ranadive, Oliver Luck, Michelle McKenna-Doyle, Sue Bird and many more. 

While league and industry leaders spoke about the current applications of analytics in the panel rooms, the newest advances in sports analytics thinking and technology were showcased in the research papers competition, startup competition, the data visualization room and the Hack-a-thon. A team of Australian researchers won the prestigious Research Paper competition presented by Ticketmaster for their work using Hawkeye technology to discover player patterns in tennis, and, in turn, predict the probability of a given player winning a point. 

The conference continued to be a leading resource for developing new talent in the world of sports with the Hackathon, presented by ESPN, the MBA case competition presented by Ticketmaster—which was won by a team from McGill University—and career conversations providing opportunities for the 1,000+ students in attendance to network and demonstrate their industry skills. 

The weekend concluded with the presentation of the Alpha Awards, as the conference recognized achievement across the entire landscape of sports analytics, as well as special recognition to the ten devotees who been a part of every conference thus far. Through the increasing number of dedicated attendees and the growth and development of the sports analytics field, SSAC 2016 was able to build on the success of previous conferences and again set the industry conference standard in sports analytics.

[[File:Oscar Pistorius 2 Daegu 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Oscar Pistorius]] running during the [[2011 World Championships in Athletics]] in [[Daegu]], South Korea]]

The '''mechanics of the running blades''' used by South African Paralympic runner [[Oscar Pistorius]] depend on [[Flex-Foot Cheetah|special]] [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]] [[prosthesis|prosthetics]].  Pistorius has double below-the-knee [[amputations]] and competes in both non-disabled and [[T44 (classification)|T44]] amputee [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] events. Pistorius's eligibility to run in international non-disabled events is sanctioned by the International Association of Athletics Federations ([[IAAF]]).

Pistorius began running in 2004 after a rugby knee injury which led to rehabilitation at the [[University of Pretoria]]'s High Performance Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Mike Moon |title=Blade Runner: Oscar Pistorius is forcing the world to rethink what it means to be disabled |url=http://www.rdasia.com/article/2730/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AH3zjOKd?url=http://www.rdasia.com/article/2730/ |archivedate=29 August 2012 |magazine=[[Reader's Digest|Reader's Digest Asia]] |year=2012 |accessdate=29 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with coach Ampie Louw.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/mysport/2312850/My-Sport-Oscar-Pistorius.html|author=Davies, Gareth A. (interviewer)|date=23 May 2007|title=My sport: Oscar Pistorius|publisher=The Daily Telegraph (London)|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first racing blades were fitted by South African [[prosthetist]] Francois Vanderwatt. Because he was unable to find suitable running blades in [[Pretoria]], Vanderwatt ordered some to be made by a local engineer at Hanger Orthopedic Group. These quickly broke, and Vanderwatt referred Pistorius to American prosthetist and Paralympic sprinter [[Brian Frasure]] to be fitted for carbon-fibre blades by [[Iceland]]ic company [[Össur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Felix Gillette |title=Racing tall: A Paralympian stands accused of getting an illegal leg up |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/left_field/2004/11/racing_tall.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AcuKt59K?url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/left_field/2004/11/racing_tall.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=10 November 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pistorius's participation in non-disabled international sprinting competitions in 2007 raised questions about his use of running blades, and the IAAF amended their rules to ban the use of "any technical device that incorporates springs, wheels or any other element that provides a user with an advantage over another athlete not using such a device." After initial studies, Pistorius was ruled ineligible for competitions under these IAAF rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/2288489/IAAF-call-time-on-Oscar-Pistorius-dream.html|author=Knight, Tom|date=10 January 2008|title=IAAF call time on Oscar Pistorius' dream|publisher=The Daily Telegraph (London)|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After further research was presented, the Court of Arbitration ([[Court of Arbitration for Sport|CAS]]) ruled that his running prostheses were not shown to provide a net competitive advantage over biological legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/may/18/olympicgames2008.athletics |author=Mackay, Duncan|date=18 May 2008|title=Diack relaxed over Pistorius's victory|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Pistorius qualified for and competed in both the [[2012 Olympic Games]] and the [[2012 Paralympic Games]] using his running blades, becoming the first amputee sprinter to run in the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/oscar-pistorius-makes-history-double-amputee-sprinter-compete/story?id=16929845|title=Pistorius, 25, Is First Double-Amputee Sprinter to Compete in Olympic Games|author=Shaw, Alexis|publisher=ABC|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pistorius's athletics prostheses==
The blades are [[transtibial prosthesis|transtibial prostheses]], meaning they replace legs and feet that are amputated below the knee (BK). They were developed by medical engineer [[Van Phillips (inventor)|Van Phillips]] who incorporated Flex-Foot, Inc., in 1984, and in 2000 sold the company to [[Össur]] which now (in 2012) manufactures the blades. They are designed to store kinetic energy like a spring, allowing the wearer to jump and run effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A Personal Call to a Prosthetic Invention|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/sports/olympics/02cheetah.html?ref=sports|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=19 September 2012|publisher=New York Times|author=Pogash, Carol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon fibre is actually a [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]], and is a strong, light-weight material used in a number of applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high [[strength-to-weight ratio]] is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally [[epoxy]], but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.&lt;ref name=blades /&gt;

Pistorius has been using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without [[fibula]]e and with malformed feet, and his legs were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear prosthetic legs. He wears socks and pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters, and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more snugly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/column-pistorius-revolutionizes-olympic-notions|title=Column: Pistorius revolutionizes Olympic notions|author=Leicester, John|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pistorius uses custom-made spike pads on the blades. Before development of the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by hand, but the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a pressure-sensitive treadmill and film at 500 [[Frame rate|fps]] to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike pad which includes a midsole of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact, with a carbon fibre plate on the bottom. The developers attached the pad with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670487/how-nike-made-track-spikes-for-oscar-pistorius-s-carbon-fiber-blades|title=How Nike Made Track Spikes For Oscar Pistorius’s Carbon Fiber Blades|author=Wilson, Mark|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the curved design, the blades have to be slightly longer than a runner's biological leg and foot would be. The blades replace the hinge of an ankle with elastic compression that bends and releases the blade with every stride, so the uncompressed blade leaves the user standing on tiptoe. They are designed to move forward, so have no heel support in the back. According to Josh McHugh of [[Wired Magazine]], "The Cheetahs seem to bounce of their own accord. It’s impossible to stand still on them, and difficult to move slowly. Once they get going, Cheetahs are extremely hard to control."&lt;ref name=blades&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/blade.html?pg=2&amp;topic=blade&amp;topic_set=|author=McHugh, Josh|date=March 2007|publisher=Wired Magazine|title=Blade Runner|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How the blades work==
[[File:Oscar Pistorius-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Pistorius running in Iceland in 2007.]]

In 2007 Pistorius applied to run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but questions quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue to run in non-disabled meets as long as he uses the equipment that was studied in the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/29/paralympics-2012-oscar-pistorius|title=Paralympics 2012: Oscar Pistorius shows what Paralympians can achieve|author=Bull, Andy|date=28 August 2012|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pistorius's performance in the early non-disabled races raised questions because of two major concerns: his pattern of running the races and his leg-swing times. Most sprinters spring out of the blocks with their fastest time and slow down as the race progresses, but Pistorius ran a "negative split," starting slowly and building up speed in the last half of the race (though he no longer uses this pattern). His average time was also less in the 400m race when compared to other runners than in the 200m.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/olympics/2012/writers/david_epstein/08/03/oscar-pistorius-london-olympics/index.html|title=Fair or foul? Experts split over whether Pistorius has advantage|author=Epstein, David|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy about the use of the blades persists, but the research provided considerable information on how they work in application, and other research is expected to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://theconversation.edu.au/pistorius-loss-to-oliveira-fuels-the-disruptive-technology-debate-9250|title=Pistorius' loss to Oliveira fuels the ‘disruptive technology’ debate|author=Lyons, Keith|date=3 September 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-disabled sprinters have calves and ankles that return and amplify the energy supplied by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work because he does not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by ''[[Engineering &amp; Technology]]'' magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his [[gluteal muscles|gluteal]] and [[quadriceps]] muscles that a normal sprinter would.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://engtechmag.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/london-2012-paralympic-games-oscar-pistorius-blades-an-annotated-graphic|title=London 2012 Paralympic games, Oscar Pistorius’ blades – an annotated graphic|publisher=Engineering &amp; Technology|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.nbcolympics.com/video/track-and-field/science-of-olympics-how-oscar-pistorius-blades-work.html|title=Science of the Olympics: How Oscar Pistorius' blades work|publisher=NBC|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.&lt;ref name=blades /&gt;

Pistorius is always slow in starting a race because the flexible blades do not provide thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/sports/olympics/pistorius-eliminated-track-and-field-roundup.html?pagewanted=all|title=Pistorius Misses Chance at Final, but Remains Upbeat|publisher=The New York Times|author=Borden, Sam|date=5 August 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/no-advantage-to-being-an-amputee-a-defense-of-oscar-pistoriuss-prostheses/260878|title='No Advantage to Being an Amputee': A Defense of Oscar Pistorius's Prostheses|author=Simpson, Jake|publisher=The Atlantic|date=8 August 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps his head down and takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may be able to use the inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.&lt;ref name=blades /&gt;

==Research==

===Brüggemann study===
[[File:Oscar Pistorius, the first round of the 400m at the London 2012 Olympic Games.jpeg|thumb|left|Pistorius running in the first round of the 400m at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London]]

To resolve questions about the blades, Pistorius was asked to take part in a series of scientific tests in November 2007 at the [[German Sport University Cologne]] with Professor of [[Biomechanics]] Peter Brüggemann and IAAF technical expert Elio Locatelli. After two days of tests, Brüggemann reported that Pistorius used about 25 percent less energy expenditure than non-disabled athletes once he achieved a given speed. The study also found that he showed major differences in sprint mechanics, with significantly different maximum vertical ground return forces, and that the positive work or returned energy was close to three times higher than that of a human ankle. The energy loss in the blade during stance phase when the foot was on the ground was measured as 9.3 percent, while that of normal ankle joint was measured at 42.4 percent, showing a difference of more than 30 percent. Brüggemann's analysis stated that the blades allowed lower energy consumption at the same speed, and that the energy loss in the blade is significantly less than in a human ankle at maximum speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.iaaf.org/news/printer,newsid=42896.htmx|title=Oscar Pistorius - Independent Scientific study concludes that cheetah prosthetics offer clear mechanical advantages|date=14 January 2008|publisher=IAAF|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of that year, Brüggemann stated to ''[[Die Welt]]'' newspaper that Pistorius "has considerable advantages over athletes without prosthetic limbs who were tested by us. It was more than just a few percentage points. I did not expect it to be so clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Report: Artificial limbs give paralympic champion competitive edge|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/20/sports/athletics20.php|newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was published in 2008 in ''Sports Technology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://users.auth.gr/~lmademli/Analysi_Vadisis/Pistorius_SportsTechnology2008.pdf |title=Biomechanics of double transtibial amputee sprinting using dedicated sprinting prostheses |first=Gert-Peter |last=Bruggemann |first2=Adamantios |last2=Arampatzis |first3=Frank |last3=Emrich |first4=Wolfgang |last4=Potthast |year=2008 |accessdate=3 October 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but later researchers stated that the analysis "did not take enough variables into consideration". Commentators have also argued that the IAAF study did not accurately determine whether Cheetahs confer a net advantage because measuring the net advantage or disadvantage conferred on an athlete using Cheetahs is not possible given current scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jonathan Clayton|title=Oscar Pistorius vows to fight Olympics ban|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/athletics/article3186862.ece|newspaper=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the IAAF study may not have measured Pistorius’s performance against appropriate controls. IAAF used five non-disabled athletes, who run 400-meter races in similar times to Pistorius, as controls. However, because Pistorius was relatively new to the sport of running, he may not have trained enough to maximize his physical potential and reach his peak performance when the IAAF study was conducted. In March 2007, approximately 9 months before the IAAF study was conducted, Pistorius’s coach commented that Pistorius had not trained enough to achieve an upper body commensurate with the upper bodies of most elite sprinters. To obtain the most accurate understanding of how the prostheses affect Pistorius’s performance, he should be compared to athletes with similar physical potential. Consequently, the IAAF study may have been flawed because it compared Pistorius, who might have the physical potential to run faster than his current times, against athletes at their peak.

===Weyand, et al. study===
In 2008 a team of seven researchers conducted tests at [[Rice University]], including Peter Weyand, [[Hugh Herr]], Rodger Kram, Matthew Bundle and Alena Grabowski. The team collected [[metabolic]] and mechanical data by indirect [[calorimetry]] and ground reaction force measurements on Pistorius's performance during constant-speed, level treadmill running, and found that the energy usage was 3.8 percent lower than average values for elite non-disabled distance runners, 6.7 percent lower than for average distance runners and 17 percent lower than for non-disabled 400m sprint runners. At sprinting speeds of 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0&amp;nbsp;m/s, Pistorius produced longer foot to ground contact times, shorter leg swing times, and lower average vertical forces than able bodied sprinters. The team concluded that running on the blades appears to be physiologically similar but mechanically different from running with biological legs. The study was published several months later in the ''[[Journal of Applied Physiology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/specialsections/summerolympics/Does-Double-Amputee-Oscar-Pistorius-Have-an-Unfair-Advantage-at-the-2012-Olympic-Games-162598806.html#ixzz26wkjbD00|title=Does Double-Amputee Oscar Pistorius Have an Unfair Advantage at the 2012 Olympic Games?|author=Eveleth, Rose|date=23 July 2012|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/107/3/903.abstract|publisher=Journal of Applied Physiology|title=The fastest runner on artificial legs: different limbs, similar function?|first=Peter G.|last=Weyand|first2=Matthew W.|last2=Bundle|first3=Craig P.|last3=McGowan|first4=Alena|last4=Grabowski|first5=Mary Beth|last5=Brown|first6=Rodger|last6=Kram|first7=Hugh|last7=Herr|date=17 February 2009|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kram also stated that Pistorius's "rate of energy consumption was lower than an average person but comparable to other high-caliber athletes."&lt;ref name=study&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.denverpost.com/perspective/ci_21056327/cu-boulder-researchers-help-oscar-pistorius-become-first#ixzz26ya4Ropt|title= CU-Boulder researchers help Oscar Pistorius become first amputee to compete in Olympics: Research shows his prostheses are not an advantage|date=11 July 2012|author=Bryen, Whitney|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lightness and rigidity of the blade compared to muscle and bone may allow blade runners to swing their legs faster than non-disabled runners. In comments on the article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that the study found that Pistorius re-positioned his legs 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.&lt;ref name=study2&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rami-hashish/oscar-pistorius-prosthetic-legs-advantage_b_1766417.html|title=Oscar Pistorius' Prosthetic Legs: Do They Give Him an Advantage Over Other Olympic Runners?|author=Hashish, Rami|publisher=Huffington Post|date=10 August 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grabowski, et al. study===
In 2008 a research team including Alena Grabowski, Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow-up study of single amputees with running blades which was published in ''[[Biology Letters]]''. Each of six amputees' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg. The team measured leg swing times and force applied to the running surface on a high-speed treadmill at the Biomechanics Laboratory of [[the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital]], and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics. They found no difference in leg swing times at different speeds, and recorded leg swing times similar to that of non-disabled sprinters. They also found that single running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent. Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in running speed, the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters' top speed. Grabowski also found that amputees typically increased their leg swing times to compensate for the lack of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/11/02/rsbl.2009.0729.abstract|title=Running-specific prostheses limit ground-force during sprinting|first=Alena M.|last=Grabowski1|first2=Craig P.|last2=McGowan|first3=William J.|last3=McDermott|first4=Matthew T.|last4=Beale|first5=Rodger|last5=Kram|first6=Hugh M.|last6=Herr|publisher=Biology Letters|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other discussion===
Discussion continues about the relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades. Researchers and analysts also point out that the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They also do not take into account differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have such factors as musculature, blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www2.teamusa.org/US-Paralympics/Features/2012/August/04/American-blade-runner-Jarryd-Wallace.aspx?p=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806200822/http://www.teamusa.org/US-Paralympics/Features/2012/August/04/American-blade-runner-Jarryd-Wallace.aspx?p=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 August 2012 |title=American blade runner: Jarryd Wallace |author=Rosewater, Amy |date=4 August 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Paralympics==
A controversy over the effects of running blade length arose at the [[2012 Paralympic Games]], as Brazilian runner [[Alan Oliveira]] and USA runner [[Blake Leeper]] changed to longer running blades within a few months before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the [[International Paralympic Committee|IPC]] rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/9517308/Oscar-Pistorius-blade-controversy-sour-grapes-or-is-South-African-right-to-complain-about-Alan-Oliveiras-blades.html|title=Oscar Pistorius blade controversy: sour grapes or is South African right to complain about Alan Oliveira's blades?|author=Hart, Simon|date=3 September 2012|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including [[Jerome Singleton]] and [[Jack Swift]], who called for the [[T43 (classification)|T43]] double blade and [[T44 (classification)|T44]] single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Sam Cunningham |title=Oscar 'right to fight' as Paralympics blades row speeds up |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2198913/Oscar-Pistorius-right-fight-blades-row-speeds-up.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ATEzRGgf?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2198913/Oscar-Pistorius-right-fight-blades-row-speeds-up.html |archivedate= 6 September 2012 |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=5 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The improvement in running time and the wide broadcast of the race results provided a public demonstration of how the blade length affects performance. Pistorius' stride length was actually 9 percent longer (2.2m vs 2.0m), but Oliveira took more strides (99 vs 92). The combination of stride length and stride rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sportsscientists.com/2012_09_01_archive.html |title=Pistorius vs Oliveira and Technology.

{{For|other people named Mike Rossi|Mike Rossi (disambiguation){{!}}Mike Rossi}}

Mike Rossi (born May 1967) is a [[disc jockey]] and former [[Television presenter|television host]] who gained national notoriety in 2015 after qualifying for the [[Boston Marathon]] with a time that later came under heavy scrutiny, resulting in widespread accusations that he had cheated in his qualifying race.

==Early career==
Rossi was one of the dancers on the 1980s television show [[Dancin' On Air]]. In 1986, one of the hosts quit, and 36 hours later, Rossi became one of the co-hosts of the show at the age of 18.&lt;ref name="citypaper" /&gt; The show was canceled in 1987.&lt;ref name="philly1" /&gt;

==Viral fame and cheating accusations==
In 2015, Rossi ran in the Boston Marathon, and brought his wife and 9-year-old twins on the trip from their hometown of [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Abington, Pennsylvania]]. He subsequently received a form letter from his children's principal informing him that a family vacation was not an excusable reason for absence, and that the school days his children missed would be marked as unexcused. Rossi then wrote a response to the principal, which he never mailed, but did post on [[Facebook]]; the post went viral, and was shared by over 28,700 people within a week.&lt;ref name="NBC10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="philly2" /&gt;

After appearances on the [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] show and [[Fox &amp; Friends]], controversy erupted over how Rossi qualified for the Boston Marathon. Rossi had submitted a qualifying time of 3:11  that he had supposedly run in the Lehigh Valley Health Network Via Marathon. The organizers of that marathon asked USA Track &amp; Field for help in investigating cheating allegations, raised mostly by other runners who, in exploring Rossi's race history, noticed that a 3:11 marathon was inconsistent with all of Rossi’s other publicly available race results.&lt;ref name ="post" /&gt; In addition, there were no photos of Rossi anywhere on the Lehigh marathon race course except for at the finish line, while most other runners were seen in 10 or more pictures taken along the way by a company hired to take photographs of the runners.&lt;ref name="RW" /&gt; 

The editors of LetsRun.com, one of the top five running-centric websites in the world, called the evidence "overwhelming" that "Rossi did not run the entire 2014 Lehigh Valley Marathon."&lt;ref name="letsrun" /&gt; The organizers of the Via Marathon sent LetsRun a statement explaining why they could not disqualify Rossi's time, stating it was "simply because they received no reports of wrongdoing as the race took place." They also stated that "there is data from Rossi’s participation in other racing events indicating that Rossi’s time may not be accurate."&lt;ref name="letsrun" /&gt;

===Aftermath===
The founders of LetsRun.com publicly offered Rossi $100,000 if he could repeat his 3:11 performance within one year of the offer.&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt; Meanwhile, the organizers of the Via Marathon announced that they had taken several steps to verify runner participation and timing accuracy after the Rossi incident. Previously, the only timing mats at the Via marathon were at the start and finish line. The marathon committee added four on-course timing mats and video surveillance at several locations that Via would archive.&lt;ref name="mcall" /&gt;

==Arrest at Kenny Chesney concert==
On June 25, 2016, Rossi was [[Tailgate party|tailgating]] prior to a Kenny Chesney concert at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia in Lot K, which had opened up to tailgaters at 10 am. At around 5 pm, when he was asked to "move along" several times by venue security, he refused, and when police arrived on the scene and made the same request, Rossi refused again, and was arrested for criminal trespass.&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt; At his court appearance two weeks later, a ''[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]'' magazine reporter approached Rossi, who told reporters that he was not Mike Rossi. Rossi's identity was immediately confirmed by a court official on the scene.&lt;ref name="philly3" /&gt;

==Arrest at a McGraw/Hill concert==
On August 19, 2017, Rossi was arrested outside the Wells Fargo center after a [[Tim McGraw]]/[[Faith Hill]] concert for allegedly punching a 47-year-old woman. Rossi later posted to his Facebook page admitting he had "a hellish past 2 1/2 years," and "most of it I brought on myself and I take full responsibility."&lt;ref name="philly4" /&gt;

[[File:Ball-bin-P1080178.jpg|thumb|A MUGA surrounded by noise reducing earth walls.]]
A '''Multi Use Games Area''' (abbreviated MUGA) is usually a steel anti vandal outdoor fenced area with built in goal post units for various types of sports games, such as [[football pitch|football]], [[basketball]] or [[tennis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/new-multi-use-games-area-1711810|title=New sports area for football, basketball and tennis opens in Harlow|first=Charlotte|last=Page|date=26 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outer fencing makes it easier to keep the ball in play. MUGAs are often installed at [[school]]s. MUGAs can be supplied in Half court (Open one end with one combination goal unit), Full court (Fully enclosed with two end goal units) and Key area (Open single goal end with key line markings).

[[File:Multipurpose Sports Court.PNG|thumb|A multi use games area with line markings for sports.]]
MUGAs are often supplied as ready-made solutions by various manufacturers. Sports MUGAs usually consist of a steel goal post and basketball goal post combination. This can be senior, junior or match quality for basketball. Sports played on MUGAs are varied, hence the term Multi Use. Basketball, football, hockey, netball, volleyball are usually provided for with appropriate floor line markings for each sport, which are lined in different coloured paints. Multi Use Games Area MUGAs are placed into the ground around a sports surface area including natural grass, artificial sports surfaces, sports tiles, tarmac or concrete. Some MUGAs are open ended, partially closed or fully enclosed. Sizes vary from Key Area 6m x 7.5m. Tarmac key lined. Half Court 7.5m x 15m. Full Court 15m x 30m.

The intense activity in a MUGA can increase [[noise pollution|noise]] and complaints from neighbours. The noise level depends on the material used for the fencing, and by the location. Positive results from United Kingdom local authorities can provide good evidence &lt;ref&gt;Citation?&lt;/ref&gt; that placements of anti vandal Multi Use Games Areas can reduce anti social behaviour and increase fitness within early teen age groups in both cities and parish localities.

The use of '''music at sporting events''' is a practice that is thousands of years old, but has recently had a resurgence as a noted phenomenon. Some sports have specific traditions with respect to pieces of music played at particular intervals. Others have made the presentation of music very specific to the team—even to particular players. Music may be used to build the energy of the fans, and music may also be introduced in ways that are less directly connected with the action in a sporting event.

==History of music at sporting events==
The [[ancient Greeks]] intently tied the performance of music to sporting events, particularly at their quadrenniel Olympic games.
:"The extent to which cultural elements were included in the Pan-Hellenic games is enlightening. At several festivals, including Delphi, Isthmia and Athens, music played a prominent role in the athletic contests."{{ref|Romano}}
The revival of the Olympic games in 1896 also incorporated music into the festivities surrounding the competitions. On March 25 of that year, "the [[Philharmonic Orchestra]] played the [[National Anthem]] and the first [[Olympic Hymn]], written by poet [[Kostis Palamas]] and set to music by the well-known Greek composer [[Spyridon Samaras]]."

==Music used for dramatic effect==
Composer [[Carl Orff]]'s [[O Fortuna]] is most commonly played over a sports venue's public-address system, just before the start of many important, significant professional and collegiate games.

Within its first two notes, coupled with its booming operatic vocals and percussive instrumentation, Orff’s ''O Fortuna'' is based upon a 13th-century poem entitled,'' [[Carmina Burana]]''.  Orff's legendary composition laments fate, and it forms the beginning and end of his interpretation of the poetry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askmen.com/top_10/entertainment/top-10-classical-music-pieces-men-should-know_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association of songs with sporting events==
Certain songs have historically been associated with particular sporting events.  Fans of the home team at collegiate athletic events may serenade the losing visitors with a song recorded by [[Steam (band)|Steam]], titled "[[Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye]]", with its familiar refrain, "na na, na na na na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye."

[[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s standards '"[[We Will Rock You]]" and "[[We Are the Champions]]" have also become common fare at sporting events, as have Five Stone's "Make Noise", [[Gary Glitter]]'s "[[Rock and Roll Part 2]]", and [[Zombie Nation (band)|Zombie Nation]]'s "Kernkraft 400". Most collegiate sports are accompanied by a [[band (music)|band]] that plays [[brass instruments|brass]] and [[drum]] [[instrumental music]] designed to accentuate the experience.

===Basketball music===
At [[NBA]] games, repetitive [[Organ (music)|organ]] music is played at key points of the game. For example, the announcers often play the "[[Charge (fanfare)|Charge]]" fanfare to accompany the home team entering the visitor's side of the court with possession of the ball. A different theme is used to encourage the home team in defense of their own side of the court. Many NBA teams now play a particular theme to accompany the home team taking the court to begin the game. They also use chant such as the defence chant to show support and pump up the crowd.

The NCAA does not use organ music, but in many Division I schools, a  smaller pep band plays at games (as compared to the full-size football marching bands).  However, during a 2004 game between [[Michigan State University]] and the [[University of Kentucky]] at [[Ford Field]], both teams' full football marching bands played.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Baseball music===
Ballpark music performed by an [[organist]] debuted at Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]] in 1941, and had spread to most other [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] parks by the 1960s.

Beginning in the mid-1970s, pre-recorded pop and rock music began to supplement the organ music (or replace it entirely) at many ballparks.{{ref|organ}} A very popular theme song is "[[Meet the Mets]]" from 1962 when the Mets joined the MLB. The Mets also had a theme song for their World Series run in 1986, it was "Lets go Mets".

In the modern evolution of the sport, many athletes now have "theme songs" that are played when they come up to bat. Slate notes that Major League Baseball players "can pick several songs as personal themes for their plate appearances, sometimes a rotation of four different tracks a game." Indeed, in 2004, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that the longtime organist for [[Dodger Stadium]] "has been usurped by a deejay who sits directly below her. He plays a selection of hip-hop and rock, interspersed with devices designed to pump up the crowd and the stadium's volume." In that same year, the [[Dropkick Murphys]]' [[Tessie#Dropkick Murphys version|version]] of [[Tessie#Broadway &amp; Royal Rooters version|a 1902 Red Sox fight song]] ended up inspiring [[Red Sox Nation|Red Sox fandom]], as [[Boston Red Sox|their team]] headed to victory in both the [[2004 ALCS]] and the [[2004 World Series]].

The [[Atlanta Braves]] are known for an organist whose primary duty is playing the visiting player's walkup music, which is often fan-selected or plays on a player's name, with special dispensation for certain players.  Former Braves usually are greeted with the theme to [[Welcome Back, Kotter]].  Georgia natives having the popular state anthem [[Georgia on My Mind]].  Players who played college baseball at one of the currently 14 [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) or currently 14 [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) schools (both conferences' fan bases reach the city) or Big Ten–school Maryland (which had been an ACC member until the 2013-14 season, since former Terrapins probably made visits to the state of Georgia while playing college baseball) receive their respective school's fight song.  (The fight song is played for all players who played at current ACC-schools Louisville, Notre Dame, and Pittsburgh or current SEC-schools Missouri and Texas A&amp;M—the five most recent members of the respective conferences in baseball—even if their team played in the American (then–Big East) or Big 12 conference at the time.)

====Repertoire====

In some cases a particular song may be played at a specific time in the game.

''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]'' is often played or sung at major- or minor-league [[baseball]] games, typically during the [[seventh-inning stretch]].

At [[Fenway Park]], [[Neil Diamond]]'s song, "[[Sweet Caroline]]," is played during the eighth inning of [[Boston Red Sox]] home games, and has been a regular part of the program since 2002.

Since 2006, ''Sweet Caroline'' has also played over the sound system during the middle of the eighth inning of [[New York Mets]] home games.

Consequently, Diamond's hit single became a standing tradition after several years of playing it based upon the home-team's performance.{{ref|Caroline}}

The National Football League team, the Buffalo Bills, have been credited for playing "Seven Nation Army" by the White Stripes before each team kickoff.

===Hockey music===
Many [[NHL]] hockey teams feature an organist to lead crowd chants, cues and other prompts. Hockey organists may adapt popular music for the organ and play genres such as rock, film scores, or pop on the organ in instrumental form.

===Association football music===
In the many countries where [[football (soccer)|football]] is popular, and in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in particular, football music is a varied and popular subgenre of popular music.  Songs are often released to coincide with specific events, such as the [[Football World Cup|World Cup]], or to become anthems for particular teams.  Since football has a huge spectator base, such songs are often very popular on the charts.  Examples of music created to be football songs include [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s "World in Motion", and "Three Lions" by [[The Lightning Seeds]] in collaboration with comedians and football fans: [[David Baddiel]] and [[Frank Skinner]].  A subset of football music is novelty football music, which typically includes humorous lyrics.  Examples of novelty football songs include "[[Vindaloo (single)|Vindaloo]]" by [[Fat Les]], "Meat Pie, Sausage Roll", and numerous [[Frank Sidebottom]] songs.

The [[Village People]]/[[Pet Shop Boys]] song "[[Go West (song)|Go West]]" has also become popular, and an instrumental version of the music was used as the theme for the [[FIFA World Cup 2006|2006 World Cup]].

[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] adopted "[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]", specifically the version performed by [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] band [[Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers]], as its theme song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coslett|first=Paul|title=You'll never walk alone|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2008/06/09/youll_never_walk_alone_feature.shtml|publisher=BBC Liverpool|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] have adopted [[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]] as their song whilst [[I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles]] can be heard at games involving [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Moon:Significance|url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/news/features/2011/march/blue-moon-significance|publisher=www.mcfc.co.uk|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] fans' anthem has been [[Delilah (Tom Jones song)|Delilah]] since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stoke City fans back Tom Jones's Delilah to top charts|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-13291654|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theme music in American football===
Many College Football teams have [[marching band]]s that play during the game at football games and march on the field during halftime.

Currently two teams have marching bands in the NFL.  The [[Washington Redskins]] have featured a marching band since 1938, and the [[Baltimore Ravens]] have featured a marching band since its 1996 inception;  however, [[Baltimore's Marching Ravens]] dating to the All-American Football Conference (a league which merged with the NFL) team in Baltimore, MD, featured a marching band when it began in 1947, went through many years with the Colts, and continued operations after being abandoned by the Irsay family when the team moved to Indianapolis in 1984.  However, that band stayed intact in the area and began playing at other events, including the [[Preakness Stakes]], and  was used for the two-year CFL experiment known as the Baltimore Stallions.  When the NFL returned to Baltimore with an expansion team in 1996 (the NFL suspended the Cleveland Browns franchise, and awarded an "expansion team" in Baltimore in a complex deal), the loyal band was rewarded by becoming the new Ravens' marching band. For the two years that the Ravens played at the Memorial Statium (former home of the Baltimore Colts) they remained "The Marching Colts." Once the new stadium opened in 1998, the group's name was changed to Baltimore's Marching Ravens to reflect the new era for the new team. During their existence, the [[Los Angeles Rams]] had a marching band during their time at both the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|LA Coliseum]] and [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim|Anaheim Stadium]]. The practice was abandoned when the team relocated to St. Louis.

The [[Seattle Seahawks]] adopted [[The Verve]]'s "Bittersweet Symphony" as their theme song, and it is heard whenever something special happens to the home team. For instance, when the team takes the field to a sellout crowd, the song blares throughout the reverberating stadium, or when the Seahawks score the game-winning field goal, it would undoubtedly be played. When the New England Patriots come out from the tunnel, Ozzy Osbourne's hit "Crazy Train" is played. A common song for the [[New Orleans Saints]] during and since their Super Bowl Season is "Half-time", or "Stand Up and Get Crunk" by  [[Ying Yang Twins]]. The [[Green Bay Packers]] play [[Todd Rundgren]]'s "[[Bang the Drum All Day]]" after every Packers touchdown at [[Lambeau Field]].

A common choice of music to be played over PA systems as games are being kicked off is "[[Start Me Up]]" by the [[Rolling Stones]] and "[[Welcome to the Jungle]]" by [[Guns N' Roses]].

===Theme music in other sports===
Entire teams will occasionally adopt a theme song (such as the [[Chicago Bears]] with their 1985 ''[[Super Bowl Shuffle]]'', sung by the members of the team). Up until 2011, [[Monday Night Football]] had its own theme, sung by [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]; the [[Hockey Night in Canada]] theme has sometimes been referred to as Canada's second national anthem; and the [[Olympic Games]] have long had powerful theme music composed to accompany ceremonies opening and closing the games.

Perhaps the most extreme example of this can be found in [[professional wrestling]] and some [[mixed martial arts]] promotions, where almost every wrestler has an entry theme written to suit their particular character.

An album entitled "ESPN Presents Stadium Anthems" has been released that includes many songs that are played over the Public Address system at North American sporting events.  Similar albums, such as [[Jock Jams]] have been released in the past.

[[Image:Greek vase with runners at the panathenaic games 530 bC.jpg|thumb|Greek vase depicting runners at the Panathenaic Games c. 530 BC]]

The '''Panathenaic Games''' ({{lang-grc|Παναθήναια}}) were held every four years in [[Athens]] in [[Ancient Greece]] from 566 BC&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of the Olympic Games by David C. Young, Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-1129-4}}, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; to the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Heuck Allen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rV8vyYn-qMgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39 Finding the walls of Troy: Frank Calvert and Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarlík], University of California Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-520-20868-4}}, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; These Games incorporated religious festival, ceremony (including prize-giving), athletic competitions, and cultural events hosted within a [[stadium]].

==Religious festival==

The competitions for which this festival came to be known were only part of a much larger religious occasion; the Great Panathenaia itself. These ritual observances consisted of numerous sacrifices to Athena (the name-sake of the event and patron deity to the hosts of the event - Athens) as well as Poseidon and others. The Panathenaic festival was formed in order to honor the goddess Athena who had become the patron of Athens after having a competition with the god Poseidon where they were to win the favor of the Athenian people by offering the people gifts. The festival would also bring unity among the people of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waldstein|first1=Charles|title=The Panathenaic Festival and the Central Slab of the Parthenon Frieze|journal=The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts|date=1885|volume=1|issue=1|pages=10–17|doi=10.2307/495977|ref=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sister-event to the Great Panathenaia was held every year - the Lesser Panathenaia, which was 3–4 days shorter in celebration. The competitions were the most prestigious games for the citizens of [[Athens]], but not as important as the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] or the other [[Panhellenic Games]].

==Ceremony==

The procession to the [[Parthenon]] was more important than the games themselves. During the Great Panathenaia, a special robe (the ''[[peplos]]'') was made by the women of Athens for the statue of [[Athena]], which was carried to the Parthenon as part of the procession. There was also a large sacrifice made to Athena, the ''hekatombe'' ("sacrifice of a hundred oxen") and the meat from the sacrificed animals was used in an enormous banquet on the final night of the festival, the ''pannychis'' (Greek παννυχίς, "all-nighter").  Many scholars believe that this procession is the theme of the inner Ionic [[Parthenon Frieze]], highlighting its importance to the Athenian people to warrant inclusion in a temple.

Award ceremonies included the giving of [[Panathenaic amphora]]e which were the large ceramic vessels that contained the oil given as prizes.  The winner of the [[chariot race]] received as a prize one-hundred and forty Panathenaic amphorae full of olive oil.

== Cultural events ==

The Panathenaia also included poetic and musical competitions.  Prizes were awarded for [[rhapsode|rhapsodic]] recitation of [[Homer]]ic poetry, for instrumental music on the [[aulos|aulus]] and [[cithara]], and for singing to the accompaniment of the aulus and cithara ([[citharede|citharody]]). In addition, the Games included a reading of both the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the ''[[Iliad]]''.

==The Panathenaic Stadium==

The athletic events were staged at the [[Panathenaic Stadium]], which is still in use today. In 1865, [[Evangelis Zappas]] left a vast fortune in his will with instructions to excavate and refurbish the ancient Panathenaic stadium so that modern Olympic Games could be held every four years "in the manner of our ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C. Young, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The Panathenaic stadium has hosted Zappas Olympics in [[Zappas Olympics#Games of 1870|1870]],&lt;ref&gt;The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C. Young, Chapters 4 &amp; 13&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zappas Olympics#Games of 1875|1875]], as well as the modern [[Olympic Games]] in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]. The stadium also hosted the [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906]] [[Intercalated Games]].

== Contests ==
The Panathenaic Games held contests in a number of musical, athletic, and equestrian events. Due to the fact that there were so many contests held, the games usually lasted a little over a week. On a fourth century marble block, experts explain that on the block is written a program for the games, as well as individual events and their prizes. The inscription also says that there are two age categories for the music events but three age categories for the athletic events. According to scholars, the age groups are boys: 12-16; beardless youths: 16-20; men: over 20.&lt;ref name=Neils&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neils|first1=Jennifer|title=Goddess and Polis: The Panathenanic Festival In Ancient Athens|date=1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One thing that was different about these games than normal funeral games is that prizes were given to runners-up, not just the lone victor.

Using the inscription, experts put together a general program like so: Day 1: Musical and Rhapsodic Contest; Day 2: Athletic Contest for Boys and Youths; Day 3: Athletic Contest for Men; Day 4: Equestrian Contest; Day 5: Tribal Contest; Day 6: Torch Race and Sacrifice; Day 7: Boat Race; Day 8: Awarding of Prizes, Feasting and Celebrations.&lt;ref name=Neils/&gt; Experts reasonably came up with how the games went based on the order of prizes which were written on the marble block. Wrestling was also a part of the contest as well as discus.

The musical events which took place were Kithara players, Flute players, and singers. The athletic events were the stadion, pentathlon, wrestling, boxing, and pankration. The equestrian events were two-horse chariot race, horse race, and javelin throw on horseback. Based on the inscription, we learn that the prizes given to the men and the youth were different. Men were rewarded a certain amount of drachmas and/or a valuable crown worth a certain amount of drachmas. Boys and youths were given a certain number of amphoras of olive oil.&lt;ref name=Neils /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24059">The '''personal finances of professional American athletes''' is a subject of widespread discussion due to the often high salaries of such athletes and the high rates of [[personal bankruptcy]] and other financial distress.

According to a 2009 ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' article, 78% of [[National Football League]] (NFL) players are either [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] or are under financial stress within two years of retirement and an estimated 60% of [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) players go bankrupt within five years after leaving their sport.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1153364/1/index.htm |title=How (and Why) Athletes Go Broke |author=Pablo S. Torre |publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811090257/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1153364/1/index.htm | archivedate=2009-08-11 | date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the statement "60% of NBA players go bankrupt within five years after leaving their sport" was released by a representative of the [[NBA Players' Association]] in 2008 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/basketball/2008/01/31/nba_players_financial_security_no_slam_dunk.html | location=Toronto | work=The Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pearlswindow.com/2008/02/do-60-of-nba-players-go-broke-5-years.html&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine article states, however, that a working paper from the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] found that the percentage of NFL players who go bankrupt after two years is a much smaller 1.9%, climbing to 15.7% after 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roberts |first1=Daniel |date=April 15, 2015 |title=16% of retired NFL players go bankrupt, a report says |journal=Fortune |url=http://fortune.com/2015/04/15/nfl-players-bankrupt/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{asof|1911}} the average salary for the about 500 players in [[Major League Baseball]] was slightly more than $2,000 a season (${{Inflation|US|2,000|1911|fmt=c|r=-2}} today). The star hitter [[Ty Cobb]] received $9,000 a season (${{Inflation|US|9,000|1911|fmt=c|r=-2}} today), and sold automobiles in the off season. While Cobb encouraged young men to play professionally, top pitcher [[Christy Mathewson]]—who had made more money as a player than Cobb—warned, "Keep out of baseball unless you are sure of being a star!" He stated that the average player did not make enough over a ten-year career to justify devoting those years to the sport.&lt;ref name="fox191105"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcLQAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA147&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DIPgUqTJG4bpoAT1u4LAAQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=Baseball as the Players See It | work=Outing Magazine |date=May 1911| accessdate=22 January 2014 | author=Fox, Edward Lyell | pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1941, [[Hank Greenberg]] was the highest-paid player in baseball, earning $55,000 a season (${{Inflation|US|55,000|1941|fmt=c|r=-2}} today).&lt;ref name="life19410519"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6U4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;f=true | title=Army Inducts Highest-paid Baseball Player | work=Life | date=1941-05-19 | accessdate=22 January 2014 | pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stan Musial]]'s $80,000 a season (${{Inflation|US|80,000|1952|fmt=c|r=-2}} today) was the highest in 1952, while young star [[Mickey Mantle]] earned $10,000 a season (${{Inflation|US|10,000|1952|fmt=c|r=-2}} today). Musial, like Cobb, supplemented his income; he owned a restaurant.&lt;ref name="life19520915"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=baseball%20salary&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=baseball%20salary&amp;f=false | title=An Old Pro and a Young One | work=Life | date=1952-09-15 | accessdate=22 January 2014 | pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Players' vulnerabilities==
Baseball outfielder [[Torii Hunter]] brought up another obstacle: "Once you get into the financial stuff, and it sounds like Japanese, guys are just like, 'I ain't going back.' They're lost."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; It has been often suggested that baseball players study finance in college so that they can understand basic finances and contracts.

Players encourage each other to spend lavishly. [[Rod Strickland]] explained, "For rookies, it's like an unspoken initiation ... You're trying to get in good with the veterans, so you go beyond your means."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; Friends and strangers become part of their entourages. Retired basketball center [[Danny Schayes]] stated, "Guys go broke because they surround themselves with people who help them go broke".&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3469271 |title=Life of Reilly |author=Rick Reilly |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional problem is that players can earn money in many different tax jurisdictions, and be a citizen of one country but a legal resident of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote =Due to complicated tax issues that don’t affect the rest of us, even financially literate athletes can wind up in tax trouble if they have less-than-stellar advisers. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Length of careers==
"There's a far shorter peak earnings period than in any other profession".&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' reported in 2003 that "the average career span for professional basketball, football, and baseball is a mere 4.5 years, 3.2 years, and under five years, respectively."&lt;ref name=BE&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1365/is_8_33/ai_97910693/?tag=content;col1 |title=A brand new game: for these athletes, entrepreneurship is the next playing field - Entrepreneurship |author=Alan Hughes |publisher=''[[Black Enterprise]]'' magazine |date=March 2003 |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study found that, excluding pitchers, rookie Major League Baseball players' careers last for 5.6 years on average.&lt;ref name="roberts20070715"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/sports/baseball/15careers.html | title=Just How Long Does the Average Baseball Career Last? | work=The New York Times | date=2007-07-15 | accessdate=14 April 2015 | author=Roberts, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managers and investments==
[[Magic Johnson]] said, "They hire these people not because of expertise but because they're friends. Well, they'll fail."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; [[Rod Strickland]] made his father his business manager. The older Strickland checked out a real estate deal from a "friend of a close friend" of Rod's, but not well enough to avoid a costly blunder.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

Hockey Hall of Famer [[Bobby Orr]] received deceitful treatment from [[Alan Eagleson]], who "as Orr's agent, left him all but broke as part of one of sports' most spectacular financial scandals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1152491/index.htm |title=The Ever Elusive, Always Inscrutable And Still Incomparable Bobby Orr |author=S. L. Price |publisher=''Sports Illustrated'' |date=March 2, 2009 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Malone]], another Basketball Hall of Famer has said, "You get in trouble when you let a lot of people close to you . . . I've made my share of mistakes. You've got to learn from them.&lt;ref name=Malone&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765586197/From-the-Mailman-to-a-businessman-Karl-Malone-still-delivers-the-goods.html?pg=all |title=From the Mailman to a businessman, Karl Malone still delivers the goods |first=Doug |last=Robinson |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spouses, children and divorce==
When asked by one of his players "What's the most dangerous thing that could happen to us financially?", [[Carolina Panthers]] majority owner [[Jerry Richardson]] replied immediately, "Divorce."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;  The money stops flowing in. Without a [[prenuptial agreement]],&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; [[Michael Jordan]]'s $168 million divorce settlement was at the time the largest ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,266343,00.html |title=Forbes: Michael Jordan's Divorce Most Costly Ever |publisher=Fox News |date=April 16, 2007 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Dikembe Mutombo]] canceled his wedding, when his fiancee refused to sign one the day before the ceremony.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

Another factor is the sexual opportunities available to athletes during their careers. Players end up being responsible for [[child support]]. [[Shawn Kemp]] had at least seven children with six women,&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; [[Derrick Thomas]] seven with five,&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; [[Jon Kilgore]] fifteen with four, and [[Travis Henry]] nine with nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=With Nine Mouths to Feed, Travis Henry Says He’s Broke |author=Mike Tierney |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=March 11, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/sports/football/12henry.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was imprisoned for non-payment of an estimated $170,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/10-ways-sports-stars-destroy-their-finances-2009-9#have-too-many-children-6 |title=10 Ways Sports Stars Go From Riches To Rags |author=Lawrence Delevingne |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |date=September 12, 2009 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

The [[National Football League]] offers its players a Financial Education Program. "The non-credit seminars are offered during the year and teach players about cash management, insurance, tax planning, retirement planning and other related topics."&lt;ref name=NFL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/playerdevelopment/finance |title=Financial Education |publisher=nfl.com |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a more advanced NFL Business Management and Entrepreneurial Program, with "custom programs at top-rated business schools".&lt;ref name=NFL/&gt;

[[Ryerson University]]'s [[Ted Rogers School of Management]] offers a program called Breakaway, which aims to help players in their transition away from professional hockey and other sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Education for when a hockey career gets put on ice |author=Danielle Webb |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=January 5, 2011 |url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/managing/business-education/education-for-when-a-hockey-career-gets-put-on-ice/article1857046/?service=mobile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education can often be overlooked by professional athletes, once they have made it to their desired sports league. This is a major concern because many professional athletes have no funds or career options to fall back on.&lt;ref name="Caryna"&gt;{{cite web|last=Caryna|first=John|title=Why a college degree is important for professional athletes|publisher=Helium|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without a college degree, higher education, or in some instances even a high school diploma; there are limited options to explore in the world outside of athletics.&lt;ref name="Caryna"/&gt; Well established athletes like Shaquille O'Neal and Ray Lewis have gone back to receive their college degrees, despite their incredible success in their respected athletic professions.&lt;ref name="Caryna"/&gt; One side of the argument says that college athletics and the educational institutions often do not succeed in accommodating their student athletes for their future endeavors outside of sports, and that the overall relationship between schools and athletes can be perceived as commercial, rather than educational.&lt;ref name="McCormick"&gt;{{cite web|last=McCormick|first=A. C|title=The myth of the student-athlete: The college athlete as employee|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/213127627?accountid=11091|publisher=Washington Law Review|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In college athletics, such as basketball and football, coaches appear to control athletes in and out of season of their respected sport.&lt;ref name="McCormick"/&gt;  With incredibly demanding schedules that almost always requires players to miss classes to focus on their athletic performance, one side of the argument is that it can be difficult to state that schools implement policies and coaches that respect athletics and education equally at a university.&lt;ref name="McCormick"/&gt;  Universities have been able to counter these arguments by complying with NCAA rules on limits of practice time and extracurricular activities for the sport that do not pertain to the classroom.&lt;ref name="Caudill"&gt;{{cite web|last=Caudill|first=Steven|title=The Impact of Participation in Intercollegiate Athletics on Income and Graduation|jstor=2109580|publisher=The MIT Press|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Universities often argue that not only do these athletes receive an opportunity of a higher education that they might not have necessarily been able to receive, but that these skills enhance competitive drive, discipline, and teamwork skills in future work settings.&lt;ref name="Caudill"/&gt;  Scholarships often provide opportunities for those who may not have gotten into a university, based on previous academic performance or financial status, have been the one of the central arguments for universities justifying their athletic standing and policies.&lt;ref name="Caudill"/&gt; Additional arguments now cite the importance of the synergies in the valuable knowledge and experience gained on the field and how these skills are applied in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Caudill"/&gt;  In a study done about the mean attribution of life skills to the sport experience, 75% of former athletes who were participants stated that there were major life skills associated with sports that transferred to their working lives.&lt;ref name="Barton"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barton|first=Gavin|title=Career success and life skill development through sports|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/880398589?accountid=11091|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study analyzed different types of experiential learning, and found that these were often experiential skills that were learned through playing sports that included what ranged from leadership to goal setting.&lt;ref name="Barton"/&gt;  These arguments may more commonly come up to defend universities for implementing high standards in athletic performance.&lt;ref name="Caudill"/&gt;   Regardless of these allegations against universities, education is extremely valuable to professional athletes because the average athlete rarely has a long tenure and cannot make their income last for a sustained period of time.&lt;ref name="Caryna"/&gt;

Some believe that the universities are not to blame, and that students often pave their own path.  In a survey consisting of previous student athletes, athletic performance and effort was attributed to helping the development of major life skills, especially in the work force.&lt;ref name="Barton"/&gt;  However, this can change from person to person, and social theorists even believe that roles and identities contribute heavily to where a person is headed in life.&lt;ref name="Preacco"&gt;{{cite web|last=Preacco|first=Lara|title=Student-athlete worldview: A qualitative discovery of student-athletes outlook of the world through their athletic experiences|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305037662?accountid=|publisher=Western Michigan University|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some athletes, whose personality caters to working incredibly hard on the field, rather than off the field, thus developing more of an athletic identity that can get in the way of a career path or education.&lt;ref name="Preacco"/&gt;  The same goes with those who have passions in education or some other activity, making student athletes think very differently from one another.&lt;ref name="Preacco"/&gt;

==Successes==

===Basketball===
[[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Famer]] Magic Johnson is an example of an athlete who has not only kept his money, but increased it. He has built a thriving business empire.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; He was at one time a part owner of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], and his company, Magic Johnson Enterprises, has a net worth of $700 million. In 2012, he was a minority partner in [[Guggenheim Partners|a group]] that bought the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].

Michael Jordan has proven almost as successful in his post-basketball business ventures, despite a temporary financial setback due to his divorce. He has numerous business interests, most notably his own line of apparel through [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. In March 2010, he became the majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, now known as the [[Charlotte Hornets]], after buying out most of the interest of founding owner [[Robert L. Johnson|Bob Johnson]] for $275 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4989536 |title=Jordan soon to get reins of Bobcats |author=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=March 13, 2010 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Hall of Famer, [[Dave Bing]], established a steel processing company, Bing Steel, in [[Detroit]] in 1980. After Bing Steel suffered a loss in its first year of operation, Bing decided to shift his company from manufacturing to being a middleman. Bing Steel became profitable in its second year of operation, and has since expanded to become the Bing Group, a conglomerate involved in a number of businesses, including supplying the automotive industry.  However, it has been recently announced that the Bing Group is heavily in debt and is in process of being sold.  Most of his holdings have either gone bankrupt or been dissolved.

Still another Hall of Famer, [[Karl Malone]], was involved in a substantial number of business ventures during his NBA career, with his involvement both expanding and diversifying since his retirement. A 2012 story in the ''[[Deseret News]]'' of [[Salt Lake City]], where he played almost all of his NBA career, listed his current ventures. Among these are new-car and used-car dealerships in the Salt Lake City area; a cattle ranch and substantial timber property in his home state of [[Louisiana]]; restaurants in Louisiana, Utah and [[Idaho]]; a commercial development company; a deer-raising venture; and an outfitting business.&lt;ref name=Malone/&gt;

===Baseball===
[[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] has proven successful in business, though not at the level of Johnson or Jordan. After the end of his playing career in 1993, he was majority owner and chairman of a bank in his home town of [[Alvin, Texas]] before selling his interest in 2005. He also became part owner of two [[Minor league baseball|minor-league]] teams in his home state, the [[Corpus Christi Hooks]] and [[Round Rock Express]]. In 2010, he was the public face of, and a minority investor in, a group that bought the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], the team with which he finished his [[Major League Baseball]] playing career. He owned a controlling interest in the team until late 2013, when he sold his stake after differences with the majority partners of the Rangers.

===Football===
Former [[Washington Redskins]] cornerback [[Eugene Profit]] parlayed his [[Yale University|Yale]] economics education into a highly successful financial career. His company, Profit Investment Management, looks after $2 billion in assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/damon_hack/06/16/eugene.profit/index.html?xid=cnnbin&amp;hpt=hp_bn10 |title=Playing for Profit: Ex-NFL corner succeeds in business after football |author=Damon Hack |publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' |date=June 16, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Denver Broncos]] quarterback and Pro Football Hall of Fame member [[John Elway]] used his football earnings to launch a chain of automotive dealerships and steakhouses.&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;espn.com, [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nfl&amp;id=2744058 Elway expands business empire, opening new steakhouse]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mixed results==
Another athlete turned successful businessman, at least for a time, was former football safety [[Dave Duerson]], president and CEO of Duerson Foods L.L.C.&lt;ref name=BE/&gt; However, an expansion of his company turned into financial disaster due to issues with a supplier of freezers for a meat processing plant. Duerson Foods won a $34 million judgment against the freezer company in 2004, but never collected because the company later filed for bankruptcy, and Duerson himself filed for bankruptcy in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/nfl/news/story?id=6146920 |title=Duerson filed for bankruptcy |work=[[ESPN.com|ESPNChicago.com]] |date=February 22, 2011 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duerson's story turned far more tragic, as he committed suicide in February 2011, and a post-mortem examination of his brain revealed he was suffering from what was described as a "moderately advanced" case of [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], presumably from constant blows to the head during his football career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/nfl/news/story?id=6465271 |title=Dave Duerson had brain damage |work=[[ESPN.com|ESPNChicago.com]] |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In team [[sport]]s, a '''man of the match'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/man_of_the_match|title=man of the match - definition of man of the match in English - Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025173131/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/man_of_the_match|archivedate=25 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; award is often given to the outstanding player in a particular match. This can be a player from either team, although the player is generally chosen from the winning team.

Some sports have unique traditions regarding these awards, and they are especially sought-after in championship or [[all-star game|all-star]] games. In Australia, the term "[[best and fairest]]" is normally used, both for individual games and season-long awards. In some competitions, particularly in North America, the terms "[[most valuable player]]" (MVP) or "most outstanding player" (MOP) are used. In [[ice hockey]] in North America, three players of the game, called the "[[three stars (ice hockey)|three stars]]", are recognised.

In sports where playoffs are decided by series rather than individual games, such as professional basketball and baseball, MVP awards are commonly given for the series, and in ice hockey's [[National Hockey League|NHL]], for performance in the entire playoffs.

==Association football==
In football, the "man of the match" award typically goes to a player on the winning side. Players who score a [[hat-trick]], or [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] who keep a [[Shutout#Association football|clean sheet]] under pressure often get the award. Hat-trick scorers usually receive the match ball whether or not they are officially named man of the match. 

The man of the match is often chosen by a television commentator or a sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/sport.comment4|title=Football: The problem with man of the match awards|first=Si|last=Hawkins|date=27 February 2008|website=the Guardian|accessdate=6 May ghg2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301170032/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/sport.comment4|archivedate=1 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all competitions have an official man of the match award, so sometimes accolades are given by websites or newspapers instead. In the [[Premier League]], for example, a player receives a small black and gold trophy for their man of the match performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/83956|title=How the Premier League's monthly awards work|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204082122/https://www.premierleague.com/news/83956|archivedate=4 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3742900/Premier-League-s-new-man-match-award-yellow-brick-poking-fun-new-design.html|title=Premier League's new man-of-the-match award is a gold coloured brick|author=|date=|website=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019220257/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3742900/Premier-League-s-new-man-match-award-yellow-brick-poking-fun-new-design.html|archivedate=19 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian rules football==
In [[Australian rules football]], the player of the game is often referred to as having been the "best on ground" (or "BOG"). Media outlets provide immediate, unofficial recognition that is largely honorary, often on a 5–4–3–2–1 or 3–2–1 voting basis.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Players may receive a [[Tissot]] watch as an award for their "best on ground" performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richmondfc.com.au/video/2016-08-06/round-20-rance-wins-the-tissot|title=Round 20: Rance wins the Tissot - richmondfc.com.au|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019220230/http://www.richmondfc.com.au/video/2016-08-06/round-20-rance-wins-the-tissot|archivedate=19 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] recognises the player of the game as being the player awarded the maximum three votes by umpires in the [[Brownlow Medal]] count at season's end. Exceptions are made during the season for certain reserved games such as the [[Western Derby]], [[The ANZAC Day clash]], [[QClash]], and [[Showdown (AFL)|Showdown]], where medallions are officially rewarded in presentations following the conclusion of the match. On the day of the [[AFL Grand Final]], a player will be awarded the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as being the best on ground voted by an independent panel of [[Australian rules football]] experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/stats/awards/norm-smith-medal|title=Norm Smith Medal - AFL.com.au|website=afl.com.au|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135158/http://www.afl.com.au/stats/awards/norm-smith-medal|archivedate=16 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==
{{main article|Player of the Match awards (cricket)}}
In cricket, the man of the match award became a regular feature in Test matches in the mid 1980s.&lt;ref name="test motm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283704.html |title=Records / Test matches / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) /Most player-of-the-match awards |work=ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |accessdate=2 January 2014 |date= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303223723/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283704.html |archivedate=3 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The man of the match title is usually awarded to the player whose contribution is seen as the most critical in winning the game. 

In one match held on 3 April 1996, the whole team from [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] was awarded the Men of the Match award. It was the first instance when a whole team was awarded it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4th ODI: West Indies v New Zealand at Georgetown, Apr 3, 1996 &amp;#124; Cricket Scorecard &amp;#124; ESPN Cricinfo|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64524.html|website=ESPN Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=24 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404011441/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64524.html|archivedate=4 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a test match played between 15,16,17,18 January 1999 between South Africa vs West Indies, the whole South African team was awarded man of the match &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63823.html|title=5th Test, West Indies tour of South Africa at Centurion, Jan 15-18 1999 - Match Summary - ESPNCricinfo|website=ESPNcricinfo|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106053428/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63823.html|archivedate=6 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Test matches, [[Jacques Kallis]] holds the record for the highest number of awards won, with 23 in 166 matches played.&lt;ref name = "test motm"/&gt; In ODIs, [[Sachin Tendulkar]] holds the record for the highest number of man of the match titles, with 62 awards in 463 matches played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html |title=Records / One-Day Internationals / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) /Most player-of-the-match awards |work=ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |accessdate=2 January 2014 |date= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304055509/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html |archivedate=4 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tendulkar is followed by [[Sanath Jayasuriya]], who, along with [[Ricky Ponting]], also holds the record for the most Man of the Match titles as captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records / One-Day Internationals / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) / Most player-of-the-match awards|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902085726/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html|archivedate=2 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the shortest form of the game, [[T20 International]]s, this record is held by [[Shahid Afridi]], who has won 11 awards in 99 matches.

==Gaelic games==

In the Gaelic games of [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic football]], the "man of the match" ({{Lang-ga|Laoch na hImeartha}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/man+of+the+match|title=man of the match - Translation to Irish Gaelic with audio pronunciation of translations for man of the match by New English-Irish Dictionary|website=www.focloir.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817205811/http://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/man+of+the+match|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "hero of the game") is commonly awarded after important games. An unusual example was the [[2008 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final]], where the award was given to [[Brian Cody]], the [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] manager, rather than to a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=100900|title=Bookie pays out on man of the match bets - Hoganstand.com|website=www.hoganstand.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817204048/http://www.hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=100900|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the women's sports of [[camogie]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]], the term "player of the match" ({{Lang-ga|Laoch na hImeartha}}, "hero of the game") is used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clarechampion.ie/fiona-scoops-player-of-the-match-award/|title=Fiona scoops player of the match award – The Clare Champion|website=clarechampion.ie|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817223801/http://clarechampion.ie/fiona-scoops-player-of-the-match-award/|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickpost.ie/2017/02/14/ul-repeat-ashbourne-supremacy-ucc/ereena-fryday-receives-her-player-of-the-match-award-from-catherine-neary-1222017/|title=Ereena Fryday receives her player of the match award from Catherine Neary 12/2/2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817204538/http://www.limerickpost.ie/2017/02/14/ul-repeat-ashbourne-supremacy-ucc/ereena-fryday-receives-her-player-of-the-match-award-from-catherine-neary-1222017/|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/shine-hails-impact-of-teen-star-odonoghue-36028640.html|title=Shine hails impact of teen star O'Donoghue - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2017/0812/896955-dublin-overcome-plucky-waterford-to-reach-final-four/|title=Dublin overcome plucky Waterford to reach final four|first=Jackie|last=Cahill|date=12 August 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817204024/https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2017/0812/896955-dublin-overcome-plucky-waterford-to-reach-final-four/|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Ice hockey==
{{main article|Three stars (ice hockey)}}
In North American [[ice hockey]], the three players who perform best in the game, often either those who accumulate the most points or outstanding goaltenders, are usually designated the '''Three stars''' of the game: the top-performing player is the ''first star'', and so on. This tradition originated in the 1930s as a promotion for a "Three Star" brand of gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/top10/hockeygimmicks.html#threestars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615075333/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/top10/hockeygimmicks.html|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in international play (and outside North America), the ''three stars'' concept is rarely used. Instead, other leagues may issue awards to one player who performed best in the game.

==Rugby football==
Both codes of rugby, [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]], commonly have man of the match or player of the match awards. In televised or sponsored matches, a commentator or sponsor often decides who gets the award, and it is presented to the winner after the match.

Examples of man of the match awards in professional men's rugby league are the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] in the [[National Rugby League Grand Final]], the [[Karyn Murphy Medal]] in the [[NRL Women's Premiership Grand Final]] the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] in the [[Challenge Cup]] final and the [[Harry Sunderland Trophy]] in the [[Super League Grand Final]].

==College basketball and football==
In [[college basketball]] and [[college football]], the two collegiate sports with the most television coverage in the United States, a top player from each team is usually honoured as "players of the game." These athletes usually cannot collect material prizes due to [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] regulations. Instead, television companies broadcasting the game or corporate sponsors will often make donations to the scholarship funds of each school in the names of the winning players.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In college basketball's Final Four events, a [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] award is given, for performance across both the semi-final and championship game. A Most Outstanding Player award is also given for each of the four regionals, based upon performances in the regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen) and final (Elite Eight).

==Gridiron football==
The [[National Football League]] names an MVP for two prominent games on its schedule:
* A [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award]] has been awarded at each [[Super Bowl]] (the NFL's championship).
* The [[Pro Bowl]] has had an MVP award throughout its existence. The current Pro Bowl MVP format selects one offensive and one defensive player. From 1956–1971, two MVP awards were given, one to a [[skill position]] and the other to a [[lineman (American football)|lineman]] or [[linebacker]]. In 1972, an offensive and defensive MVP were named. From 1973–2012, a single Pro Bowl MVP was chosen.

Individual games typically have an informal player (or players) of the game chosen by the broadcast network covering the game; one prominent example of this phenomenon is the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day#Game MVPs|Turkey Leg Award, All-Iron Award and Galloping Gobbler]] trophies awarded for games held on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].

The [[Canadian Football League]] awards two MVP awards for its championship game, the [[Grey Cup]]. The [[Grey Cup Most Valuable Player]] award is open to all players; the [[Dick Suderman Trophy]] is limited to players with Canadian citizenship or who were raised in Canada since childhood.

A '''pocket schedule''' or '''fixtures card''' is a small card or foldable paper guide which typically fits in a [[wallet]] or [[pocket]]. It is most often used by [[sports club]]s or their [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] for marketing purposes, in addition to displaying the team's scheduled matches.

A typical pocket schedule may contain a full season match schedule for the team, venue information, contact information for purchasing tickets, promotional events, and major sponsor advertising. It may also include radio and television broadcast data.

The '''Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] passed in February 2002, making [[Scotland]] the first part of the [[United Kingdom]] to ban traditional [[fox hunting]] and [[hare coursing]].

==Passage of the Act==
The bill was introduced into the Scottish Parliament in 1999 by [[Mike Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie|Mike Watson]] MSP with support from SNP MSP [[Tricia Marwick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1816168.stm |title=Timeline: Scotland's fox hunting bill |work=BBC News |date=13 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2001, the Scottish Parliament rejected a negative committee report &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.parliament.scot/business/committees/historic/x-rural/reports-01/rar01-10-vol01-02.htm |title=Rural Development Committee. 10th Report 2001.

Volume 1 : Report |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |date=2000 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the Bill from its Rural Development Committee and voted to support the general principles of the Bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-01/sor0919-02.htm#Col2613]&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 February 2002 the Parliament voted by eighty three to thirty six to pass the legislation to ban hunting with dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1819189.stm |title=Fox-hunting ban passed |work=BBC News |date=13 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-02/sor0213-02.htm#Col6513]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]]s decided not to give compensation to those whose livelihoods or businesses might suffer as a result of the ban. The Scottish Countryside Alliance attempted to block introduction of the legislation by taking their case to the [[Court of Session]] in Edinburgh, although their appeal was not successful and in July the Judge recognised the will of the Parliament on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2162766.stm |title=Court backs hunting ban |work=BBC News |date=31 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act came into effect on 1 August 2002.

==Impact of the ban==
An article in [[The Guardian]] on 9 September 2004 reports that of the ten Scottish hunts, nine survived the ban, using the permitted exemption allowing them to use packs of hounds to flush foxes to guns (an exemption which is strongly opposed by people against hunting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/sep/09/scotland.hunting |title=Legal rule helps hounds survive |first=Gerard |last=Seenan |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 September 2004 |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of convictions have taken place under the Act, two for people hunting foxes and ten for hare coursing. The only prosecution of a traditional fox hunt led to a not guilty verdict, but to a clarification of the law, with the sheriff saying that the activity of flushing foxes to guns "will require to be accompanied by realistic and one would expect, effective arrangements for the shooting of pest species. The use of what might be termed "token guns" or what was described by the Crown as paying lip service to the legislation is not available ... as a justification for the continuation of what was referred to in the evidence before me as traditional fox hunting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment?id=6af686a6-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7 |title=Judgement of Sheriff T A K Drummond, Q.C. in the cause Procurator Fiscal, Jedburgh Against Trevor Adams. Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 |publisher=Scottish Courts and Tribunals |date=10 December 2004 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is controversy over the impact on the number of foxes killed by hunts. Hunts say that the number killed by hunts has doubled because shooting is more effective than chasing with dogs.

Since the ban 2 new fox hunts have started in Scotland, the Strathappin and the Dumfriesshire and Stewartry.

==2016 review==
In December 2015, the Scottish Government announced that a review would be held that would look at legislation dealing with hunting with dogs, with the review to be led by [[Iain Bonomy, Lord Bonomy|Lord Bonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35182347 |title=Lord Bonomy to lead review of Scottish fox hunting legislation |work=BBC News |date=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016 a report was published with various recommendations, including making amendments to the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/21/scottish-foxhunting-review-legislation |title=Scottish foxhunting review calls for stronger legislation |first=Libby |last=Brooks |work=The Guardian |date=21 November 2016 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2016, a group of militants armed with [[AK-47]]s attacked a cafe in [[Balad, Iraq]], frequented by supporters of the Spanish football club [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/isis-kill-16-real-madrid-7962654|title=ISIS massacre 16 Real Madrid fans at supporters club|first=Stephen|last=Jones|date=13 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36290195|title=IS militants attack Iraq cafe used by Real Madrid fans - BBC News|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 16 people were killed and at least 30 were wounded.

On 29 May 2016, ISIL gunmen and a suicide bomber attacked another Real Madrid fan club in the same area, killing at least 12 people and injuring around 15. They were attacked while watching the [[2016 UEFA Champions League Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3615485/ISIS-gunmen-kill-12-Real-Madrid-fans-watch-Champions-League-Final-fresh-attack-club-s-supporters-Iraq.html|title=ISIS gunmen kill 12 Real Madrid fans as they watch Champions League|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
During the first attack on May 13, around 50 fans of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] were gathered in a café in [[Balad, Iraq|Balad]], to discuss their arrangements for their favorite team's upcoming football match, when six armed men stormed into the café and started to shoot at the young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/real-madrid-mourns-soccer-fans-killed-attack-cafe-iraq-n574026|title=Real Madrid Mourns Soccer Fans Killed in Attack on Cafe in Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports claim that grenades were also used to attack those gathered to watch the match. Several attackers reportedly fled the cafe and then detonated themselves, one was captured but then burned to death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/13/isil-massacres-16-real-madrid-supporters-in-baghdad-caf/|title=Isil massacres 16 Real Madrid supporters in Iraq café|last=Farmer|first=Ben|date=2016-05-13|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 14 people were killed outright and two more died of their wounds later on. More than 30 people were injured.&lt;ref name="cbssports1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/real-madrid-players-pay-tribute-to-iraq-fan-club-members-killed-by-isis/|title=Real Madrid players pay tribute to Iraq fan club members killed by ISIS|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility==
Survivors of the attack blamed the attack on May 13 on ISIL and its opposition to football.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In its claim of responsibility, ISIL said the attack had targeted [[Shia]] militiamen, making no mention of any connection to Real Madrid.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Some believe that the claim stems from the extremist groups ideology against football, as they believe it is a product of western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/in-iraq-town-real-madrid-fans-gather-in-defiance-of-isil-1.192956|title=In Iraq town, Real Madrid fans gather in defiance of ISIL|work=The National|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

[[Image:RPWlogo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|'''Real Pro Wrestling''''s Logo.]]
'''Real Pro Wrestling''' (also known as '''RPW''' or '''RealPro Wrestling''') was a [[professional]] [[sports league]] of [[wrestling]], similar to the [[amateur wrestling]] found in the [[Olympic Games]] and at the [[collegiate wrestling|college]] and [[scholastic wrestling|high school]] level. The term "real" was meant to emphasize that it was [[professional]] (meaning the wrestlers are paid money) and it was wrestling, but that it was not [[professional wrestling]] in the traditional sense; modern professional wrestling features [[work (professional wrestling)|predetermined outcomes]] and operates under a very different [[Professional wrestling#Rules|set of rules]] from amateur wrestling.

Real Pro Wrestling, Inc was founded in 2002 by former [[Northwestern University]] wrestling teammates Toby Willis and Matt Case. The company was based in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] with branch offices in New York and Virginia. RPW was a television production company and a producer of live events.

The league began operations in March 2005 and consisted of eight teams (see below).  Although the teams had various city and state names, all matches were taped on a soundstage in Nashville and Los Angeles (Los Angeles Center Studios).

According to [https://web.archive.org/web/20050126155145/http://realprowrestling.com/ the official website], "In RPW, classic meets the future as the matches are conducted in a specially designed coliseum which showcases a raised circular mat to facilitate better camera angles and to afford the live audience a better viewing experience. The circular mat allows for 360 degree camera angles and aids in covering the close quarters that wrestlers frequently find themselves in as they maneuver for position." 

Numerous similar projects were announced before RPW, but none had gotten off the ground.  Lanny Bryant, the [[Montana]]-based editor of ''Wrestling USA'' magazine, proposed a similar league in the early 1990s, as one example.

RPW folded in 2007, after two seasons (2004 and 2006-7).  

In the spring of 2013, the Association of Career Wrestlers formed a new series offering competitions with financial incentives for post-collegiate wrestlers called [http://touracw.com Tour ACW].  This new series has a new set of rules building on the RPW rules with an emphasis on scoring.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intermatwrestle.com/articles/11869&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Wrestling style==
The style of wrestling that is used in ''RPW'' is a combination of [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]], [[folkstyle|American Folkstyle]], [[Sumo|sumo wrestling]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling]].  Because of this, wrestlers of many styles competed in the league.  Greco-Roman and Freestyle were the most common wrestling backgrounds in the leagues, due largely to the Olympic experience of the wrestlers in the league.  In fact, the team rosters consists of numerous Olympians and [[NCAA]] champions.

==Rules==
The rules were similar to [[Freestyle wrestling#Scoring|freestyle wrestling]] but were modified to encourage risk and intensity. The goal is to dominate the opponent and pin his shoulders to the mat. This is called a fall. Points are also awarded during the six-minute match for controlling the opponent, placing him in danger, or escaping the opponent's control. If there is no fall, then the wrestler with the most points wins the match. Some of the most noticeable changes were as follows:
# Two 3-minute periods instead of 3 periods totaling 7 minutes
# If a wrestler pushed his opponent out of the ring he would get a point.
# '''The Bonus''' - if a wrestler manages to stay in the center of the mat and stay aggressive, their ''bonus meter'' would go up.  If they got the bonus, they would get to go into a special position in which they couldn't lose any points and could gain points by throwing their opponents.
# '''TV Challenge''' - the coach of each wrestler is allowed once per individual match to challenge a call made by the ''Ref'' using video from multiple video angles.

==Teams==

*Chicago Groove
*Iowa Stalkers
*Minnesota Freeze
*New York Outrage
*Oklahoma Slam
*Pennsylvania Hammer
*Texas Shooters

==League structure==
Despite the existence of eight "franchises" in RPW, all tournaments were conducted in a classic elimination bracket format. No actual [[dual meet]]s were held.

==Television coverage==
In the league's first season, 2005–06, matches were televised on PAX TV (now [[ION Television]]) on Sunday evenings and on [[Fox Sports Net]] affiliates at various times.  [[Rulon Gardner]], one of the most famous figures in amateur wrestling in the [[United States]], was the [[color analyst]].  Veteran Radio and Television Sports Announcer Chip Hoback from Nashville, TN did the Voice Over and Highlights.  

Due to executive reorganizations at both networks, both PAX and FSN pulled the show.  RPW then decided to syndicate coverage of the second season on various [[terrestrial television|broadcast stations]].

In an [http://thewrestlingmall.com/stories/rpw_willis_interview.php interview] with [http://www.thewrestlingmall.com/ The Wrestling Mall] co-founder Toby Willis also revealed that although sponsors and investors were already lined up for Season 2 a few employees had attempted a "take over" of the company which also added to the downfall of the league.  In the same series of articles Mr. Willis stated his wish that wrestling would adopt more of a martial arts mentality to draw in more kids.  Mr. Willis said, "Wrestling desperately needs to rebrand itself as a martial art not just another arbitrary sport. We need to use military terminology and martial art vocabulary. We need to teach it as self defense. So instead of the high school coach walking up to a kid in the hallways of school and asking them to try wrestling, they should ask the kid if he wants to learn self defense. What kid says they want to be defenseless? Then when the kid shows up for practice, the coach has to teach wrestling from a martial arts perspective."

The '''International Association of Red Sports and Gymnastics Associations''', commonly known as '''Red Sport International (RSI)''' or '''Sportintern''' was a [[Comintern]]-supported international sports organization established in July 1921. The RSI was established in an effort to form a rival organization to already existing [[bourgeoisie|"bourgeois"]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] international sporting groups. The RSI was part of a [[physical culture]] movement in [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]] linked to the physical training of young people prior to their enlistment in the military. The RSI held 3 summer games and 1 winter games called "[[Spartakiad]]" in competition with the [[Olympic games]] of the [[International Olympic Committee]] before being dissolved in 1937.

The notion of a separate [[working class]] national athletic federation emerged first in Germany during the decade of the 1890s, when a [[Workers Gymnastics Association]] was established by activists in the [[socialism|socialist]] movement in opposition to the [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[German Gymnastics Society]] ''(Turnen).''&lt;ref name=RK107&gt;James Riordan and Arnd Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century.'' London: Routledge, 1999; pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Other "proletarian" sports organizations emerged soon thereafter in that country, including the Solidarity Worker Cycling Club, the Friends of Nature Rambling Association, the Worker Swimming Association, the Free Sailing Association, and the [[Worker Track and Field Athletics Association]], among others.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; By the time of [[World War I]], the German proletarian sports movement included more than 350,000 participants.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt;

Following the bloodbath of World War I, the German workers' sports movement began to reemerge, with a new competitive orientation beginning to take the place of individualistic club activities.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; The international [[social democracy|social democratic]] movement also experienced a rebirth after its connections had been severed by war. In 1920 the social democrats established an International Association for Sports and Physical Culture, echoing its efforts in the pre-war period.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; This organization was rechristened as the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International]] (SWSI) in 1925.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] the international socialist movement divided into two antagonistic camps, socialist and [[communism|communist]] — a division exacerbated with the establishment of the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) in 1919. Parallel political organizations sprung up in every country and a state of bitter enmity prevailed.

===Establishment===
[[File:Podvoisky 1903.jpg|thumb|right|Nikolai Podvoisky, first head of the Red Sports International, as he appeared as a young man.]]
The idea of a rival Red Sport International (RSI) was the inspiration of [[Nikolai Podvoisky]], who at the [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern]] in the summer of 1920 discussed with a number of delegates from around the world the idea of establishing an organization to coordinate the physical training of youth.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957&gt;E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926: Volume 3, Part 2.'' London: Macmillan, 1964; pg. 957.&lt;/ref&gt; Podvoisky, a military specialist in charge of Soviet Russia's military training organization, believed systematic physical training to be beneficial for the needs of the [[Red Army]] for healthy and fit youth in its ranks.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; An international sports organization was also seen as a potential ideological counterweight to the [[Olympic games]] of the "[[bourgeois]]" [[International Olympic Committee]] as well as the activities of the rival International Association for Sports and Physical Culture of the socialists.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 958.&lt;/ref&gt;

Podvoisky gathered interested delegates who were already in Moscow for the Comintern Congress and the group constituted itself a founding conference for an international sports organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; It is worthy of emphasis that the Comintern did not itself directly found the Red Sport International, the group being established through independent initiative and the Comintern being preoccupied with other affairs.&lt;ref&gt;André Gounot, [http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2001/JSH2801/JSH2801d.pdf "Sport or Political Organization? Structures and Characteristics of the Red Sport International, 1921-1937,"] ''Journal of Sport History,'' vol. 28, no. 1 (Spring 2001), pg. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The group issued a public manifesto declaring the establishment of a Red Sport International and elected a governing Executive Committee, consisting of representatives from Soviet Russia, Germany, [[Czechoslovakia]], France, Sweden, Italy, and [[Alsace-Lorraine]].&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; Podvoisky was elected President of the new organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt;

The establishment of an international sports organization in Soviet Russia in 1921 was not without its utopian elements, since no official Soviet sport organizations existed in famine stricken post-civil war Soviet Russia at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 957-958.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, on the other hand, had a well-developed workers' sport movement at this time.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; Consequently, Sportintern from its outset maintained a strong German flavor and it was there in the city of [[Berlin]] that the 2nd Conference of the organization was held in July 1922.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; The only national "proletarian" sports organization to join the German group at that early date was the [[Czechoslovak Federation of Workers' Gymnastic Leagues]], said to represent 100,000 athletes.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt;

The Comintern moved closer to the fledgling Sportintern in November 1922 when, in conjunction with the [[4th World Congress of the Comintern|4th World Congress]], the governing [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] decided to name a representative to the "independent" proletarian sport organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; The [[Communist International of Youth]] (KIM) did not take action until the meeting of its governing Bureau in Moscow in July 1923, when it issued a general recommendation of support for the Sportintern and the national sports organizations affiliated to it as a useful "proletarian class instrument."&lt;ref name=Carr8-960&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 960.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not, however, delve into the contentious issue of in what manner and to what extent these two international bodies should be related.&lt;ref name=Carr8-960 /&gt;

The governing Executive Committee of Sportintern met in Moscow in February 1923 and decided to establish a satellite bureau of the organization in Berlin, with a view to increasing participation among Western European workers' sports organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 960-961.&lt;/ref&gt; The maneuver proved successful in helping to build the organization, triggering a split of the French Workers Sports Federation later that year and the affiliation of 80% of its membership with the Red Sport International.&lt;ref name=Carr8-961&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 961.&lt;/ref&gt; The RSI's increased place in the public eye motivated the governing body of the rival international socialist sports authority, meeting in [[Zurich]] in August 1923, to discuss issuing an invitation to Sportintern to help organize a joint "Workers' Olympiad" — a proposal which was narrowly defeated, despite indications that a majority of individual members of the socialist organization favored joint participation.&lt;ref name=Carr8-961 /&gt;

===End of autonomy===

In October 1924 the Red Sport International held its 3rd Congress in Moscow.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 963.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the organization decided to enlarge its governing Executive Committee to include four members of the Executive Committee of the Communist International of Youth — an organization which saw the national affiliates of Sportintern as comprised overwhelmingly of young workers and sought to insert its influence in the organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963 /&gt; As the membership of Sportintern was formally "open to all proletarian elements which recognize the class struggle" it was not an explicitly communist organization, a situation which the KIM saw as a significant shortcoming.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963 /&gt;

The RSI was a large and growing organization in this interval, with some 2 million affiliated members in the Soviet Union, joined by others sections in Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, Norway, Italy, Finland, Switzerland, the United States, [[Estonia]], Bulgaria, and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 963-964.&lt;/ref&gt; As the size of the organization grew, so, too, did pressure to bring the organization's [[ideology|ideological]] character under tighter centralized Communist Party control.

Nikolai Podvoisky was himself a voice for such an insertion of such ideological hegemony, declaring in a lengthy speech to the [[5th Enlarged Plenum of the Comintern]], held in the spring of 1925, that Sportintern should henceforth adopt as its motto:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Convert sport and gymnastics into a weapon of the class revolutionary struggle, concentrate the attention of workers and peasants on sport and gymnastics as one of the best instruments, methods, and weapons for their class organization and struggle."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Carr, Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same time the international communist movement moved to further politicize the RSI, efforts were made to make political hay over the refusal of the Socialist Workers' Sport International to conduct joint activities, such as its decision to bar the Red Sport International from participation at the July 1925 "Workers' Olympiad" held in Frankfurt under its auspices.&lt;ref name=Carr8-965&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 965.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this period, 1924 to 1925, that the Red Sport International effectively became an auxiliary of the Communist International.&lt;ref&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This control was effected by the subordinate youth section of the Comintern, the Communist International of Youth, although the Comintern reserved for itself ultimate authority to decide issues of great importance.&lt;ref name=Gounot27&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Comintern was itself in the process of being absorbed as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy in this interval, the RSI likewise gradually lost its ability to function independently as an international entity.&lt;ref name=Gounot27 /&gt;

In the words of French sports historian André Gounot:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...The RSI's dependence on the Comintern was accompanied, almost inevitably, by the Soviet section's dominance within the RSI. The interests of the Soviet Union and Soviet sport were decisive factors in the RSI's decisions and actions — even if, as was frequently the case, they were incompatible with those of European worker sport."&lt;ref name=Gounot27 /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last International Congress of the Red Sport International came in 1928 and was marked by no serious discussion of contemporary sporting issues.&lt;ref name=Gounot28&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the 1928 gathering consisted of a mechanical attempt to apply the Comintern's ultra-radical [[Third Period]] slogan of "Class versus Class" and its corollary theory of [[social fascism]] to world sport — splitting the fissure between the two camps of the European workers' sport movement wider than ever.&lt;ref name=Gounot28 /&gt;

===Social composition===

Membership of the various national sections of the Red Sport International was by no means monolithic. According to the RSI's own study of the issue, members of the organizations were predominantly male, but hailed from a variety of communist, socialist, [[syndicalism|syndicalist]], and [[anarchism|anarchist]] tendencies, including many of whom who were members of no party.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;''Internationaler Arbeitersport: Zeitschrift für Fragen der internationalen revolutionären Arbeitersportbewegung.'' Aug. 1931, pg. 303. Quoted in Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of these were of the working class, also included were white collar employees, students, and government workers.&lt;ref name=IAS /&gt; Membership records of the French section, for example, indicate that approximately 80% of participants were from the working class, with the remaining 20% members of other social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 38, fn. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

No details exist for the exact Communist Party membership of any national section of the RSI, although in the considered opinion of a leading historian on the topic, "it is safe to assume that this group represented a minority of the whole membership of each section."&lt;ref name=Gounot29&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Czechoslovakian federation, thought to include the largest Communist Party contingent from outside the USSR, is believed to have included something in the range of 20 to 30% who were members of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt;

The fact that members of other parties or no parties participated in the national sections of the Red Sport International is testimony to the limited impact that RSI programmatic rhetoric had upon grassroots participants.&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt; It was rather the fun and excitement of training and competition that bound together local groups and their national units more than ideological proclivities.&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt; The difference in perception of the organization between its rank-and-file participants and the Moscow dominated leadership of the organization has led one scholar to conclude that the RSI was a "split organization, living in two universes," bureaucratic in political discourse but remaining well within the less intense social democratic workers' sports tradition at the individual club level.&lt;ref name=Gounot35&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view politics was merely a piece of a broader participatory sports movement.&lt;ref name=Gounot35 /&gt;

===International competitions===

The international workers' sports organizations of the socialist and communist movements did not necessarily object to some of the most noble goals of the International Olympic Committee (IOC),&lt;ref name=RK109&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; but they did each share fundamental reservations about the modern Olympic games that were the inspiration of [[Pierre de Coubertin|Baron Pierre de Coubertin]], a hereditary French nobleman.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Hill, ''Olympic Politics: Athens to Atlanta, 1896-1996.'' Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 1996; pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; First and foremost, the Olympics of the IOC stressed competition between nations — regarded by the radicals as a manifestation of national [[chauvinism]].&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Rather than the accentuation of national rivalry and patriotic feeling, international competition should focus on the actual athletic effort in a setting designed to build the ethic of [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], both the socialists and communists agreed.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt;

The IOC games also were based upon rigid entrance standards, while the international festivals of the worker athletic movement instead attempted to build mass participation through pageantry, artistic and cultural activities, and unifying political presentations.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Moreover, the sort of athletes dominating the IOC games were objectionable to the radicals on the basis of [[social class]], dominated as they were by the privileged children of the rural aristocracy and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Such international competitions should be open to the participation of less privileged national and social groups, without distinction to race or creed, in the view of the radical sports organizations.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt;

Therefore, the Red Sport International and its socialist rival, the organization emerging as the Socialist Workers' Sport International, conducted a series of their own workers' sports festivals in distinction to and competition with the Olympiads of the IOC. Four such events (called Spartakiads in honor of the heroic slave leader, [[Spartacus]]) were sponsored by the RSI. Two of these were held in 1928,  and one each in 1931 and 1937.

While a major national workers' sport festival had already been held in Czechoslovakia in 1921, it was the socialist organization in 1925 that conducted the first pair of Workers' Olympics events — Summer Games in Frankfurt attracting 150,000 spectators and competitors from 19 country, and Winter Games in Schreiberhau (today's [[Szklarska Poręba]], Poland), attended by athletes from 12 countries.&lt;ref name=RK110&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; No national flags or anthems graced the closing or opening ceremonies, replaced instead by universal use of the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] and singing of "[[The Internationale]]."&lt;ref name=RK110 /&gt; "Soviet and other communist athletes were excluded from these games, however, and there was therefore little actual unity of the workers' sports movement for all the universalist pageantry employed.

From the middle 1930s the political line of the world communist movement changed. The so-called [[Popular Front]] against the threat of [[fascism]] rendered cooperation with socialists and others through unified workers' athletic festivals not only a possibility but the tactical order of the day. Plans were laid for a so-called 3rd Workers' Olympiad to be held in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], Spain in June 1936, under joint auspices of the RSI and the SWSI. The time and place proved inauspicious, however, coinciding with outbreak of hostilities in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=RK113&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; This forced postponement of the event, which was rescheduled for the next summer in [[Antwerp]], Belgium.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt;

The 3rd Workers' Olympiad proved to be less successful than previous endeavors, but it still managed to attract 27,000 participating athletes, and put 50,000 people in the stadium for the final day of competition.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt; An estimated 200,000 people turned out for the traditional closing parade through the city.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt;

===Dissolution===

With the Soviet Union becoming immersed in the first months of 1937 in a massive and [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] secret police campaign against perceived underground [[espionage|espionage networks]] remembered as the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]], the Red Sport International was summarily dissolved by the Comintern in April of that year.

{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}
'''Redshirt''', in United States [[college athletics]], is a delay or suspension of an athlete's participation to lengthen his or her period of eligibility. Typically, a student's athletic eligibility in a given sport is four seasons, like the four years of academic classes typically required to earn a [[bachelor's degree]] at an American college or university.  However, in a '''redshirt year''', [[student athlete]]s may attend classes at the college or university, practice with an athletic team, and “suit up” (wear a team uniform) for play – but they may compete in only a limited number of games, (see "[[#Use of status|Use of status]]" section). Using this mechanism, a student athlete has at most five academic years to use the four years of eligibility, thus becoming what is termed a [[Super senior|fifth-year senior]].

The origin of the term ''redshirt'' was likely from [[Warren Alfson]] of the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|University of Nebraska]] who, in 1937, asked to practice but not play and wore a Nebraska red shirt without a number. The term is used as a [[verb]], [[noun]], and [[adjective]]. For example, a coach may choose to redshirt a player who is then referred to as a redshirt, and a redshirt [[freshman]] refers to an athlete in the first year of participation, after a redshirt non-participatory year.

== Reasons==
{{original research|section|date=August 2018}}
Student athletes become redshirts for many reasons. One example is that the student athlete may not be ready to balance the demands of both academic and athletic requirements. Redshirting provides the opportunity, with tutoring, to take some classes and become accustomed to the academic rigors demanded of them. They may also redshirt to undergo a year of practice with a team prior to participating in competition. In American [[college football]], a student athlete may redshirt to work towards increasing size, strength, and stamina; all desirable assets for many positions, as the current and post-redshirt years coincide with the final phases of physical maturity. Players may also redshirt to learn the team playbook, as many college teams run more complex formations and executions in comparison to high school teams.

Athletes may be asked to redshirt if they would have little or no opportunity to play as an academic freshman. This is a common occurrence in many sports where there is already an established upperclassman player in a position, or too much depth at the position the freshman in question plans to play. The coaching staff may also want to use the player as a starter later in his or her career so that they may play for the full four years instead of three.

A special case involves the eligibility of a player who loses the majority of a season to injury, known as a '''medical redshirt'''. A '''hardship waiver''' may be granted to those athletes who sustain a major injury while appearing in less than 30% of team competitions, nor can they have participated after the midpoint of a season. For the purposes of eligibility, players granted such a [[waiver]] are treated as though they did not compete in that season.

On rare occasions, players may be allowed to play in their sixth year of college if they suffered a serious injury that kept them from competing for more than one season. Former [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]] [[quarterback]] [[Jason White (American football)|Jason White]] is perhaps the best known example of this; White had redshirted his first year, then subsequently [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|tore]] the [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] in both knees, forcing him to miss nearly two years of eligible play time. Another recent example is former [[Houston Cougars football|Houston Cougars]] quarterback [[Case Keenum]]; Keenum redshirted his freshman year of 2006, and subsequently tore an ACL three games into the 2010 season, which would have otherwise been his final year of eligibility.

==Terminology==
The term '''redshirt freshman''' indicates an academic [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] who is in his or her first season of athletic participation. A redshirt freshman is distinguished from a true [[Freshman#United States|freshman]]: a student who is in their first year both academically and athletically. A redshirt freshman may have practiced with the team during the prior season. The term '''redshirt sophomore''' is also commonly used to indicate an academic [[Junior (education)|junior]] who is in the second season of athletic participation. After the second athletic year, the term redshirt is rarely used; the terms '''fourth-year junior''' and '''fifth-year [[Senior (education)|senior]]''' are used instead.

In 2016, a new status could be applied to prospective student athletes, dubbed an '''academic redshirt'''. That year, the NCAA started enforcing new, stricter admissions requirements for incoming athletic freshmen. Under these new requirements, a student athlete who meets a school’s own academic admission requirements yet does not meet the NCAA requirement of a 2.3 GPA across four years, may enter school as an academic redshirt.  This student can receive an athletic scholarship and practice with the team, but may not participate in competition.  An academic redshirt does not lose a year of eligibility, and may later take an injury redshirt if needed. Finally, academic redshirts must complete nine academic credit hours in their first semester and may then compete in their second year, free of restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/recruiting/football/story/_/id/7885522/new-incoming-eligibility-standards-create-term |title=New eligibility standards on the way: Toughest initial requirements ever enacted start with Class of 2016 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other colors==
Athletes may also use a "grayshirt" year in which they attend school, but cannot enroll as a full-time student, and do not receive a scholarship for that year.  This means that they are an unofficial member of the team and do not participate in practices, games, or receive [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial assistance]] from their athletic department. Typically, grayshirts are players who are injured right before college and require an entire year to recuperate.  Rather than waste the redshirt, the player can attend school as a part-time regular student and join the team later.  This is also used by players with religious or military obligations that keep them out of school for a full academic year.

"Blueshirt" athletes are those that the [[NCAA]] does not classify as a "recruited student-athlete". They have never made an official visit to the school, met with the school's athletic employees or had more than one phone call with them, or received a scholarship offer. Such athletes are [[walk-on (sports)|walk-on]]s, but can receive scholarships after enrolling; although they are immediately eligible to play, their scholarships count for the school's quota in the following year. The [[New Mexico State Aggies football]] program was the first to blueshirt in the early 2000s; other football programs include [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]].&lt;ref name="mizell20140215"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-state-football-how-deionte-noel-went-from-texas-tech-commitment-to-osu-blueshirt/article/3934197/ | title=How Deionte Noel went from Texas Tech commitment to OSU 'blueshirt' | work=The Oklahoman | date=February 15, 2014 | accessdate=February 16, 2014 | author=Mizell, Gina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of status==

While the redshirt status may be conferred by a coach at the beginning of the year, it is not confirmed until the end of the season, and more specifically, it does not rule a player ineligible in advance to participate in the season. If a player shows great talent, or there are injuries on the team, the coach may remove the redshirt status and allow the player to participate in competition for the remainder of the year.

The first athlete known to extend his eligibility in the modern era of redshirting was [[Warren Alfson]] of the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|University of Nebraska]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{cite news|title=Warren Alfson|url=http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;ATCLID=944901|accessdate=February 4, 2016|publisher=huskers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfson requested that he be allowed to sit out his sophomore season due to the number of experienced players ahead of him. In addition, he had not started college until several years after graduating from high school, and thus felt he needed more preparation.  The year off greatly benefited him; Alfson was All-[[Big Eight Conference|Big Six Conference]] in 1939 and an [[All-American]] [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|guard]] in 1940.

In January 2017, the trade association for college football coaches, the [[American Football Coaches Association]], proposed a change to that sport's eligibility rules that maintains the current model of four years of play in five years, but significantly changes the redshirt rule. Under the proposal, medical redshirts would be eliminated, but redshirt status would not be lost unless a player participated in more than four games in a season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/new-redshirt-proposal-would-allow-athletes-to-play-four-games-regardless-of-injury/ |title=New redshirt proposal would allow athletes to play four games, regardless of injury |first1=Ben |last1=Kercheval |first2=Dennis |last2=Dodd |website=[[CBSSports.com]] |date=January 11, 2017 |accessdate=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal, which was unanimously passed by the AFCA subcommittees for all three NCAA divisions,&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/2017/12/30/college-football-can-benefit-revised-redshirt-rule-tim-sullivan/987732001/ |title=College football can benefit from a revised redshirt rule |first=Tim |last=Sullivan |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]] |location=[[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]] |date=December 31, 2017 |accessdate=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was approved by the NCAA Division I Council in June 2018, taking effect with the 2018 college football season.&lt;ref name=Dellenger&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2018/06/13/ncaa-redshirt-rule-change-eligibility-reaction |title=The NCAA's Redshirt Rule Change Is a Major Win for Both Coaches and Players |first=Ross |last=Dellenger |publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' |date=June 13, 2018 |accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original proposal was to have been retroactive, meaning that players with athletic eligibility remaining who had played in four or fewer games in a given season would have effectively received one extra season of eligibility,&lt;ref name=Sullivan/&gt; but the final passed proposal was not retroactive.&lt;ref name=Dellenger/&gt;

== In professional sports ==
Unofficially, redshirting in professional sports is mostly for medical reasons, mostly done for delaying their debuts. [[Blake Griffin]] won the Rookie of the Year in his second year because his first year was written off with injuries, but had he not declared for the draft, he would have been a college junior. [[Larry Bird]] opted to declare for the draft early in 1978, but decided to stay in college for one year to finish his senior year. [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] was redshirted for two years due to military requirements. [[Jerry Lucas]], however, effectively held out due to contract disputes. All four went on to win Rookie of the Year in their first years of eligibility for the award. In the NFL, quarterbacks cannot be officially redshirted because they are unused backups that never started in their rookie year. It is the same case with other positions, while players can become 'redshirt rookies' for injury reasons, they are not eligible for rookie of the year/month/week honors.

==Etymology==
According to ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' and ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged]]'', the term ''redshirt'' comes from the red [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] commonly worn by such a player in practice [[Line of scrimmage|scrimmage]]s against the regulars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of REDSHIRT|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/redshirt|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rugby socks.jpg|right|thumb|200px]]

'''Rugby socks''' are similar to the long [[socks]] that are worn in other sports such as [[association football|football (soccer)]]. They are intended to be worn pulled up just below the [[knee]] and cover the shins and calves and are designed to be hardwearing.

==Construction==
The foot part of the rugby sock is generally thick but breathable so as to fit snugly into the rugby boot and provide comfort during training and matches. They have padded heel-and-toe constructions with comfortable and absorbent cushioned soles. Rugby socks were traditionally made from cotton. Outer portions are made of tough [[nylon]], with the uppers being made from soft elasticised [[acrylic fiber|acrylic]] or [[polyester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pickyguide.com/sports_and_recreation/rugby_socks_guide.html|title=Guide to Rugby Socks|publisher= pickyguide.com|accessdate=01/06/2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some may use more advanced materials to allow for more comfort and to reduce swelling of the feet or excessive sweating, keeping the feet warm but dry while playing.

==Fit==
Socks should be well fitting. This can help to prevent rubbing and any [[blisters]] that may arise from poor fitting socks.

==Colours==
As part of a kit, the rugby sock will often match the [[away colours|colours]] of the team and may have the team's [[logo#Sports|logo]] stitched onto the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;

==Manufacturers==
[[Canterbury of New Zealand]] is the most popular producer of rugby kit. [[Kooga]] are a very popular supplier, particularly to [[rugby league]] teams.

[[Image:1896 Olympic medal.jpg|frame|right|The [[1896 Olympics|1896 Olympic]] Silver Medal]]

A '''silver medal''' in sports and other similar areas involving competition is a [[medal]] made of, or [[silver plating|plated with]], [[silver]] awarded to the second-place finisher, or [[runner-up]], of contests or competitions such as the [[Olympic Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]], etc. The outright winner receives a [[gold medal]] and the third place a [[bronze medal]]. More generally, silver is traditionally a metal sometimes used for all types of high-quality medals, including artistic ones.

Some governments award military and civilian decorations called Silver Medals. Silver medals can also be awarded by private organizations for achievements in their fields.

== Sports ==
=== Olympic Games ===
{{main|Olympic medal}}
In [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], winners' medals were in fact [[silver]]. The custom of [[gold]]-silver-[[bronze]] for the first three places dates from the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 games]] and has been copied for many other sporting events. [[Mint (coin)|Minting]] the medals is the responsibility of the host city. From [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]]–[[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by [[Florence|Florentine]] artist [[Giuseppe Cassioli]] with text giving the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of an Olympic champion. From [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]–[[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], Cassioli's design (or a slight reworking) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli's design showed a [[Roman amphitheatre]] for what was originally a Greek games, a new obverse design was commissioned for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens 2004]] Games. [[Winter Olympics]] medals have been of more varied design.

=== The Open Championship ===
In [[The Open Championship]] golf tournament, the Silver Medal is an award presented to the lowest scoring [[amateurism|amateur]] player at the tournament.

=== Psychological ===
Silver medalists were known to suffer "self-recrimination and gold medal envy", particularly those who had lost championship games or missed out of the title by a close score, whereas bronze medalists were usually happy just to make the podium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/fivering_circus/2014/02 silver_medal_face_the_saddest_looking_second_place_finishers_in_olympic.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In many sports with an elimination tournament, including those with a [[third place playoff]] (such as Olympic ice hockey, Olympic soccer, [[FIFA World Cup]]), silver is the only medal given to a team that loses, whereas gold and bronze are earned by teams winning their final matches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/2/22/17039802 jocelyne-larocque-removed-silver-medal-hockey-usa]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable athletes such as [[Lothar Matthäus]] ([[1999 UEFA Champions League Final]]) and [[Jocelyne Larocque]] (2018 Olympics) removed their runners-up/silver medals right after receiving them; Larocque was later ordered by the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] official to put her silver medal back on.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/olympics/rules-trump-emotion-as-canadian-womens-hockey-player-ordered-to-wear-silver-medal/article38062105/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/5170424 canadian-takes-off-medal-olympics/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/2/22/17039802 jocelyne-larocque-removed-silver-medal-hockey-usa]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some notable exceptions; for instance [[Elizabeth Manley]] (1988) and [[Paul Wylie]] (1992) were pleased to win silver medals in their respective Olympic figure skating disciplines after not expected to be podium contenders entering the competition.

== Military and government ==

Some countries present military and civilian decorations known as Silver Medals. These include:

*[[Austria]]′s [[Silver Medal for Services to the Republic of Austria]]
*[[Italy]]′s [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]]
*[[South Africa]]′s [[Silver Medal for Merit]]
*The [[Civil Air Patrol]]′s [[Silver Medal of Valor]] in the [[United States]].

== Other awards ==

The [[Zoological Society of London]] awards a [[Silver Medal (Zoological Society of London)|Silver Medal]] "to a Fellow of the Society or any other person for contributions to the understanding and appreciation of zoology, including such activities as public education in natural history, and wildlife conservation."

The [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] awards a Silver Medal "for an outstanding and demonstrated personal contribution to UK engineering, which results in successful market exploitation, by an engineer with less than 22 years in full-time employment or equivalent."

'''Sporting colours''', more often known merely as &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/colour|title=colour Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;''colours'' or ''house-colours'', are awarded to members of a university or school who have excelled in a sport.  Colours are traditionally worn in or on scarves, ties, blazers, gowns, cuff-links, and other items of apparel. The award system gives rise to phrases such as ''an Oxford Blue'', meaning a person who was awarded a [[Oxford Blue|Blue]] by the [[University of Oxford]]. Similarly a [[Cambridge Blue (colour)|Cambridge Blue]] is awarded by the [[University of Cambridge]]. ''Colours are not however, always known as 'a Blue'.''  A 'university sporting blue' is a generic term which stems from the Oxford and Cambridge Blue, but 'Colours' by definition may be any colour, and often reflect the colours associated with the school uniform, crest, or other significant semiotic.

In some award schemes, it is possible to receive a half colour, such as a Half-Blue. Typically, a given institution will award a single colour; for example, Cambridge and Oxford awards are different shades of blue, and the [[University of London]] awards a Purple.

American universities tend to award a [[varsity letter]] rather than a colour.

The system is common in the majority of British  [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep schools]], [[Independent school (UK)|independent schools]] and old schools of Australia, South African and Sri Lanka. Often [[blazer]]s are given to denote pupils who have achieved in a sport. The blazers are often distinct from the standard school blazer though often colours simply take the form of embellished arms or braided cord or ribbon edging on the standard blazer. Ties are also used as a common way of displaying representative ''colours''.

'''Sportsmanship''' is an aspiration or ethos that a [[sport]] or activity will be enjoyed for its own sake, with proper consideration for [[wikt:fairness|fairness]], [[ethics]], [[respect]], and a sense of [[fellow]]ship with one's competitors. A "sore loser" refers to one who does not take defeat well, whereas a "good sport" means being a "good winner" as well as being a "good loser"&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Joel Fish and Susan Magee, ''101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent'', p. 168. Fireside, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lacey, [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html "It takes a bad loser to become a good winner."] ''The Guardian'', November 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (someone who shows courtesy towards another in a sports game).

== Analysis ==

Sportsmanship can be conceptualized as an enduring and relatively stable characteristic or disposition such that individuals differ in the way they are generally expected to behave in sports situations. In general, sportsmanship refers to virtues such as fairness, self-control, courage, and persistence,&lt;ref name="Shields &amp; Bredemeier, 1995"&gt;Shields &amp; Bredemeier, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been associated with interpersonal concepts of treating others and being treated fairly, maintaining self-control if dealing with others, and respect for both authority and opponents. Sportsmanship is also looked at as being the way one 
reacts to a sport/game/player.

The four elements of sportsmanship are often shown being good form, the will to win, equity and fairness. All four elements are critical and a balance must be found among all four for true sportsmanship to be illustrated.&lt;ref name="abad" /&gt; These elements may also cause conflict, as a person may desire to win more than play in equity and fairness and thus resulting in a clash within the aspects of sportsmanship. This will cause problems as the person believes they are being a good sportsman, but they are defeating the purpose of this idea as they are ignoring two key components of being sportsman like. When athletes become too self-centred, the idea of sportsmanship is dismissed.&lt;ref name="ahola"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07303084.2006.10597902|title =Promoting Sportsmanship in Youth Sports|last1 = Goldstein |first1=Jay|last2=Iso-Ahola |first2 = Seppo|date = 2006|journal =Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|doi = 10.1080/07303084.2006.10597902|issue = 7|volume = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's sporting culture, in particular the base of elite sport, places great importance on the idea of competition and winning and thus sportsmanship takes a back seat as a result.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt; In most, if not all sports, sportsmen at the elite level make the standards on sportsmanship and no matter whether they like it or not, they are seen as leaders and role models in society.&lt;ref name="clifford"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ken |last=Clifford |journal=Newcastle Herald |date=2013 |title=Sport's also about sportsmanship |volume=1 |issue=33 |url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Sport%27s+also+about+sportsmanship&amp;rft.jtitle=Newcastle+Herald&amp;rft.au=KEN+CLIFFORD&amp;rft.date=2013-12-10&amp;rft.pub=Fairfax+Digital&amp;rft.issn=0727-9825&amp;rft.spage=33&amp;rft.externalDocID=3149922301&amp;paramdict=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since every sport is rule driven, the most common offence of bad sportsmanship is the act of cheating or breaking the rules to gain an unfair advantage this is called [[unsportsmanlike conduct]].&lt;ref name="feez"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00948705.1986.9714436|title = Sportsmanship|last = Feezell|first = Randolph|date = 1986|journal = Journal of the Philosophy of Sport|doi = 10.1080/00948705.1986.9714436|issue = 1|volume = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A competitor who exhibits poor sportsmanship after losing a game or contest is often called a "sore loser", while a competitor who exhibits poor sportsmanship after winning is typically called a "bad winner". Sore loser behavior includes blaming others for the loss, not accepting responsibility for personal actions that contributed to the defeat, reacting to the loss in an immature or improper fashion, [[rationalization (psychology)|making excuses]] for the defeat, and citing unfavorable conditions or other petty issues as reasons for the defeat.&lt;ref&gt;"MJD", [https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/If-he-s-going-to-lose-Bill-Belichick-would-rath?urn=nfl,64971 "If he's going to lose, Bill Belichick would rather be elsewhere"]. Yahoo Sports, February 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E-releases, [http://www.ereleases.com/prfuel/super-winners-and-losers/ "Super Winners and Losers"] ("The Patriots' coach was eviscerated by sports pundits for leaving the field before the game was actually finished.")&lt;/ref&gt; A bad winner acts in a shallow fashion after his or her victory, such as by gloating about his or her win, rubbing the win in the face(s) of the opponent(s), and lowering the opponent(s)'s [[self-esteem]] by constantly reminding the opponent(s) of "poor" performance in comparison (even if the opponent(s) competed well). Not showing respect to the other team is considered to being a bad sportsman and could lead to demoralising effects; as Leslie Howe describes: "If a pitcher in baseball decides to pitch not to his maximum ability suggest that the batter is not at an adequate level, [it] could lead to the batter to have low self-confidence or worth."&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00948705.2004.9714661|title =Gamesmanship|last = Howe|first = Leslie|date = 2008|journal = Journal of the Philosophy of Sport|doi = 10.1080/00948705.2004.9714661|issue = 2|volume = 31 |pp=212–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six different categories relating to sportsmanship: the elements of sports, the elements of sportsmanship, clarifications, conflicts, balance and irreducibility.&lt;ref name="abad" /&gt; All six of these characterize a person with good sportsmanship. Even though there is some affinity between some of the categories, they are distinct elements.&lt;ref name="abad"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/full/10.1080/17511320903365227#abstract|title = Sportsmanship|last = Abad|first = Diana|date = 2010|journal = Sport, Ethics and Philosophy|doi = 10.1080/17511320903365227|issue = 1|volume = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In essence, play has for its directed and immediate end joy, pleasure, and delights and which is dominated by a spirit of moderation and generosity. Athletics, on the other hand, is essentially a competitive activity, which has for its end victory in the contest and which is characterized of dedication, sacrifice and intensity." (Feelezz, 1896, pp.&amp;nbsp;3) Hence, the virtues of a player are radically different from the virtues of an athlete. (Feelezz, 1896, pp.&amp;nbsp;3). When talking about misunderstanding sportsmanship, Rudd and Stoll (2013) provide an example from 1995, a U.S. high school athletic league banned the post-game handshake that was a part of sports such as football and basketball. The handshaking was banned because of fights that were ensuing after the handshake.(pp.&amp;nbsp;41) Most players are influenced by the leaders around them such as coaches and older players, ''if there are coaches and administrators who don't understand sportsmanship, then what about the players?''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/pdf/10.1080/07303084.1998.10605629|title = Understanding Sportsmanship|last = Rudd; Stoll|first = Andrew; Sharon K|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|p=41|doi = 10.1080/07303084.1998.10605629|volume = 69|issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Sportmanship sculpture.jpg|thumb|A moment of sportmanship when [[John Landy]] helped [[Ron Clarke]] get up after he had fallen.]]

There are various ways that sportsmanship is practiced in different sports. Being a good sport often includes treating others as you would also like to be treated, cheer for good plays (even if it is made by the opposition), accept responsibility for your mistakes, and keep your perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachel|first1=Beverly|title=Scoring big: It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play|journal=Current Health 2, a Weekly Reader Publication|date=2009|volume=35|issue=7|pages=16–20|url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Scoring+big%3A+it%27s+not+whether+you+win+or+lose%2C+it%27s+how+you+play&amp;rft.jtitle=Current+Health+2%2C+a+Weekly+Reader+publication&amp;rft.au=Bachel%2C+Beverly&amp;rft.date=2009-03-01&amp;rft.pub=Weekly+Reader+Corp&amp;rft.issn=0163-156X&amp;rft.volume=35&amp;rft.issue=7&amp;rft.spage=16&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=194620867&amp;paramdict=en-US|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of treating others how you would like to be treated would include being respectful and polite to other team members and the opposition because in return you would also like to be treated the same way.&lt;ref name="clifford" /&gt; Cheer for good plays could include if in netball a player of the opposition made a good lead for the ball, which then resulted in a goal, everyone would either clap or make a supportive comment to acknowledge that what the player did was very well done. To accept responsibility for your mistakes will entail not placing the blame on other people.&lt;ref name="feez" /&gt;

Some popular examples of good sportsmanship include shaking hands, help an opponent who may have fallen over, encourage everyone, cheer, clap or hi-five, and be respectful to everyone including teammates, the opposition, parents and officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Josephson|first1=Michael|title=Ethics and sportsmanship (part I)|url=https://charactercounts.org/sports/Olympic/olympic-report-ethicssportsmanship.htm|website=Pursuing Victory with Honor|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly it is often encouraged and said regarding sportsmanship that "It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game."&lt;ref name="feez" /&gt;

Sportsmanship can be manifested in different ways depending on the game itself or the culture of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/concepts-of-sportsmanship-vary-across-cultures|title=Concepts of Sportsmanship Vary Across Cultures|first=Dustin|last=Petzold|date=|website=bigthink.com|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing factors ==

Sportsmanship can be affected by a few contributing factors such as the players' values and attitudes towards the sport and also the professional role models that are shown to the public. Role models in sport are expected to act in a moral and respectful way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Carwyn|title=Drunken role models: Rescuing our sporting exemplars|journal=Sport, Ethics and Philosophy|date=2011|volume=5|issue=4|pages=414–432|doi=10.1080/17511321.2011.561254}}&lt;/ref&gt; When elite sporting role models do not encourage sportsmanship this can also encourage people in society to act in similar ways to the athletes that they look up to and idolize. For example, if an individual looked up to an athlete who was drinking excessively, they may see this as acceptable behavior.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt; The direct correlation between sportsmanship and leadership is also considered to be another contributing factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=M. S.|title=Creating an environment for sportsmanship outcomes: A systems perspective|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=2006|volume=77|issue=7|pages=1–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a positive environment in your sporting team will therefore create good sportsmanship from the individuals. Having a positive leadership by the captains, coaches and supporters would then encourage a positive sporting environment.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt;

'''Springbok colours''' is the name given to green and gold blazers awarded to members of the [[South Africa national rugby union team]]. They were historically awarded to teams and individuals representing [[South Africa]] in international competition of any sport, following their creation in 1906. With the arrival of South Africa's new post-apartheid government in 1994, the name ''Springbok'' was abandoned by the various control boards since they felt that the term had been abused by the previous [[apartheid]] governments, and stigmatised by the anti-apartheid movement.&lt;ref name=bok /&gt; An exception was made in the case of the national rugby union team, who have retained the practice of awarding colours.

== History ==
The first Springbok colours were created in 1906 during the [[1906–07 South Africa rugby union tour]] of the Northern Hemisphere as none had been provided for them and the captain [[Paul Roos (rugby player)|Paul Roos]] decided that the team need to create their own emblem and nickname to prevent the British press creating one for them. Using the guidelines that the director of the [[South African Rugby Board]] (SARB) had given for the playing kit of myrtle green jerseys and a gold collar, Roos instructed that a green blazer with gold [[Piping (sewing)|piping]] and a Springbok emblem on the breast pocket would be made for the team in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/south_africa.html |title=South Africa |publisher=Rugby Football History |date= |accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, not many colours were made as they were not standard issue at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/3691122.stm |title=Rare rugby blazer put up for sale |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-09-26 |accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on they became standard issue for all sportsmen representing South Africa internationally but primarily was used by rugby union as the creators.&lt;ref name=rr /&gt;

[[File:1937 span 011.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The South Africa rugby union team wearing Springbok colours in 1937]]
The first dispute over Springbok colours came from the rise of [[rugby league in South Africa]] in the 1950s. SARB felt it was their duty as members of the [[World Rugby|International Rugby Football Board]] to defend amateur rugby union against professional rugby league after several Springboks had defected to rugby league.&lt;ref name=thir /&gt; In 1959, the SARB declared that all players that represented South Africa in rugby union had to sign a declaration they would not turn professional for two years. Any player who refused this was obliged to return his Springbok colours and was not permitted to purchase a replacement.&lt;ref name=thir&gt;Conellisen, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the SARB took the step of copyrighting the Springbok emblem and Springbok colours as a badge under the [[Heraldry Act]]&lt;ref name=cr&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://blogs.sun.ac.za/iplaw/files/2011/12/SPORT-AS-A-BRAND-AND-ITS-LEGAL-PROTECTION-IN-SOUTH-AFRICA.pdf |title=Sport as a brand and its legal protection in South Africa |publisher=Stellenbosch University |date= |accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to pre-empt any other sporting body copyrighting it. The board initially declared, it was happy to share the Springbok colours providing that they were only awarded to white amateur sportspeople representing South Africa internationally.&lt;ref name=sarb&gt;Conellisen, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; It was also an attempt to try and stop the [[South Africa national rugby league team]] from using the colours, though [[South African Rugby League|Rugby League South Africa]] circumvented this by developing their own version of the Springbok colours.&lt;ref name=sarb /&gt; Later legislation in 1971 was passed in order to enforce [[apartheid]] so that only white South Africans could be awarded Springbok colours&lt;ref name=bok&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-187035625.html |title=The time when it was right to ban the Springbok has long passed |work=The Mercury |date= |accessdate=2016-05-11}} {{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this later extended to those deemed as "[[honorary whites]]".&lt;ref name=Chinese /&gt; This came after three black Africans were awarded Springbok colours for competing in the World Paraplegic Games. Later as a result of the legislation, Glen Popham was not awarded Springbok colours following winning a gold medal in [[Karate]] in the 1969 [[South African Games]] alongside his white team, as his race was officially classified as [[Coloured]] which the [[South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee|South African National Olympic Committee]] were not aware of prior.&lt;ref name=rr&gt;{{cite book | first=Muriel |last=Horell | title =A Survey of Race Relations in South Africa |publisher = University of California Press | edition =   | year = 1972 | isbn = 0869820109 |page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; As non-whites were not eligible to be selected for South African national sports teams, the Springbok colours came to be viewed as a symbol of white supremacy in apartheid South Africa because they were only awarded to white sportspeople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Maurice |last=Hommel | title =Conversations and Soliloquies: A Window on South Africa |publisher = iUniverse | edition =   | year = 2012 | isbn = 1462084079 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post apartheid ==
Following the repeal of apartheid legislation, Springbok colours started to be issued to non-whites.&lt;ref name=Chinese&gt;{{cite book | first =Melanie| last =Yap  | title =Colour, Confusion and Concessions: The History of the Chinese in South Africa | publisher = Hong Kong University Press | edition =   | year = 1996 | isbn = 9622094244 | page = 394}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, following the election of [[Nelson Mandela]] and the [[African National Congress]], the National Colours Board was set up to control the distribution of Springbok colours.&lt;ref name=cr /&gt; Despite this, the majority of South Africa's sporting organisations stopped awarding Springbok colours, following the replacement of the Springbok by the [[Protea]] by government demand. The only sporting body in South Africa that was allowed to retain Springbok colours was the [[South African Rugby Union]] as an act of conciliation towards the white minority who made up the majority of the national rugby union team.&lt;ref name=bok /&gt;

In 2008, the South African Sports Minister claimed under the National Sport and Recreation Act, 1998, that the Springbok colours copyright had been transferred to the government and the SARU had been issuing it illegally and requested they cease using it. However, legal writers stated that the South African government's claim had expired in 2007 while SARU's copyright still was valid and pursuant to the case of ''In re: Certification of the Constitution of the RSA 1996'', if the government tried to stop the SARU issuing Springbok colours, then the government would be liable to pay millions of [[South African Rand|Rands]] in compensation.&lt;ref name=cr /&gt; In 2013, as part of their "Yesterday's Heroes" programme, SARU retrospectively awarded Springbok colours to all non-whites who had played for a South African national team such as the black [[SAARB Leopards (rugby team)|SAARB Leopards]] and the Coloured [[Proteas (rugby union)|Proteas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/goolams-long-wait-finally-over-1134437 |title=Goolam's long wait finally over |work=Manchester Evening News |date= |accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Springbok colours are only awarded to South Africans. Australian [[Eddie Jones (rugby union)|Eddie Jones]], who worked as a technical advisor to South Africa for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], was not allowed Springbok colours as a non-South African&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keohane |first=Mark |url=http://www.iol.co.za/sport/thanks-eddie-but-you-dont-get-a-bok-blazer-577774 |title=Thanks Eddie, but you don't get a Bok blazer |publisher=IOL |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was obliged to wear a South Africa tracksuit when pitchside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolford |first=Anthony |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/who-eddie-jones-how-good-10467741 |title=Who is Eddie Jones?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5527">In [[professional sport|professional]] [[team sport]]s, '''tapping up''' ([[British English]]) or '''tampering''' ([[American English]]) is an attempt to persuade a player contracted to one team to transfer to another team, without the knowledge or permission of the player's current team. This kind of approach is often made through the player's [[sports agent|agent]].  It is expressly forbidden in many professional [[league (sports)|league]]s, but is not illegal.

==In English football==
{{Original research|date=August 2008}}

{{Main|2009 English football tapping up controversy}}

A milder form of "tapping up" involves a [[manager (football)|manager]]'s letting his admiration for a player at another club become known, perhaps by hinting at his interest while working as a [[pundit (expert)|pundit]] during the broadcast of a game in which the player is taking part, "he's the sort of player any manager would be very keen to sign", or by lavishing praise in programme notes when the two teams meet. There are also the "source close to the manager"-type newspaper rumours which in many case originate within the club and are intended to flag an interest while retaining [[plausible deniability]] against charges of tapping up. Most ex-players candidly admit that tapping up has gone on in football for decades. [[Nottingham Forest]] manager [[Brian Clough]] later said, "we tapped more players than the [[Severn Trent|Severn-Trent water board]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2365552/Cloughs-cockiness-and-principles-live-on.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Clough's cockiness and principles live on | first=David | last=Miller | date=2005-09-20 | accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notorious examples of tapping up in the [[Premier League]] include [[Dwight Yorke]], [[Jermain Defoe]] and [[Ashley Cole]]. In these cases, the incidents soured the relationship between the player and his original club. Cole was found guilty and fined £100,000 by the Premier League on 2 June 2005 for a meeting in a hotel in January 2005 between himself, the Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]], Chelsea chief executive, [[Peter Kenyon]], and his agent [[Jonathan Barnett (sports agent)|Jonathan Barnett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/5382332.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cole's agent handed FA suspension | date=2006-09-26 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chelsea were again at the centre of a controversy in 2009, when the club was found guilty of inducing [[Gaël Kakuta]] to break his contract with French team [[RC Lens]] in 2007. As punishment, they were banned by [[FIFA]] from registering new players for two [[transfer window]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/8236187.stm|title=Angry Chelsea hit by signings ban |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2009-09-03|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea appealed to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]], who subsequently lifted the sanctions on the club and the player after ruling that Kakuta did not have a valid contract with Lens, and therefore could not have breached it. Chelsea's transfer ban was suspended later in the same year, and was lifted in February 2010.&lt;ref name=Chels2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1955578|title=Statement on Kakuta Decision|publisher=Chelsea FC|date=4 February 2010|accessdate=25 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103092129/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1955578|archivedate=3 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Redknapp]], manager of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at that time, has said that activity which verges upon 'tapping-up' regularly occurs in deals between Premier League clubs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2009/08/18/spurs-boss-redknapp-dismisses-tapping-up-rules-351827/|title=Redknapp dismisses 'tapping up' rules|publisher=''Metro''|work=[[The Press Association]]|date=2009-08-18|accessdate=2014-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scott Minto]], a pundit for [[Sky Sports]], said that the ban was "extremely harsh" because of the frequency of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11668_5536089,00.html|title=Can't turn the tap off|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=2009-09-03|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been other cases where clubs have received transfer window bans for tapping-up; notably, [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] over [[Philippe Mexès]], and [[FC Sion]] over [[Essam El-Hadary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/03/chelsea-transfer-ban|title=Chelsea's transfer ban: four other examples from football|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2009-09-03|accessdate=2009-09-03 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Binks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of tapping up is portrayed in the 1953 British film ''[[The Great Game (1953 film)|The Great Game]]''.

Kaepernick and his 49ers teammate [[Eric Reid (American football)|Eric Reid]] say they choose to kneel during the anthem to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality. "After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from [[Nate Boyer]], a retired [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] and former NFL player, we came to the conclusion that we should kneel, rather than sit, ... during the anthem as a peaceful protest," said Reid. "We chose to kneel because it's a [[respect]]ful gesture.

But my dad is also out of the Army, and he drives trucks all over the country, and he's a black man everywhere he goes, and sometimes he has racial incidents still today. That doesn't protect him, just because he served our country. And I think that's important."&lt;ref&gt;

In May 2018 on an in interview President Donald Trump went as far to say "You have to stand proudly for the national anthem, or you shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there.

Trump applauded the new policy that NFL players must either stand for the anthem or stay back in the locker room, but felt that this policy was not strict enough. &lt;ref name="nbcnews.com"/&gt; Trump even wanted players to not be able to express political views even when off the field. &lt;ref name="nbcnews.com"/&gt;

He explained his decision to switch was an attempt to show more respect to former and current U.S. military members while still protesting during the anthem.

===2018 preseason===
On May 23, 2018, NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] and all NFL team owners except for two owners that abstained from voting in a show of hand voting process, approved a new policy requiring all players to stand during the national anthem or be given the option to stay in the locker room during the national anthem.

In disagreement with the policy, several players on the Super Bowl champion [[Philadelphia Eagles]] indicated they would decline an invitation from Trump to visit the [[White House]] on June 5, leading the President to rescind the offer the day before the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald Trump calls off Eagles' White House visit over national anthem dispute|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/donald-trump-calls-off-eagles-white-house-visit-players-decline-invitation-232323202.html|publisher=Oath Inc.

On July 19, the NFL and the players association issued a joint statement that "no rules relating to the anthem will be issued for the next several weeks."

[[Seattle Reign FC]] and [[United States women's national soccer team|U.S. women's national soccer team]] player [[Megan Rapinoe]] knelt during the national anthem in a game on September 5, 2016, explaining that her decision was a "nod to Kaepernick and everything that he's standing for right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/05/sport/megan-rapinoe-colin-kaepernick-anthem-kneel/index.html|title=Megan Rapinoe takes knee in solidarity with Kaepernick|last=McKirdy|first=Euan|date=September 5, 2016|publisher=CNN|access-date=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent match at the [[Washington Spirit]], Spirit owner Bill Lynch – anticipating Rapinoe's protest – moved the national anthem's performance without warning or notice to occur before the players' appearances on the pitch.

[[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) have released a statement in September 2017 regarding any potential protests "The march of players, officials and children into our stadiums and singing of the anthem has been a pre-match tradition since our first game in 1996.

The protest had supporters outside the U.S. as well: In an October 2017 match against [[Schalke 04]], players and staff of German football club [[Hertha BSC]] took the knee in solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2017/10/14/hertha-berlin-kneel-german-national-anthem-protest|title=Hertha Berlin players take knee during German anthem|last=Rapaport|first=Daniel|date=October 14, 2017|work=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herta BSC has a few American players on their roster.

In September 2016, President [[Barack Obama]] stated that Kaepernick was "exercising his constitutional right" to protest. He went on: "I don't doubt his sincerity. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about. If nothing else, he's generated more conversation about issues that have to be talked about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hjelmgaard|first1=Kim|title=24095 924 494 Obama defends Kaepernick's national anthem protest|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2016/09/05/obama-defends-kaepernicks-national-anthem-protest/89879478/|work=USA Today|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] criticized the protest as "dumb and disrespectful", stating that athletes have the right to protest "if they want to be stupid".

'''Weighted clothing''' is clothing that adds weight to various parts of the body, usually as part of [[Strength training|resistance training]]. The effect is achieved through attaching weighted pieces to the body (or to other garments) which leave the hands free to grasp objects. Unlike with held weights or machines, weighted clothing can leave users more able to do a variety of movements and manual labour. In some cases certain weighted clothing can be worn under normal [[clothing]], to disguise its use to allow exercise in casual environments.

The use of weighted clothing is a form of resistance training, generally a kind of [[weight training]]. In addition to the greater effect of gravity on the person, it also adds resistance during ballistic movements, due to more force needed to overcome the inertia of heavier masses, as well as a greater momentum that needs deceleration at the end of the movement to avoid injury. The method may increase muscle mass or lose weight; however, there have been concerns about the safety of some uses of weights, such as wrist and ankle weights. It is normally done in the form of small weights, attached to increase endurance when performed in long repetitive events, such as running, swimming, punching, kicking or jumping. Heavier weighted clothing can also be used for slow, controlled movements, and as a way to add resistance to body-weight exercises.

==Core==

===Neck===
Sometimes, weights are draped over or tied to the neck. As weighted vests often have weight placed here, they effectively have the same benefits. Advantages to neck weights and more upper-body-centric weighted vests is that they allow easier spinal flexion (contracting abdominals or stretching extensor spinae) and extension (contracting extensor spinae, stretching abdominals). This makes them prime for adding resistance to these movements, and takes out the requirement of using the arms to anchor weight to the upper body to add resistance.

===Torso===

====Vests====
The purpose of using a weight vest is to add extra weight for body-weight exercises and to create an overload effect for walking, distance running or speed, agility and quickness (SAQ) drills.  Research demonstrates that using an overload during sprinting or speed drills requires lower-body muscles to generate more force against the ground which could lead to gains in strength and power and ultimately faster acceleration during running.  Weight vests are used by athletes to increase strength and efficiency during speed, power and agility drills; producing a unique training effect that is unavailable with traditional free weight training equipment. They can also be used by casual walkers or runners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyper Vest® PRO weight vest works|url=https://www.acefitness.org/reviews/review-list.aspx|publisher=Editor's Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight vests are becoming a very popular form of adding weight around the entire core to, for the most part, simulate the fat storage areas of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chasse|first=Andy|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/24120-benefits-weighted-vests/|title=Benefits from Weighted Vests|publisher=Livestrong|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is very useful for adding weight to limb-centric movements, and for handling great weights. Due to the large area available, it can also handle more weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.besthealthgear.com|title=BestHealthGear.com - Providing Honest Fitness Equipment Reviews|website=BestHealthGear.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; If well-affixed, it is the safest most natural means of mimicking added body mass without unbalancing the body's muscles. They can be used to add resistance to almost any whole-body movement. A study has shown that using a weighted vest can increase the metabolic costs, relative exercise intensity, and loading of the skeletal system during walking.&lt;ref&gt;The effect of weighted vest walking on metabolic responses and ground reaction f...&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem with some weighted vests is that due to tightness in the shoulder girdle, in movements like pull-ups or high range of motion pushups, the vest can be shearing, either damaging the person or in some cases, the vest itself being slowly torn away. This can also be seen as an advantage, however, in those who wish to limit their range of motion due to lack of strength or flexibility, to avoid injury. The limitations of front and back bending of the core is for example, contrasted by ergonomic construction to encourage good posture in modern weighted vests such as the x-vest, hyper vest or game-breakers pro suit. Another problem with some weighted vests is the constriction of breathing and overheating due to the use of heavy, non-breathing materials such as nylon and neoprene. The latest developments in weighted vest products offer comfortable weight vests with cool wicking fabric that allow full range and direction of movement, chest expansion for breathing, open sides connected with lacing, and low profile design allowing a vest to be worn under clothing or football pads, unlike traditional vests made of nylon or neoprene.

===Backpacks===
Using weighted backpacks is a very common form of weight. It is like clothing when properly affixed, although some backpacks require tension in the pectorals or being held on the arms to keep from sliding off if not properly affixed.

Simpler to put on and remove than weighted vests, it simulates how humans carry things, like young or injured comrades or camping supplies, rather than the storage of body fat. For most exercises, like pull-ups or pushups, it is just as effective as a weighted vest in adding resistance from gravity. Limitations in flexibility forward or backward or to the side in arms may or may not be present depending on the pack as they vary greatly.

A standard form of military and fire fighter training is not only be able to carry a backpack, but to march and run with one loaded down with a concrete "marble". Part of SWAT training is to be able to do pull-ups wearing a heavy pack.

===Hip drags===
Hip drags are not so much useful due to their weight, but are small attachments which add drag during many movements in swimming by making the swimmer less streamlined. This added resistance allows the swimmer to build up more force, and swim faster when they are later removed.

===Belts===
Different from dip belts, weighted belts are affixed to the body and do not use suspended weights or swing. They are useful, like weighted vests, in having weight close to the core and mimic very well the additional weight one might have from body fat stored in the abdomen and lower back. The advantage over other core weights is the flexibility that is freed up by not constraining the upper body, the disadvantage being limited core flexion. There tends to be some overlap in certain larger weighted vests and the region covered by certain larger weighted belts near the upper abdominal muscles.

====Dip belts====
[[Image:DipBelt.jpg|thumb|A dip belt can be used to add weight to exercises]]
Dip belts are a very commonly used form of weight training. They are named for the dip exercise, one of the few and best known methods of adding resistance to it. It is also commonly used to add resistant to pull-ups and knee/leg raises in hanging from a pull-up bar. Unlike most weighted clothing, dip belts are not affixed to the body, but rather the weight suspends semi-secured to the usually leather belt, suspending from the back and generally kept up by resting on the gluteus.

As such, it is only useful in strength training movements, and not for dynamic movements, making it only pseudo-clothing. Dip belts are also used for added weight in squatting exercises, for people who want to work their quadriceps muscles with more weight without compressing their spine or straining their [[erector spinae|back muscles]] or hands. Due to the dangling length, these belt squats are usually done elevated, where the suspended weight will dip much lower than the feet, allowing a sufficient range of motion. How far below the feet it goes can determine the range of motion of the exercise, similar to limitations like squatting in a power rack for working heavy resistance near the top of the movement.

==Upper body==

===Upper-arm===
Upper arm weights are another method of adding weight close to the core beyond that of a weighted vest, or to add resistance to the shoulders with less danger to the elbows than wrist weights or the added biceps/triceps strain. A problem with these is similar to thigh weights in that those with large biceps, triceps, or fat around the region may experience tightness, and the tightness required can be straining in exercises that involve elbow extension, making it more suitable for leg and core movements.

===Wrist===
Wrist weights are used in place of holding dumbbells (or to supplement them) or other hand-held weights as a way of adding leveraged resistance to the movement of the arms. Like ankle weights, practicing explosive movements is not advised, and if done, should be approached gradually, with acceleration before full extension, and also reduced gradually, to avoid over-extension injuries. Wrist weights are advantageous in that they do not require a strong grip or wrist extension for added arm resistance like held hand weights do. A disadvantage is that the tightness required to stop movements could possibly increase the damages in those with [[carpal tunnel syndrome]].

===Gloves===
Weighted gloves serve a similar purpose to wrist weights. Generally, they are worn to prepare for boxing in some fashion. Their advantage, beyond a slight increase in distance for leverage, is the lack of strain on the wrist from having weight isolated there, and better simulating sparring gloves. They are generally not very heavy, and since they limit the grip anyway, unless being used to practice specific striking fists, light dumbbells are more common.

==Lower body==

===Thighs===
Thigh weights are the most reasonable form of resistance. The location of the mass more readily duplicates the natural fat-storage mechanism of the human body and being closer to the core. In leg raise exercises, it allows more activation of the hip flexors (and abdominals) without putting more strain on the [[quadriceps muscles]] for extension, making it good for sports-specific training on movements like knees and jumping. The greater area and safe location allow it to handle much more weight. For those with wide thighs, such as bodybuilders with large quadriceps, or people with large amounts of fat stores on the inner thigh, it may cause chafing. If worn on both legs, however, the chafing would be between the weights and only damage them, possibly only chafing with a lack of tightness.

Thigh weights are not ideal for movements involving quadriceps use, as they require tightness which may limit the use of the muscle and blood flow to the legs. For such movements, weights worn higher on the body or free weights are more ideal.

===Ankles===
Ankle weights are a commonly found weight used in many activities. Further from the core, fixated above the ankle around the lower shin and Achilles tendon, due to leverage much less weight is needed to increase the forces on the body.

As they are attached to a region with a far smaller diameter than the thigh, there is not room for much weight without greatly changing the effective width of the lower leg. An advantage over thigh weights is that they are not attached to any major muscle or fat storage region, so tightness is not a factor and it can be used in almost any exercise.

Being above the ankle, movements incorporating the calf muscles such as calf raises can benefit from ankle weights.

Ankle weights are useful in adding weight to pull-ups and dips, especially when incorporating leg raises into the movements. They are also useful in slow kicking [[kata]]s, and static-[[active stretching]] of the legs when balancing on one leg, or suspended in the air.

Light ankle weights have a history of use resistance for kicking in swimming, and of forward flexion in kicking, walking, jogging, and sprinting exercises. Concern has been expressed regarding this type of training. It may put too much stress on the joints, similar to the shearing forces found in [[leg extension]] and [[leg curl]] exercises.

Practicing weighted movements at high speeds also causes the nervous system to fire at larger intensities. If an individual loses the weight without being trained to adapt to the transition, he may overexert himself without checking at the end of the movement and overextend a [[tendon]]. This is more of a risk when people fully extend their limbs in such movements and do not come to a controlled stop at the end, limiting muscle flexion. Generally, the muscle being extended is more at risk, not one held statically. For example, the quadriceps muscle could overexert in a snap kick trained with ankle weights, but in a rising kick, it is the hip flexor muscle more likely to overextend. In either case, the hamstring and associated ligaments would be at risk for a tear.

One major advantage to ankle weights, unlike wrist weights, is that it adds a whole new component to exercises that wrist weights do not, since we can't grip dumbbells with our feet like we can with our hands. It is a major advantage in training rotational hip stabilizers, to work on turnout for martial arts and dance postures. To do this, the leg is bent 90 degrees at the knee, and then rotated inwards and outwards to bring the foot upwards. This is commonly seen in [[footbag]] kicks and holds.

One potential disadvantage to ankle weights is they may add stress to [[ligament]]s in ankle or knee. For this reason, some expert physicians discourage running while wearing them.

===Footwear===
Weighted footwear, such as "iron" boots, sandals, and shoes, are generally very similar to ankle weights. The main difference is that being below the ankle, the calf muscle is not activated at all in wearing them. Muscles in both legs only become stimulated when the leg is raised in the air (calf flexion for the rooted leg, hip/knee/ankle for the raised leg, or the entire body if suspended from pull-up bar). For straight-leg flexion (front and back) the slight increase in distance does increase leverage somewhat. In regard to the flexion muscles of the ankle, weighted footwear provides unique methods of working them that ankle weights do not. Leverage is best when the weight is near the tip of the foot, either above the toes or (more often) below the ball of the foot. Flexed to the front, it works the muscle opposite the calf, which is very useful as it is not a commonly activated muscle for movement, generally only a stabilizer to the calf muscle. It is very useful in retaining flexibility. The calf muscle can also be activated, but the leg must be raised behind the body as to make gravity resisting the flexion. At the front of the body, it would only assist calf flexion.

An advantage to weighted footwear is that they can be inconspicuous, depending upon the weight and the form of the footwear in question. This mainly applies to those with a fixed weight, adjustable weighted footwear is more obvious, and may not even be used as normal footwear at all inherent to their design, an example being weighted boots with a pole for the weight stack extending directly from the sole of the foot. For footwear which can be worn normally, an advantage to wearing them beyond additional training stimulus, is their additional mass, which creates far more downward force than one would otherwise have, with foot-dropping attacks such as [[axe kick]]s and [[stomp (strike)|stomps]]. To gain this energy, more initial energy must be expended in hip flexion (and possibly knee extension) to raise the foot from the ground.

==Therapeutic use==
[[Sensory integration therapy]], a popular therapy for children with [[autism]] and other developmental disabilities, often employs weighted vests, weighted belts and weighted blankets, under the theory that behavioral problems such as inattentiveness and [[stereotypy]] are due to over- or under-sensitivity to sensory input, and that weighted belts and weighted blankets provide [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]] feedback that has a calming effect. Only a limited amount of scientific research is available on this treatment, but it suggests no significant improvement with weighted vests.&lt;ref&gt;"The Use of Weighted Vests with Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and Other Disabilities," Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, Jan. 2009, vol. 39, pp. 105-114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==

===Literature===
*In the [[Kurt Vonnegut]] short story ''[[Harrison Bergeron]]'', physically strong individuals are weighted down with weights of varying heaviness in accordance to the individuals' strength. This is done to handicap them and make them physically "equal" to a normal person.
*[[Tamora Pierce]]'s ''[[Protector of the Small]]'' quartet, knight-trainees wear weighted leather harnesses in general training to increase strength and prepare for wearing armor.

===Manga and anime===
* 1984: In ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' many of the characters wear weighted clothing as a form of training to increase their strength. [[Kame-Sennin]] wears a heavy-weighted turtle shell on his back, as do [[Goku]] and [[Kuririn]] during their time training with him, though they are not shown with the shells after this point. In a martial arts tournament Goku goes up against [[Tenshinhan]], to which he throws off his clothes which were weighted, he then gains in speed and power. Goku and [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] hide weights in their [[Keikogi|gis.]] Removing the clothing visibly increased their power levels on [[Raditz]]' scouter. Later in the series, some characters use high gravity environments such as gravity-multiplying chambers to train. By increasing their body-weights, they no longer require potentially cumbersome weighted clothing to train properly, as the higher bodyweight movements suffice, though at times they have also used weighted clothes during gravity training. In some scenes where the higher gravity environments are not available, characters also use weighted wrist bands and ankle bands, sometimes weighing several tons each.
* 1989: In ''[[Hajime no Ippo]]'', the Osaka brawler boxer named [[Takeshi Sendo|Sendo Takeshi]] adds ankle weight to his training routine in order to build up greater lower body strength. The effects of this addition do not show themselves until his second Japanese title defense when the training results in increased weight shifting and dashing power.
* 1994: In ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'', Kenshin's master [[Hiko Seijuro]] wears a white coat (modeled after [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]) containing weighted springs that constrict the garment and require a person's muscles to work from being crushed. The resistance it provides is more due to the tensile force of the springs rather than their weight, though they would contribute somewhat. Upon removing it, the strength built through wearing it can be used against opponents. A suit like this could be dangerous to wear. As nothing like it currently exists, it may be hard to design in real life. Some similar simplified attempts using similar ideas exist using stretch bands anchored on the shoulders and feet. While the springs could have significant weight, technically making it weighted clothing, it is more so resistance clothing as it primarily uses a force other than gravity to resist the movements. It will remain here until [[resistance clothing]] has its own article.
* 1998: In ''[[Hunter × Hunter]]'', before seeing [[Killua Zoldyck|Killua]], [[Gon Freecss|Gon]], [[Kurapika]] and [[Leorio]] wear weighted slippers and clothing during their stay at the [[Zaoldyeck_family#Zeburo|gatekeeper]]'s house.
* 1999: In ''[[Naruto]]'', the [[taijutsu]] expert [[Rock Lee]] uses stone-weighted clothing. He wears extremely dense ankle weights, and rarely removes them. When he does, he gains an exceptional increase in speed. He later wears weighted sandals, a weighted belt, and wrist weights for training.
* 1999: In ''[[The Prince of Tennis]]'', [[Sadaharu Inui]] uses various weighted clothing to exercise his body while reading and taking notes.
* 2000: In ''[[Beyblade]]'', [[Kai Hiwatari]] wears wrist weights all day and during bey blade battles, keeping them as an emergency reserve (much like Goku) for added power and speed to unleash the power of his beast when they are removed.
* 2001: In ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' a native tribe of monkeys have immense jumping ability required by Jack. He trains with massive rocks tied to his ankles until the day he can jump a very small amount (less than 1mm). The tribe unbind him, and upon jumping he leaps an enormous distance into the air. A similar regimen in reality would probably cause long term joint damage.
* 2002: In ''[[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]'', Rena Ryugu's [[armband]]s are rumored to have weights in them, a possible theory to why Rena can do almost anything physical when she's serious.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* 2002: In ''[[Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple]]'', the titular character [[List_of_Kenichi:_The_Mightiest_Disciple_characters#Kenichi_Shirahama|Shirahama Kenichi]] undergoes extensive training while having weights attached to his legs, waist and wrist. He even wears huge leg weights while doing daily chores like shopping.

===Film===
* In ''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]'', the Tailor wears brass rings used in [[Hung Gar]] training. However, his rings are also used as weapons.
* In the non-fiction documentary The Smashing Machine,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320512/&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed Martial Arts fighter [[Mark Kerr (fighter)|Mark Kerr]] runs up and down stairs wearing a weighted vest as part of his training.
* In ''[[Drunken Master]]'', Jackie Chan wears weights on his wrist while doing 5 hour's horse stance as his punishment.
* In ''[[Super Bodyguard]]'', Wu-Lin wears 25kg weighted iron boots. When removed, the strength of his kicks is greatly increased.
