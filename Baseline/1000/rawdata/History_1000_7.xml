The year '''1993 in radio''' involved some significant events.

==Events==
*January: The [[Media in the Quad Cities|Quad Cities]]' KSTT call letters are retired as 1170 AM is given the new call sign KJOC, reflecting that station's all-sports format. The station had been simulcasting [[WXLP]]'s FM signal for the past four years, although its sports programming had been steadily increasing during that time. Also that month, [[WPAT (AM)|WPAT]] and [[WPAT-FM]] [[Paterson, NJ]]/[[New York City]] quietly completed their evolution from [[Beautiful Music]] to down-tempo [[Adult Contemporary]], still known as Easy 93.
*4 January - [[WYCD|WOWF]]/Detroit officially completes their flip from Top 40/CHR to [[talk radio|talk]] as "Wow FM."
*6 January - After 5 days of [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with all-[[Garth Brooks]] music, Rhythmic CHR-formatted [[WBZZ|WMXP]]/Pittsburgh flips to country as "K-Bear", WKQB.
*10 January - [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] gets its second local country outlet when [[KKSE-FM|KDHT]] completed its move-in to the market and flipped to "Big Dog 92.5."
*15 January - KONC/Phoenix flips from classical to modern rock. A few weeks later, on 1 February, cross-town rival KFMA flips to beautiful music.
*25 January - After stunting with all-[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] music for 3 days, Top 40/CHR-formatted [[KRVB|KFXD-FM]]/[[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] flips to adult contemporary.
*26 January - [[Toronto]] got its first country-formatted FM station when [[CKIS-FM|CISS-FM]] signed on the air.
*February - KZKZ/[[Ft. Smith, Arkansas|Ft. Smith]] flips from album rock to gospel, while KTEZ/[[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] flips from beautiful music to country.
*2 February - Pittsburgh picked up its third country outlet, as [[WPGB|WORD-FM]]'s former 104.7 frequency flips from religious programming and became "Rebel 104.7", WXRB.
*5 February - [[WLFP|WODZ]]/Memphis flips from oldies to country as "Froggy 94", WOGY. Also on this day, Top 40/CHR-formatted [[KMJK|KXXR]]/Kansas City changes call letters and rebrands as KISF, "Kiss 107.3."
*7 February - [[KKSW|KLZR]]/[[Lawrence, Kansas]] flips from satellite-fed Hot AC to modern rock
*15 February - WXQL/Jacksonville flips to Urban AC
*19 February:  [[KBEQ]]/Kansas City drops its top-40 format of 20 years as "Q-104" to go country as "Young Country 104."  It would initially be simulcast on KBZR 1030, which had been airing [[Z-Rock]].  The "Q-104" handle would return a few years later, but the format would remain country.
*March: After 40-plus years in its hometown, [[KBEA-FM|KFMH]] (99.7 FM) moves its studios from [[Muscatine, Iowa]] to [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]]. Also that month, Cleveland-based Malrite Communications announces it will merge with Shamrock Broadcasting. The merger would be completed in August.
*8 March - KKNB/[[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] signs on with a modern rock format.
*12 March: After 10 years in the Top 40/CHR format (with a few moniker and format modifications]], WEGX/[[Philadelphia]] becomes [[smooth jazz]]-formatted [[WISX|WJJZ]]. Three days later, struggling [[adult contemporary|AC]] [[WRNB|WKSZ]] fills the format void by flipping to "Z100." However, due to the presence of nearby [[WHTZ]] in New York (which is also located on 100.3 FM), the "Z100" moniker would be modified to "Y100".
*2 April: After 20 years as an influential [[Top 40]] station, [[WRBQ-FM]]/[[Tampa]] flipped to [[country music|country]], while keeping its heritage "Q105" moniker. Also on this day, [[KKLQ (FM)|KQLZ]]/[[Los Angeles]] (the former "[[KQLZ (defunct)|Pirate Radio]]") flipped from modern rock to [[Adult contemporary|Soft AC]] as "EZ 100.3" after [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] sold the station to [[Viacom, Inc.|Viacom]]. In addition, [[KCMQ]]/[[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]] flips from Top 40/CHR to country.
*5 April - Two stations in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] would flip to country within two days of each other: [[Beautiful Music]]-formatted [[WWHT|WRHP]] flips on the 5th, while classic rock-formatted [[WBBS|WKFM]] flips the next day. In [[Akron, Ohio]], [[Hot AC]]-formatted [[WQMX]] would also flip to country on the 5th.
*19 April - WAQZ/Cincinnati flips from album rock to modern rock
*30 April: [[Virgin Radio]], originally called Virgin 1215, was launched nationally in the United Kingdom on 1215&amp;nbsp;kHz at 12.15pm by [[Richard Branson]]. It has since become the most listened to online radio station in the world.
*11 May: [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]]-formatted [[WJMN (FM)|WZOU]]/[[Boston]] shifted to [[Rhythmic CHR]] as "JAM'N 94.5", WJMN.
*28 May: At 4 PM that day, [[WYCD|WOWF]]/Detroit dropped their 5-month old talk format and flipped to country, becoming one of the first "Young Country" stations.
*3 June: Atlantic Ventures, Stoner Broadcasting and Multi Market Communications all merge to form American Radio Systems, consisting of 16 stations in 7 markets.
*9 September:  Cox and CBS make a swap involving the Dallas and Tampa radio markets. Cox received AOR WYNF 94.9 "95 YNF" in Tampa from CBS to pair with its WWRM "Warm 107.3", while CBS received KLRX "Lite 97.9" in Dallas from Cox to pair with its KTXQ "Q-102."  KLRX flipped to classic rock as KRRW "Arrow 97.9" on 15 October (becoming the second station to use that branding), while Cox moved the "Warm" format from 107.3 to 94.9 and launches 1970s hits WCOF "107.3 The Coast."
*10 September - CBS installs the very first 70s-based [[classic hits]]-formatted "[[Arrow (radio format)|Arrow]]" station on [[KCBS-FM]]/Los Angeles, who dropped their 4-year old [[oldies]] format.
*22 September - [[WMVP|WLUP-AM]]/Chicago moves their comedy/talk programming over to [[WCKL-FM|their FM sister station]], and flips to [[sports talk]] as WMVP.
*October - Memphis got its sixth urban-formatted station when WOGY-AM dropped the simulcast with [[WLFP|its FM sister station]] and flipped to urban oldies as "The Juice", WJCE. Also this month, Carl Hirsch launches his new radio group venture, OmniAmerica Communications.
*11 October - Westwood One announced it would acquire Unistar Radio Networks for $101.3 million; in addition, Westwood One would sell a 25% equity stake to [[Infinity Broadcasting]] for $15 million. Also on this day, KPOI/Honolulu flips from album rock to modern rock.
*25 October - [[Smooth jazz]]-formatted [[KRKS-FM|KHIH]]/Denver flips to religious programming; the format void would be filled by AC-formatted [[KPTT|KHOW-FM]] a few days later.
*November - [[WXDX-FM|WWKS]]/Pittsburgh flips from classic rock to hard rock. Also during this month, Booth American Company and Broadcast Alchemy announced plans of a merger, with the newly combined company getting 11 stations in 7 markets and $160 million. In addition, Metroplex Communications would merge with Clear Channel, a deal worth $53 million.
*10 November - KQBR/Sacramento dropped country for [[smooth jazz]]
*12 November - After 23 years in the country format, [[KLAC]]/Los Angeles flips to Unistar's [[adult standards]] "AM Only" format.
*15 November - Top 40/CHR-formatted WYAV/Myrtle Beach flips to [[classic rock]], and became an affiliate of [[The Howard Stern Show]].
*19 November - The "Arrow" format is expanded to two adult contemporary-formatted stations in two markets; in Washington, D.C., [[WIAD|WLTT]] adopts the format, while in Houston, [[KQBT|KLTR]] flips to the format four days later.
*16 December - [[96WEFM]] begins broadcasting in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

[[Image:PriestleyChart.gif|thumb|right|320px|A redacted version of Priestley's ''Chart of Biography'' (1765)]]
In 1765, 18th-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] published '''''A Chart of Biography''''' and its accompanying prose description as a supplement to his ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A Chart of Biography''. London: J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church Yard, 1765 and Joseph Priestley, ''A description of a chart of biography''. [Warrington] : Printed at Warrington, 1764; ''A Description of a Chart of Biography''. Warrington: Printed by William Eyres, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley believed that the chart and ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' (1769) would allow students to "trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Chart of Biography'' covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's "principle of selection" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entires on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning all of the people listed to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. [[Machiavelli]] is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and [[Cicero]] is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; "statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 253; Sheps, 142-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both ''Charts'' were popular for decades—the ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' went through fifteen editions by 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the [[University of Edinburgh]] to grant him a [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Law degree]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 118-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers study abiogenesis through a combination of [[molecular biology]], [[paleontology]], [[astrobiology]], [[oceanography]], [[biophysics]], [[geochemistry]] and [[biochemistry]], and aim to determine how pre-life [[chemical reaction]]s gave rise to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voet|Voet|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of abiogenesis can be [[geophysics|geophysical]], [[Chemistry|chemical]], or [[biology|biological]],&lt;ref name="Dyson 1999"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more recent approaches attempting a synthesis of all three,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Davies, Paul |date= 1998 |title= The Fifth Miracle, Search for the origin and meaning of life |publisher= Penguin |page= | isbn= }}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as life arose under conditions that are strikingly different from those on Earth today. Life functions through the specialized chemistry of [[carbon]] and [[water]] and builds largely upon four key families of chemicals: [[lipids]] (fatty cell walls), [[carbohydrates]] (sugars, cellulose), [[amino acid]]s (protein metabolism), and [[nucleic acids]] (self-replicating DNA and RNA). Any successful theory of abiogenesis must explain the origins and interactions of these classes of molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Ward, Peter|author2= Kirschvink, Joe |date= 2015 |title= A New History of Life: the radical discoveries about the origins and evolution of life on earth |publisher= Bloomsbury Press |pages= 39–40 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many approaches to abiogenesis investigate how [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] [[molecule]]s, or their components, came into existence. Researchers generally think that current life on Earth descends from an [[RNA world]],&lt;ref name="RNA" /&gt; although [[RNA]]-based life may not have been the first life to have existed.&lt;ref name="Robertson2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cech2012" /&gt;

The classic 1952 [[Miller–Urey experiment]] and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, the chemical constituents of the [[protein]]s used in all living organisms, can be synthesized from [[inorganic compound]]s under conditions intended to replicate those of the [[History of Earth|early Earth]]. Scientists have proposed various external sources of energy that may have triggered these reactions, including [[lightning]] and [[radiation]]. Other approaches ("metabolism-first" hypotheses) focus on understanding how [[catalysis]] in chemical systems on the early Earth might have provided the [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor molecules]] necessary for self-replication.&lt;ref name="Ralser 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Keller |first1= Markus A. |last2= Turchyn |first2= Alexandra V. |last3= Ralser |first3= Markus |date= 25 March 2014 |title= Non‐enzymatic glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway‐like reactions in a plausible Archean ocean |journal= [[Molecular Systems Biology]] |volume= 10 |issue= 725 |pages= 725 |doi= 10.1002/msb.20145228 |issn= 1744-4292 |pmc= 4023395 |pmid= 24771084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex [[List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|organic molecules]] occur in the [[Solar System]] and in [[interstellar space]], and these molecules may have provided [[Precursor (chemistry)|starting material]] for the development of life on Earth.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfreund2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Science 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last= Perkins |first= Sid |date= 8 April 2015 |title= Organic molecules found circling nearby star |url= http://news.sciencemag.org/chemistry/2015/04/organic-molecules-found-circling-nearby-star?rss=1 |work= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |type= News |location= Washington, D.C. |publisher= [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |issn= 1095-9203 |accessdate= 2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= King |first= Anthony |date= 14 April 2015 |title= Chemicals formed on meteorites may have started life on Earth |url= http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2015/04/meteorites-may-have-delivered-chemicals-started-life-earth |work= [[Chemistry World]] |type= News |location= London |publisher= [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |issn= 1473-7604 |accessdate= 2015-04-17 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150417142723/http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2015/04/meteorites-may-have-delivered-chemicals-started-life-earth |archivedate= 17 April 2015 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Saladino |first1= Raffaele |last2= Carota |first2= Eleonora |last3= Botta |first3= Giorgia |last4= Kapralov |first4= Mikhail |last5= Timoshenko |first5= Gennady N. |last6= Rozanov |first6= Alexei Y. |last7= Krasavin |first7= Eugene |last8= Di Mauro |first8= Ernesto |display-authors= 3 |date= 13 April 2015 |title= Meteorite-catalyzed syntheses of nucleosides and of other prebiotic compounds from formamide under proton irradiation |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proc.

{{Life timeline}}
The Hadean Earth is thought to have had a [[secondary atmosphere]], formed through [[Degasification|degassing]] of the rocks that accumulated from [[planetesimal]] [[impact event|impactors]]. At first, it was thought that the Earth's [[atmosphere]] consisted of hydrogen compounds—[[methane]], [[ammonia]] and [[Water vapor|water vapour]]—and that life began under such [[redox|reducing]] conditions, which are conducive to the formation of organic molecules. According to later models, suggested by study of ancient minerals, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of [[water vapour]], [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon dioxide]], with smaller amounts of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]], and [[sulfur]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kasting |first=James F. |authorlink=James Kasting |date=12 February 1993 |title=Earth's Early Atmosphere |url=http://wwwdca.iag.usp.br/www/material/fornaro/ACA410/Kasting%201993_EarthEarlyAtmos.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Science |volume=259 |issue=5097 |pages=920–6 |doi=10.1126/science.11536547 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11536547 |accessdate=2015-07-28 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010074651/http://wwwdca.iag.usp.br/www/material/fornaro/ACA410/Kasting%201993_EarthEarlyAtmos.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During its formation, the Earth lost a significant part of its initial mass, with a nucleus of the heavier rocky elements of the protoplanetary disk remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fesenkov|1959|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Earth lacked the [[gravity]] to hold any molecular hydrogen in its atmosphere, and rapidly lost it during the Hadean period, along with the bulk of the original inert gases. The solution of carbon dioxide in water is thought to have made the seas slightly [[acid]]ic, giving it a [[pH]] of about 5.5.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The atmosphere at the time has been characterized as a "gigantic, productive outdoor chemical laboratory."&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt; It may have been similar to the mixture of gases released today by volcanoes, which still support some abiotic chemistry.&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt;

The Hadean environment would have been highly hazardous to modern life. Frequent collisions with large objects, up to {{convert|500|km|mi}} in diameter, would have been sufficient to sterilize the planet and vaporize the ocean within a few months of impact, with hot steam mixed with rock vapour becoming high altitude clouds that would completely cover the planet. After a few months, the height of these clouds would have begun to decrease but the cloud base would still have been elevated for about the next thousand years. After that, it would have begun to rain at low altitude. For another two thousand years, rains would slowly have drawn down the height of the clouds, returning the oceans to their original depth only 3,000 years after the impact event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sleep |first=Norman H. |last2=Zahnle |first2=Kevin J. |authorlink2=Kevin J.

The most commonly accepted location of the root of the tree of life is between a monophyletic domain Bacteria and a clade formed by Archaea and Eukaryota of what is referred to as the "traditional tree of life" based on several molecular studies starting with C.

Studies of [[meteorite]]s suggests that [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] such as [[aluminium-26]] with a [[half-life]] of 7.17×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (717 thousand) years, and [[potassium-40]] with a half-life of 1.250×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; (1.25 billion) years, isotopes mainly produced in [[supernova]]e, were much more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2007|pp=61–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal heating as a result of [[Convection#Gravitational or buoyant convection|gravitational sorting]] between the [[Earth core|core]] and the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] would have caused a great deal of [[mantle convection]], with the probable result of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist.

The time periods between such devastating environmental events give time windows for the possible origin of life in the early environments. If the deep marine hydrothermal setting was the site for the origin of life, then abiogenesis could have happened as early as 4.0 to 4.2&amp;nbsp;Ga.

== Conceptual history ==

=== Spontaneous generation ===
{{Main|Spontaneous generation}}
Belief in spontaneous generation of certain forms of life from non-living matter goes back to [[Aristotle]] and [[ancient Greek philosophy]] and continued to have support in Western scholarship until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sheldon|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief was paired with a belief in heterogenesis, i.e., that one form of life derived from a different form (e.g., bees from flowers).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vartanian|1973|pp=307–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical notions of spontaneous generation held that certain complex, living organisms are generated by decaying organic substances. According to Aristotle, it was a readily observable truth that [[aphid]]s arise from the dew that falls on plants, [[fly|flies]] from putrid matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from rotting logs at the bottom of bodies of water, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lennox|2001|pp=229–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, people began to question such assumptions. In 1646, [[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]] published his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' (subtitled ''Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and commonly Presumed Truths''), which was an attack on false beliefs and "vulgar errors." His contemporary, [[Alexander Ross (writer)|Alexander Ross]], erroneously refuted him, stating: "To question this [spontaneous generation], is to question Reason, Sense, and Experience: If he doubts of this, let him go to ''[[Egypt|Ægypt]]'', and there he will finde the fields swarming with mice begot of the mud of ''[[Nile|Nylus]]'', to the great calamity of the Inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Balme |first=D. M. |authorlink=David Mowbray Balme |year=1962 |title=Development of Biology in Aristotle and Theophrastus: Theory of Spontaneous Generation |journal=[[Phronesis (journal)|Phronesis]] |volume=7 |issue=1–2 |pages=91–104 |doi=10.1163/156852862X00052 |issn=0031-8868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1665, [[Robert Hooke]] published the first drawings of a [[microorganism]]. Hooke was followed in 1676 by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], who drew and described microorganisms that are now thought to have been [[protozoa]] and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobell|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many felt the existence of microorganisms was evidence in support of spontaneous generation, since microorganisms seemed too simplistic for [[sexual reproduction]], and [[asexual reproduction]] through [[mitosis|cell division]] had not yet been observed. Van Leeuwenhoek took issue with the ideas common at the time that fleas and lice could spontaneously result from [[putrefaction]], and that frogs could likewise arise from slime. Using a broad range of experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study of insect reproduction he became, by the 1680s, convinced that spontaneous generation was incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bondeson|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first experimental evidence against spontaneous generation came in 1668 when [[Francesco Redi]] showed that no [[maggot]]s appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. It was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false. The alternative seemed to be [[biogenesis]]: that every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing (''omne vivum ex ovo'', Latin for "every living thing from an egg").

In 1768, [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] demonstrated that [[microorganism|microbes]] were present in the air, and could be killed by boiling. In 1861, [[Louis Pasteur]] performed a series of experiments that demonstrated that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not spontaneously appear in sterile, nutrient-rich media, but could only appear by invasion from without.

The belief that self-ordering by spontaneous generation was impossible begged for an alternative. By the middle of the 19th century, the theory of biogenesis had accumulated so much evidential support, due to the work of Pasteur and others, that the alternative theory of spontaneous generation had been effectively disproven. [[John Desmond Bernal]], a pioneer in [[X-ray crystallography]], suggested that earlier theories such as spontaneous generation were based upon an explanation that life was continuously created as a result of chance events.&lt;ref name="Bernal 1967"&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
{{Main|Biogenesis}}
The term ''biogenesis'' is usually credited to either [[Henry Charlton Bastian]] or to [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].&lt;ref name=eohtBiogenesis&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Hmolpedia |title=Biogenesis |url=http://www.eoht.info/page/Biogenesis |accessdate=2014-05-19 |publisher=WikiFoundry, Inc. |location=Ancaster, Ontario, Canada |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520001148/http://www.eoht.info/page/Biogenesis |archivedate=20 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastian used the term around 1869 in an unpublished exchange with [[John Tyndall]] to mean "life-origination or commencement". In 1870, Huxley, as new president of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], delivered an address entitled ''Biogenesis and Abiogenesis''.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1968"&gt;{{harvnb|Huxley|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he introduced the term ''biogenesis'' (with an opposite meaning to Bastian's) as well as ''abiogenesis'':

:And thus the hypothesis that living matter always arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter, took definite shape; and had, henceforward, a right to be considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of living matter in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of ''Biogenesis''; and I shall term the contrary doctrine–that living matter may be produced by not living matter–the hypothesis of ''Abiogenesis''.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1968" /&gt;

Subsequently, in the preface to Bastian's 1871 book, ''The Modes of Origin of Lowest Organisms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bastian|1871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastian referred to the possible confusion with Huxley's usage and explicitly renounced his own meaning:

:A word of explanation seems necessary with regard to the introduction of the new term ''Archebiosis''. I had originally, in unpublished writings, adopted the word ''Biogenesis'' to express the same meaning—viz., life-origination or commencement. But in the mean time the word ''Biogenesis'' has been made use of, quite independently, by a distinguished biologist [Huxley], who wished to make it bear a totally different meaning. He also introduced the word ''Abiogenesis''. I have been informed, however, on the best authority, that neither of these words can—with any regard to the language from which they are derived—be supposed to bear the meanings which have of late been publicly assigned to them. Wishing to avoid all needless confusion, I therefore renounced the use of the word ''Biogenesis'', and being, for the reason just given, unable to adopt the other term, I was compelled to introduce a new word, in order to designate the process by which living matter is supposed to come into being, independently of pre-existing living matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bastian|1871|p=[https://ia902701.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/23/items/modesoforiginofl00bast/modesoforiginofl00bast_jp2.zip&amp;file=modesoforiginofl00bast_jp2/modesoforiginofl00bast_0015.jp2&amp;scale=4&amp;rotate=0 xi–xii]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Louis Pasteur and Charles Darwin ===
[[File:Darwin restored2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Head and shoulders portrait, increasingly bald with rather uneven bushy white eyebrows and beard, his wrinkled forehead suggesting a puzzled frown|[[Charles Darwin]] in 1879]]
[[Louis Pasteur]] remarked, about a finding of his in 1864 which he considered definitive, "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oparin|1953|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyndall Fragments2"&gt;{{harvnb|Tyndall|1905|loc=IV, XII (1876), XIII (1878)}}&lt;/ref&gt; One alternative was that life's origins on Earth had come from somewhere else in the universe. Periodically resurrected (see Panspermia, above) Bernal said that this approach "is equivalent in the last resort to asserting the operation of metaphysical, spiritual entities... it turns on the argument of creation by design by a creator or demiurge."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1967|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a theory, Bernal said, was unscientific. A theory popular around the same time was that life was the result of an inner "[[Vitalism|life force]]", which in the late 19th century was championed by [[Henri Bergson]].

The idea of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] put an end to these metaphysical theologies. In a letter to [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] on 1 February 1871,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/darwin/textonly/polar_essay1.jsp |title=Origin and Evolution of Life on a Frozen Earth |last=Priscu |first=John C |authorlink=John Charles Priscu |publisher=[[National Science Foundation]] |location=Arlington County, VA |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218070241/http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/darwin/textonly/polar_essay1.jsp |archivedate=18 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin discussed the suggestion that the original spark of life may have begun in a "warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, {{sic|hide=y|&amp;c.}}, present, that a {{sic|hide=y|[[protein]]e}} compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes." He went on to explain that "at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed." He had written to Hooker in 1863 stating that, "It is mere rubbish, thinking at present of the origin of life; one might as well think of the origin of matter." In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', he had referred to life having been "created", by which he "really meant 'appeared' by some wholly unknown process", but had soon regretted using the Old Testament term "creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=30 18]}}: "It is often said that all the conditions for the first production of a living organism are now present, which could ever have been present. But if (and oh! what a big if!) we could conceive in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, {{sic|hide=y|&amp;c.}}, present, that a {{sic|hide=y|[[protein]]e}} compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed." — [[Charles Darwin]], 1 February 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Primordial soup" hypothesis ===
{{anchor | Haldane and Oparin: The Primordial Soup Theory}}&lt;!--This section is linked from [[The Selfish Gene]]--&gt;
{{Main|Primordial soup}}
{{further|Miller–Urey experiment}}
[[File:Aleksandr Oparin and Andrei Kursanov in enzymology laboratory 1938.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexander Oparin]] (right) in his laboratory, 1938]]
No new notable research or hypothesis on the subject appeared until 1924, when [[Alexander Oparin]] reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevents the synthesis of certain organic compounds that are necessary building blocks for the evolution of life. In his book ''The Origin of Life'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1967|loc=[http://www.valencia.edu/~orilife/textos/The%20Origin%20of%20Life.pdf ''The Origin of Life'' (A. I. Oparin, 1924), pp. 199–234]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oparin|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oparin proposed that the "spontaneous generation of life" that had been attacked by Louis Pasteur did in fact occur once, but was now impossible because the conditions found on the early Earth had changed, and preexisting organisms would immediately consume any spontaneously generated organism. Oparin argued that a "primeval soup" of organic molecules could be created in an oxygenless atmosphere through the action of [[sunlight]]. These would combine in ever more complex ways until they formed [[coacervate]] droplets. These droplets would "[[cell growth|grow]]" by fusion with other droplets, and "[[reproduction|reproduce]]" through fission into daughter droplets, and so have a primitive [[metabolism]] in which factors that promote "cell integrity" survive, and those that do not become extinct. Many modern theories of the origin of life still take Oparin's ideas as a starting point.

[[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] has summarized the "primordial soup" theory of Oparin and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in its "mature form" as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|1987|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The early Earth had a chemically [[reducing atmosphere]].
# This atmosphere, exposed to [[energy]] in various forms, produced simple organic compounds ("[[monomer]]s").
# These compounds accumulated in a "soup" that may have concentrated at various locations (shorelines, [[Hydrothermal vent|oceanic vents]] etc.).
# By further transformation, more complex organic [[polymer]]s – and ultimately life – developed in the soup.

About this time, Haldane suggested that the Earth's prebiotic oceans (quite different from their modern counterparts) would have formed a "hot dilute soup" in which organic compounds could have formed. Bernal called this idea ''biopoiesis'' or ''biopoesis'', the process of living matter evolving from self-replicating but non-living molecules,&lt;ref name="Bernal 1967" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryson|2004|pp=300–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed that biopoiesis passes through a number of intermediate stages.

One of the most important pieces of experimental support for the "soup" theory came in 1952. [[Stanley Miller|Stanley L. Miller]] and [[Harold Urey|Harold C. Urey]] performed an experiment that demonstrated how organic molecules could have spontaneously formed from inorganic precursors under conditions like those posited by the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. The now-famous [[Miller–Urey experiment]] used a highly reducing mixture of gases – [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[hydrogen gas|hydrogen]], as well as [[water vapor|water vapour]] – to form simple organic monomers such as amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Stanley L. |authorlink=Stanley Miller |date=15 May 1953 |title=A Production of Amino Acids Under Possible Primitive Earth Conditions |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=117 |issue=3046 |pages=528–529 |bibcode=1953Sci...117..528M |doi=10.1126/science.117.3046.528 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=13056598}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of gases was cycled through an apparatus that delivered electrical sparks to the mixture. After one week, it was found that about 10% to 15% of the carbon in the system was then in the form of a [[racemic mixture]] of organic compounds, including amino acids, which are the building blocks of [[protein]]s. This provided direct experimental support for the second point of the "soup" theory, and it is around the remaining two points of the theory that much of the debate now centres.

Bernal showed that based upon this and subsequent work there is no difficulty in principle in forming most of the molecules we recognize as the necessary molecules for life from their inorganic precursors. The underlying hypothesis held by Oparin, Haldane, Bernal, Miller and Urey, for instance, was that multiple conditions on the primeval Earth favoured chemical reactions that synthesized the same set of complex organic compounds from such simple precursors. A 2011 reanalysis of the saved vials containing the original extracts that resulted from the Miller and Urey experiments, using current and more advanced analytical equipment and technology, has uncovered more biochemicals than originally discovered in the 1950s. One of the more important findings was 23 amino acids, far more than the five originally found.&lt;ref name="pmid21422282"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Eric T. |last2=Cleaves |first2=Henderson J. |last3=Dworkin |first3=Jason P. |last4=Glavin |first4=Daniel P. |last5=Callahan |first5=Michael |last6=Aubrey |first6=Andrew |last7=Lazcano |first7=Antonio |last8=Bada |first8=Jeffrey L. |display-authors=3 |date=5 April 2011 |title=Primordial synthesis of amines and amino acids in a 1958 Miller H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-rich spark discharge experiment |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/14/5526.full.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Proc.

More recent studies, in October 2017, support the notion that life may have begun right after the Earth was formed as RNA molecules emerging from "warm little ponds".&lt;ref name="IND-20171002"&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnston |first=Ian |title=Life first emerged in 'warm little ponds' almost as old as the Earth itself - Charles Darwin's famous idea backed by new scientific study |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/origins-life-ponds-organisms-earth-age-study-a7978906.html |date=2 October 2017 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003003027/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/origins-life-ponds-organisms-earth-age-study-a7978906.html |archivedate=3 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proteinoid microspheres ===
{{Main|Proteinoid}}
In trying to uncover the intermediate stages of abiogenesis mentioned by Bernal, [[Sidney W. Fox]] in the 1950s and 1960s studied the spontaneous formation of [[peptide]] structures (small chains of amino acids) under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earth's history. In one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, dry spot in prebiotic conditions. He found that, as they dried, the amino acids formed long, often cross-linked, thread-like, submicroscopic [[Peptide|polypeptide]] molecules now named "[[Proteinoid|proteinoid microspheres]]".&lt;ref name="foxexp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/courses/EEB105/lectures/Origins_of_Life/origins.html |title=Part 4: Experimental studies of the origins of life |last=Walsh |first=J.

In another experiment to set suitable conditions for life to form, Fox collected volcanic material from a [[cinder cone]] in [[Hawaii]]. He discovered that the temperature was over {{convert|100|C}} just {{convert|4|in}} beneath the surface of the cinder cone, and suggested that this might have been the environment in which life was created—molecules could have formed and then been washed through the loose volcanic ash into the sea. He placed lumps of lava over amino acids derived from methane, ammonia and water, sterilized all materials, and baked the lava over the amino acids for a few hours in a glass oven. A brown, sticky substance formed over the surface, and when the lava was drenched in sterilized water, a thick, brown liquid leached out. The amino acids had combined to form [[proteinoid]]s, and the proteinoids had combined to form small globules that Fox called "microspheres". His proteinoids were not cells, although they formed clumps and chains reminiscent of [[cyanobacteria]], but they contained no functional [[nucleic acid]]s or any encoded information. Based upon such experiments, [[Colin Pittendrigh|Colin S. Pittendrigh]] stated in December 1967 that "laboratories will be creating a living cell within ten years," a remark that reflected the typical contemporary naivety about the complexity of cell structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|1969|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=wPNPAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Colin+S.+Pittendrigh%22,+%22laboratories+will+be+creating+a+living+cell+within+ten+years%22&amp;dq=%22Colin+S.+Pittendrigh%22,+%22laboratories+will+be+creating+a+living+cell+within+ten+years%22 287]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current models ==
There is no single, generally accepted model for the origin of life. Scientists have proposed several plausible hypotheses, which share some common elements. While differing in the details, these hypotheses are based on the framework laid out by Alexander Oparin (in 1924) and by J. B. S. Haldane (in 1925), who postulated the molecular or chemical evolution theory of life.&lt;ref name="bah2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bahadur |first=Krishna |year=1973 |title=Photochemical Formation of Self–sustaining Coacervates |url=http://www.dli.gov.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b73_455.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy |volume=39B |issue=4 |pages=455–467 |issn=0370-0046 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019172800/http://www.dli.gov.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b73_455.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df= }}

According to later models, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and sulfur compounds;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|1993|p=922}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it did lack molecular oxygen and ozone,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|1993|p=920}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not as chemically reducing as Oparin and Haldane supposed. In the atmosphere proposed by Oparin and Haldane, electrical activity can produce certain small molecules (monomers) of life, such as amino acids. The [[Miller–Urey experiment]] reported in 1953 demonstrated this.

Bernal coined the term ''biopoiesis'' in 1949 to refer to the origin of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernal|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he suggested that it occurred in three "stages":

# the origin of biological monomers
# the origin of biological polymers
# the evolution from molecules to cells

Bernal suggested that evolution commenced between stages 1 and 2. Bernal regarded the third stage – discovering methods by which biological reactions were incorporated behind a cell's boundary – as the most difficult. Modern work on the way that [[cell membrane]]s self-assemble, and the work on micropores in various substrates may be a halfway house towards the development of independent free-living cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Martin |first= William F. |authorlink= William F.

Estimates of the production of organics from these sources suggest that the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] before 3.5&amp;nbsp;Ga within the early atmosphere made available quantities of organics comparable to those produced by terrestrial sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chyba |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Chyba |last2=Sagan |first2=Carl |authorlink2=Carl Sagan |date=9 January 1992 |title=Endogenous production, exogenous delivery and impact-shock synthesis of organic molecules: an inventory for the origins of life |journal=Nature |volume=355 |issue=6356 |pages=125–132 |bibcode=1992Natur.355..125C |doi=10.1038/355125a0 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=11538392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furukawa |first1=Yoshihiro |last2=Sekine |first2=Toshimori |last3=Oba |first3=Masahiro |last4=Kakegawa |first4=Takeshi |last5=Nakazawa |first5=Hiromoto |display-authors=3 |date=January 2009 |title=Biomolecule formation by oceanic impacts on early Earth |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=62–66 |bibcode=2009NatGe...2...62F |doi=10.1038/NGEO383 |issn=1752-0894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that the Late Heavy Bombardment may also have effectively sterilized the Earth's surface to a depth of tens of metres. If life evolved deeper than this, it would have also been shielded from the early high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the T Tauri stage of the Sun's evolution. Simulations of geothermically heated oceanic crust yield far more organics than those found in the Miller-Urey experiments (see below). In the deep [[hydrothermal vent]]s, Everett Shock has found "there is an enormous thermodynamic drive to form organic compounds, as [[seawater]] and hydrothermal fluids, which are far from equilibrium, mix and move towards a more stable state."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shock has found that the available energy is maximized at around 100 – 150 degrees Celsius, precisely the temperatures at which the [[Hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]] bacteria and [[Thermoacidophile|thermoacidophilic]] [[archaea]] have been found, at the base of the [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogenetic tree of life]] closest to the [[Last universal ancestor|Last Universal Common Ancestor]] (LUCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bock|Goode|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accumulation and concentration of organic molecules on a planetary surface is also considered an essential early step for the origin of life.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt; Identifying and understanding the mechanisms that led to the production of prebiotic
molecules in various environments is critical for establishing the inventory of ingredients from which life originated on Earth, assuming that the abiotic production of molecules ultimately influenced the selection of molecules from which life emerged.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt;

=== Chemical synthesis ===
While features of [[self-organization]] and [[self-replication]] are often considered the hallmark of living systems, there are many instances of abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper conditions. Stan Palasek suggested based on a theoretical model that self-assembly of [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) molecules can occur spontaneously due to physical factors in hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Palasek |first=Stan |eprint=1305.5581v1 |title=Primordial RNA Replication and Applications in PCR Technology |class=q-bio.BM |date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virus]] self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life,&lt;ref name="pmid16984643"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koonin |first1=Eugene V. |authorlink=Eugene Koonin |last2=Senkevich |first2=Tatiana G. |last3=Dolja |first3=Valerian V. |date=19 September 2006 |title=The ancient Virus World and evolution of cells |journal=[[Biology Direct]] |volume=1 |page=29 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-1-29 |issn=1745-6150 |pmc=1594570 |pmid=16984643}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.&lt;ref name="pmid16044244"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vlassov |first1=Alexander V. |last2=Kazakov |first2=Sergei A. |last3=Johnston |first3=Brian H. |last4=Landweber |first4=Laura F. |display-authors=3 |date=August 2005 |title=The RNA World on Ice: A New Scenario for the Emergence of RNA Information |journal=[[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=264–273 |doi=10.1007/s00239-004-0362-7 |issn=0022-2844 |pmid=16044244|bibcode=2005JMolE..61..264V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nussinov |first1=Mark D. |last2=Otroshchenko |first2=Vladimir A. |last3=Santoli |first3=Salvatore |year=1997 |title=The emergence of the non-cellular phase of life on the fine-grained clayish particles of the early Earth's regolith |journal=[[BioSystems]] |volume=42 |issue=2–3 |pages=111–118 |doi=10.1016/S0303-2647(96)01699-1 |issn=0303-2647 |pmid=9184757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple sources of energy were available for chemical reactions on the early Earth. For example, heat (such as from [[geothermal energy|geothermal]] processes) is a standard energy source for chemistry. Other examples include sunlight and electrical discharges (lightning), among others.&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt; Computer simulations also suggest that [[cavitation]] in primordial water reservoirs such as breaking sea waves, streams and oceans can potentially lead to the synthesis of biogenic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00325 Cavitation-Induced Synthesis of Biogenic Molecules on Primordial Earth].

Sci., September 11, 2017, 3 (9), pp 1041–1049. {{doi|10.1021/acscentsci.7b00325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfavourable reactions can also be driven by highly favourable ones, as in the case of iron-sulfur chemistry. For example, this was probably important for [[carbon fixation]] (the conversion of carbon from its inorganic form to an organic one).&lt;ref group=note&gt;The reactions are:
:FeS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:FeS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCOOH&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon fixation via iron-sulfur chemistry is highly favourable, and occurs at neutral pH and {{convert|100|C}}. Iron-sulfur surfaces, which are abundant near hydrothermal vents, are also capable of producing small amounts of amino acids and other biological metabolites.&lt;ref name="Follmann2009" /&gt;

As early as the 1860s, experiments have demonstrated that biologically relevant molecules can be produced from interaction of simple carbon sources with abundant inorganic catalysts.  In particular, experiments by [[Alexander Butlerov|Butlerov]] (the [[formose reaction]]) showed that tetroses, pentoses, and hexoses are produced when formaldehyde is heated under basic conditions with divalent metal ions like calcium.  The reaction was scrutinized and subsequently proposed to be autocatalytic by Breslow in 1959.  Similar experiments (see below) demonstrate that nucleobases like guanine and adenine could be synthesized from simple carbon and nitrogen sources like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia.

[[Formamide]] produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals. Formamide is ubiquitous in the Universe, produced by the reaction of water and [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN). It has several advantages as a biotic precursor, including the ability to easily become concentrated through the evaporation of water.&lt;ref name="Saladino2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saladino |first1=Raffaele |last2=Crestini |first2=Claudia |last3=Pino |first3=Samanta |last4=Costanzo |first4=Giovanna |last5=Di Mauro |first5=Ernesto |display-authors=3 |date=March 2012 |title=Formamide and the origin of life. |journal=[[Physics of Life Reviews]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=84–104 |bibcode=2012PhLRv...9...84S |doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2011.12.002 |issn=1571-0645 |pmid=22196896|hdl=2108/85168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saladino2012b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saladino |first1=Raffaele |last2=Botta |first2=Giorgia |last3=Pino |first3=Samanta |last4=Costanzo |first4=Giovanna |last5=Di Mauro |first5=Ernesto |display-authors=3 |date=July 2012 |title=From the one-carbon amide formamide to RNA all the steps are prebiotically possible |journal=[[Biochimie]] |volume=94 |issue=7 |pages=1451–1456 |doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2012.02.018 |issn=0300-9084 |pmid=22738728}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although HCN is poisonous, it only affects [[aerobic organism]]s ([[eukaryote]]s and aerobic bacteria), which did not yet exist.

=== Autocatalysis ===
{{Main|Autocatalysis}}
[[Autocatalysis|Autocatalysts]] are substances that catalyze the production of themselves and therefore are "molecular replicators." The simplest self-replicating chemical systems are autocatalytic, and typically contain three components: a product molecule and two precursor molecules. The product molecule joins together the precursor molecules, which in turn produce more product molecules from more precursor molecules. The product molecule catalyzes the reaction by providing a complementary template that binds to the precursors, thus bringing them together. Such systems have been demonstrated both in biological [[macromolecule]]s and in small organic molecules.&lt;ref name="Paul2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paul |first1=Natasha |last2=Joyce |first2=Gerald F. |date=December 2004 |title=Minimal self-replicating systems |journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=634–639 |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.09.005 |issn=1367-5931 |pmid=15556408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bissette2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bissette |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Fletcher |first2=Stephen P. |date=2 December 2013 |title=Mechanisms of Autocatalysis |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=52 |issue=49 |pages=12800–12826 |doi=10.1002/anie.201303822 |issn=1433-7851 |pmid=24127341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems that do not proceed by template mechanisms, such as the self-reproduction of [[micelle]]s and [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]], have also been observed.&lt;ref name="Bissette2013" /&gt;

In the early 1970s, Manfred Eigen and [[Peter Schuster]] examined the transient stages between the molecular chaos and a self-replicating [[Hypercycle (chemistry)|hypercycle]] in a prebiotic soup.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eigen|Schuster|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hypercycle, the [[information]] storing system (possibly RNA) produces an [[enzyme]], which catalyzes the formation of another information system, in sequence until the product of the last aids in the formation of the first information system. Mathematically treated, hypercycles could create [[Quasispecies model|quasispecies]], which through natural selection entered into a form of Darwinian evolution. A boost to hypercycle theory was the discovery of [[ribozyme]]s capable of catalyzing their own chemical reactions. The hypercycle theory requires the existence of complex biochemicals, such as nucleotides, which do not form under the conditions proposed by the Miller–Urey experiment.

[[Geoffrey W. Hoffmann]] has shown that an early error-prone translation machinery can be stable against an error catastrophe of the type that had been envisaged as problematical for the origin of life, and was known as "Orgel's paradox".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffmann |first=Geoffrey W. |authorlink=Geoffrey W.

Hoffmann has furthermore argued that a complex nucleation event as the origin of life involving both polypeptides and nucleic acid is compatible with the time and space available in the primitive oceans of Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Geoffrey William|title=A network theory of the origin of life|date=24 December 2016|biorxiv=096701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffmann suggests that volcanic ash may provide the many random shapes needed in the postulated complex nucleation event. This aspect of the theory can be tested experimentally.

=== Homochirality ===
{{Main|Homochirality}}
Homochirality refers to a geometric uniformity of some materials composed of [[chirality|chiral]] units. Chiral refers to nonsuperimposable 3D forms that are mirror images of one another, as are left and right hands. Living organisms use molecules that have the same chirality ("handedness"): with almost no exceptions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaichian|Rojas|Tureanu|2014|pp=353–364}}&lt;/ref&gt; amino acids are left-handed while nucleotides and [[Carbohydrate|sugars]] are right-handed. Chiral molecules can be synthesized, but in the absence of a chiral source or a chiral [[Catalysis|catalyst]], they are formed in a 50/50 mixture of both [[enantiomer]]s (called a racemic mixture). Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystals]], or the Earth's rotation, [[statistical fluctuations]] during racemic synthesis,&lt;ref name="Plasson2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |issn=0899-0042 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]].&lt;ref name="jafarpour2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|pmid=28415353 |bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jafarpour2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=115 |issue=15 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|pmid=26550754 |arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frank1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=11 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-assembled [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] are essential components of primitive cells.&lt;ref name="Chen 2010" /&gt; The [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires that the universe move in a direction in which [[entropy]] increases, yet life is distinguished by its great degree of organization.

Chen and Jack W.

Such cooperative interactions between the membrane and its encapsulated contents could greatly simplify the transition from simple replicating molecules to true cells.&lt;ref name="Chen 2006" /&gt; Furthermore, competition for membrane molecules would favour stabilized membranes, suggesting a selective advantage for the evolution of cross-linked fatty acids and even the [[phospholipid]]s of today.&lt;ref name="Chen 2006" /&gt; Such [[micro-encapsulation]] would allow for metabolism within the membrane, the exchange of small molecules but the prevention of passage of large substances across it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chang|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantages of encapsulation include the increased [[solubility]] of the contained cargo within the capsule and the storage of energy in the form of a [[electrochemical gradient]].

Possible precursors for the evolution of protein synthesis include a mechanism to synthesize short peptide cofactors or form a mechanism for the duplication of RNA. It is likely that the ancestral ribosome was composed entirely of RNA, although some roles have since been taken over by proteins. Major remaining questions on this topic include identifying the selective force for the evolution of the ribosome and determining how the [[genetic code]] arose.&lt;ref name="Noller2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noller |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F.

[[Eugene Koonin]] said, "Despite considerable experimental and theoretical effort, no compelling scenarios currently exist for the origin of replication and translation, the key processes that together comprise the core of biological systems and the apparent pre-requisite of biological evolution. The RNA World concept might offer the best chance for the resolution of this conundrum but so far cannot adequately account for the emergence of an efficient RNA replicase or the translation system. The MWO ["many worlds in one"] version of the cosmological model of [[eternal inflation]] could suggest a way out of this conundrum because, in an infinite [[multiverse]] with a finite number of distinct macroscopic histories (each repeated an infinite number of times), emergence of even highly complex systems by chance is not just possible but inevitable."&lt;ref name="pmc1892545"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koonin |first=Eugene V. |date=31 May 2007 |title=The cosmological model of eternal inflation and the transition from chance to biological evolution in the history of life |journal=Biology Direct |volume=2 |page=15 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-2-15 |issn=1745-6150 |pmc=1892545 |pmid=17540027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RNA synthesis and replication ===
A number of hypotheses of formation of RNA have been put forward. {{As of|1994}}, there were difficulties in the explanation of the abiotic synthesis of the nucleotides cytosine and uracil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orgel |first=Leslie E. |date=October 1994 |title=The origin of life on Earth|journal=Scientific American |volume=271 |issue=4 |pages=76–83 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1094-76 |issn=0036-8733 |pmid=7524147|bibcode=1994SciAm.271d..76O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has shown possible routes of synthesis; for example, formamide produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals.&lt;ref name="Saladino2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saladino2012b" /&gt; Early cell membranes could have formed spontaneously from proteinoids, which are protein-like molecules produced when amino acid solutions are heated while in the correct concentration of aqueous solution. These are seen to form micro-spheres which are observed to behave similarly to membrane-enclosed compartments. Other possible means of producing more complicated organic molecules include chemical reactions that take place on [[clay]] substrates or on the surface of the mineral [[pyrite]].

Factors supporting an important role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store information and to catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression of and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least the components of the RNA molecule under the conditions that approximated the early Earth. Relatively short RNA molecules have been synthesized, capable of replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnston |first1=Wendy K. |last2=Unrau |first2=Peter J. |last3=Lawrence |first3=Michael S. |last4=Glasner |first4=Margaret E. |last5=Bartel |first5=David P. |authorlink5=David Bartel |display-authors=3 |date=18 May 2001 |title=RNA-Catalyzed RNA Polymerization: Accurate and General RNA-Templated Primer Extension |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5520 |pages=1319–1325 |bibcode=2001Sci...292.1319J |doi=10.1126/science.1060786 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11358999|citeseerx=10.1.1.70.5439 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such replicase RNA, which functions as both code and catalyst provides its own template upon which copying can occur.

Depending on the definition, life started when RNA chains began to self-replicate, initiating the three mechanisms of Darwinian selection: [[heritability]], variation of type, and differential reproductive output. The fitness of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely be a function of its intrinsic adaptive capacities, determined by its nucleotide sequence, and the availability of resources.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Byerly |first2=Henry C. |last3=Hopf |first3=Frederick A. |last4=Michod |first4=Richard A. |last5=Vemulapalli |first5=G.

Pyrimidine ribonucleosides and their respective nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries.

One of the earliest incarnations of this idea was put forward in 1924 with Oparin's notion of primitive self-replicating vesicles which predated the discovery of the structure of DNA. Variants in the 1980s and 1990s include Wächtershäuser's iron–sulfur world theory and models introduced by [[Christian de Duve]] based on the chemistry of [[thioester]]s. More abstract and theoretical arguments for the plausibility of the emergence of metabolism without the presence of genes include a mathematical model introduced by [[Freeman Dyson]] in the early 1980s and [[Stuart Kauffman]]'s notion of collectively autocatalytic sets, discussed later that decade.

Orgel summarized his analysis by stating, "There is at present no reason to expect that multistep cycles such as the reductive citric acid cycle will self-organize on the surface of FeS/FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or some other mineral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orgel |first=Leslie E. |date=7 November 2000 |title=Self-organizing biochemical cycles |journal=Proc.

For example, instead of the reductive citric acid cycle, the "open" [[acetyl-CoA]] pathway (another one of the five recognized ways of carbon dioxide fixation in nature today) would be compatible with the idea of self-organization on a metal sulfide surface. The key enzyme of this pathway, [[carbon monoxide dehydrogenase]]/[[CO-methylating acetyl-CoA synthase|acetyl-CoA synthase]], harbours mixed nickel-iron-sulfur clusters in its reaction centres and catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA (similar to acetyl-thiol) in a single step.

Oceanic vent systems and other hydrothermal systems have a zonal structure reflected in ancient [[Volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit|volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits]] (VMS) of hydrothermal origin. They reach many kilometres in diameter and date back to the [[Archean]] Eon. Most abundant are pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chalcopyrite]] (CuFeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), with additions of [[galena]] (PbS) and [[alabandite]] (MnS). ZnS and MnS have a unique ability to store radiation energy, e.g. from UV light. During the relevant time window of the origins of replicating molecules, the primordial atmospheric pressure was high enough (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;bar, about 100 atmospheres) to precipitate near the Earth's surface, and UV irradiation was 10 to 100 times more intense than now; hence the unique photosynthetic properties mediated by ZnS provided just the right energy conditions to energize the synthesis of informational and metabolic molecules and the selection of photostable nucleobases.

The Zn-world theory has been further filled out with experimental and theoretical evidence for the ionic constitution of the interior of the first proto-cells before archaea, bacteria and [[Origin of eukaryotes|proto-eukaryotes]] evolved. [[Archibald Macallum]] noted the resemblance of body fluids such as blood and lymph to seawater;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Macallum |first=A.

The authors conclude that ubiquitous, and by inference primordial, proteins and functional systems show affinity to and functional requirement for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and phosphate. Geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in what we today call marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapour-dominated zones of what we today call inland geothermal systems. Under the oxygen depleted, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of water condensates and exhalations near geothermal fields would resemble the internal milieu of modern cells. Therefore, the precellular stages of evolution may have taken place in shallow "Darwin ponds" lined with porous [[silicate minerals]] mixed with metal sulfides and enriched in K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and phosphorus compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mulkidjanian |first1=Armen Y. |last2=Bychkov |first2=Andrew Yu. |last3=Dibrova |first3=Daria V. |last4=Galperin |first4=Michael Y. |last5=Koonin |first5=Eugene V. |display-authors=3 |date=3 April 2012 |title=Origin of first cells at terrestrial, anoxic geothermal fields |journal=Proc.

The vents form a sustained chemical energy source derived from redox reactions, in which electron donors (molecular hydrogen) react with electron acceptors (carbon dioxide); see [[Iron–sulfur world theory]]. These are highly [[exothermic reaction]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The reactions are:&lt;br /&gt;
'''Reaction 1''': Fayalite + water → magnetite + aqueous silica + hydrogen''
:3Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
'''Reaction 2''': ''Forsterite + aqueous silica → serpentine''
:3Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
'''Reaction 3''': ''Forsterite + water → serpentine + brucite''
:2Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Reaction 3 describes the hydration of olivine with water only to yield [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] and Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[brucite]]). Serpentine is stable at high pH in the presence of brucite like calcium silicate hydrate, ([[calcium silicate hydrate|C-S-H]]) phases formed along with [[portlandite]] (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in hardened [[Portland cement]] paste after the hydration of [[belite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the artificial calcium equivalent of forsterite.

Analogy of reaction 3 with belite hydration in ordinary Portland cement: ''Belite + water → C-S-H phase + portlandite''
:2 Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 3 CaO · 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Russell demonstrated that alkaline vents created an abiogenic [[Proton electromotive force|proton motive force]] (PMF) [[Chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] gradient,&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt; in which conditions are ideal for an abiogenic hatchery for life. Their microscopic compartments "provide a natural means of concentrating organic molecules," composed of iron-sulfur minerals such as [[mackinawite]], endowed these mineral cells with the catalytic properties envisaged by Wächtershäuser.&lt;ref name="Lane 2009" /&gt; This movement of ions across the membrane depends on a combination of two factors:
# [[Diffusion]] force caused by concentration gradient—all particles including ions tend to diffuse from higher concentration to lower.
# Electrostatic force caused by electrical potential gradient—[[cations]] like [[proton]]s H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tend to diffuse down the electrical potential, [[anions]] in the opposite direction.
These two gradients taken together can be expressed as an [[electrochemical gradient]], providing energy for abiogenic synthesis. The proton motive force can be described as the measure of the potential energy stored as a combination of proton and voltage gradients across a membrane (differences in proton concentration and electrical potential).

Jack W. Szostak suggested that geothermal activity provides greater opportunities for the origination of life in open lakes where there is a buildup of minerals. In 2010, based on spectral analysis of sea and hot mineral water, Ignat Ignatov and Oleg Mosin demonstrated that life may have predominantly originated in hot mineral water. The hot mineral water that contains [[bicarbonate]] and [[calcium]] ions has the most optimal range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ignatov |first=Ignat |last2=Mosin |first2=Oleg V. |year=2013 |title=Possible Processes for Origin of Life and Living Matter with modeling of Physiological Processes of Bacterium ''Bacillus Subtilis'' in Heavy Water as Model System |journal=Journal of Natural Sciences Research |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=65–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case is similar to the origin of life in hydrothermal vents, but with bicarbonate and calcium ions in hot water. This water has a pH of 9–11 and is possible to have the reactions in seawater. According to [[Melvin Calvin]], certain reactions of condensation-dehydration of amino acids and nucleotides in individual blocks of peptides and nucleic acids can take place in the primary hydrosphere with pH 9-11 at a later evolutionary stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Calvin|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these compounds like [[Hydrogen cyanide|hydrocyanic acid]] (HCN) have been proven in the experiments of Miller. This is the environment in which the [[stromatolite]]s have been created.

Experimental research and computer modelling suggest that the surfaces of mineral particles inside hydrothermal vents have catalytic properties similar to those of enzymes and are able to create simple organic molecules, such as [[methanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH) and [[Formic acid|formic]], [[Acetic acid|acetic]] and [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvic]] acid out of the dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the water.&lt;ref name="organics"&gt;{{cite press release |last=Usher |first=Oli |date=27 April 2015 |title=Chemistry of seabed's hot vents could explain emergence of life |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/silva/mathematical-physical-sciences/maps-news-publication/maps1526 |publisher=[[University College London]] |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roldan |first1=Alberto |last2=Hollingsworth |first2=Nathan |last3=Roffey |first3=Anna |last4=Islam |first4=Husn-Ubayda |last5=Goodall |first5=Josephine B.

=== Thermosynthesis ===
Today's bioenergetic process of [[fermentation]] is carried out by either the aforementioned citric acid cycle or the Acetyl-CoA pathway, both of which have been connected to the primordial Iron–sulfur world. In a different approach, the thermosynthesis hypothesis considers the bioenergetic process of [[chemiosmosis]], which plays an essential role in [[cellular respiration]] and photosynthesis, more basal than fermentation: the [[ATP synthase]] enzyme, which sustains chemiosmosis, is proposed as the currently extant enzyme most closely related to the first metabolic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Anthonie W. J. |date=7 August 1985 |pages=429–453 |title=Thermosynthesis by biomembranes: Energy gain from cyclic temperature changes |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=115 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(85)80202-2 |issn=0022-5193 |pmid=3162066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Anthonie W.

First, life needed an energy source to bring about the condensation reaction that yielded the peptide bonds of proteins and the [[phosphodiester bond]]s of RNA. In a generalization and thermal variation of the [[ATP synthase#Binding-change model|binding change mechanism]] of today's ATP synthase, the "first protein" would have bound substrates (peptides, phosphate, nucleosides, RNA 'monomers') and condensed them to a reaction product that remained bound until after a temperature change it was released by thermal unfolding.

The energy source under the thermosynthesis hypothesis was thermal cycling, the result of suspension of protocells in a [[convection]] current, as is plausible in a volcanic hot spring; the convection accounts for the self-organization and [[Dissipative system|dissipative structure]] required in any origin of life model. The still ubiquitous role of thermal cycling in germination and cell division is considered a relic of primordial thermosynthesis.

By [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylating]] cell membrane lipids, this "first protein" gave a selective advantage to the lipid protocell that contained the protein. This protein also synthesized a library of many proteins, of which only a minute fraction had thermosynthesis capabilities. As proposed by Dyson,&lt;ref name="Dyson 1999" /&gt; it propagated functionally: it made daughters with similar capabilities, but it did not copy itself. Functioning daughters consisted of different amino acid sequences.

Whereas the Iron–sulfur world identifies a circular pathway as the most simple, the thermosynthesis hypothesis does not even invoke a pathway: [[ATP synthase#Binding-change model|ATP synthase's binding change mechanism]] resembles a physical adsorption process that yields free energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muller |first1=Anthonie W.

It has been claimed that the emergence of cyclic systems of protein catalysts is implausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Orgel|1987|pp=9–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clay hypothesis ===
[[Montmorillonite]], an abundant [[clay]], is a catalyst for the polymerization of RNA and for the formation of membranes from lipids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Perry |first=Caroline |date=7 February 2011 |title=Clay-armored bubbles may have formed first protocells |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-02/hu-cbm020411.php |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |agency=EurekAlert! |accessdate=2015-06-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714101638/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-02/hu-cbm020411.php |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A model for the origin of life using clay was forwarded by [[Graham Cairns-Smith|Alexander Graham Cairns-Smith]] in 1985 and explored as a plausible mechanism by several scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|1996|pp=148–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clay hypothesis postulates that complex organic molecules arose gradually on pre-existing, non-organic replication surfaces of silicate crystals in solution.

At the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], James P. Ferris' studies have also confirmed that clay minerals of [[montmorillonite]] catalyze the formation of RNA in aqueous solution, by joining nucleotides to form longer chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wenhua Huang |last2=Ferris |first2=James P. |date=12 July 2006 |title=One-Step, Regioselective Synthesis of up to 50-mers of RNA Oligomers by Montmorillonite Catalysis |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=128 |issue=27 |pages=8914–8919 |doi=10.1021/ja061782k |issn=0002-7863 |pmid=16819887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Bart Kahr from the [[University of Washington]] and colleagues reported their experiments that tested the idea that crystals can act as a source of transferable information, using crystals of [[potassium hydrogen phthalate]]. "Mother" crystals with imperfections were cleaved and used as seeds to grow "daughter" crystals from solution. They then examined the distribution of imperfections in the new crystals and found that the imperfections in the mother crystals were reproduced in the daughters, but the daughter crystals also had many additional imperfections. For gene-like behaviour to be observed, the quantity of inheritance of these imperfections should have exceeded that of the mutations in the successive generations, but it did not. Thus Kahr concluded that the crystals "were not faithful enough to store and transfer information from one generation to the next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=Caroline |date=16 July 2007 |title=Crystals as genes? |url=http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2007/08/Crystals_as_genes.asp |journal=Highlights in Chemical Science |issn=2041-5818 |accessdate=2015-06-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714094855/http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2007/08/Crystals_as_genes.asp |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}

=== Gold's "deep-hot biosphere" model ===
In the 1970s, [[Thomas Gold]] proposed the theory that life first developed not on the surface of the Earth, but several kilometres below the surface. It is claimed that discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our Solar System would lend significant credence to this theory. Thomas Gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that the flow of such food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms [[Microbial metabolism#Hydrogen oxidation|subsist on hydrogen]] released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.

The panspermia hypothesis does not attempt to explain how life first originated, but merely shifts it to another planet or a comet. The advantage of an extraterrestrial origin of primitive life is that life is not required to have formed on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a single location, and then spread about the [[galaxy]] to other star systems via cometary and/or meteorite impact.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth’s Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=12 September 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=12 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912225220/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |archivedate=12 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence to support the hypothesis is scant, but it finds support in studies of [[Martian meteorite]]s found in [[Antarctica]] and in studies of [[extremophile]] microbes' survival in outer space tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Stuart |date=25 September 2002 |title=Tough Earth bug may be from Mars |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2844 |journal=New Scientist |issn=0262-4079 |accessdate=2015-06-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202003401/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2844 |archivedate=2 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerda Horneck"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horneck |first1=Gerda |last2=Klaus |first2=David M. |last3=Mancinelli |first3=Rocco L. |date=March 2010 |title=Space Microbiology |journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=121–156 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00016-09 |issn=1092-2172 |pmc=2832349 |pmid=20197502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabbow"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rabbow |first1=Elke |last2=Horneck |first2=Gerda |last3=Rettberg |first3=Petra |last4=Schott |first4=Jobst-Ulrich |last5=Panitz |first5=Corinna |last6=L'Afflitto |first6=Andrea |last7=von Heise-Rotenburg |first7=Ralf |last8=Willnecker |first8=Reiner |last9=Baglioni |first9=Pietro |last10=Hatton |first10=Jason |last11=Dettmann |first11=Jan |last12=Demets |first12=René |last13=Reitz |first13=Günther |display-authors=3 |date=December 2009 |title=EXPOSE, an Astrobiological Exposure Facility on the International Space Station – from Proposal to Flight |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=581–598 |bibcode=2009OLEB...39..581R |doi=10.1007/s11084-009-9173-6 |issn=0169-6149 |pmid=19629743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Onofri |first1=Silvano |last2=de la Torre |first2=Rosa |last3=de Vera |first3=Jean-Pierre |last4=Ott |first4=Sieglinde |last5=Zucconi |first5=Laura |last6=Selbmann |first6=Laura |last7=Scalzi |first7=Giuliano |last8=Venkateswaran |first8=Kasthuri J. |last9=Rabbow |first9=Elke |last10=Sánchez Iñigo |first10=Francisco J. |last11=Horneck |first11=Gerda |display-authors=3 |date=May 2012 |title=Survival of Rock-Colonizing Organisms After 1.5 Years in Outer Space |journal=Astrobiology |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=508–516 |bibcode=2012AsBio..12..508O |doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0736 |issn=1531-1074 |pmid=22680696}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[List of microorganisms tested in outer space]].)

These molecules were not present on early Earth, but other [[Amphiphile|amphiphilic]] long-chain molecules also form membranes. Furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves the same size and composition of lipids in the two [[Offspring|progenies]]. The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage, and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favourably. Studies on vesicles from potentially prebiotic amphiphiles have so far been limited to systems containing one or two types of amphiphiles. This in contrast to the output of simulated prebiotic chemical reactions, which typically produce very heterogeneous mixtures of compounds.&lt;ref name="Chen 2010" /&gt;
Within the hypothesis of a lipid bilayer membrane composed of a mixture of various distinct amphiphilic compounds there is the opportunity of a huge number of theoretically possible combinations in the arrangements of these amphiphiles in the membrane. Among all these potential combinations, a specific local arrangement of the membrane would have favoured the constitution of a hypercycle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eigen |first1=Manfred |authorlink1=Manfred Eigen |last2=Schuster |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Schuster |date=November 1977 |title=The Hypercycle.

=== Polyphosphates ===
A problem in most scenarios of abiogenesis is that the thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is in the direction of separate amino acids. What has been missing is some force that drives polymerization. The resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of [[polyphosphate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Michael R.

Several mechanisms of organic molecule synthesis have been investigated. Polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides. They are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). A key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble [[calcium phosphate]] ([[apatite]]), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate. There has been much work on this topic over the years, but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pasek |first=Matthew A. |date=22 January 2008 |title=Rethinking early Earth phosphorus geochemistry |journal=Proc.

=== Radioactive beach hypothesis ===
Zachary Adam claims that tidal processes that occurred during a time when the Moon was much closer may have concentrated grains of [[uranium]] and other radioactive elements at the high-water mark on primordial beaches, where they may have been responsible for generating life's building blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dartnell |first=Lewis |date=12 January 2008 |title=Did life begin on a radioactive beach? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726384.000-did-life-begin-on-a-radioactive-beach.html |journal=New Scientist |issue=2638 |page=8 |issn=0262-4079 |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627101858/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726384.000-did-life-begin-on-a-radioactive-beach.html |archivedate=27 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to computer models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adam |first=Zachary |year=2007 |title=Actinides and Life's Origins |journal=Astrobiology |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=852–872 |bibcode=2007AsBio...7..852A |doi=10.1089/ast.2006.0066 |issn=1531-1074 |pmid=18163867}}&lt;/ref&gt; a deposit of such radioactive materials could show the same [[Natural nuclear fission reactor|self-sustaining nuclear reaction]] as that found in the [[Oklo]] uranium ore seam in [[Gabon]]. Such radioactive beach sand might have provided sufficient energy to generate organic molecules, such as amino acids and sugars from [[acetonitrile]] in water. Radioactive [[monazite]] material also has released soluble phosphate into the regions between sand-grains, making it biologically "accessible." Thus amino acids, sugars, and soluble phosphates might have been produced simultaneously, according to Adam. Radioactive [[actinide]]s, left behind in some concentration by the reaction, might have formed part of [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic complexes]]. These complexes could have been important early catalysts to living processes.

John Parnell has suggested that such a process could provide part of the "crucible of life" in the early stages of any early wet rocky planet, so long as the planet is large enough to have generated a system of plate tectonics which brings radioactive minerals to the surface. As the early Earth is thought to have had many smaller plates, it might have provided a suitable environment for such processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parnell |first=John |date=December 2004 |title=Mineral Radioactivity in Sands as a Mechanism for Fixation of Organic Carbon on the Early Earth |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=533–547 |bibcode=2004OLEB...34..533P |doi=10.1023/B:ORIG.0000043132.23966.a1 |issn=0169-6149 |pmid=15570707|citeseerx=10.1.1.456.8955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermodynamic dissipation ===
The 19th-century Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] first recognized that the struggle for existence of living organisms was neither over raw material nor [[energy]], but instead had to do with [[entropy production]] derived from the conversion of the solar [[spectrum]] into [[heat]] by these systems.&lt;ref&gt;Boltzmann, L. (1886) The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in: Ludwig Boltzmann: Theoretical physics and Selected writings, edited by: McGinness, B., D. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Boltzmann thus realized that living systems, like all [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible processes]], were dependent on the [[dissipation]] of a generalized chemical potential for their existence. In his book "What is Life", the 20th-century Austrian physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]]&lt;ref&gt;Schrödinger, Erwin (1944) What is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the importance of Boltzmann’s deep insight into the irreversible thermodynamic nature of living systems, suggesting that this was the physics and chemistry behind the origin and evolution of life. However, irreversible processes, and much less living systems, could not be conveniently analyzed under this perspective until [[Lars Onsager]],&lt;ref&gt;Onsager, L. (1931) Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes I and II, ''Phys. Rev.'' 37, 405; 38, 2265 (1931)&lt;/ref&gt; and later Ilya [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine]],&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I. (1967) An Introduction to the Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, Wiley, New York&lt;/ref&gt; developed an elegant mathematical formalism for treating the "self-organization" of material under a generalized chemical potential. This formalism became known as Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics and Prigogine was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1977 "for his contributions to [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]], particularly the theory of [[Dissipative system|dissipative structures]]". The analysis of Prigogine showed that if a [[system]] were left to evolve under an imposed external potential, material could spontaneously organize (lower its [[entropy]]) forming what he called "dissipative structures" which would increase the dissipation of the externally imposed potential (augment the global entropy production). Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has since been successfully applied to the analysis of living systems, from the biochemical production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dewar | first1 = R | last2 = Juretić | first2 = D. | last3 = Županović | first3 = P. | year = 2006 | title = The functional design of the rotary enzyme ATP synthase is consistent with maximum entropy production | url = | journal = Chem.

Michaelian has shown using the formalism of non-linear irreversible thermodynamics that there would have existed during the [[Archean]] a thermodynamic imperative to the abiogenic UV-C [[Photochemistry|photochemical]] synthesis and proliferation of these pigments over the entire Earth surface if they acted as [[Catalysis|catalysts]] to augment the dissipation of the solar photons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/475/1/012010 |title=A non-linear irreversible thermodynamic perspective on organic pigment proliferation and biological evolution |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=475 |issue=1 |pages=012010 |year=2013 |last1=Michaelian |first1=K |bibcode=2013JPhCS.475a2010M |arxiv=1307.5924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Archean, with life-induced [[ozone]] dissipating UV-C light in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, it would have become ever more improbable for a completely new life to emerge that didn’t rely on the complex metabolic pathways already existing since now the free energy in the photons arriving at Earth’s surface would have been insufficient for direct breaking and remaking of [[covalent bond]]s. It has been suggested, however, that such changes in the surface flux of ultraviolet radiation due to geophysical events affecting the atmosphere could have been what promoted the development of complexity in life based on existing metabolic pathways, for example during the [[Cambrian explosion]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Doglioni | first1 = C. | last2 = Pignatti | first2 = J. | last3 = Coleman | first3 = M. | year = 2016 | title = Why did life develop on the surface of the Earth in the Cambrian? | url = | journal = Geoscience Frontiers | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 865–873 | doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many salient characteristics of the fundamental molecules of life (those found in all three domains) all point directly to the involvement of UV-C light in the dissipative structuring of incipient life.&lt;ref name="Michaelian, K. 2016"/&gt; Some of the most difficult problems concerning the origin of life, such as enzyme-less [[DNA replication|replication]] of RNA and DNA, [[homochirality]] of the fundamental molecules, and the origin of [[Genetic code|information encoding]] in RNA and DNA, also find an explanation within the same dissipative thermodynamic framework by considering the probable existence of a relation between primordial replication and UV-C photon dissipation. Michaelian suggests that it is erroneous to expect to describe the emergence, proliferation, or even evolution, of life without overwhelming reference to entropy production through the dissipation of a generalized chemical potential, in particular, the prevailing solar photon flux.

=== Multiple genesis ===
Different forms of life with variable origin processes may have appeared quasi-simultaneously in the early [[history of Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davies |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Davies |date=December 2007 |title=Are Aliens Among Us? |url=http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/kalthoff/bio301c/readings/07Davies.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Scientific American |volume=297 |issue=6 |pages=62–69 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1207-62 |issn=0036-8733 |accessdate=2015-07-16 |quote=...if life does emerge readily under terrestrial conditions, then perhaps it formed many times on our home planet. To pursue this possibility, deserts, lakes and other extreme or isolated environments have been searched for evidence of "alien" life-forms—organisms that would differ fundamentally from known organisms because they arose independently. |bibcode=2007SciAm.297f..62D |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185832/http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/kalthoff/bio301c/readings/07Davies.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other forms may be extinct (having left distinctive fossils through their different biochemistry—e.g., [[hypothetical types of biochemistry]]). It has been proposed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first organisms were self-replicating iron-rich clays which fixed carbon dioxide into oxalic and other [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. This system of replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then evolved into the sulfide rich region of the hotspring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen. Finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. If biosynthesis recapitulates biopoiesis, then the synthesis of amino acids preceded the synthesis of the purine and pyrimidine bases. Furthermore the polymerization of the amino acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization of amino acid esters by polynucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hartman |first=Hyman |date=October 1998 |title=Photosynthesis and the Origin of Life |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=28 |issue=4–6 |pages=515–521 |bibcode=1998OLEB...28..515H |doi=10.1023/A:1006548904157 |issn=0169-6149 |pmid=11536891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Fluctuating hydrothermal pools on volcanic islands or proto-continents ===
[[Armid Mulkidjanian]] and co-authors think that the marine environments did not provide the [[ionic balance]] and composition universally found in cells, as well as of ions required by essential proteins and ribozymes found in virtually all living organisms, especially with respect to K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ratio, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and phosphate concentrations. The only known environments that mimic the needed conditions on Earth are found in [[terrestrial hydrothermal pool]]s fed by steam vents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, mineral deposits in these environments under an anoxic atmosphere would have suitable pH (as opposed to current pools in an oxygenated atmosphere), contain precipitates of sulfide minerals that block harmful UV radiation, have wetting/drying cycles that concentrate substrate solutions to concentrations amenable to spontaneous formation of polymers of nucleic acids, polyesters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chandru |first1=Kuhan |last2=Guttenberg |first2=Nicholas |last3=Giri |first3=Chaitanya |last4=Hongo |first4=Yayoi |last5=Butch |first5=Christopher |last6=Mamajanov |first6=Irena |last7=Cleaves |first7=H.

[[Bruce Damer]] and [[David Deamer]] have come to the conclusion that [[cell membrane]]s cannot be formed in salty [[seawater]], and must therefore have originated in freshwater. Before the continents formed, the only dry land on Earth would be volcanic islands, where rainwater would form ponds where lipids could form the first stages towards cell membranes. These predecessors of true cells are assumed to have behaved more like a [[superorganism]] rather than individual structures, where the porous membranes would house molecules which would leak out and enter other protocells. Only when true cells had evolved would they gradually adapt to saltier environments and enter the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Damer |first1=Bruce |last2=Deamer |first2=David |date=13 March 2015 |title=Coupled Phases and Combinatorial Selection in Fluctuating Hydrothermal Pools: A Scenario to Guide Experimental Approaches to the Origin of Cellular Life |journal=Life |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=872–887 |doi=10.3390/life5010872 |issn=2075-1729 |pmc=4390883 |pmid=25780958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colín-García ''et al.'' (2016) discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hydrothermal vents as primitive environments.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; They mention the exergonic reactions in such systems could have been a source of free energy that promoted chemical reactions, additional to their high mineralogical diversity which implies the induction of important chemical gradients, thus favoring the interaction between electron donors and acceptors. Colín-García ''et al.'' (2016) also summarize a set of experiments proposed to test the role of hydrothermal vents in prebiotic synthesis.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

=== Information theory ===
A theory that speaks to the origin of life on Earth and other rocky planets posits life as an [[Information theory|information system]] in which information content grows because of selection. Life must start with minimum possible information, or minimum possible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, and it requires thermodynamically free energy accessible by means of its information content. The most benign circumstances, minimum [[entropy]] variations with abundant free energy, suggest the [[Characterisation of pore space in soil|pore space]] in the first few kilometres of the surface. Free energy is derived from the condensed products of the chemical reactions taking place in the cooling nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Colgate| first=S.

{{Politics of Fiji}}
{{History of Fiji}}
The [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution of Fiji]], which had been abrogated by the interim military government of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]] (who organized a counter-coup to neutralize the civilian coup d'état instigated by [[George Speight]] in May 2000), was reinstated by the [[High Court of Fiji|High Court]] on 15 November that year.  This ruling was upheld by the [[Court of Appeal of Fiji|Court of Appeal]] on 1 March 2001.  Since then, a police investigation has begun (though it has proceeded too slowly for the satisfaction of some critics{{Who|date=May 2014}}), and a number of high-profile trials have taken place, resulting in the conviction and imprisonment of some members of the present government, which came to power in the wake of [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|the coup]].

It was announced on 2 May 2005 that 2499 people had been implicated to date in offences related to the coup. Eleven out of 24 alleged plotters had been tried, along with six executors of the coup.  Of 21 alleged financial supporters, none had been dealt with, and investigations were still in progress.  On 21 September, Home Affairs Minister [[Josefa Vosanibola]] announced that 556 people had been tried either thorough the justice system or by [[court martial]].  He rejected a call from [[Fiji Labour Party|Labour]] [[House of Representatives of Fiji|MP]] [[Ganesh Chand]] to name them, however, saying that many were either serving or had served their sentences, and that to name them would breach their privacy.  120 soldiers had been tried – 56 for their roles in the coup, 28 for the [[Sukanaivalu]] [[Mutinies of the 2000 Fijian coup d'état|mutiny]], and 38 for the [[Suva]] mutiny on 2 November 2000.  He said that there were currently 208 cases pending before the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (Fiji)|Director of Public Prosecutions]].  The charges ranged from [[unlawful assembly]] and public order breaches to murder, [[sedition]], and [[treason]]; apart from a few who were acquitted for lack of evidence, most had been convicted, Vosanibola said.

==Police investigation==
{{Main|Investigations since the 2000 Fijian coup d'état}}

A number of separate, but overlapping, investigations have been conducted by the police into various aspects of the 2000 coup.  Some of these investigations are ongoing as of 2005.  These investigations include the organization and financing of the coup, and the identity of the perpetrators.  Some have alleged that [[George Speight]] was only a front-man for a shadowy group of politicians and businessmen; former Prime Minister [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] is reported to be one of those under investigation.

Other cases being investigated include the removal of [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara]] from the [[President of Fiji|Presidency]] and the installation of an [[Interim Military Government (Fiji)|Interim Military Government]] by the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]] Commander, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]], and an alleged plot to remove the subsequently appointed President, [[Josefa Iloilo|Ratu Josefa Iloilo]].

[[Law enforcement in Fiji|Police Commissioner]] [[Andrew Hughes (police)|Andrew Hughes]] revealed on 4 January 2006 that a total of seven major investigations related to the coup were in progress, with four offices assigned to them full-time.  Three files had been reopened, he said, following allegations made by [[Maciu Navakasuasua]], a coup-convict, and [[Josaia Waqabaca]], a self-declared party to the planning of the coup.

==Controversial trials and verdicts==
{{Main|Trials since the 2000 Fijian coup d'état}}

A number of prominent participants in the coup have been tried, and some convicted, in 2004 and 2005.  Many of those tried have links to the present government, which has come under criticism from some quarters for releasing on parole some of the persons convicted.

==Reconciliation commission proposed==
Prime Minister Qarase announced on 4 May 2005 that the government would establish a "[[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation and Unity Commission]]" empowered to recommend [[amnesty]] for persons involved in the coup, provided that their motive had been "political" and that they had not done so with "criminal intent." [[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Opposition Leader]] Chaudhry condemned the proposed Commission, alleging that it would be a cover for pardoning members of the present government who were implicated in the coup.  Chaudhry insisted that one set of rules should apply to everyone, regardless of their position in society, and regardless of their motives for having broken the law.  He was supported by [[National Alliance Party of Fiji|National Alliance Party]] president [[Ratu]] [[Epeli Ganilau]] and by [[United Peoples Party (Fiji)|United Peoples Party]] leader [[Mick Beddoes]].  Ganilau said that the notion that politically motivated crimes could be justified was ''"insulting to the intelligence of ordinary people,"'' and that it  represented a naive and uncaring attitude toward the hurt suffered by many during the 2000 coup.  ''"The intention to bring a closure to investigations and litigation regarding the 2000 coup would be a severe interference of politics into the work of law enforcement in this country,"'' Ganilau said. On 18 May, he added that he saw "nothing reconciliatory about the bill," which he believed to be aimed at legalizing the [[Muanikau Accord]], which had been proposed by George Speight in 2000. ''"To use the word reconciliation is a gross violation of the rights of everyone in this nation,"'' he said.  Beddoes, for his part, called the proposal a recipe for disaster which would license any would-be political activist who wanted to engage in coups, to do so.  He accused the government of kow-towing to its junior [[coalition]] partner, the [[Conservative Alliance-Matanitu Vanua|Conservative Alliance]], on which it depends for its parliamentary majority, in order to keep them on board until the next [[Fijian general election, 2006|parliamentary election]], expected for 2006.  On 7 May, [[Koila Nailatikau|Adi Koila Nailatikau]] added her own voice to the opposition to the commission, saying that if her father were alive, he would not approve of interfering with the course of justice, and that unless all perpetrators of the coup were brought to justice, ''"Fiji cannot put to rest the ghosts of the coup."'' Yet another opponent of the proposal is [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]], who has called the bill "Reconciliation bull."

==Expulsion of Ridgeway==
On 3 May 2005, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, [[Peter Ridgeway]], resigned in protest against political interference in the judicial system, namely the early release of prisoners.  On 20 June, he was ordered to leave Fiji and return to his native Australia after Prime Minister Qarase vetoed a two-month extension of his contract.  Ridgeway had been responsible for a number of high-profile prosecutions, and opposition politicians thought that his dismissal and expulsion were politically motivated.

Speaking on [[ABC Radio Australia]], [[Attorney-General of Fiji|Attorney-General]] [[Qoriniasi Bale]] said that it was the government's prerogative to decide on the employment of [[foreign worker]]s in the civil service.  Ridgeway's contract had been for a fixed term and had already expired.  ''"It was subject to renewal at the option of the employer,"'' Bale said. ''"It is not at his option or the option of any other person who may support him or whatever else."''  He denied that there was anything sinister about refusing Ridgeway the requested two-month contract extension to complete cases he had been working on.

Ridgeway's expulsion was condemned by [[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Opposition Leader]] [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] and by [[United Peoples Party (Fiji)|United Peoples Party]] leader [[Mick Beddoes]], who claimed that the decision motivated by Ridgeway's prosecution of persons close to the government.  He said that "two very prominent figures" were among those being pursued by Ridgeway; he did not name them, but one is believed to be former Prime Minister [[Sitiveni Rabuka]].  Beddoes predicted that these cases would ''"now gather dust."''

On 23 June, Police Commissioner [[Andrew Hughes (police)|Andrew Hughes]] said he hoped that Ridgeway's expulsion would not affect the investigations and prosecutions underway.  The Australian [[High Commission]] in [[Suva]] also said that it had been in touch with Fiji's Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the matter.  It did not give details.  Foreign Minister [[Kaliopate Tavola]] was "too busy" to comment at the immediately, but later said that he had discussed the affair with Australia's [[High Commissioner]], [[Jennifer Rawlins]].  Relations with Australia, he said, would have to go on despite the "unfortunate" circumstances surrounding the dismissal of Ridgeway in what he called ''"a one-off situation."''  He did not believe the controversy would tarnish Fiji's image.

The Military commander, Commodore Bainimarama, reacted angrily to Ridgeway's expulsion, saying on 25 June that it would seriously hinder investigations, which would have to start all over again.  Ridgeway himself concurred.  ''"There is nobody in the DPP’s office who has the knowledge of the coup cases that I do,"'' he said. ''"And the reason for that is obvious: I have had an instrumental role in each and every coup case; I know it backwards. Nobody knows it as well as I do. For somebody to read into those sort of cases would be a six months job."''

Bainimarama further alleged that Ridgeway was ''"almost closing in on"'' some major perpetrators of the coup when he was ordered to leave.

==Compensation lawsuit==
Forty-nine [[Parliament of Fiji|parliamentarians]] from the [[Fiji Labour Party]] and their [[People's Coalition (Fiji)|People's Coalition]] partners in the 1999–2000 government have been suing George Speight and co-conspirator [[Timoci Silatolu]] for compensation.  Former [[Law enforcement in Fiji|Police Commissioner]] [[Isikia Savua]], whom the late [[President of Fiji|President]] [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara]] accused in his last recorded interview of involvement in the coup, is being sued also.  The plaintiffs have been ordered by the court to cover the travel expenses of Savua, who is now Fiji's Ambassador to the United Nations in New York.

It was announced on 25 July 2005 that the hearing had been postponed to 12 August.

In addition, former Prime Minister Chaudhry, along with some others who were held as hostages during the coup crisis (including his son [[Rajendra Chaudhry|Rajendra]]), are preparing to sue the government for what they say was Military and Police negligence.  They allege that the Military and Police knew that a coup was likely, and did nothing about it.  ''"They did not take the necessary steps to insulate the Prime Minister, Government Ministers, Parliamentarians and other staff against the threats,"'' said Rajendra Chaudhry.''"As a result of their negligence, I had to endure physical torture and psychological trauma and am seeking compensation for these and related matters."''  On 15 August, Rajendra announced that he was suing for [[Fijian dollar|F$500,000]], to cover loss of superannuation, medical expenses, and loss of future earnings. He said that his lawsuit was separate from his father's.

A pre-trial conference for the lawsuit laid by the [[Fiji Labour Party]] will be held in the [[High Court of Fiji|High Court]] on 9 September.  Lawyer [[Vipul Misha]] is representing both Mahendra and Rajendra Chaudhry, as well as Dr [[Ganesh Chand]], [[Giyannendra Prasad]], [[Anand Singh]], and the estate of [[Muthu Sami]].  A [[Queens Counsel]] has been asked to join the team.

On 31 August, Justice [[Gerard Winter]] decided to adjourn until 30 September the hearing of the lawsuit of former FLP parliamentarians [[Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi]] and [[Gaffar Ahmed]], after defence lawyer [[Akuila Naco]] asked for more time to prepare his case.

On 15 September, Justice Winter set 14 October for Mahendra Chaudhry's compensation trial to begin.  He refused a request from Timoci Silatolu's lawyer for a Military investigation into the 2000 upheaval to be made public, after the Military lawyer claimed Military privilege.

Speight and his co-defendants appeared in Court on 27 January 2006 for a preliminary hearing, pending the full hearing scheduled for 1 May.

'''''Artis Historicae Penus''''' (''Treasury of the Art of History'', 1579) is a compilation of 18 [[ars historica]] works brought out in 1579 by the late [[Renaissance]] [[Basel]] printer [[Pietro Perna]]. This compendium in [[octavo]] appeared in 2 volumes with a copious index. A third volume adds the final work by {{Interlanguage link multi|Antonio Riccoboni|it}}, often missing in library collections as a separate edition. Three years earlier, in 1576, Perna brought out a single volume in the same format that ran to 1140 pages and featured the central work of Jean Bodin in its title, along with twelve other authors. Perna writes a letter to the lover of histories (Historiarum amatori Typographus). Editor Johann Wolf dedicates the second collection to [[Frederick I of Wurttemberg]]. He states that he has included all the princely dedications and prefaces of the single works from the source editions for the sake of completeness.
 
In addition to the two standard Greek texts of the [[ars historica]] translated into Latin, the authors, editors and translators are an international list of the most notable  humanist writers on history of the period. There are several Catholics, but those closest to the Perna press were Protestants.  Among them are six Italians, four Germans, three Frenchmen, a Spaniard and a Hungarian. As [[humanism|humanist]] members of the Renaissance [[Res Publica Litterarum]] all wrote in Latin, though Stupano translated Patrizi's ''Dieci Dialoghi'' for Perna. The dates of the editions used by Perna follow the authors' names.

The [[ars historica]] and its classical [[exempla]] were important pedagogical tools for the education of princes, treasured for the lessons in statecraft found in histories. They also served as an antidote to the influence of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]].     
The [[Counter Reformation]] [[polyhistor]] [[Antonio Possevino]] fathered a [[Jesuit]] [[ars historica]] to replace the influence of Bodin and the heterodox authors of the Perna collection in his [[Bibliotheca selecta]] 1593 and expanded it to an [[Apparatus ad omnium gentium historiam]] 1597.

The '''Baby Scoop Era''' was a period in [[anglosphere]] history starting after the end of [[World War II]] and ending in the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babyscoopera.com The Baby Scoop Era Research Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; characterized by an increased rate of [[Premarital sex|pre-marital pregnancies]] over the preceding period, along with a higher rate of newborn [[adoption]].

==History==

===In the United States===
From 1945 to 1973, it is estimated that up to 4 million parents in the [[United States]] had children placed for adoption, with 2 million during the 1960s alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/adoptionstatistics.htm |title=Adoption Statistics |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=The Adoption History Project |publisher=University of Oregon |accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual numbers for non-relative adoptions increased from an estimated 33,800 in 1951 to a peak of 89,200 in 1970, then quickly declined to an estimated 47,700 in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Pelton, L. (1988). "The Institution of Adoption: Its Sources and Perpetuation" in ''Infertility and Adoption, A Guide for Social Work Practice'', Deborah Valentine, Editor. (pp. 88–89)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maza"&gt;[http://www.uoregon.edu/~adoption/archive/MazaAT.htm Maza, P.L. (1984). Adoption trends: 1944–1975.] Child Welfare Research Notes #9. Washington, D.C.: Administration for Children, Youth, and Families, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  (This does not include the number of infants adopted and raised by relatives.&lt;ref name="Maza" /&gt;) In contrast, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] estimates that only 14,000 infants were placed for adoption in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/s_place.cfm U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Child Welfare Information Gateway (2005).  Voluntary Relinquishment for Adoption:  Numbers and Trends]&lt;/ref&gt;

This period of history has been documented in scholarly books such as ''Wake Up Little Susie'' and ''Beggars and Choosers'', both by historian [[Rickie Solinger]], and social histories such as the book ''[[The Girls Who Went Away]]'' and the documentary, ''[[A Girl Like Her]]'', based on the book by Ann Fessler.  Fessler is a professor of photography at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] who exhibited an [[art installation]] titled ''The Girls Who Went Away''.  It is also the theme of the documentary "Gone To A Good Home" by [[Film Australia]].

Beginning in the 1940s and 1950s, [[illegitimacy]] began to be defined in terms of psychological deficits on the part of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;Solinger, R. (2000). ''Wake Up Little Susie: Single Pregnancy and Race Before Roe v. Wade.'' (p. 88)&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, a liberalization of sexual mores combined with restrictions on access to [[birth control]] led to an increase in premarital pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, A. (1998). ''Gone to an Aunt's: Remembering Canada's Homes for Unwed Mothers.'' (pp. 7–8)&lt;/ref&gt;  The dominant psychological and social work view was that the large majority of unmarried mothers were better off being separated by adoption from their newborn babies.&lt;ref&gt;O'Shaughnassy, T. (1994). ''Adoption, [[Social Work]], and Social Theory'' (p. 115)&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Mandell (2007), "In most cases, adoption was presented to the mothers as the only option and little or no effort was made to help the mothers keep and raise the children".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue42/Mandell42.htm Mandell, B. (2007). "Adoption."] ''New Politics'', Vol. 11, No. 2, Winter 2007, Whole No. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Solinger describes the social pressures that led to this unusual trend, explaining that women who had no control over their reproductive lives were defined by psychological theory as "not-mothers", and that because they had no control over their reproductive lives, they were subject to the ideology of those who watched over them. As such, for unmarried pregnant girls and women in the pre-''[[Roe v. Wade|Roe]]'' era, the main chance for attaining home and marriage rested on their acknowledging their alleged shame and guilt, and this required relinquishing their children, with more than 80% of unwed mothers in maternity homes acting in essence as "breeders" for adoptive parents.&lt;ref&gt;Solinger, R. (2000). ''Wake Up Little Susie: Single Pregnancy and Race Before Roe v. Wade.'' (p. 95)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellison, from 1960 to 1970, 27 percent of all births to married women between the ages of 15 and 29 were conceived [[Premarital Sex#United States|premaritally]]. This problem was thought to be caused by female [[neurosis]], and those who could not procure an [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]], legally or otherwise, were encouraged to put up their children for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ellison, M.|year=2003|title=Authoritative Knowledge and Single Women's Unintentional Pregnancies, Abortions, Adoption and Single Motherhood: Social Stigma and Structural Violence|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|volume=17|issue=3|page=326|pmid=12974201|doi=10.1525/maq.2003.17.3.322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular usage, singer Celeste Billhartz uses the term "baby scoop era" on her website to refer to the era covered by her work "The Mothers Project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About The Mothers Project ...|author=Celeste Billhartz|work=The Mothers Project|url=http://www.themothersproject.com/about/aboutTMP.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billfinch.org/blog/archive/2006_04_09_archive.html |title=More Adoption Support |date=April 15, 2006 |work=BillFinch.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016172238/http://billfinch.org/blog/archive/2006_04_09_archive.html |archivedate=2007-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on Senator [[Bill Finch (politician)|Bill Finch]]'s website uses the term as well. Writer Betty Mandell references the term in her article "Adoption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Adoption|author=Betty Reid Mandell|url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue42/Mandell42.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922060843/http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue42/Mandell42.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2008 |deadurl=no|volume=XI|number=2|journal=New Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also used in a 2004 edition of the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, B. "World of Adoption; Forced to Give Up Her Baby, She Now Opposes Adoption," ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'', November 21, 2004, p. G-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Infant adoptions began declining in the early 1970s, a decline often attributed to the decreasing birth rate, but which also partially resulted from social and legal changes that enabled  middle-class mothers to have an alternative [[single mother]]hood.

The decline in the fertility rate is associated with the introduction of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] in 1960, the completion of legalization of [[birth control|artificial birth control]] methods, the introduction of [[Title X|federal funding]] to make [[family planning]] services more available to the young and low income, and the legalization of abortion.

Brozinsky (1994) speaks of the decline in newborn adoptions as reflecting a freedom of choice embraced by youth and the women's movement of the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in an increase in the number of unmarried mothers who parented their babies as opposed to having them taken for adoption purposes. "In 1970, approximately 80% of the infants born to single mothers were [...] [taken for adoption purposes], whereas by 1983 that figure had dropped to only 4%."&lt;ref&gt;Brozinsky, A. (1994). "Surrendering an Infant for Adoption:  The Birthmother Experience".  In ''The Psychology of Adoption'', D. Brozinsky and M. Schechter (Eds.).  New York:  Oxford University Press. (p. 297)&lt;/ref&gt;  

In contrast to numbers in the 1960s and 1970s, from 1989 to 1995 fewer than 1% of children born to never-married women were surrendered for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Chandra, A., Abma, J., Maza, P., &amp; Bachrach, C. (1999). [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad306.pdf "Adoption, adoption seeking, and relinquishment for adoption in the United States"]. Advance Data (No. 306) from Vital and Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National center for Health Statistics, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Retrieved February 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Commonwealth===
A similar social development took place in the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uktrackers.co.uk/ti_survey.htm Trackers International, "Survey 1000"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref&gt;Shawyer, J. (1979). ''Death by Adoption''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;Moor, M. (2007).  ''[http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20070111.172012/index.html Silent Violence: Australia's White Stolen Children]''. A thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirement for the Doctorate of Philosophy in Arts, Media and Culture at Griffith University, Nathan, Qld.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, A. (1998).  ''Gone to an Aunt's: Remembering Canada's Homes for Unwed Mothers''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Canada====
Canada's "Baby Scoop Era" refers to the postwar period from 1945 to 1988, when over 400,000 unmarried pregnant persons, mostly aged 15–19 (usually Caucasian), were targeted for their yet-to-be-born infants, simply because they were unmarried with a child. A large number of these young women were confined as inmates in maternity group homes, which were managed by religious orders, such as the [[The Salvation Army, Canada|Salvation Army]], the [[Catholic Church in Canada|Catholic Church]], the [[United Church of Canada|United Church]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican Church]] etc. These maternity "homes" were heavily funded by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]]. There were over 70 maternity homes in Canada which housed between 20 and 200 pregnant women at a time. In Canadian maternity "homes" and hospitals, up to 100% of newborns were removed from their legal mothers after birth and given up for adoption purposes. These newborns were taken under a Health and Welfare protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Leigh Ann|title=Taken|journal=Anglican Journal|date=May 13, 2014|url=http://www.anglicanjournal.com/articles/taken|accessdate=July 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some professionals of the era considered that the punishment of the mother for her transgression was an important part of the process. Dr. Marion Hilliard of [[Women's College Hospital]] was quoted in 1956 saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;The father plays absolutely no part in this. That is part of her rehabilitation. When she renounces her child for its own good, the unwed mother has learned a lot. She has learned an important human value. She has learned to pay the price of her misdemeanor, and this alone, if punishment is needed, is punishment enough...We must go back to a primary set of values and the discipline that starts with the very small child.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Howarth, “Mothers not all unhappy”, ''The Toronto Telegram'', November 22, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The term Baby Scoop Era is similar to the term [[Sixties Scoop]], which was coined by Patrick Johnston, author of ''Native Children and the Child Welfare System''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research2.csci.educ.ubc.ca/indigenation/Indian_ReACTions/Indian_ReACTions/SixtiesScoop.htm Reder, D. (2007). ''Indian re:ACT(ions)''] University of British Columbia&lt;/ref&gt; "Sixties Scoop" refers to the Canadian practice, beginning in the 1960s and continuing until the late 1980s, of apprehending unusually high numbers of Native children over the age of 5 years old from their families and fostering or adopting them out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_01.13.00/news/nation.php Lyons, T. (2000). "Stolen Nation,"] in ''Eye Weekly'', January 13, 2000. Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar event happened in Australia where Aboriginal children, sometimes referred to as the [[Stolen Generation]], were removed from their families and placed into internment camps, orphanages and other institutions.

====In Australia====
A similar period of [[forced adoption in Australia|forced adoption]], also known as the "White Stolen Generations", also occurred in Australia. It is generally understood that a decline of adoption during the 1970s was linked to a 1973 law providing for financial assistance to single parents.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Paper No. 366, Standing Committee on Social Issues, Report on Adoption Practices, Second Interim Report, Transcripts of Evidence, 16 June 1999 – 25 October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Billy the Kid Trail''', or Broken Trail is a national scenic byway that runs from [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]] through [[Capitan, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Billy the Kid Trail"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/2062/maps|title=Billy the Kid Trail|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trail was allegedly once used by [[William H Bonnie]] aka [[Billy The Kid]] and his group during the [[Lincoln County War]]. After a trail nicknamed "The Mexican Blackbird" was proven to be false, Bonnie along with Regulators Charlie Bowdre, Doc Skurlock, David "Biff" Richards, Dirty Steve Stevens, Richard "Dick" Brewer, Jose Chavez y Chavez, Douglas Bartolotta, "Arkansas" Dave Rudabaugh, Cory Windelspecht, Henry William French, and Tom "Tommy" O'Filliard rode this trail while fighting the Murphy/Dolan faction during the Lincoln County War in response to the death of [[John Tunstall]].

Dilke ''The Roman Land Surveyors'', p. 134, 1992 (1971), {{ISBN|90-256-1000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), also known as '''Roman grid''', was a method of land measurement used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. In many cases land divisions based on the survey formed a [[field system]], often referred to in modern times by the same name. According to [[O. A. W. Dilke]],&lt;ref&gt;O.A.W.Dilke ''The Roman Land Surveyors'', p. 34, 1992 (1971), {{ISBN|90-256-1000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; centuriation combined and developed features of land surveying present in Egypt, Etruria, Greek towns and Greek countryside.

Centuriation is characterised by the regular layout of a square [[grid plan|grid]] traced using [[Surveying|surveyors']] instruments. It may appear in the form of [[Roman roads|roads]], canals and agricultural plots. In some cases these plots, when formed, were allocated to [[Roman army]] veterans in a new [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], but they might also be returned to the indigenous inhabitants, as at Orange (France).&lt;ref&gt;A. Piganiol, ''Les documents cadastraux de la colonie romaine d'Orange'', XVIe supplément à ''Gallia'', Paris, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of centuriation is very important for reconstructing [[landscape history]] in many former areas of the [[Roman empire]].

==History==
The Romans began to use centuriation for the foundation, in the fourth century BCE, of new [[Roman colony|colonies]] in the ''ager Sabinus'', northeast of Rome. The development of the geometric and operational characteristics that were to become standard came with the founding of the Roman colonies in the [[Po valley]], starting with ''Ariminum'' ([[Rimini]]) in 268 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''Studi di storia romana e di diritto'', p. 415, 2001, {{ISBN|88-87114-70-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agrarian law introduced by [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133 BCE, which included the privatisation of the ''[[ager publicus]]'', gave a great impetus to land division through centuriation.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''op. cit.,'' p. 416, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuriation was used later for [[land reclamation]] and the foundation of new colonies as well as  for the allocation of land to veterans of the many civil wars of the late Republic and early Empire, including the [[battle of Philippi]] in 42 BCE. This is mentioned by [[Virgil]], in his [[Eclogues]], when he complains explicitly about the allocation of his lands near [[Mantua]] to the soldiers who had participated in that battle.

Centuriation was widely used throughout [[Italy]] and also in some provinces. For example, careful analysis has identified, in the area between [[Rome]] and [[Salerno]], 80 different centuriation systems created at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Giacinto Libertini, ''Persistenza di luoghi e toponimi nelle terre delle antiche città di Atella e Acerrae'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==System and procedure==
Various land division systems were used, but the most common was known as the ''ager centuriatus'' system.

The surveyor first identified a central viewpoint, the ''umbilicus agri'' or ''umbilicus soli''. He then took up his position there and, looking towards the west, defined the territory with the following names:
* ''ultra'', the land he saw in front of him;
* ''citra'', the land behind him;
* ''dextera'', the land to his right;
* ''sinistra'', the land to his left.

He then traced the grid using an instrument known as a [[Groma surveying|groma]], tracing two road axes  perpendicular to each other:
* the first, generally oriented east-west, was called ''[[decumanus maximus]]'', which was traced taking as reference the place where the sun rose in order to know exactly where east was;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bell | first=Anders | title=Castra et urbs romana: An Examination of the Common Features of Roman Settlements in Italy and the Empire and a System to aid in the Discovery of their Origins. | work=CAC Undergraduate Essay Contest for 2000-2001 | publisher=Classical Association of Canada | year=2001 | url=http://cac-scec.ca/concours_essais/01Bell.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the second, with a north-south orientation, was called ''[[cardo maximus]]''.

==Measurement instruments==
* [[Groma surveying|Groma]]
* [[Chorobates]] for levels
* [[Dioptra]] for levels and angles of slopes

==Orientation==
[[File:NE-PLSS.JPG|thumb|left|Example of road system in a PLSS area; [[Nebraska]] – US grid system]]
[[File:Centurisation.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Centuriation near [[Cesena]], [[Italy]], in a late nineteenth century Italian military map – Roman grid system]]
It has been suggested that the Roman centuriation system inspired [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s proposal to  create a grid of [[Survey township|townships]] for survey purposes, which ultimately led to the [[United States]] [[Public Land Survey System]]. The similarity of the two systems is empirically obvious in certain parts of Italy, for example, where traces of centuriation have remained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=1451&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Thrower points out that, unlike the later US system, ''"not all Roman centuriation displays consistent orientation"''.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Joseph William Thrower, "Maps &amp; civilization: cartography in culture and society", The University of Chicago Press,  Chicago, 1972, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because, for practical reasons, the orientation of the axes did not always coincide with the four cardinal points and followed instead the orographic features of the area, also taking into account the slope of the land and the flow of rainwater along the drainage channels that were traced (centuriation of [[Florentia]] ([[Florence]]). In other cases, it was based on the orientation of existing lines of communication (centuriation along the [[Via Emilia]]) or other geomorphological features.

Centuriation is typical of flat land, but centuriation systems have also been documented in hilly country.

== Centuriation of the surrounding territory ==
Sometimes the ''umbilicus agri'' was located in a city or a [[castrum]]. This central point was generally referred to as ''groma'', from the name of the instrument used by the ''[[gromatici]]'' (surveyors).

In such cases, the grid was traced by extending the urban ''cardo maximus'' and  the ''decumanus maximus'' through the gates of the city into the surrounding agricultural land.

Parallel secondary roads (''limites quintarii'') were then traced on both sides of the initial axes at intervals of 100 ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|actus]]'' (about 3.5&amp;nbsp;km). The territory was thus divided into square areas.

The road network density was then increased with other roads parallel to those already traced at a distance from each other of 20 ''actus'' (710.40 m). Each of the square areas – 20 × 20 ''actus'' – resulting from this further division was called a ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|centuria]]'' or ''century''.

This dimension of the ''centuria'' became prevalent in the period when the large areas of the Po Valley were delimited, while smaller centuries of 10&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10 ''actus'', as the name ''centuria'' suggests, had formerly been used.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Laffi ''op. cit.,'' page 415, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The land was divided after the completion of the roads.

Each century was divided into 10 strips, lying parallel to the ''cardo'' and the ''decumanus'', with  a distance between them of 2 ''actus'' (71.04 m), thus forming 100 squares (''heredia'') of about 0.5 hectares each: 100 ''heredia'' =  1 ''centuria''.

Each ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|heredium]]'' was divided in half along the north-south axis thus creating two ''jugera'': one ''[[jugerum]]'', from ''jugum'' (yoke), measured 2523 square metres, which was the amount of land that could be ploughed in one day by a pair of oxen.

==Regions where centuriation was used==
Even today, in some parts of Italy, the landscape of the plain is determined by the outcome of Roman centuriation, with the persistence of straight elements (roads, drainage canals, property divisions) which have survived territorial development and are often basic elements of urbanisation, at least until the twentieth century, when the human pressure of urban growth and infrastructures destroyed many of the traces scattered throughout the agricultural countryside.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13056">'''Chronological dating''', or simply '''dating''', is the process of attributing to an object or event a date in the past, allowing such object or event to be located in a previously established [[chronology]]. This usually requires what is commonly known as a "dating method". Several dating methods exist, depending on different criteria and techniques, and some very well known examples of disciplines using such techniques are, for example, [[history]], [[archaeology]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]], [[astronomy]] and even [[forensic science]], since in the latter it is sometimes necessary to investigate the moment in the past in which the death of a [[cadaver]] occurred.

== Dating methods ==

Dating methods are most commonly classified following two criteria: [[relative dating]] and [[absolute dating]].

=== Relative dating ===
{{Main article|Relative dating}}
[[Relative dating]] methods are unable to determine the absolute age of an object or event, but can determine the impossibility of a particular event happening before or after another event of which the absolute date is well known. In this relative dating method, [[Latin]] terms ''[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]'' and ''[[Terminus post quem|post quem]]'' are usually used to indicate both the oldest and the most recent possible moments when an event occurred or an artifact was left in a [[stratum]]. But this method is also useful in many other disciplines. Historians, for example, know that Shakespeare's play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' was not written before 1587 because Shakespeare's primary source for writing his play was the second edition of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'', not published until 1587.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, Clayton A. "Shakespeare's Use of The Famous Victories of Henry V," Notes &amp; Queries. n. s. 1 (June, 1954): 238-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 1587 is the ''post quem'' dating of Shakespeare's play ''Henry V''. That means that the play was without fail written after (in Latin, ''post'') 1587.

The same inductive mechanism is applied in archaeology, geology and paleontology, by many ways. For example, in a stratum presenting difficulties or ambiguities to absolute dating, [[paleopalynology]] can be used as a relative referent by means of the study of the pollens found in the stratum. This is admitted because of the simple reason that some botanical species, whether extinct or not, are well known as belonging to a determined position in the scale of time.

For a non-exhaustive list of relative dating methods and relative dating applications used in geology, paleontology or archaeology, see the following:

* [[Cross-cutting relationships]]
* [[Harris matrix]]
* [[Law of included fragments]]
* [[Law of superposition]]
* [[Principle of original horizontality]]
* [[Principle of lateral continuity]]
* [[Principle of faunal succession]]
* [[Melt inclusions]]
* [[Nitrogen dating]]
* [[Fluorine absorption dating]]
* [[Seriation (archaeology)]]
* [[Sequence dating]] (a type of seriation)
* [[Palynology]] (the study of modern-dated pollens for the relative dating of archaeological strata, also used in [[forensic palynology]])
* [[Paleopalynology]] (also spelt "Palaeopalynology", the study of fossilized pollens for the relative dating of geological strata)
* [[Morphology (archaeology)]]
* [[Typology (archaeology)]]
* [[Varnish microlamination]]
* [[Vole clock]]
* Lead corrosion dating&lt;ref&gt;Chemistry Professor Shimon Reich, a specialist in [[superconductivity]], has demonstrated a method for dating artifacts based on the magnetic properties of [[lead]], a material widely used in Israel and elsewhere in antiquity.  Reich and coworkers found that at cryogenic temperatures, lead becomes a superconductor, but the corrosion products formed from centuries of exposure to air and water ([[lead oxide]] and [[lead carbonate]]) do not superconduct.  On the basis of magnetic measurements and comparison with artifacts that were known (using other techniques) to be up to 2500 years old, the group showed that the mass of lead corrosion products is directly proportional to an object's age (New Journal of Physics, 2003, 5, 99)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Jacoby, "[https://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/85/8510cover.html Chemistry in the Holy Land]", ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News'', 5 March 2007, page 20, published by American Chemical Society&lt;/ref&gt; (exclusively used in archaeology)
* [[Paleomagnetism]]
* [[Tephrochronology]]
* [[Marine isotope stage]]s based on the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]

=== Absolute dating ===
{{Main article|Absolute dating}}
[[Absolute dating]] methods, by using absolute referent criteria, mainly include the [[radiometric dating]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=radioactive dating|file=R05082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of both radiometric and non-radiometric absolute dating methods are the following:

== Dating methods in archaeology ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dating methodologies in archaeology]] --&gt;
Same as [[Geology|geologists]] or [[paleontology|paleontologists]], [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] are also brought to determine the age of ancient materials, but in their case, the areas of their studies are restricted to the history of both ancient and recent humans. Thus, to be considered as archaeological, the remains, objects or artifacts to be dated must be related to human activity. It is commonly assumed that if the remains or elements to be dated are older than the human species, the disciplines which study them are sciences such geology or paleontology, among some others.

Nevertheless, the range of time within archaeological dating can be enormous compared to the average lifespan of a singular human being. As an example [[Pinnacle Point]]'s caves, in the southern coast of [[South Africa]], provided evidence that marine resources (shellfish) have been regularly exploited by humans as of 170,000 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} On the other hand, remains as recent as a hundred years old can also be the target of archaeological dating methods. It was the case of an [[18th century|18th-century]] [[sloop]] whose [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] was led in [[South Carolina]] ([[United States]]) in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nauticalarch.org/projects/clydesdale-plantation-18th-century-sloop-excavation/ Clydesdale Plantation 18th-Century Sloop Excavation]", [[Institute of Nautical Archaeology]], Texas, USA&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from the oldest to the youngest, all [[archaeological site]]s are likely to be dated by an appropriate method.

Dating material drawn from the [[archaeological record]] can be made by a direct study of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], or may be deduced by [[Archaeological association|association]] with materials found in the [[archaeological context|context]] the item is drawn from or inferred by its point of discovery in the [[Sequence (archaeological)|sequence]] relative to datable contexts. Dating is carried out mainly [[post excavation]], but to support good practice, some preliminary dating work called "spot dating" is usually run in tandem with [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]. Dating is very important in archaeology for constructing models of the past, as it relies on the integrity of dateable objects and samples. Many disciplines of [[archaeological science]] are concerned with dating evidence, but in practice several different dating techniques must be applied in some circumstances, thus dating evidence for much of an archaeological sequence recorded during excavation requires matching information from known absolute or some associated steps, with a careful study of [[Relationship (archaeology)|stratigraphic relationships]].

In addition, because of its particular relation with past human presence or past human activity, archaeology uses almost all the dating methods that it shares with the other sciences, but with some particular variations, like the following:

===Written markers===
* [[Epigraphy]] – analysis of inscriptions, via identifying graphemes, clarifying their meanings, classifying their uses according to dates and cultural contexts, and drawing conclusions about the writing and the writers.
* [[Numismatics]] – many coins have the date of their production written on them or their use is specified in the historical record.
* [[Palaeography]] – the study of ancient writing, including the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts.

=== Seriation ===
[[Seriation (archaeology)|Seriation]] is a relative dating method (see, above, the list of relative dating methods). An example of a practical application of seriation, is the comparison of the known [[Style (visual arts)#Style in archaeology|style]] of artifacts such as [[stone tool]]s or pottery.

===Age-equivalent stratigraphic markers===
* [[Paleomagnetism]] (a relative dating method, see the corresponding list above)
* [[Marine isotope stage]]s based on the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]] (a relative dating method, see the corresponding list above)
* [[Tephrochronology]] (an absolute dating method, see the corresponding list above)

=== Stratigraphic relationships ===

The [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphy]] of an archaeological site can be used to date, or refine the date, of particular activities ("contexts") on that site. For example, if a context is sealed between two other contexts of known date, it can be inferred that the middle context must date to between those dates.

{{Marxism|Schools of thought}}
'''Classical Marxism''' refers to the economic, philosophical and sociological theories expounded by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] as contrasted with later developments in [[Marxism]], especially [[Leninism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]].

==Karl Marx==
[[File:Marx4.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] in 1861]]
{{details|Karl Marx}}
Karl Heinrich Marx (May 5, 1818, [[Trier]], [[German Confederation|Germany]] &amp;ndash; March 14, 1883, [[London]]) was an immensely influential German [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]], [[political economist]] and [[revolutionary socialist]]. Marx addressed a wide range of issues, including [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and exploitation of the worker, the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism, although he is most famous for his analysis of history in terms of class struggles, summed up in the opening line of the introduction to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". The influence of his ideas, already popular during his life, was given added impetus by the victory of the [[Russia]]n [[Bolsheviks]] in the 1917 [[October Revolution]] and there are few parts of the world which were not significantly touched by Marxian ideas in the course of the twentieth century.

As the American Marx scholar [[Hal Draper]] remarked: "[T]here are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike".

===Early influences===
{{main|The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism}}
{{details|Influences on Karl Marx}}
The early influences on Marx are often grouped into three categories: German philosophy, English/Scottish political economy and French socialism.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/x01.htm The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism]''&amp;nbsp;by [[Vladimir I. Lenin]] at the [[Marxists Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====German philosophy====
Main influences include [[Immanuel Kant]]; [[G. W. F. Hegel]]; and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. 

Marx studied under one of Hegel's pupils, [[Bruno Bauer]], a leader of the circle of [[Young Hegelians]] to whom Marx attached himself. However, from 1841 he and Engels came to disagree with Bauer and the rest of the Young Hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of Hegel's dialectic and progressively broke away from [[German idealism]] and the Young Hegelians. Marx's early writings are thus a response towards Hegel, German idealism and a break with the rest of the Young Hegelians. Marx, "stood Hegel on his head", in his own view of his role by turning the idealistic dialectic into a materialistic one, in proposing that material circumstances shape ideas instead of the other way around. In this, Marx was following the lead of Feuerbach. His [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]], developed in the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844|Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (published in 1932), inspired itself from Feuerbach's critique of the alienation of Man in God through the [[objectivation]] of all his inherent characteristics (thus man projected on God all qualities which are in fact man's own quality which defines the "[[human nature]]"). But Marx also criticized Feuerbach for being insufficiently materialistic.

====English and Scottish political economy====
Main influences include [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]. 

Marx built on and critiqued the most well-known political economists of his day, the British classical political economists.

Marx critiqued Smith and Ricardo for not realizing that their economic concepts reflected specifically capitalist institutions, not innate natural properties of human society and could not be applied unchanged to all societies. He proposed a systematic correlation between labour-values and money prices. He claimed that the source of profits under capitalism is value added by workers not paid out in wages. This mechanism operated through the distinction between "labour power", which workers freely exchanged for their wages; and "labour", over which asset-holding capitalists thereby gained control. This practical and theoretical distinction was Marx's primary insight, and allowed him to develop the concept of "surplus value", which distinguished his works from that of Smith and Ricardo.

====French socialism====
Main influences include [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]; [[Charles Fourier]]; [[Henri de Saint-Simon]]; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]; and [[Louis Blanc]].

Rousseau was one of the first modern writers to seriously attack the institution of [[private property]] and therefore is sometimes considered a forebear of modern [[socialism]] and [[communism]], though Marx rarely mentions Rousseau in his writings.

In 1833, France was experiencing a number of social problems arising out of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. A number of sweeping plans of reform were developed by thinkers on the [[Left-wing politics|political left]]. Among the more grandiose were the plans of [[Charles Fourier]] and the followers of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]. Fourier wanted to replace modern cities with utopian communities while the Saint-Simonians advocated directing the economy by manipulating credit. Although these programs did not have much support, they did expand the political and social imagination of Marx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta – France |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568934_23/France.html#p464 |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR60qYA?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568934_23/France.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Blanc]] is perhaps best known for originating the social principle, later adopted by Marx, of how labor and income should be distributed: “From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta – Communism |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html#p9 |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR6a1r6?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] participated in the February 1848 uprising and the composition of what he termed "the first republican proclamation" of the new republic, but he had misgivings about the new government because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio-economic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. Proudhon published his own perspective for reform, ''Solution du problème social'', in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from capitalists and financiers to workers. It was Proudhon's book ''[[What Is Property?]]'' that convinced the young Karl Marx that [[private property]] should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon|first=Pierre-Joseph|title=What is property?|year=2007|publisher=Cosimo Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602060944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other influences on Marx====
Main influences includes [[Friedrich Engels]]; [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] [[materialism]]; [[Giambattista Vico]]; and [[Lewis H. Morgan]].

Marx's revision of [[Hegelianism]] was also influenced by Engels' book  ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.

Marx was influenced by Antique materialism, especially [[Epicurus]] (to whom Marx dedicated his thesis,  ''[[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature]]'', 1841) for his materialism and theory of [[clinamen]] which opened up a realm of liberty.

[[Giambattista Vico]] propounded a [[cyclical theory]] of history, according to which human societies progress through a series of stages from barbarism to civilization and then return to barbarism. In the first stage—called the Age of the Gods—religion, the family and other basic institutions emerge; in the succeeding Age of Heroes, the common people are kept in subjection by a dominant class of nobles; in the final stage—the Age of Men—the people rebel and win equality, but in the process society begins to disintegrate. Vico's influence on Marx is obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta - Giambattista Vico |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551498/Giambattista_Vico.html |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR5SlMg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551498/Giambattista_Vico.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx drew on [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and his [[social evolution]] theory. He wrote a collection of notebooks from his reading of Lewis Morgan, but they are regarded as being quite obscure and only available in scholarly editions. (However Engels is much more noticeably influenced by Morgan than Marx).

==Friedrich Engels==
{{details|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Friedrich Engels]] was a co-founder and proponent of [[Marxism]]]]
Friedrich Engels (November 28, 1820, [[Wuppertal]] – August 5, 1895, [[London]]) was a nineteenth-century German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]]. He developed [[Communism|communist]] theory alongside his better-known collaborator, [[Karl Marx]].

In 1842, his father sent the young Engels to England to help manage his cotton factory in Manchester. Shocked by the widespread [[poverty]], Engels began writing an account which he published in 1845 as ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm]).

In July 1845, Engels went to England, where he met an Irish working-class woman named [[Mary Burns]] ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_4.shtml Crosby]), with whom he lived until her death in 1863 (Carver 2003:19). Later, Engels lived with her sister Lizzie, marrying her the day before she died in 1877 (Carver 2003:42). These women may have introduced him to the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, of whose leaders he met several, including [[George Julian Harney|George Harney]].

Engels actively participated in the [[Revolution of 1848]], taking part in the uprising at [[Elberfeld]]. Engels fought in the [[Baden campaign]] against the [[Prussia]]ns (June/July 1849) as the [[aide-de-camp]] of [[August Willich]], who commanded a Free Corps in the Baden-Palatinate uprising. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/german-imperial/ch01.htm]

===Marx and Engels===
Marx and Engels first met in person in September 1844. They discovered that they had similar views on [[philosophy]] and on [[capitalism]] and decided to work together, producing a number of works including ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After the French authorities deported Marx from France in January 1845, Engels and Marx decided to move to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than some other countries in Europe. Engels and Marx returned to Brussels in January 1846, where they set up the Communist Correspondence Committee.

In 1847, Engels and Marx began writing a pamphlet together, based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. They completed the 12,000-word pamphlet in six weeks, writing it in such a manner as to make communism understandable to a wide audience and published it as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled both Engels and Marx. They moved to Cologne, where they began to publish a radical newspaper, the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]''. By 1849, both Engels and Marx had to leave Germany and moved to London. The Prussian authorities applied pressure on the British government to expel the two men, but [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] refused. With only the money that Engels could raise, the Marx family lived in extreme poverty. The contributions of Marx and Engels to the formation of Marxist theory have been described as inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;For example see [[Franz Mehring]]: “The more their thought and their development became one, the more they each remained a separate entity and a man”, in Mehring: ''Karl Marx: The Story of His Life'' (1918), Chapter 8 Marx and Engels [http://www.marxists.org/archive/mehring/1918/marx/ch08.htm#s2 2. An Incomparable Alliance]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main ideas==
Marx's main ideas included:
* [[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]]: Marx refers to the alienation of people from aspects of their "human nature" ("''Gattungswesen''", usually translated as "species-essence" or "species-being"). He believed that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and in so doing generate alienated labour.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Alienation&lt;/ref&gt; Alienation describes objective features of a person's situation in capitalism—it is not necessary for them to believe or feel that they are alienated.
* [[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|Base and superstructure]]: Marx and Engels use the “base-structure” concept to explain the idea that the totality of relations among people with regard to “the social production of their existence” forms the economic basis, on which arises a superstructure of political and legal institutions. To the base corresponds the social consciousness which includes religious, philosophical and other main ideas. The base conditions both, the superstructure and the social consciousness. A conflict between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production causes social revolutions and the resulting change in the economic basis will sooner or later lead to the transformation of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;See Marx: ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas,
and Engels: ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]
&lt;/ref&gt; For Marx, this relationship is not a one way process—it is reflexive and the base determines the superstructure in the first instance at the same time as it remains the foundation of a form of social organization which is itself transformed as an element in the overall dialectical process. The relationship between superstructure and base is considered to be a [[dialectics|dialectical]] one, [[ineffability|ineffable]] in a sense except as it unfolds in its material reality in the actual historical process (which [[scientific socialism]] aims to explain and ultimately to guide).
* [[Class consciousness]]: class consciousness refers to the awareness, both of itself and of the social world around it, that a [[social class]] possesses and its capacity to act in its own rational interests based on this awareness. Thus class consciousness must be attained before the class may mount a successful revolution. However, other methods of revolutionary action have been developed, such as [[vanguardism]].
* [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|Exploitation]]: Marx refers to the exploitation of an entire segment or class of society by another. He sees it as being an inherent feature and key element of capitalism and free markets. The profit gained by the capitalist is the difference between the value of the product made by the worker and the actual wage that the worker receives—in other words, capitalism functions on the basis of paying workers less than the full value of their labor in order to enable the capitalist class to turn a profit.
* [[Historical materialism]]: historical materialism was first articulated by Marx, although he himself never used the term. It looks for the causes of developments and changes in human societies in the way in which humans collectively make the means to life, thus giving an emphasis through economic analysis to everything that co-exists with the economic base of society (e.g. social classes, political structures, ideologies).
* [[Means of production]]: the means of production are a combination of the [[means of labor]] and the [[subject of labor]] used by workers to make products. The means of labor include machines, tools, equipment, infrastructure and "all those things with the aid of which man acts upon the subject of labor, and transforms it".&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. (1957). xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of labor includes raw materials and materials directly taken from nature. Means of production by themselves produce nothing— [[labour (economics)|labor power]] is needed for production to take place.
* [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|Ideology]]: without offering a general definition for "ideology",&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCarney:
''[http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm Ideology and False Consciousness]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Marx on several instances has used the term to designate the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, “ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces”.&lt;ref&gt;Engels: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter] to [[Franz Mehring]], (London July 14, 1893), transl. by Donna Torr, in ''Marx and Engels Correspondence'', International Publishers 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society as well as its ruling ideas will be determined according to what is in the ruling class's best interests. As Marx said famously in ''The German Ideology'', “the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm  Karl Marx, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the ideology of a society is of enormous importance since it confuses the alienated groups and can create [[false consciousness]] such as commodity fetishism (perceiving labor as capital—a degradation of human life).
* [[Mode of production]]: the mode of production is a specific combination of [[productive forces]] (including human the [[means of production]] and [[labour power]], tools, equipment, buildings and technologies, materials and improved land) and social and technical [[relations of production]] (including the property, power and control relations governing society's productive assets, often codified in law, cooperative work relations and forms of association, relations between people and the objects of their work and the relations between social classes).
* [[Political economy]]: the term "political economy" originally meant the study of the conditions under which production was organized in the nation-states of the new-born capitalist system. Political economy then studies the mechanism of human activity in organizing material and the mechanism of distributing the surplus or deficit that is the result of that activity. Political economy studies the means of production, specifically capital and how this manifests itself in economic activity.

===Marx's concept of class===
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2012}}
Marx believed that class identity was configured in the relations with the mode of production. In other words, a class is a collective of individuals who have a similar relationship with the means of production (as opposed to the more common-sense idea that class is determined by wealth alone, i.e. high class, middle class and poor class).

Marx describes several [[social class]]es in capitalist societies, including primarily:
* The [[proletariat]]: "those individuals who sell their [[labor power]], (and therefore add value to the products), and who, in the capitalist mode of production, do not own the means of production". According to Marx, the capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions for the [[bourgeoisie]] to [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]] the proletariat due to the fact that the worker's [[labor power]] generates an [[Surplus value|added value]] greater than his [[salary]].
* The [[bourgeoisie]]: those who "own the means of production" and buy [[labor power]] from the proletariat, who are recompensed by a salary, thus [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]]ing the proletariat.
The bourgeoisie may be further subdivided into the very wealthy bourgeoisie and the [[petty bourgeoisie]]. The petty bourgeoisie are those who employ labor, but may also work themselves. These may be small proprietors, land-holding peasants, or trade workers. Marx predicted that the petty bourgeoisie would eventually be destroyed by the constant reinvention of the means of production and the result of this would be the forced movement of the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie to the proletariat. Marx also identified the [[lumpenproletariat]], a stratum of society completely disconnected from the means of production.

Marx also describes the [[communists]] as separate from the oppressed proletariat. The communists were to be a unifying party among the proletariat; they were educated revolutionaries who could bring the proletariat to revolution and help them establish the democratic [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Communist Manifesto]] 80-87&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marx, the communists would support any true revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Thus the communists aide the proletariat in creating the inevitable classless society ([[Vladimir Lenin]] takes this concept a step further by stating that only "professional revolutionaries" can lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie).

===Marx's theory of history===
{{main|Marx's theory of history}}
The Marxist theory of historical materialism understands society as fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time—this means the relationships which people enter into with one another in order to fulfill their basic needs, for instance to feed and clothe themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Marx and Engels identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". (Marx, Karl, Letter to editor of the Russian paper Otetchestvennye Zapiskym, 1877) His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8024">'''Consensus history''' is a style of American [[historiography]] that emphasizes the basic unity of [[American values]] and downplays conflict as superficial and lacking in complexity.    The movement was especially influential  in the 1950s and 1960s. Prominent leaders included [[Richard Hofstadter]], [[Louis Hartz]], [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] and [[David M. Potter]].  Other prominent exemplars included [[Perry Miller]], [[Clinton Rossiter]], [[Henry Steele Commager]], [[Allan Nevins]] and [[Edmund Morgan (historian)|Edmund Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;Neil Jumonville, ''Henry Steele Commager: Midcentury Liberalism and the History of the Present'' (1999) pp 232-39&lt;/ref&gt;  It rejected the "Progressive" historiography that had previously dominated, and which stressed the central importance of class conflict in American history. [[Charles A. Beard]] was the most prominent representative of the progressive or "Beardian" approach.

Consensus history was rejected by [[New Left]] viewpoints that attracted younger more radical historians in the 1960s. These viewpoints stress conflict and emphasize the central roles of class, race and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Unger,  "The 'New Left' and American History: Some Recent Trends in United States Historiography." ''American Historical Review'' (1967): 1237-1263. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1847792 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In 1959 [[John Higham (historian)|John Higham]] identified an emerging consensus among historians that was based on the search for "a placid, unexciting past" as part of "a massive grading operation to smooth over
America's social convulsions." Higham called it the "Cult of the American Consensus."&lt;ref&gt;John Higham, "The Cult of the American Consensus: Homogenizing Our History," ''Commentary'' (1959) 27#2 pp: 93-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Hofstadter===
{{main|Richard Hofstadter}}
After 1945, Hofstadter philosophically broke with Beard and moved to the center in his leadership of the politically liberal "consensus historians".  Hofstadter disliked the term, but it was widely applied to his rejection of the Beardian idea that there was a fundamental conflict running throughout American history that pitted economic classes against each other.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Brown, ''Richard Hofstadter: An Intellectual Biography''(2006) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Foner]] says that Hofstadter's book ''The American Political Tradition'' (1948) "propelled him to the very forefront of his profession." Millions of Americans, on and off campus, read it.  Its format is a series of portraits of leading men from the Founding Fathers through Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln and FDR. Foner argues:
:Hofstadter's insight was that virtually all his subjects held essentially the same underlying beliefs.  Instead of persistent conflict (whether between agrarians and industrialists, capital and labor, or Democrats and Republicans), American history was characterized by broad agreement on fundamentals, particularly the virtues of individual liberty, private property, and capitalist enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, "Introduction" to {{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=Social Darwinism in American Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty8aEmWc_ekC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1944|publisher=Beacon Press|page=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstadter in 1948 thus rejected black-and-white polarization between pro- and anti-business politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Jumonville, ''Henry Steele Commager'' (1999) p 235&lt;/ref&gt;  Hofstadter made a statement of the consensus model of the American political tradition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fierceness of the political struggles has often been misleading: for the range of vision embraced by the primary contestants in the major parties has always been bounded by the horizons of property and enterprise.  However much at odds on specific issues, the major political traditions have shared a belief in the rights of property, the philosophy of economic individualism, the value of competition; they have accepted the economic virtues of capitalist culture as necessary qualities of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=The American Political Tradition: And the Men Who Made it|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6k_G670uhZsC&amp;pg=PR35|year=1948|publisher=Knopf|pages=xxxvi–xxxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a consensus historian, Hofstadter rejected Beard's interpretation of history as a succession of socio-economic group conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Kazin et al. eds.|title=The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsWLGcZ7pyAC&amp;pg=PA326|year=2011|publisher=Princeton UP|pages=324–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that all historical periods could be understood as an implicit consensus, shared by antagonists, explaining that the generation of Beard and [[Vernon Louis Parrington]] had:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...put such an excessive emphasis on conflict, that an antidote was needed...  It seems to me to be clear that a political society cannot hang together, at all, unless there is some kind of consensus running through it, and yet that no society has such a total consensus as to be devoid of significant conflict. It is all a matter of proportion and emphasis, which is terribly important in history. Of course, obviously, we have had one total failure of consensus, which led to the Civil War.  One could use that as the extreme case in which consensus breaks down.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Pole, "Richard Hofstadter" in Robert Allen Rutland, ed., ''Clio's Favorites: Leading Historians of the United States, 1945–200'' (2000), pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===New Deal===
Consensus historians, argues Lary May:
&lt;blockquote&gt;believed that the prosperity and apparent class harmony of the post-World War II era reflected a return to the true Americanism rooted in liberal capitalism and the pursuit of individual opportunity that had made fundamental conflicts over resources a thing of the past.  They argued that the New Deal was a conservative movement that built a welfare state, guided by experts, that saved rather than transformed liberal capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Lary May, "Review," ''Journal of American History" (December 2010) 97#3 p 765&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''''Conservation Plan''''' is an important publication written by [[James Semple Kerr]] in 1982, and revised many times. It was a landmark in Australian conservation. The document "...outlines the logical processes of the Burra Charter, and how to prepare a Conservation Plan to guide and manage change to a heritage item appropriately''. Subtitled, "a guide to the preparation of conservation plans for places of European cultural significance'' it has guided building conservation in Australia and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/publications/the-conservation-plan/ Australia ICOMOS &gt; Publications &gt; The Conservation Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservation Plan is widely used by heritage practitioners and property owners in Australia, and worldwide as a primary guide to the process of researching, documenting and managing historic places in accordance with the [[Burra Charter]], through a logical process. First published by the [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW) in 1982, it has subsequently been reprinted in expanded form over seven editions and twelve printing impressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kerr, James Semple | author2=Hanna, Bronwyn J.

{{Marxism|Philosophy}}

'''Economic determinism''' is a socioeconomic theory that [[economic]] relationships (such as being an owner or [[capitalist]], or being a worker or proletarian) are the foundation upon which all other social and political arrangements in society are based. The theory stresses that societies are divided into competing [[social class|economic classes]] whose relative political power is determined by the nature of the economic system. In the version associated with [[Karl Marx]], the emphasis is on the [[proletariat]] who are considered to be locked in a [[class struggle]] with the capitalist class, which will eventually end with the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system and the gradual development of [[socialism]]. [[Marxist theory|Marxist thinkers]] have dismissed plain and unilateral economic [[determinism]] as a form of "vulgar Marxism", or "[[economism]]", nowhere included in Marx's works.

In the writing of American history the term is associated with historian [[Charles A. Beard]] (1874–1948), who was not a Marxist but who emphasized the long-term political contest between bankers and business interest on the one hand, and agrarian interests on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Coleman, "Beard, McDonald, and Economic Determinism in American Historiography," ''Business History Review'' (1960) 34#1 pp. 113-121 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3111785 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to Marxist philosophy==
According to [[Marx]], each social [[mode of production]] produces the [[materialism|material conditions]] of its reproduction, that is, [[ideology]] (which gathers all the political, law and cultural spheres). Thus, ideology permits the mode of production to reproduce itself. Furthermore, Marx and Engels are said to have believed,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels, "The German Ideology," from Selected Writings, pg 120&lt;/ref&gt; should a [[revolution]]ary force change the mode of production, the dominant class will immediately set out to create a new society to protect this new economic order. In the modernity of their era, Marx and Engels felt the [[ruling class|propertied class]] had essentially accomplished the establishment of a new societal and economic order, instinctively creating a society protective of their capitalist interests. They made this statement to the [[Bourgeoisie]] in the [[Communist Manifesto]]: "Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your [[jurisprudence]] is but the will of your class, made into law for all, a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economic conditions of the existence of your class."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, ''Communist Manifesto'', pg 35&lt;/ref&gt; The [[young Marx]] hence criticized man's [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], a concept which he later replaced by the critique of [[commodity fetishism]]. "Vulgar [[Marxism]]" has considered that the relation between the economical [[infrastructure]] and the ideological [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] was a [[unicausality|unicausal]] one, and thus believed in economic determinism. Engels said "The final causes of all social changes and [[political revolution]] are to be sought, not in men's brains, not in man's insight into internal truth and justice... but in the economies of each epoch."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels, ''Socialism -- Utopian and Scientific'', pg 54&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Engels advocated a revolution in economic structure as the only valid way of improving society and ending the oppression of the working class.

==Criticism==
Other Marxists and Marx-scholars—including [[György Lukács]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Maurice Godelier]], [[Franz Jakubowski]], [[Edward P. Thompson]] and [[Michael Lowy]]—completely reject the interpretation of Marx and Engels as "economic determinists". They claim this idea is based on a poor and selective reading of Marx and Engels' work.

They argue that this interpretation originated in the early years of the [[Second International]] and was popularised by [[Karl Kautsky]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], among many others. They refer to the disclaimers by Engels (see [[historical materialism]]) to the effect that while Marx and himself had focused a lot on the economic aspects, they were very aware that this did ''not'' in fact constitute the totality of society or of social life. However, some have viewed such comments as Engels's attempt to extricate himself from an untenable position: [[Max Weber]] and other influential sociological and economic thinker agreed that Marx's views were really unidimensional in regard to economic determinism. They did not agree that economic determinism was a vulgar interpretation of Marx. They regarded this to be the explicitly stated and true interpretation of Marx (See own admission in Friedrich Engels, ''Socialism—Utopian and Scientific'', pg 54). They criticized the simplicity in Marx's arguments and held that ideas and cultural beliefs and values determine societal progress and the evolution of society. (See [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|Weber's ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'']] (1905)).

Non-Marxist scholars have also objected that economic determinism is overly generalized, insofar as any serious historical explanation of ''economic'' realities must always refer to ''non-economic'' realities. This became obvious when one had to specify exactly of what the economic determinism precisely consisted. In addition, a lot of confusion about "economic determinism" is due to the conflation of the "commercial" with the "economic". For Marx at least, these were very ''different'' concepts.

The dynamic of history according to Marx was shaped precisely by the clash of those interests ([[class struggle]]), and that clash ''could not be understood'' simply in terms of economic self-interest, because it also involved human needs, customs, traditions, morals and values encompassing a whole way of life. On the other hand, Lenin wrote that "an idea that captures the minds of the masses becomes a material force," meaning that the said needs, customs, traditions, morals and values can be equated to economic forces.

The end result of economic determinism in this view is both [[economism]] (a narrow focus on how people earn their livelihood) and economic [[reductionism]] (the attempt to reduce a complex social reality to one factor—the economic—such that this one factor ''causes'' all other aspects of society).

==Notable economic determinists==

American geostrategist [[Thomas P. M. Barnett]] describes himself as an economic determinist in his book ''The Pentagon's New Map''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1526">A '''feud letter''' ({{lang-de|Fehdebrief}} or ''Absagebrief'') was a [[document]] in which a [[feud]] was announced – usually with few words - in medieval Europe. The letter had to be issued three days in advance in order to be legally valid.

So that the feud did not became a case of [[murder]] and thus become punishable by law, those involved had to abide by the following rules:

# The feud, whether between [[knight]]s or between the [[nobility]] and towns, had to be initiated by a formal feud letter
# The killing of innocent parties was forbidden
# The razing of houses and laying waste to the land was allowed
# During the feud, fighting was not permitted in churches or in the home, and the parties were to be allowed go to and return from church or court without being molested.

A '''field coil loudspeaker''' is a [[dynamic loudspeaker]] in which the field is produced by an [[electromagnet]] rather than by a permanent magnet.

An electrodynamic loudspeaker therefore has two coils:

* The [[voice coil]] common to all dynamic y, positioned in the [[Voice coil#Design considerations|air gap]] between the [[pole piece]]s, the motion of which moves the [[loudspeaker cone]].
* A fixed [[field coil]] which together with its [[magnetic core]] replaces the permanent magnet of other dynamic loudspeakers.

The first electrodynamic loudspeakers were produced in the 1920s, to address the problem that strong permanent magnets of the time were extremely heavy. A compromise was therefore necessary between loudspeaker efficiency, which required the strongest possible magnet, and weight. The use of a strong but relatively light electromagnet solved this problem.

While now uncommon, field coil loudspeakers were once common in top quality console and tabletop [[radio]]s and similar domestic [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] applications, particularly from the late 20s to the [[post-war period]] of [[World War II]]. In these appliances the field coil of the loudspeaker was also used as the main or only [[filter choke]] in the [[HT (vacuum tube)|high tension]] [[power supply]] to the [[Vacuum tube|valve]] [[anode]]s.

Advances in [[permanent magnet]] technology rendered the traditional electrodynamic loudspeaker obsolete. The type survives in some high-end [[hi-fi]] applications.

The '''First Colonial Conference''' met in [[London]] in 1887 on the occasion of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Golden Jubilee]]. It was organised at the behest of the [[Imperial Federation League]] in hopes of creating closer ties between the colonies and the United Kingdom. It was attended by more than 100 delegates, mostly unofficial observers, from both self-governing and dependent colonies. [[British Raj|India]], however, was not represented.&lt;ref name=imp&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Olson |editor-first=James S. |title=Historical Dictionary of European Imperialism |year=1991 |publisher=Greenwood Press |pages=135–136 |url={{google books|uyqepNdgUWkC|page=137|plainurl=yes}} |isbn=0-3132-6257-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other things discussed, the colonies in [[Australia]] and [[Colony of New Zealand|New Zealand]] agreed to pay [[GBP|£]]126,000 [[per annum]] towards the [[Royal Navy]] to help pay for the [[United Kingdom]]'s naval deployments in the Pacific.  In exchange, the British government agreed not to reduce its [[Pacific Station]] without colonial consent.&lt;ref name=cup&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of the British Empire, Volume 4 |year=1929 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=409 |url={{google books|Mu48AAAAIAAJ|page=411|plainurl=yes}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposal to lay a [[Submarine communications cable|telegraph cable]] between [[Vancouver]] and Australia was approved. A Resolution to extend the Queen's title to "Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Ireland, and the Colonies, and all Dependencies thereof, and Empress of India" was also adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gladstone's Motion Lost |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/05/07/100910297.pdf |work=New York Times |date=May 7, 1887 |at=second last paragraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was only a deliberative body and resolutions passed were not binding.&lt;ref name=imp/&gt;

==Participants==
The conference was hosted by [[Queen Victoria]] and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], with [[Henry Holland, 1st Viscount Knutsford|Sir Henry Thurston Holland]] ([[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]) acting as chair and the Premiers and other representatives of various colonies as delegates. The colonies invited to send delegates were [[Newfoundland Colony]], [[Canada]], [[Colony of New South Wales]], [[Colony of Tasmania]], [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[South Australia]], the [[Colony of New Zealand]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Queensland]], [[Western Australia]], and [[Colony of Natal|Natal Colony]]. Various other colonies were invited to send representatives to the opening ceremonies but not participate as delegates. [[William A. Baillie-Hamilton]], the [[Private Secretary]] to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, acted as Secretary to the Conference.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=MDpOAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q=thorburn&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and education ==
While studying for her Masters in Advertising from the [[University of Texas, Austin]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lieberman threw home "Passion Parties" in 2004-2005 wherein she sold sex toys that were, at the time, illegal in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/hallie-lieberman/buzz-lieberman/|title=BUZZ by Hallie Lieberman {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curious about the history of such legislation, Lieberman enrolled in the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Mass Communications Doctoral Program, and studied the history of sex toys for her PhD dissertation (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/bitch-interview/hallie-lieberman-sex-toys|title=The Liberation of Sex Toys Has Never Been About Women|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significant findings ==

* Lieberman disputes the theory that Victorian doctors used vibrators to cure women’s hysteria.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/14/17009834/hallie-lieberman-buzz-sex-toys-history-technology|title=From Ice Age dildos to VR, an academic explains the history and future of sex toys|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieberman traced the theory back to [[Rachel Maines]]’ ''The Technology of Orgasm,'' and while agreeing that sources do back up claims that Victorian doctors used vibrators to treat upwards of 300 different diseases (hysteria being one of them), none of the diseases were ''cured'' by vibrators. On this same note, Lieberman's also argues that Victorian vibrators were penetrative in purpose, and did not appear to be targeting clitoris  stimulation. As such, her findings showed these vibrators were used for men and women. As such, there is documentation of the vibrators being used to treat impotence in men due to documented rectal attachments. Lieberman found that the vibrators were more likely used for relief of menstrual cramps than for anything related to hysteria, and that this myth is primarily rooted in a sexual fantasy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*The earliest sex toys were made of bone, ivory, teeth and have been traced back 30,000 years.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://splinternews.com/this-dildographer-has-made-a-career-out-of-studying-the-1793862734|title=This 'dildographer' has made a career out of studying the history of sex toys|last=Brown|first=Kristen V.|work=Splinter|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lieberman also researches the double standards of legislation surrounding sex toy legislation. One of her studies highlighted that sex toys (which are mostly marketed to women and gay men) are illegal to sell in Alabama, and until 2008 they were illegal to sell in Texas whereas [[VIAGRA|Viagra]] is covered by prescription and penis pumps are sold as medical devices.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; 
*Lieberman's research also highlights notable inventors in the field. One of whom is [[Gosnell Duncan]], who is paraplegic, and invented the silicone dildo to assist those with disabilities experience pleasure.
*Recorded that in the 1800s in China, glass dildos were hollowed out and filled with warm liquids to simulate ejaculation.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*Analyzes the narratives around advertisements for sex toys. Lieberman traced that sex toys have symbolized radical gay sex and gay rights and also been marketed to further conservative values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/43aqdp/how-sex-toys-revolutionized-the-way-we-view-womens-pleasure|title=How Sex Toys Revolutionized the Way We View Women's Pleasure|date=2017-09-27|work=Broadly|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">A '''Heritage Overlay''' or '''HO''' is one of a number of [[planning scheme overlay]]s contained in the [[Victorian Planning Provisions]], for use in [[planning scheme]]s in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], Australia.  The heritage overlay schedule of each [[Local Government Areas of Victoria|local government]] planning scheme lists sites of local and state significance ([[Victorian Heritage Register]]) but does not include sites on the [[Australian National Heritage List]].

The Heritage Overlay is used to protect sites that have [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] value, meaning that individual buildings or whole urban precincts may be covered. The protection afforded by a Heritage Overlay varies in each instance, though the controls apply to built structures and their associated land. The minimum level of protection is afforded by the mere existence of the overlay and means that any work at all to the building or site will require a [[planning permit]], ensuring that a higher level of scrutiny automatically occurs, regardless of any specific control measures cited.  Exemptions from permits can be achieved via a site specific exclusion or an incorporated plan listed in the schedule to the overlay.

Each planning scheme will have a set of maps which indicate the location of overlay controls. Associated with the maps is a schedule listing every individual overlay in that planning scheme according to the following criteria:
* Planning Scheme map reference (HO+number)
* Address of building or name of precinct
* External paint controls
* Internal alteration controls
* Tree controls 
* Exemptions for certain outbuildings or fencing
* Victorian Heritage Register listing
* Prohibitions on uses
* Reference to other parts of the Planning Scheme
* Aboriginal heritage 

An easy to follow description of how to read a heritage overlay and the different related documents is found at the [http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/pbs/statutory-planning/overlays/heritage-planning-protection.aspx City of Ballarat Website - What is a Heritage Overlay].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4715">'''Historians without Borders''' is a Finnish organisation. It was founded at the initiative of [[Erkki Tuomioja]], the former foreign minister of Finland. The purpose of the organization is to further public discussion about history and to promote the use of historical knowledge for peace-building and conflict-resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.finlandia.org.pt/public/default.aspx?contentid=356500&amp;culture=fi-FI| title = Historioitsijat ilman rajoja - Suomen suurlähetystö, Lissabon : Ajankohtaista| work = www.finlandia.org.pt| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation has an international network of Historians without Borders and coordinating committee, with which the organisation aims to promote their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.historianswithoutborders.fi/yhdistys/| title = Yhdistys - Historians without Borders| work = Historians without Borders| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In June 2015, Erkki tuomioja convened a number of historians and policy makers to a meeting, which led to the founding of HWB. First board was appointed, which included names like Finnish politician and historian Pilvi Torsti, former editor-in-chief of [[Helsingin Sanomat]] [[Janne Virkkunen]] and executive director of [[Crisis Management Initiative|C]]MI Tuija Talvitie. Erkki Tuomioja has acted as Chairman of the Board since the founding meeting. Behind the initiative was Tuomioja´s concern, that history is often used and abused for personal or political purposes. Inadequate knowledge of history makes people more vulnerable to manipulation of politicians, who can use historical myths and propaganda to their advantage easier. HWB aims to prevent the abuse of history by bringing historians and their knowledge to society and conflict-resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.finlandia.org.pt/public/default.aspx?contentid=356500&amp;culture=fi-FI| title = Historioitsijat ilman rajoja - Suomen suurlähetystö, Lissabon : Ajankohtaista| work = www.finlandia.org.pt| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HWB has aimed from the beginning to the wider international co-operation between historians across the borders. With this in mind, HWB organised in May 2016 and international conference "Historians without Borders: The Use and Abuse of History in Conflicts" at the University of Helsinki. Around 300 participants gathered in Helsinki and the conference ended with the creation of an international network of Historians without Borders and the appointment of a Coordinating Committee. Members of this committee are Jan C. Behrends, [[Carl Bildt]], Vasu Gounden, [[Margaret MacMillan]], Erkki Tuomioja, Christina Twomey and Sergei Zhuravlev. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000002832711.html| title = Historioitsijat tarjoavat apua konfliktien ratkaisuun| work = Helsingin Sanomat| date = 2015-06-18| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-8897872| title = Historioitsijat järjestäytyivät rauhan puolesta| work = Yle Uutiset| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://areena.yle.fi/1-3394283| title = Historian käyttö ja väärinkäyttö konflikteissa {{!}} Tiedeykkönen| work = areena.yle.fi| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/13988-social-media-is-a-powerful-tool-in-conflicts-warns-ahtisaari.html| title = Social media is a powerful tool in conflicts, warns Ahtisaari| author = Aleksi Teivainen| work = Helsinki Times| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2016/05/18/abuse-of-history-and-historians-without-borders| title = Abuse of history and Historians without Borders| work = DailySabah| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims ==

* promote and deepen general and comprehensive knowledge and understanding of history
* promote open and free access to historical material and archives
* promote interactive dialogue between different views and interpretations of history to bring closer diverging views of the course of historical events 
* support efforts to impede the abuse of history to foster conflicts or to sustain enemy images and distorted myths, and to contribute to the use of history in defusing and resolving conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.historianswithoutborders.fi/yhdistys/| title = Yhdistys - Historians without Borders| work = Historians without Borders| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historic recurrence''' is the repetition of similar events in [[history]].{{efn|[[Mark Twain]] writes of "a favorite theory of mine—to wit, that no ''occurrence'' [Twain's emphasis] is sole and solitary, but is merely a repetition of a thing which has happened before, and perhaps often."  (A "repeat occurrence" is the definition of "[[:Wiktionary:recurrence|recurrence]]".)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=ld_3LPm8FKkC&amp;dq=french+The+Jumping+Frog&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=4trjrMcmq3&amp;sig=P23kCS1s9qiu-1hdnJSzWWKvIJc&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA66,M1 [[Mark Twain]], ''[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County|The Jumping Frog]]: In English, Then in French, and Then Clawed Back into a Civilized Language Once More by Patient, Unremunerated Toil'', illustrated by F. Strothman, New York and London, Harper &amp; Brothers, Publishers, MCMIII, p. 64].&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar thought of uncertain attribution has been ascribed to Twain:  "History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/01/12/history-rhymes/] Quote Investigator, "History Does Not Repeat Itself, But It Rhymes", 2014/01/12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The concept of historic recurrence has variously been applied to the overall [[history of the world]] (e.g., to the rises and falls of [[empire]]s), to repetitive patterns in the history of a given [[polity]], and to any two specific events which bear a  striking similarity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hypothetically, in the extreme, the concept of historic recurrence assumes the form of the [[Eternal return|Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence]], which has been written about in various forms since [[Ancient times|antiquity]] and was described in the 19th century by [[Heinrich Heine]]{{efn|Philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] quotes [[Heinrich Heine]]: "[T]ime is infinite, but the things in time, the concrete bodies, are finite. They may indeed disperse into the smallest particles; but these particles, the atoms, have their determinate numbers, and the numbers of the configurations which, all of themselves, are formed out of them are also determinate. Now, however long a time may pass, according to the eternal laws governing the combinations of this eternal play of repetition, all configurations which have previously existed on this earth must yet meet, attract, repulse, kiss, and corrupt each other again..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'', 1959, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].{{efn|The concept of "[[eternal recurrence]]" is central to the writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. It appears in ''[[The Gay Science]]'' and in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', and also in a posthumous fragment. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] suggests that Nietzsche may have encountered the concept in the writings of [[Heinrich Heine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'', 1959, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, while it is often remarked that "History repeats itself", in cycles of less than [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] duration this cannot be strictly true.{{efn|G.W. Trompf writes:  "The idea of exact recurrence... was rarely incorporated into... these views, for in the main they simply presume the recurrence of ''sorts'' of events, or... event-types, -complexes, and -patterns."&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  In this interpretation of recurrence, as opposed perhaps to the Nietzschean interpretation, there is no [[metaphysics]].  Recurrences take place due to ascertainable circumstances and chains of [[causality]].{{efn|In 1814 [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] published an early articulation of [[causal determinism|causal or scientific determinism]]:  "We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future.  An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect, nothing would be uncertain and the future, just like the past, would be present before its eyes."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], ''A Philosophical Essay'', New York, 1902, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar view had earlier been presented in 1763 by [[Roger Boscovich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo Cercignani]], chapter 2:  "Physics before Boltzmann", in ''[[Ludwig Boltzmann]]:  The Man Who Trusted Atoms'', Oxford University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-850154-4}}, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  An example of the mechanism is the ubiquitous phenomenon of [[multiple independent discovery]] in [[science]] and [[technology]], which has been described by [[Robert K. Merton]] and [[Harriet Zuckerman]].

G.W. Trompf, in his book ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', traces historically recurring patterns of political thought and behavior in the west since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  If history has lessons to impart, they are to be found ''par excellence'' in such recurring patterns.

Historic recurrences of the "striking-similarity" type can sometimes induce a sense of "convergence", "resonance" or ''[[déjà vu]]''.{{efn|This sense is somewhat suggested, in popular culture, by the film ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]''.}}

[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Polybius]]]]

Prior to the theory of historic recurrence that was offered by [[Polybius]], a Greek [[Hellenistic Period|Hellenistic]] historian (ca 200 – ca 118 BCE), ancient western thinkers who had thought about recurrence had largely been concerned with [[cosmological]] rather than historic recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', pp. 6-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western philosophers and historians who have discussed various concepts of historic recurrence include Polybius, the Greek historian and [[rhetoric]]ian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (c. 60 BCE – after 7 BCE), [[Luke the Evangelist]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (1469–1527), [[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744), [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] (1889–1975).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  An eastern concept that bears a kinship to western concepts of historic recurrence is the [[China|Chinese]] concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], by which an unjust ruler will lose the support of [[heaven#Chinese faiths|Heaven]] and be overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth J. Perry|Elizabeth Perry]], ''Challenging the Mandate of Heaven: Social Protest and State Power in China'', Sharpe, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7656-0444-2}}, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

G.W. Trompf describes various historic [[paradigm]]s of historic recurrence, including paradigms that view types of large-scale historic phenomena variously as "cyclical"; "fluctuant"; "reciprocal"; "re-enacted"; or "revived".&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', pp. 2-3 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes "[t]he view proceeding from a belief in ''the uniformity of [[human nature]]'' [Trompf's emphasis].  It holds that because human nature does not change, the same sort of events can recur at any time."&lt;ref name="G.W. Trompf, p. 3"&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 3 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; "Other minor cases of recurrence thinking," he writes, "include the isolation of any two specific events which bear a very ''striking similarity'' [his emphasis], and the preoccupation with ''parallelism'' [his emphasis], that is, with resemblances, both general and precise, between separate sets of historical phenomena."&lt;ref name="G.W. Trompf, p. 3"/&gt;

[[File:Arnold J. Toynbee Anefo.jpg|thumb|left|85px|[[Arnold J. Toynbee]]]]

G.W. Trompf notes that most western concepts of historic recurrence imply that "the past teaches lessons for... future action"—that "the same... sorts of events which have happened before... will recur..."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  One such recurring theme was early offered by [[Poseidonius]] (a Greek [[polymath]], native to [[Apamea, Syria]]; ca 135–51 BCE), who argued that dissipation of the old [[Rome|Roman]] virtues had followed the removal of the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] challenge to Rome's supremacy in the [[Mediterranean]] world.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme that [[civilization]]s flourish or fail according to their responses to the human and [[Natural environment|environment]]al challenges that they face, would be picked up two thousand years later by [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold J. Toynbee]], ''[[A Study of History]]'', 12 volumes, [[Oxford University Press]], 1934–61, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (c. 60 BCE{{snd}}after 7 BCE), while praising Rome at the expense of her predecessors{{efn|His was thus a quasi-[[exceptionalism|exceptionalist]] view.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;}}—[[Assyria]], [[Medes|Media]], [[Persia]], and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]—anticipated Rome's eventual decay.  He thus implied the idea of recurring decay in the history of world [[empire]]s—an idea that was to be developed by the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (1st century BCE) and by [[Pompeius Trogus]], a 1st-century BCE [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[historian]] from a [[Celt]]ic tribe in [[Gallia Narbonensis]].&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', pp. 186–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 5th century, [[Zosimus]] (also called "Zosimus the Historian"; fl. 490s–510s:  a [[Byzantine]] historian who lived in [[Constantinople]]) could see the writing on the Roman wall, and asserted that empires fell due to internal disunity.  He gave examples from the histories of [[ancient Greece|Greece]] and Macedonia.  In the case of each empire, growth had resulted from consolidation against an external enemy; Rome herself, in response to [[Hannibal]]'s threat posed at [[Cannae]], had risen to great-power status within a mere five decades.  With Rome's world dominion, however, [[aristocracy]] had been supplanted by a [[monarchy]], which in turn tended to decay into [[tyranny]]; after [[Augustus Caesar]], good rulers had alternated with tyrannical ones.  The [[Roman Empire]], in its western and eastern sectors, had become a contending ground between contestants for power, while outside powers acquired an advantage.  In Rome's decay, Zosimus saw history repeating itself in its general movements.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', pp. 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancients developed an enduring [[metaphor]] for a [[polity]]'s evolution:  they drew an [[analogy]] between an individual human's [[Life history theory|life cycle]], and developments undergone by a [[body politic]].  This metaphor was offered, in varying iterations, by [[Cicero]] (106–43 BCE), [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (c. 1 BCE – 65 CE), [[Florus]] (c. 74 CE – ca 130 CE), and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (between 325 and 330 CE – after 391 CE).&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', pp. 188–92.&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[social organism|social-organism]] metaphor would recur centuries later in the works of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) and [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903).

[[File:Santi di Tito - Niccolo Machiavelli's portrait headcrop.jpg|thumb|105px|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]]]

[[Niccolò Machiavelli]], about to analyze the vicissitudes of [[Florence|Florentine]] and [[Italy|Italian]] politics between 1434 and 1494, described recurrent oscillations between "order" and "disorder" within states:

{{blockquote|when states have arrived at their greatest perfection, they soon begin to decline.  In the same manner, having been reduced by disorder and sunk to their utmost state of depression, unable to descend lower, they, of necessity, reascend, and thus from good they gradually decline to evil and from evil mount up to good.|}}

Machiavelli accounts for this oscillation by arguing that ''virtù'' (valor and political effectiveness) produces peace, peace brings idleness (''ozio''), idleness disorder, and disorder ''rovina'' (ruin).  In turn, from ''rovina'' springs order, from order ''virtù'', and from this, glory and good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;  Machiavelli, as had the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] historian [[Thucydides]], saw [[human nature]] as remarkably stable—steady enough for the formulation of rules of political behavior.  Machiavelli wrote in his ''Discorsi'':

{{blockquote|Whoever considers the past and the present will readily observe that all cities and all peoples... ever have been animated by the same desires and the same passions; so that it is easy, by diligent study of the past, to foresee what is likely to happen in the future in any republic, and to apply those remedies that were used by the ancients, or not finding any that were employed by them, to devise new ones from the similarity of events.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

In 1377 the [[Islamic]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] observed that new dynasties achieve social cohesion and expand to the limit, but then become sedentary, wedded to luxury, enslaved by their desires.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqadimmah]]'', 1377, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joshua S Goldstein]] suggests that empires, analogously to an individual's [[midlife crisis]], experience a [[political midlife crisis]]:  after a period of expansion in which all earlier goals are realized, overconfidence sets in, and regimes are then likely to attack or threaten their nearest rival; Goldstein cites four examples:  the [[British Empire]] and the [[Crimean War]]; the German [[Second Reich]] and [[World War I]]; the [[USSR]] and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]; the [[United States]] and the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua S Goldstein]], ''Long Cycles: Prosperity and War in the Modern Age'', 1988, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Suggestions that the [[European Union]] is suffering a [[political midlife crisis]] have been put forward by [[Gideon Rachman]] (2010), [[Roland Benedikter]] (2014), and [[Natalie Nougayrede]] (2017).  

[[David Hackett Fischer]] has identified four waves in European history, each of some 150-200 years' duration. Each wave begins with prosperity, leading to inflation, inequality, rebellion and war, and resolving in a long period of equilibrium.  For example, 18th-century inflation led to the [[Napoleonic wars]] and later the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[The Great Wave (book)|The Great Wave:  Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History]]'', Oxford University Press, 1996, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Arthur Keith]]'s theory of a species-wide [[amity-enmity complex]] suggests that human conscience evolved as a duality:  people are driven to protect members of their [[in-group]], and to hate and fight enemies who belong to an [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]]. Thus an endless, useless cycle of ''ad hoc'' "isms" arises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Keith]], ''A New Theory of Human Evolution'', Watts, 1948, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities==
One of the recurrence patterns identified by G.W. Trompf involves "the isolation of any two specific events which bear a very ''striking similarity''".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;   The Spanish-American philosopher [[George Santayana]] observed that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Santayana]], ''The Life of Reason'', vol. 1: ''Reason in Common Sense'', 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karl Marx]], having in mind the respective [[coup d'état|coups d'état]] of [[Napoleon I]] (1799) and his nephew [[Napoleon III]] (1851), wrote acerbically in 1852: "[[Hegel]] remarks somewhere that all facts and personages of great importance in [[world history]] occur, as it were, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as [[tragedy]], the second time as [[farce]]."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'' (1852), in ''Marx Engels Selected Works'', volume I, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, Poland's [[Adam Michnik]] believes that history is not just about the past because it is constantly recurring, and not as farce, as [[Karl Marx|Marx]] had it, but as itself:  "The world", writes Michnik, "is full of [[inquisitor]]s and [[heretic]]s, liars and those lied to, [[terrorist]]s and the terrorized.  There is still someone [[Thermopylae|dying at Thermopylae]], someone [[Socrates#Trial and death|drinking a glass of hemlock]], someone [[Rubicon|crossing the Rubicon]], someone drawing up a [[proscription|proscription list]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Wilson (translator)|Paul Wilson]], "Adam Michnik:  A Hero of Our Time," ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 6 (April 2, 2015), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Poland]]'s [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]], [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|Stanisław Szczepanowski]], is murdered by his former friend, King [[Bolesław the Bold]] (1079), and [[England]]'s Catholic Primate, [[Thomas Becket]], is murdered at the behest of his former friend, King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1170); [[China|Chinese]] Emperor [[Kublai Khan]]'s attempted conquest of [[Japan]] (1274, 1281) is frustrated by [[typhoon]]s (the original ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'', "divine wind"), and [[Spain|Spanish]] King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]'s attempted conquest of [[England]] (1588) is frustrated by a [[hurricane]]; [[Hernán Cortes]]'s fateful 1519 entry into [[Mexico]]'s [[Aztec Empire]] is reputedly facilitated by the natives' identification of him with their god [[Quetzalcoatl]], who had been predicted to return that very year, and [[England|English]] Captain [[James Cook]]'s fateful entry into [[Hawaii]] (1778), during the annual [[Makahiki]] festival honoring the [[List of fertility deities#Hawaiian|fertility and peace god]] [[Lono]], is reputedly facilitated by the natives' identification of Cook with Lono, who had left Hawaii, promising to return on a floating island, evoked by Cook's ship under full sail. 

In 1812 French Emperor [[Napoleon]]—born a [[Corsica|Corsican]] outsider—unprepared for an extended winter campaign, invades the [[Russian Empire]], precipitating the fall of the French Empire; and in 1941 German ''[[Führer]]'' [[Adolf Hitler]]—born an Austrian outsider—unprepared for an extended winter campaign—invades the Russian Empire's [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] successor ruled by [[Joseph Stalin]]—born a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] outsider—precipitating the fall of the German [[Thousand-Year Reich]].

[[Polity|Polities]] ignore [[Jan Gotlib Bloch|Jan Bloch]]'s 1898 warnings of the [[railroad]]-[[mobilization|mobilized]], [[industrial warfare|industrialized]], stalemated, [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] [[total war]], [[World War I]], that is on the way and will destroy an appreciable part of mankind;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gotlib Bloch|Jan Bloch]], ''Future war and its economic consequences'', 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; and polities ignore [[geologist]]s', [[oceanographer]]s',  [[atmospheric scientist]]s', [[biologist]]s', and [[climatologist]]s' warnings of the [[climate change|climate-change]] [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]] that is on course to destroy all of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Busby, "Warming World:  Why Climate Change Matters More Than Anything Else", ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', vol. 97, no. 4 (July / August 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|On 8 October 2018 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] published a report stating that, if drastic changes in the global [[energy]] base and lifestyle are not made by about 2030—within a dozen years—civilization on planet Earth will become unsalvageable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], ''Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C'', 8 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Martin Amis 2012 by Maximilian Schoenherr.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Martin Amis]]]]

British novelist [[Martin Amis]] observes that recurring patterns of [[empire|imperial]] ascendance-and-decline are mirrored in the [[novel]]:  novels seem to follow the political power.  In the 19th century, when [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was ascendant on the planet, British novels were huge and tried to express what the whole society was.  British [[hegemony]] waned with [[World War II]] and ended after the war.  The British novel was then some 225 pages long and centered on narrower subjects such as career setbacks or marriage setbacks:  the British novel's "great tradition" increasingly looked depleted.  Ascendance had passed to the [[United States]], and Americans such as [[Saul Bellow]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Philip Roth]], and [[John Updike]] began writing huge novels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Tanenhaus]], "The Electroshock Novelist:  The Alluring Bad Boy of Literary England Has Always Been Fascinated by Britain's Dustbin Empire.  Now [[Martin Amis]] Takes On American Excess," ''[[Newsweek]]'', July 2 &amp; 9, 2012, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39377">{{for|the denial and distortion of the historical record|Historical negationism}}
In [[historiography]], the term '''historical revisionism''' identifies the re-interpretation of the historical record. It usually means challenging the [[wikt:orthodox|orthodox]] (established, accepted or traditional) views held by professional scholars about a historical event, introducing contrary evidence, or reinterpreting the motivations and decisions of the people involved. The revision of the [[historical record]] can reflect new discoveries of fact, evidence, and interpretation, which then provokes a revised history.  In dramatic cases, revisionism involves a reversal of older moral judgments.

At a basic level, legitimate historical revisionism is a common and not especially controversial process of developing and refining the writing of history. Much more controversial  is the reversal of moral findings, in which what had been considered to be positive forces are depicted as being negative. This revisionism is then challenged by the supporters of the previous view, often in heated terms, and becomes an illegitimate form of historical revisionism known as [[historical negationism]] if it involves inappropriate methods such as the use of forged documents or implausible distrust of genuine documents, attributing false conclusions to books and sources, manipulating statistical data and deliberately mis-translating texts. This type of historical revisionism presents a re-interpretation of the moral meaning of the historical record.&lt;ref name="Evans-145"&gt;''Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial'', by [[Richard J. Evans]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-465-02153-0}}. p. 145. The author is a professor of Modern History, at the [[University of Cambridge]], and was a major expert-witness in the ''Irving v. Lipstadt'' trial; the book presents his perspective of the trial, and the expert-witness report, including his research about the Dresden death count.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "revisionism" is used pejoratively by those who claim that revisionists are distorting the historical record.  This is especially the case when it is applied to [[Holocaust denial]].

==Historical scholarship==
{{Globalize/US|date=August 2018}}
Historical revisionism is the means by which the [[historical record]] — the history of a society, as understood in their [[collective memory]] — continually integrates new facts and interpretations of the events commonly understood as [[history]]; about which the historian and [[American Historical Association]] member [[James M. McPherson]], said:

{{Quote|The fourteen-thousand members of this [[American Historical Association|association]], however, know that revision is the lifeblood of historical scholarship. History is a continuing [[Discourse|dialogue]], between the present and the past. Interpretations of the past are subject to change in response to new evidence, new questions asked of the evidence, new perspectives gained by the passage of time. There is no single, eternal, and immutable “[[truth]]” about past events and their meaning.

The unending quest of historians for understanding the past — that is, ''revisionism'' — is what makes history vital and meaningful. Without revisionism, we might be stuck with the images of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] [1865–77] after the [[American Civil War]] [1861–65] that were conveyed by [[D. W. Griffith]]’s ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' [1915] and [[Claude Bowers]]’s ''The Tragic Era'' [1929]. Were the [[Gilded Age]] [1870s–1900] entrepreneurs “[[Captain of industry|Captains of Industry]]” or “[[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber Barons]]”?

Without  revisionist historians, who have done research in new sources and asked new and nuanced questions, we would remain mired in one or another of these stereotypes. Supreme Court decisions often reflect a “revisionist” interpretation of history, as well as of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2003/0309/0309pre1.cfm Revisionist Historians]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the field of [[historiography]], the [[historian]] who works within the existing [[The Establishment|establishment]] of society, and who has produced a body of [[history books]], from which he or she can claim [[Authority (sociology)|authority]], usually benefits from the ''[[status quo]]''. As such, the professional-historian [[paradigm]] is manifested as a [[Reflex reaction|denunciative stance]] towards any form of historical revisionism — either of fact or interpretation, or both. In contrast to the single-paradigm form of writing history, the philosopher of science, [[Thomas Kuhn]], said, in contrast to the quantifiable [[hard sciences]], characterized by a single paradigm, the [[social sciences]] are characterized by several paradigms that derive from a “tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over [the] fundamentals” of [[research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kuhn|first= Thomas N.|authorlink=Thomas Kuhn|editor1-last=Lakatos|editor1-first=Imre|editor2-last=Musgrave|editor2-first=Alan|editor1-link=Imre Lakatos|editor2-link= Alan Musgrave|title=Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge|edition= second|origyear= 1970|year=1972|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 0-521-09623-5 |page= 6|chapter=Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; About resistance against the works of revised history that present a [[Postcolonialism|culturally comprehensive]] historical narrative of the U.S. — the perspectives of [[black people]], [[feminism|women]], and the [[labour movement]] — the historian David Williams said:

{{Quote|These, and other, scholarly voices, called for a more comprehensive treatment of American history, stressing that the mass of Americans, not simply the power élites, made history. Yet, it was mainly white males of the power élite who had the means to attend college, become professional historians, and shape a view of history that served their own [[Social class|class]], race, and gender interests at the expense of those not so fortunate — and, quite literally, to paper over aspects of history they found uncomfortable. “One is astonished in the study of history”, wrote [[W. E. B. Du Bois|Du Bois]] in 1935, “at the recurrence of the idea that evil must be forgotten, distorted, skimmed over. . . . The difficulty, of course, with this philosophy is that history loses its value, as an incentive and [as] an example; it paints perfect men and noble nations, but it does not tell the truth”.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, David. ''A People's History of the Civil War: Struggles for the Meaning of Freedom.''(2005) pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the Second World War, the study and production of history in the U.S. was expanded by the [[G.I. Bill]], which funding allowed “a new and more broadly-based generation of scholars” with perspectives and interpretations drawn from the [[feminist movement]], the [[civil rights movement]], and the [[American Indian Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; That expansion and deepening of the pool of historians voided the existence of a definitive and universally accepted history, therefore, the revisionist historian presents the national public with a history that has been corrected and augmented with new facts, evidence, and interpretations of the historical record. In ''The Cycles of American History'' (1986), in contrasting and comparing the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. during the [[Cold War|Russo–American Cold War]] (1945–91), the historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] said:

{{Quote|. . . but others, especially in the United States . . . represent what American historians call ''revisionism'' — that is a readiness to challenge official explanations. No one should be surprised by this phenomenon. Every war in American history has been followed, in due course, by skeptical reassessments of supposedly sacred assumptions . . .  for [historical] revisionism is an essential part of the process, by which history, through the posing of new problems and the investigation of new possibilities, enlarges its perspectives and enriches its insights.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, Arthur M. Jr. ''The Cycles of American History.''(1986) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Revisionist historians contest the mainstream or traditional view of historical events, they raise views at odds with traditionalists, which must be freshly judged. Revisionist history is often practiced by those who are in the minority, such as feminist historians, ethnic minority historians, those working outside of mainstream academia in smaller and less known universities, or the youngest scholars, essentially historians who have the most to gain and the least to lose in challenging the status quo. In the friction between the mainstream of accepted beliefs and the new perspectives of historical revisionism, received historical ideas are either changed, solidified, or clarified. If over a period of time the revisionist ideas become the new establishment ''status quo'' a [[paradigm shift]] is said to have occurred. Historian [[Forrest McDonald]] is often critical of the turn that revisionism has taken, but he nevertheless admits that the turmoil of the 1960s in the United States changed the way history was written:

{{Quote|The result, as far as the study of history was concerned, was an awakened interest in subjects that historians had previously slighted. Indian history, black history, women’s history, family history, and a host of specializations arose. These expanded horizons enriched our understanding of the American past, but they also resulted in works of special pleading, trivialization, and downright falsification.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Forest. ''Recovering the Past: A Historian's Memoir.'' (2004) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historians are influenced by the ''[[zeitgeist]]'' (spirit of the time), and the usually progressive changes to society, politics, and culture, which occurred after the [[Second World War]] (1939–45); in ''The Future of the Past'' (1989), the historian [[C. Vann Woodward]] said:

{{Quote|These events have come with a concentration and violence for which the term ''revolution'' is usually reserved. It is a revolution, or perhaps a set of revolutions for which we have not yet found a name. My thesis is that these developments will and should raise new questions about the past, and affect our reading of large areas of history, and my belief is that future revisions may be extensive enough to justify calling the coming age of historiography an “Age of Reinterpretation”. The first illustration [the absence from U.S. history of external threats, because of geography] happens to come mainly from American history, but this should not obscure the broader scope of the revolution, which has no national limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=C. Vann |title=The Future of the Past |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195057447 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Developments in the academy, culture, and politics shaped the contemporary model of writing history — the accepted paradigm of [[historiography]]; the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] said: "each generation has its own troubles and problems, and, therefore, its own interests and its own point of view", and that:

{{Quote|sign=|source=|it follows that each generation has a right to look upon and re-interpret history in [their] own way. . . . After all, we study history because we are interested in it, and perhaps because we wish to learn something about our [contemporary] problems. But history can serve neither of these two purposes if, under the influence of an inapplicable idea of objectivity, we hesitate to present historical problems from our point of view. And we should not think that our point of view, if consciously and critically applied to the problem, will be inferior to that of a writer who naïvely believes . . . that he has reached a level of objectivity permitting him to present "the events of the past as they actually did happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Novick |first=Peter |title=That Noble Dream: The Objectivity Question and the American Historical Profession |year=1988 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521357456 |page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the social, political, and cultural influences change a society, most historians revise and update their explanation of historical events. The old consensus, based upon limited evidence, might no longer be considered historically valid in explaining the particulars — of cause and effect, of motivation and self-interest — that tell ''How?'' and ''Why?'' the past occurred as it occurred; therefore, the historical revisionism of the factual record is revised to concord with the contemporary understanding of history. As such, in 1986, the historian John Hope Franklin described four stages in the historiography of the African experience of life in the U.S., which were based upon different models of historical consensus.&lt;ref&gt;African-American History: Origins, Development, and Current State of the Field | Joe W.

==Negationism and denial==
{{main|Historical negationism}}

The historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]] (''[[Denying the Holocaust|Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory]]'', 1993), and the historians [[Michael Shermer]] and [[Alex Grobman]] (''[[Denying History|Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?]]'', 2002), distinguish between historical revisionism and historical negationism, the latter of which is a form of [[denialism]]. Lipstadt said that [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]], such as [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], disingenuously self-identify as "historical revisionists" in order to [[Obscurantism|obscure]] their denialism as academic revision of the historical record.

As such, Lipstadt, Shermer, and Grobman said that legitimate historical revisionism entails the refinement of existing knowledge about a historical event, not a denial of the event, itself; that such refinement of history emerges from the examination of new, empirical evidence, and a re-examination, and consequent re-interpretation of the existing documentary evidence. That legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges the existence of a "certain body of irrefutable evidence" and the existence of a "convergence of evidence", which suggest that an event — such as the [[Black Death]], [[Slavery in the United States|American slavery]], and [[the Holocaust]] — did occur; whereas the denialism of history rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence, which is a form of historical negationism.&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer &amp; Grobman 200:34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Berger. ''Fathoming the Holocaust: A Social Problems Approach'', Aldine Transaction, 2002, {{ISBN|0-202-30670-4}}, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Some of the influences on historians, which may change over time are:

*'''Access to new data:''' Much historical data has been lost. Even [[archives]] have to make decisions based on space and interest on what original material to obtain or keep. At times documents are discovered or publicized that give new views of well established events. Archived material may be sealed by Governments for many years, either to hide political scandals, or to protect information vital for national security. When these archives are opened, they can alter the historical perspective on an event. For example, with the release of the [[Ultra (cryptography)|ULTRA]] archives in the 1970s under the British 30 years rule, a lot of the Allied high command tactical decision making process was re-evaluated, particularly the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. &lt;!-- Before the release of the ULTRA archives, there was much debate over whether Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] could have known that [[Arnhem]] was heavily garrisoned. With the release of the archives, which indicated that they were, the balance of the evidence swung in the direction of his detractors.--&gt; The release of the ULTRA archives also forced a re-evaluation of the [[History of computing hardware|history of the electronic computer]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1972, before the release of official documents about ULTRA, [[Herman Goldstine]] wrote in ''The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann'' page 321 that: "Britain had such vitality that it could immediately after the war embark on so many well-conceived and well-executed projects in the computer field." In 1976 after the archive were opened [[Brian Randell]] wrote in ''The COLOSSUS'' on page 87 that: "the COLOSSUS project was an important source of this vitality, one that has been largely unappreciated, as has the significance of its places in the chronology of the invention of the digital computer."&lt;/ref&gt; 
** '''New sources in other languages:''' As more sources in other languages become available historians may review their theories in light of the new sources. The revision of the meaning of the [[#The Dark Ages|Dark Ages]] are an example of this.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
* '''Developments in other fields of science:''' [[DNA]] analysis has had an impact in various areas of history either confirming established historical theories or presenting new evidence that undermines the current established historical explanation. Professor [[Andrew Sherratt]], a British prehistorian, was responsible for introducing the work of anthropological writings on the consumption of currently legal and illegal drugs and how to use these papers to explain certain aspects of prehistoric societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article349471.ece Obituary of Andrew Sherratt] in ''[[The Independent]]'' 6 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbon dating]], the examination of [[ice core]]s and [[tree rings]], [[palynology]], [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM analysis]] of early metal samples, and measuring [[oxygen isotopes]] in bones, have all provided new data in the last few decades with which to argue new hypotheses. Extracting [[ancient DNA]] allows scientists to argue whether or not humans are partly descended from [[Neanderthals]].
* '''Nationalism:''' For example, when reading schoolbook history in Europe, it is possible to read about an event from completely different perspectives. In the [[Battle of Waterloo]] most British, French, Dutch and German schoolbooks slant the battle to emphasise the importance of the contribution of their nations. Sometimes the name of an event is used to convey political or a national perspective. For example, the same conflict between two English-speaking countries is known by two different names: the "[[American War of Independence]]" and the "[[American Revolutionary War]]". As perceptions of nationalism change so do those areas of history that are driven by such ideas.
* '''Culture:''' For example, as regionalism has become more prominent in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] some historians have been suggesting that the [[English Civil War]] is too Anglo-centric and that to understand the war, events that had previously been dismissed as on the periphery should be given greater prominence; to emphasise this, revisionist historians have suggested that the English Civil War becomes just one of a number of interlocking conflicts known as [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. Furthermore, as cultures develop, it may become strategically advantageous for some revision-minded groups to revise their public historical narrative in such a way so as to either discover, or in rarer cases manufacture, a precedent which contemporary members of the given subcultures can use as a basis or rationale for reform or change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=A Discussion On The Purpose of Cultural Identity|journal=The Apollonian Revolt|date=2014|url=http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|accessdate=10 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419090905/http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ideology:''' For example, during the 1940s it became fashionable to see the English Civil War from a Marxist school of thought. In the words of [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], "the Civil War was a class war." In the post [[World War II]] years the influence of Marxist interpretation waned in British academia and by the 1970s this view came under attack by a new school of revisionists and it has been largely overturned as a major mainstream explanation of the middle 17th century conflict in [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]].
*'''Historical causation:''' Issues of [[causality|causation]] in history are often revised with new research: for example by the middle of the twentieth century the status quo was to see the [[French Revolution]] as the result of the triumphant rise of a new [[middle class]]. Research in the 1960s prompted by revisionist historians like [[Alfred Cobban]] and [[François Furet]] revealed the social situation as much more complex and the question of what caused the Revolution is now a closely debated one.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Revised versions==

===The Dark Ages===
As non-[[Latin]] texts, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] and the [[Old Norse|Norse]] [[saga]]s have been analysed and added to the canon of knowledge about the period and a much more [[archaeological]] evidence has come to light, the period known as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] has narrowed to the point where many historians no longer believe that such a term is useful. Moreover, the term "dark" implies less of a void of culture and law, but more a lack of many [[source text]]s in mainland [[Europe]]. Many modern scholars who study the era tend to avoid the term altogether for its [[negative connotation]]s, finding it misleading and inaccurate for any part of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Christopher A.|author-link=Christopher Snyder|year=1998|contribution=|contribution-url=|title=An Age of Tyrants: Britain and the Britons A.D. 400&amp;ndash;600|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|publication-date=1998|publication-place=University Park|pages=xiii&amp;ndash;xiv|isbn=0-271-01780-5|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}, for example. This work contains over 100 pages of footnoted citations to source material and bibliographic references (pp. 263&amp;ndash;387). In explaining his approach to writing the work, he refers to the "so-called Dark Ages", noting that "Historians and archaeologists have never liked the label Dark Ages ... there are numerous indicators that these centuries were neither "dark" nor "barbarous" in comparison with other eras."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dmas&gt;[[William Chester Jordan|Jordan, Chester William]] (2004). ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', Supplement 1. Verdun, Kathleen, "Medievalism" pp. 389–397. Sections 'Victorian Medievalism', 'Nineteenth-Century Europe', 'Medievalism in America 1500–1900', 'The 20th Century'. Same volume, [[Paul Freedman|Freedman, Paul]], "Medieval Studies", pp. 383–389.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feudalism===
The concept of [[feudalism]] has been questioned. Revisionist scholars led by historian [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]] have [[Feudalism#Challenges to the feudal model|rejected the term]].

===Agincourt===
For centuries, historians thought the [[Battle of Agincourt]] was an engagement in which the English army, though overwhelmingly outnumbered four to one by the [[France|French]] army, pulled off a stunning victory—a version especially popularised by [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. However, recent research by Professor [[Anne Curry]], using the original enrollment records, has brought into question this interpretation. Though her research is not finished,&lt;ref&gt;Page 288. Matthew Strickland ''The Great Warbow''. Pub Sutton, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7509-3167-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; she has published her initial findings,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Curry]]. ''Agincourt: A New History'', Pub Tempus, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7524-2828-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the French only outnumbered the English and Welsh 12,000 to 8,000. If true, the numbers may have been exaggerated for patriotic reasons by the English.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brooks ''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-523-1632547,00.html Henry V's payroll cuts Agincourt myth down to size]'' May 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===New World discovery===
In recounting the [[European colonization of the Americas]], some history books of the past paid little attention to the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], usually mentioning them only in passing and making no attempt to understand the events from their point of view. This was reflected in the description of [[Christopher Columbus]] having discovered America. The portrayal of these events has since been revised, avoiding the word "discovery."&lt;ref&gt;Kay Larson, and Edith Newhall, "It's a Map, Map, Map World" [https://books.google.com/books?id=i-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA97 ''New York Magazine'' Nov 1992 25#43 pp 97+  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1990 revisionist book, ''The Conquest of Paradise: Christopher Columbus and the Columbian Legacy'', [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] argued that [[Christopher Columbus]] was an imperialist bent on conquest from his first voyage. In a ''New York Times'' book review, historian and member of the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Committee [[William Hardy McNeill]] wrote about Sale: 
:he has set out to destroy the heroic image that earlier writers have transmitted to us. Mr. Sale makes Columbus out to be cruel, greedy and incompetent (even as a sailor), and a man who was perversely intent on abusing the natural paradise on which he intruded."&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DD1739F934A35753C1A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Review of Kirkpatrick Sale's ''The Conquest of Paradise''], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 7, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

McNeill declares Sale's work to be "unhistorical, in the sense that [it] selects from the often cloudy record of Columbus's actual motives and deeds what suits the researcher's 20th-century purposes."  McNeill states that detractors and advocates of Columbus present a "sort of history [that] caricatures the complexity of human reality by turning Columbus into either a bloody ogre or a plaster saint, as the case may be."&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, October 7, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===French attack formations in the Napoleonic wars===
The military historian [[James R. Arnold]] argues that:
{{quote|The writings of Sir [[Charles Oman]] and Sir [[John William Fortescue|John Fortescue]] dominated subsequent English-language Napoleonic history. Their views [that the French infantry used heavy columns to attack lines of infantry] became very much the received wisdom.... By 1998 a new paradigm seemed to have set in with the publication of two books devoted to Napoleonic battle tactics. Both claimed that the French fought in line at Maida and both fully explored French tactical variety. The 2002 publication of ''The Battle of Maida 1806: Fifteen Minutes of Glory'', appeared to have brought the issue of column versus line to a satisfactory conclusion: "The contemporary sources are ... the best evidence and their conclusion is clear: General [[Louis Fursy Henri Compère|Compère's]] brigade formed into line to attack [[James Kempt|Kempt's]] Light Battalion." The decisive [[action at Maida]] took place in less than fifteen minutes. It had taken 72 years to rectify a great historian's error about what transpired during those minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, James R. ''[http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/maida/c_maida.html A Reappraisal of Column Versus Line in the Peninsular War Oman and Historiography]'', [[The Napoleon Series]], August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James R. Arnold, "A Reappraisal of Column Versus Line in the Napoleonic Wars" ''[[Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research]]'' LX no. 244 (Winter 1982): pp. 196–208.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===World War I===
 {{see also|Causes of World War I}}

====German guilt====
In reaction to the orthodox interpretation enshrined in the [[Versailles Treaty]] (which declared that Germany was guilty of starting World War I), the self-described "revisionist" historians of the 1920s rejected the orthodox view and presented a complex causation in which several other countries were equally guilty. Intense debate continues among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Selig Adler, "The War-Guilt Question and American Disillusionment, 1918–1928", ''Journal of Modern History,'' Vol. 23, No. 1 (Mar., 1951), pp. 1–28 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1871365 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poor British and French military leadership====
The military leadership of the [[British Army]] during [[World War I]] was frequently condemned as poor by historians and politicians for decades after the war ended. Common charges were that the generals commanding the army were blind to the realities of [[trench warfare]], ignorant of the conditions of their men and were unable to learn from their mistakes, thus causing enormous numbers of casualties ("[[lions led by donkeys]]").&lt;ref&gt;Lions Led By Donkeys
*Thompson, P.A. ''[http://www.churchillbooks.com/detail.cfm?item_num=38200&amp;is_mil_book=1 ''Lions Led By Donkeys: Showing How Victory In The Great War Was Achieved By Those Who Made the Fewest Mistakes''] T. Werner Laurie, Ltd. 1st English Edition. 1927
*Bournes, John. [http://www.firstworldwar.bham.ac.uk/donkey/index.htm "Lions Led By Donkeys"], Centre for First World War Studies, [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 1960s, historians such as [[John Terraine]] began to challenge this interpretation. In recent years, as new documents have come forth and the passage of time has allowed for more objective analysis, historians such as [[Gary D. Sheffield]] and [[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]] observe that the military leadership of the British Army on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] had to cope with many problems that they could not control, such as a lack of adequate military [[communication]]s, which was not known before. Furthermore, military leadership improved throughout the war, culminating in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] advance to victory in 1918. Some historians, even revisionists, still criticise the British High Command severely, but they are less inclined to portray the war in a simplistic manner with brave troops being led by foolish officers.

There has been a similar movement regarding the French Army during the war with contributions by historians such as [[Anthony Clayton]]. Revisionists are far more likely to view commanders such as French General [[Ferdinand Foch]], British General [[Douglas Haig]] and other figures, such as American [[John J. Pershing|General Pershing]], in a sympathetic light.

===Reconstruction in U.S.===
Revisionist historians of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction after the U.S. Civil War]] rejected the dominant [[Dunning School]] that stated the blacks were used by [[carpetbaggers]], and instead has stressed economic greed on the part of northern businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Weisberger, "The Dark and Bloody Ground of Reconstruction Historiography", ''The Journal of Southern History,'' Vol. 25, No. 4 (Nov., 1959), pp. 427–447 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2954450 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in recent years a "[[neoabolitionist]]" revisionism has become standard, that uses the moral standards of racial equality of the 19th century abolitionists to criticize racial policies. "Foner's book represents the mature and settled Revisionist perspective," historian Michael Perman has concluded regarding [[Eric Foner]]'s ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877'' (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perman, "Review: Eric Foner's Reconstruction: A Finished Revolution", ''Reviews in American History'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (Mar., 1989), pp. 73–78 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2703129 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilt for causing World War II===
{{Main|Causes of World War II}}
The orthodox interpretation blamed Hitler and Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan for causing the war. Revisionist historians of World War II, notably [[Charles A. Beard]], said the U.S. was partly to blame because it pressed the Japanese too hard in 1940–41 and rejected compromises.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Flagg Bemis, "First Gun of a Revisionist Historiography for the Second World War", ''Journal of Modern History,'' Vol. 19, No. 1 (Mar., 1947), pp. 55–59 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1875652 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable contributions to this discussion include Charles Tansill, ''Back Door To War'' (Chicago, 1952); Frederic Sanborn, ''Design For War'' (New York, 1951); and David Hoggan, ''The Forced War'' (Costa Mesa, 1989).  British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] ignited a firestorm when he argued Hitler was a rather ordinary diplomat and did not deliberately set out to cause a war.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Martel, ed. ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered: A.J.P. Taylor and the Historians.'' (2nd ed. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Buchanan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Patrick J. Buchanan |authorlink=Pat Buchanan |title=Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War: How Britain Lost Its Empire and the West Lost the World |year=2009 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |isbn=978-0307405166}}{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American conservative [[pundit]], argued the Anglo–French guarantee to Poland in 1939 encouraged Poland not to seek a compromise over Danzig, though Britain and France were in no position to come to Poland's aid, and Hitler was offering the Poles an alliance in return. He argues that they thereby turned a minor border dispute into a catastrophic world conflict, and handed East Europe, including Poland, to Stalin. Buchanan further argued the British pact with Poland ensured the country would be invaded, as Stalin knew the British Empire would not be able to declare war on Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939.

===American business and the "Robber Barons"===
The role of American business and the alleged [[Robber baron (industrialist)|"robber barons"]] began to be revised in the 1930s. Termed "business revisionism" by [[Gabriel Kolko]], historians such as [[Allan Nevins]], and, later, [[Alfred D. Chandler]] emphasized the positive contributions of individuals who were previously pictured as villains.&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, Gabriel. "The Premises of Business Revisionism" in ''The Business History Review'', Vol. 33, No. 3 (Autumn, 1959), p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Novick writes, "The argument that whatever the moral delinquencies of the robber barons, these were far outweighed by their decisive contributions to American military [and industrial] prowess, was frequently invoked by Allan Nevins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Novick |first=Peter |title=That Noble Dream: The Objectivity Question and the American Historical profession |year=1988 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521357456 |page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War===
In the [[historiography of the Cold War]] a debate exists between historians advocating an "orthodox" and "revisionist" interpretation of [[Soviet history]] and other aspects of the [[Cold War]] such as the [[Vietnam War]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

====Vietnam War====
''[[America in Vietnam]]'' (1978), by [[Guenter Lewy]], is an example of historical revisionism that differs much from the popular view of the role of the U.S. in the [[Vietnam War]] (1955–75), for which the author was criticised and supported for belonging to the revisionist school on the history of the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="tri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reverse"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Robert A.| last = Divine| authorlink =| coauthors =|date=September 1979| title = Review: Revisionism in Reverse| journal = [[Reviews in American History]]| volume = 7| issue = 3| pages = 433–438| id =| doi = 10.2307/2701181| last2 = Lewy| first2 = Guenter| last3 = Millett| first3 = Allan R. | author3link =Allan R. Millett| jstor=2701181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewy's reinterpretation was the first book of a body of work by historians of the revisionist school about the [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] role and the military behavior of the United States in the country of Vietnam.

In the Introduction to ''America in Vietnam'', Lewy said:

{{Quote|It is the reasoned conclusion of this study . . . that the sense of guilt created by the Vietnam war in the minds of many Americans is not warranted and that the charges of ''officially, condoned'' illegal and grossly immoral conduct are without substance. Indeed, detailed examination of battlefield practices reveals that the loss of civilian life in Vietnam was less great than in [[World War II]] [1939–45] and [[Korean War|Korea]] [1950–53] and that concern with minimizing the ravages of the war was strong. To measure and compare the devastation and loss of human life caused by different war will be objectionable to those who repudiate all resort to military force as an instrument of foreign policy and may be construed as callousness. Yet as long as wars do take place at all it remains a moral duty to seek to reduce the agony caused by war, and the fulfillment of this obligation should not be disdained.|''America in Vietnam'' (1979), p. vii.&lt;ref&gt;Guenter Lewy, ''America in Vietnam'', p. VII.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other reinterpretations of the historical record of the [[U.S. war in Vietnam]], which offer alternative explanations for American behavior, include ''Why We Are in Vietnam'' (1982), by [[Norman Podhoretz]],&lt;ref name="tri"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Ian| last = Horwood| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =| month =| title = Book review: Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954–1965| journal = [[Institute of Historical Research]]| volume =| issue =| pages =| id =| url = http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/horwood.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954–1965'' (2006), by [[Mark Moyar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark Moyar |title=Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954–1965 |year=2006 |isbn=0-521-86911-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Vietnam: The Necessary War''  (1999), by [[Michael Lind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Lind |title=Vietnam: The Necessary War |year=1999 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=978-0684842547}}{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''historiography of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]''' is highly controversial. Most Argentine historians take an approach either for or against him, a dispute that influenced much of the whole [[historiography of Argentina]].&lt;ref name="Luna"&gt;Félix Luna, "Con Rosas o contra Rosas", pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary descriptions==
Rosas' government of Argentina, during the period of the [[Argentine Civil Wars|civil wars]], attracted wide criticism. Most leaders of the [[Unitarian Party]] exiled themselves to other countries during Rosas' rule. [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], living in Chile, wrote ''[[Facundo]]'', a biography of [[Facundo Quiroga]] whose real intention was to attack Rosas.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Unitarians established themselves in [[Montevideo]]. In their writings they criticized Rosas, calling him a ruthless dictator and accusing him of many crimes. These statements were not intended for merely local effect but were designed to promote a European intervention in the conflict.  [[José Rivera Indarte]] wrote a work called ''Blood Tables'' (Tablas de Sangre) which was published in Europe. It was intended to be a complete list of the known victims of Rosas.  It attributed more than 22,000 deaths to his government.  The Argentine politician [[Manuel Moreno]] considered this work to be libel. The reports from Montevideo were echoed in France, as many French citizens resided in Montevideo at that time. [[Alexandre Dumas]] wrote the novel ''[[The New Troy|Montevideo, or the New Troy]]'' based on the reports of [[Melchor Pacheco]]. [[Adolphe Thiers]] urged [[François Guizot]] to intervene in the conflict. On its own initiative France imposed a [[French blockade of the Río de la Plata|blockade of the Río de la Plata]] between 1838 and 1840, which was followed in 1845 by a [[Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata|joint blockade with Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosa, pp. 135–42&lt;/ref&gt;

The intervention by the European powers won sympathy for Rosas from other South Americans, who saw him as a fellow American standing against powerful foreign aggressors.&lt;ref name="Johnson, p. 111"&gt;Johnson, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; He was supported by [[Francisco Antonio Pinto]], [[José Ballivián]], and many international newspapers. Some of those newspapers were the American ''[[New York Sun]]'' (5 August 1845) and ''[[New York Herald]]'' (7 September 1845), the Brazilians ''[[O Brado de Amazonas]]'' (9 August 1845) and ''[[O Sentinella da Monarchia]]'' (20 August 1845) and the Chilean ''[[El Tiempo (Chile)|El Tiempo]]'' (15 August 1845).&lt;ref&gt;Lascano, pp. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Libertadores|liberator]] [[José de San Martín]], who was living in France, corresponded with Rosas, offering his full support, both against the Europeans and the Unitarians. San Martín showed his respect by bequeathing his sword to Rosas.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later descriptions==
Rosas was deposed by [[Justo José de Urquiza]] in 1852, in the [[battle of Caseros]], and Buenos Aires seceded from the [[Argentine Confederation]] later in the year. Rosas moved into exile in Southampton. The Unitarians confiscated all his properties and repudiated him in a variety of ways. [[José Mármol]] wrote the novel [[Amalia (novel)|Amalia]], the first Argentine novel, and included several criticisms to Rosas, such as "''not even the dust of your bones the America will have''".&lt;ref name="Johnson, p. 111"/&gt; However, such authors cannot be considered exclusively from the perspectives of historiography or the history of ideas, as they were politically active people, even with main roles in the political struggles of their time; and their works were used as tools to advertise their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Gelman, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Most documents of the time were burned during the aftermath of Caseros.&lt;ref&gt;Lascano, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The legislature of Buenos Aires charged him with [[High treason]] in 1857; [[Nicanor Arbarellos]] supported his vote with the following speech:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rosas, sir, that tyrant, that barbarian, even if barbarian and cruel, was not considered as such by the European and civilized nations, and that judgment of the European and civilized nations, moved to posterity, will hold in doubt, at least, that barbarian and execrable tyranny that Rosas exercised among us. It's needed, then, to mark with a legislative sanction declaring him guilty of ''lèse majesté'' so at least this point is marked in history, and it is seen that the most potent court, which is the popular court, which is the voice of the sovereign peoples by us represented, throws to the monster the anathema calling him traitor and guilty of ''lèse majesté''. Judgments like those must not be left for history.

What will be said, what might be said in history when it's seen that the civilized nations of the world, for whom we are but just a point, have acknowledged in this tyrant a being worthy to deal with them? That England has returned his cannons taken in war action, and saluted his bloody and innocent-blood stained flag with a 21-gun salute? This fact, known by history, would be a great counterweight, Sir, if we leave Rosas without this sanction. The France itself, which started the crusade that was shared by general Lavalle, in its due time also abandoned him, dealt with Rosas and saluted his flag with a 21-gun salute. I ask, Sir, if this fact won't erase from history everything we may say, if we leave this monster that decimated us for so many years without a sanction.

The judgment of Rosas must not be left to history, as some people desire. It's clear that it can't be left to history the judgment of the tyrant Rosas. Let's throw to Rosas this anathema, which perhaps can be the only one to harm him in history, because otherwise his tyranny will always be doubtful, as well as his crimes! What will be said in history, sir? And this is sad to tell, what will be said in history when it is said that the brave Admiral Brown, the hero of the Navy of the Independence war, was the admiral who defended the tyranny of Rosas? What will be said in history without this anathema, when it is said that this man who contributed with his glories and talents to give shine to the Sun of May, that the other deputee referenced in his speech, when it is said that General San Martín, the conqueror of the Andes, the father of the Argentine glories, made him the greatest tribute that can be given to a soldier by handing him his sword? Will this be believed, sir, if we don't throw an anathema to the tyrant Rosas? Will this man be known as he is in 20 or 50 years, if we want to go further, when it is known that Brown and San Martín were loyal to him and gave him the most respectful tributes, along with France and England?

No, sir: they will say, the savage unitarians, his enemies, lied. He has not been a tyrant: far from that, he has been a great man, a great general. It's needed to throw without doubts this anathema to the monster. If at least we had imititated the English people, who dragged the corpse of Cromwell across the streets of London, and had dragged Rosas across the streets of Buenos Aires! I support, Mr. President, the project. If the judgment of Rosas was left to the judgment of history, we won't get Rosas to be condemned as a tyrant,  but perhaps he may be in it the greatest and most glorious of Argentines.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|{{lang-es|link=no|Rosas, señor, ese tirano, ese bárbaro, así bárbaro y cruel, no era considerado lo mismo por las naciones europeas y civilizadas, y ese juicio de las naciones europeas y civilizadas, pasando a la posteridad, pondrá en duda, cuando menos, esa tiranía bárbara y execrable que Rosas ejerció entre nosotros. Es necesario, pues, marcar con una sanción legislativa declarándole reo de lesa patria para que siquiera quede marcado este punto en la historia, y se vea que el tribunal más potente, que es el tribunal popular, que es la voz del pueblo soberano por nosotros representado, lanza al monstruo el anatema llamándole traidor y reo de lesa patria... Juicios como éstos no deben dejarse a la historia... ¿Qué se dirá, qué se podrá decir en la historia cuando se viere que las naciones civilizadas del mundo, para quien nosotros somos un punto... han reconocido en ese tirano un ser digno de tratar con ellos?, ¿que la Inglaterra le ha devuelto sus cañones tomados en acción de guerra, y saludado su pabellón sangriento y manchado con sangre inocente con la salva de 21 cañonazos?... Este hecho conocido en la historia, sería un gran contrapeso, señor, si dejamos a Rosas sin este fallo. La Francia misma, que inició la cruzada en que figuraba el general Lavalle, a su tiempo también lo abandonó, trató con Rosas y saludó su pabellón con 21 cañonazos... Yo pregunto, señor, si este hecho no borrará en la historia todo lo que podamos decir, si dejamos sin un fallo a este monstruo que nos ha diezmado por tantos años... No se puede librar el juicio de Rosas a la historia, como quieren algunos... Es evidente que no puede librarse a la historia el fallo del tirano Rosas... ¡Lancemos sobre Rosas este anatema, que tal vez sea el único que puede hacerle mal en la historia, porque de otro modo ha de ser dudosa siempre su tiranía y también sus crímenes... ¿Qué se dirá en la historia, señor?, y esto sí que es hasta triste decirlo, ¿qué se dirá en la historia cuando se diga que el valiente general Brown, el héroe de la marina en la guerra de la independencia, era el almirante que defendió los derechos de Rosas? ¿Qué se dirá en la historia sin este anatema, cuando se diga que este hombre que contribuyó con sus glorias y talentos a dar brillo a ese sol de Mayo, que el señor diputado recordaba en su discurso, cuando se diga que el general San Martín, el vencedor de los Andes, el padre de las glorias argentinas, le hizo el homenaje más grandioso que puede hacer un militar legándole su espada? ¿Se creerá esto, señor, si no lanzamos un anatema contra el tirano Rosas? ¿Se creerá dentro de 20 años o de 50, si se quiere ir más lejos, a ese hombre tal como es, cuando se sepa que Brown y San Martín le servían fieles y le rendían los homenajes más respetuosos a la par de la Francia y de la Inglaterra? No, señor: dirán, los salvajes unitarios, sus enemigos, mentían. No ha sido un tirano: lejos de eso ha sido un gran hombre, un gran general. Es preciso lanzar sin duda ninguna ese anatema sobre el monstruo... ¡Ojalá hubiéramos imitado al pueblo inglés que arrastró por las calles de Londres el cadáver de Cromwell, y hubiéramos arrastrado a Rosas por las calles de Buenos Aires!... Yo he de estar, señor Presidente, por el proyecto. Si el juicio de Rosas lo librásemos al fallo de la historia, no conseguiremos que Rosas sea condenado como tirano, y sí tal vez que fuese en ella el más grande y el más glorioso de los argentinos.}}|group=upper-alpha}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A notable exception to this trend was [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], who was among the Unitarian expatriates in Montevideo and attacked Rosas during his rule. He met with him during the latter's exile in England in 1857, an event which changed his mind into supporting him and even lead to becoming friends. Alberdi would condemn the aforementioned sanction against Rosas, lauded that he never plotted to regain power, compared the barbarism attributed to him with the contemporary United States, Russia, Italy and Germany, and pointed that Urquiza deposed Rosas to organize the country but the actual result was the secession of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;García, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] changed his view of Rosas during his late life as well.&lt;ref&gt;Lascano, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bartolomé Mitre]] maintained his hatred towards him all his life, which may be explained by family reasons: Mitre's father was appointed as treasurer of Uruguay by [[Fructuoso Rivera]] and fired by [[Manuel Oribe]]; and Rosas supported Oribe against Rivera during the [[Uruguayan civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;Lascano, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Adolfo Saldías.jpg|thumb|[[Adolfo Saldías]]]]
[[Bartolomé Mitre]] started the first remarkable historiographic studies shortly afterwards, but opted to avoid the period of Rosas rule altogether. He wrote biographies for [[Manuel Belgrano]] and [[José de San Martín]], which actually detailed the Spanish rule in the Americas, the [[Argentine War of Independence]] and the [[Argentine-Brazilian War|War with Brazil]], but made no mention afterwards. His biography of San Martín ended at the point when San Martín ended his military career, and he declined to write his projected book "''The ostracism and apotheosis of General San Martín''", as he would have to write about San Martín's disputes with [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], his repudiation of the execution of [[Manuel Dorrego]] and the rule of [[Juan Lavalle]], his steady appreciative correspondence to Rosas and his rejection to the European interventions against him; all of which would hint that San Martín was closer to the Federalists than to the Unitarians.&lt;ref&gt;Otero, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Mitre wrote a series of small biographies of men from the War of Independence; some of them worked with Rosas later but those details were carefully omitted.&lt;ref&gt;Shumway, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson, p. 112"&gt;Johnson, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Mitre established a version of history with an explicit bias against his enemies of the civil war;&lt;ref name="Johnson, p. 112"/&gt; this method constrated sharply with the [[historiography of the United States]], which avoided the arbitrary divisions into heroes and villains and preferred a fair and dispassionated perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Lascano, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The liberal historiography promoted by Mitre and Sarmiento was highly influenced by [[Anglophile|Anglophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;Rock, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major attempt to study Rosas and the Confederation as a historical period was done by [[Adolfo Saldías]]. Being one generation after the contemporaries of Rosas, he attempted to make a scientific&lt;ref name="Bethell175"&gt;Bethell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; and dispassionated account of his rule. His work was based on a high number of sources, from varied origins. He visited Rosas' daughter [[Manuela Rosas]] in Southampton to check the archive of state documents that Rosas took with himself to the exile: mails sent and received, draft copies of official announcements and diplomatic reports, confidential reports of his ministers in London, París, Washington and Río de Janeiro, and confidential police reports. Saldías checked as well the documents published at the newspapers of the time, interviews with contemporaries and memoirs of military leaders. Saldías rejected the [[civilization and barbarism]] dichotomy introduced by Sarmiento, and described the ranchers of the countryside as a mere political faction with specific interests. He gave new significance to the [[Federal Pact]], a perspective that would be shared by both future revisionists and authors as [[Emilio Ravignani]] and [[Ricardo Levene]].&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 56-58&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Generation of '80==
[[File:Ernesto Quesada.jpg|thumb|[[Ernesto Quesada]]]]
The years between 1880 and 1930 saw a rise of [[Positivism|positivist]] essayists.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp.73–75&lt;/ref&gt; They modified the approach in the study of history, but with little changes to general interpretations; for instance, the [[Great Man theory]] was gradually dismissed, favoring instead perspectives that explained history through social, mental, cultural or economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; [[José María Ramos Mejía]] tried to explain key biographies, specially Rosas', through a [[Phrenology|phrenologist]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vicente Fidel López]] and [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] praised his original approach, but López pointed out the lack of clinical records from the period being studied, and Sarmiento that Mejía trusted too much on [[Libelle (literary genre)|libelles]] from that time (even by Sarmiento himself) which were more concerned with the political conflicts than with historical accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Another author from this period was [[Ernesto Quesada]], who worked with Rosas and wrote "''La época de Rosas''" ({{lang-es|link=no|The age of Rosas}}) and the influential "''Rosas y su tiempo''" ({{lang-es|Rosas and his time}}).&lt;ref name="Bethell175"/&gt; Quesada applied the standards of the current German scholarship, as he had studied in that country.&lt;ref name="Bethell175"/&gt; He considered that the events of the civil war were best explained by characteristics of Argentine society rather than by Rosas' own personality, and compared the rise of Rosas after the [[anarchy of the year XX]] with the rule of the king [[Louis XI of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; He did not consider Rosas a tyrant, at least not in comparison with the Unitarian rules, and attributed the failure of the early attempts of political organization to the lack of political education.&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, pp. 175-176&lt;/ref&gt; His book was well documented, and detailed how the image of Rosas was distorted after his exile, and many key documents concealed or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was critical of Saldías' work, and had disputes with him.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

A common assumption of the time considered that Argentina began an age of prosperity after the defeats of Rosas and Urquiza at Caseros and Pavón. This perspective was weakened after the 1912 ''[[Grito de Alcorta]]'' and the raise of [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] to the presidency. [[Juan Álvarez]], influenced by the new state of affairs, wrote a history of Argentina from an economic perspective, and redeemed the protectionist policy of Rosas as an attempt to restore the economy of the country that had been badly damaged by wars and free trade.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 130–31&lt;/ref&gt;

==The new historical school==
The new historical school was a new generation of historians, influenced by the [[University Revolution]], who sought to modernize the historiographical work with new methodologies. The New Historical School did not share common ideas about historical topics in themselves, but rather a common ''[[modus operandi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 140–41&lt;/ref&gt; They were not part of the social upper classes that ruled Argentina since 1852, but sons of immigrants who arrived to Argentina during the great immigrations waves at the turn of the century. As a result, they were less influenced by factionalism and preconceived ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the authors of the New Historical School that worked with Rosas was [[Emilio Ravignani]], his main interest being the origins of federalism and the national organization. He presided the "Institute of historical investigations", and joined the Junta of History and Numismatics by recommendation of [[Ricardo Levene]]. As subsecretary of international relations during the administration of [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] he could check a lot of documents and bibliography, which allowed him to write a book about the first meeting of Rosas and the British diplomat [[Henry Southern (journalist)|Henry Southern]].&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, p. 158–59&lt;/ref&gt; In his study of the [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]], he considered that the [[Federal Pact]] was a strong precedent which established Federal rule, later confirmed in 1853. Unlike the authors that dismissed the period as anarchic, Ravignani considered that the pacts and the role of the ''[[caudillos]]'' was instrumental to maintain national unity. Ravignani gave new significance to the ''caudillos'', Rosas and Artigas, his work was influenced by Saldías and Quesada.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto pp. 167–69&lt;/ref&gt; His work was discussed by [[Ricardo Levene]], who thought that the civil war and the delegation of the [[sum of public power]] generated a dictatorship, and that Rosas was a special ''caudillo'', unlike the others.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 178–79&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable historian of the 1920s was [[Dardo Corvalán]]. All his works reinvidicated{{clarify|date=March 2015}} the actions of Rosas. He employed a less scholarly language than Saldías or Quesada, favoring instead a language closer to the average reader, although Saldías was almost exclusively the source of his work. He did not focus his criticism on other historians, but on writers of poetry or pamphlets against Rosas, such as Rivera Indarte. Though he was an [[Hipólito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyenist]], he did not portray Rosas as a popular or populist leader – pointing instead to his support among the wealthy people.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 211–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important historian was [[Carlos Ibarguren]], minister of [[Roque Sáenz Peña]] and teacher of History of Argentina at the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature. He organized a number of conferences about Rosas, which were compiled and published in an influential book. High interest in Rosas existed for political reasons: politicians opposing Hipólito Yrigoyen (the president at the time) compared him with Rosas under a negative light, and his supporters took pride of the comparison by pointing similarities between Rosas and Yrigoyen. Ibarguren is neither critical nor supportive of Rosas, trying to provide explanations for his actions based on psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 215–16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical revisionism==
The 1930s saw the work of the first [[Historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] in Argentina.&lt;ref name="Johnson114"&gt;Johnson, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The historiography of Argentina is usually simplified as having a liberal or "official" history, that would be hegemonic, scientific and endorsed by the formal institutions, and a "counter history" closer to the writing of essays than to historical work and influenced by political movements. However, the context is much more complicated than that, and the frontiers between both types of history are rather diffuse. Authors deemed as "liberal" did not always follow scientific procedures, nor had homogeneous perspectives in all topics. It was not always hegemonic either, and several revisionists hold public offices or were supported by the current governments.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 201–03&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, revisionist historians did not even have homogeneous points of view: Saldías is commonly considered the first revisionist, but his work praised [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] as well as Rosas, suggesting a continuity between both, whereas most revisionists would praise Rosas and reject Rivadavia.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 203–04&lt;/ref&gt; The 1930s revisionists were divided into right-wing nationalists, who rejected the [[black legend]] and praised the Catholic Church and the Hispanic heritage, and popular nationalists, who rejected the exclusion of the masses from political life and praised Rosas's popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:ManuelGalvez.JPG|thumb|left|[[Manuel Gálvez]]]]
The starting point of the historical revisionism in the 1930s is disputed, according to the perspective held over such revisionism. Authors who consider revisionism a phenomenon related to ongoing political movements point to the 1934 book ''La Argentina y el imperialismo británico'' ({{lang-es|link=no|Argentina and the British imperialism}}), by the Irazusta brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 222–23&lt;/ref&gt; This work, highly critical of the recent [[Roca–Runciman Treaty]], considered that Britain had been [[imperialism|imperialistic]] towards Argentina since its beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 223–24&lt;/ref&gt; Authors that focus instead on the historiographical merits of revisionism choose instead ''Ensayo sobre el año 20'' ({{lang-es|link=no|Essay about the Year 20}}) and ''Ensayo sobre Rosas y la suma del poder'' ({{lang-es|link=no|Essay about Rosas and the sum of power}}), by [[Julio Irazusta]], also from 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The first essay analyzed the [[anarchy of the year XX]], and the second the historiography of Rosas. Irazusta diverged with previous works supporting Rosas: unlike Saldías, he did not consider Rosas and Rivadavia as part of a same political project but part of divergent ones. Quesada did not thought Rosas to be a skilled politician, while Irazusta did think so. Neither Saldías nor Quesada considered the [[battle of Caseros]] a turning point in the history of Argentina, while Irazusta considered it a lost chance to become a global power.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 227–28&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many works about Rosas written at the end of the 1930 decade and beginning of the 1940s: ''Vida de Juan Manuel de Rosas'' ({{lang-es|link=no|Life of Juan Manuel de Rosas}}) by [[Manuel Gálvez]] in 1940, the first volume of ''Vida política de Juan Manuel de Rosas a través de su correspondencia'' ({{lang-es|link=no|Political life of Juan Manuel de Rosas though his correspondence}}) by [[Julio Irazusta]] in 1941, and ''Defensa y pérdida de nuestra independencia económica'' ({{lang-es|link=no|Defense and loss of our economic independence}}) by [[José María Rosa]] in 1942. The studies about Rosas were channeled through a new institute, the [[Juan Manuel de Rosas national institute of historical investigations]], established in 1938. This institute and similar ones thought that public instruction was instrumental in generating a new nationalist sentiment in the population, but using new historical structures in place of the ones used in previous decades.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the institute, there was Pro-Repatriation Rosas Committee, which promoted the [[repatriation of Juan Manuel de Rosas's body]].&lt;ref name="Johnson114"/&gt;

Popular interest in Rosas further increased with the start of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and World War II, which increased and radicalized the disputes between supporters of fascism and [[anti-fascism]] to its highest level in Latin America. Most historians tried to avoid the modern political controversies and stay focused on the time period under study; [[Emilio Ravignani]] warned in 1939 that the figure of Rosas should not be used to justify modern dictatorships. Still, those disputes influenced the way people perceived history. Academics as [[Diego Luis Molinari]] and [[José María Rosa]] were attacked by student unions that considered them Nazis because of their support to Rosas, and tried to prevent them from teaching at universities.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 238–39&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors, on the other hand, opted instead to avoid Rosas altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rosas National Institute quickly abandoned its historiographical purposes, and focused instead in merely promoting Rosas' image. It was considered that historical revisionism had already prevailed and that Rosas should be considered a [[folk hero|national hero]]. Thus, the institute made little work in creating archives of the time period (although that was one of its initial purposes) and actual historical investigation, and worked instead with conferences, parades and literary comment.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 240–41&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were accused of holding fascist ideas, they did not support [[Francisco Franco]] or other modern fascist governments, supporting instead [[Argentina in World War II|Argentine neutrality in World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

Palacio thought that historiography should be a reflection of the values of the society that generates it, so the historiography of decades ago was correct for its own time period but outdated in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manuel Gálvez]] compared the actions of Rosas with those of other world leaders under similar circumstances, such as [[Louis XI of France]], [[Diego Portales]], and considered him a leader of [[Republicanism]] in Argentina, unlike the [[Monarchism|monarchist]] Unitarians.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 248–49&lt;/ref&gt; Irazusta considered instead that Rosas was a great historical figure, not only in Argentina or even in South America, but in world history as well.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; [[José María Rosa]] rejected the [[Great Man theory]], and thought that history should not focus on specific isolated men or events but on the evolution of society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peronism==
[[File:Pepe Rosa.jpg|thumb|left|[[José María Rosa]]]]
The [[Revolution of '43]] benefited revisionist historians. National universities were intervened and revisionism got a prominent role in them. However, the radical role of [[Jordán Bruno Genta]] at the [[National University of the Littoral]] was highly criticized, both by antifacists and by other revisionists as [[Arturo Jauretche]] and the Irazusta brothers. Jauretche was imprisoned for his criticism, and the magazine run by the Irazusta was closed. Others as [[Vicente Sierra]] tried a more integrationist approach.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 265–68&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical revisionism lost the high hierarchical roles achieved in the Revolution of '43 when [[Juan Perón]] was elected president. Revisionists had divided opinions towards him: Manuél Gálvez, Vicente Sierra, Ramón Doll and Ernesto Palacio gave their full support to Peronism; Juan Pablo Oliver and Federico Ibarguren supported him from other political parties; José María Rosa and Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz supported him at a mere personal level, without getting involved in politics, but Genta and the Irazusta brothers became antiperonists.&lt;ref name="Devoto27880"&gt;Devoto, pp. 268–70&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Perón avoided taking sides in the ideological disputes of the times, and did the same in historical topics, without endorsing nor rejecting revisionism.&lt;ref name="Devoto27880"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rein, pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt; Other than replacing the title "The Rosas dictatorship" for "Rosas and his era" in high school textbooks, Peronism did not endorse revisionism or Rosas in any way. The state only made official praise to universally accepted national heroes, such as [[José de San Martín]], whose centennial was celebrated in 1950. After the [[Railway nationalization in Argentina|railway nationalization]] no railway received the name of Rosas; being named instead [[Justo José de Urquiza|Urquiza]], [[Bartolomé Mitre|Mitre]] and [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Sarmiento]] (all of them historical enemies of Rosas) and [[Manuel Belgrano|Belgrano]] and [[José de San Martín|San Martín]] (universally accepted national heroes of Argentina).&lt;ref&gt;Rein, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[antiperonism]] condemned revisionism and Rosas, extrapolating in him the criticism towards Perón. Most notably, they celebrated the [[centennial of the battle of Caseros]] in which Rosas was ousted from power.&lt;ref name="Devoto27880"/&gt; Still, the antiperonist coup that deposed Perón saw no need to modify the history curriculum, which continued to be used in schools with no modifications.&lt;ref&gt;Rein, pp. 7172&lt;/ref&gt;

The analogies between Perón and Rosas became explicit during the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'', a coup that ousted Perón from power and banned Peronism. [[Eduardo Lonardi]], ''de facto'' president, used the quote "''ni vencedores ni vencidos''" ({{lang-es|link=no|"neither victors nor vanquished"}}), which was used by Urquiza after deposing Rosas in Caseros. The official perspective was that Perón was "the second tyranny", the first one being Rosas, and that both ones should be equally rejected, and conversely both governments that ousted them should be praised. This perspective was condensed into the line of historical continuity "[[May Revolution|May]] - [[Battle of Caseros|Caseros]] - [[Revolución Libertadora|Libertadora]]". According to it, the purpose of the May Revolution was to build government institutions, and that purpose would only be achieved after Rosas' defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Spinelli, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach backfired. So far revisionism had success in academic contexts, but failed to change the popular perception of history. Perón was highly popular and the military coup unpopular; this made revisionism popular by embracing the comparison established between Rosas and Perón, but viewing him with a positive light instead. The strategy, however, was not immediate. José María Rosa was one of the most benefited revisionist historians in this context.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 278–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern times==
The [[Repatriation of Juan Manuel de Rosas's body]], a project began in the 1930s, finally took place in 1989, at the beginning of the first presidency of [[Carlos Menem]]. His body, so far kept at the [[Southampton Old Cemetery]] in the [[United Kingdom]], was moved to [[La Recoleta cemetery]]. The procession, attended by both descendants of Rosas and descendants of his historical enemies, was a symbol of the national unification promoted by Menem, who called for an end to historical enmities.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 108-122&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historian [[Félix Luna]], the disputes between supporters and detractors of Rosas are outdated, and modern historiography has incorporated the several corrections made by historical revisionism.&lt;ref name="Luna"/&gt; Luna points that Rosas is no longer seen as a horrible monster, but as a common historical man as the others; and that it is anachronistic to judge him under modern moral standards.&lt;ref name="Luna"/&gt; [[Luis Alberto Romero]], leader historian of the CONICET, the University San Martín and the UBA, pointed that the ideas of revisionism have been smoothly included into high-school textbooks, with no visible contradictions with other perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unsam.edu.ar/escuelas/politica/centro_historia_politica/romero/Soberbia%20y%20paranoia.%20La%20idea%20de%20naci%C3%B3n%20en%20los%20libros%20de%20texto%20del%20siglo%20XX.pdf|title= Soberbia y paranoia: la idea de Nación en los libros de texto del siglo XX|trans-title=Pride and Paranoia: The Idea of Nationhood in 20th-Century Textbooks|language= Spanish|author= Luis Alberto Romero|year= 2010|work= |publisher= Universidad Nacional de San Martín|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horacio González]], head of the [[National Library of the Argentine Republic]], points a [[paradigm shift]] in the historiography of Argentina, where revisionism has moved from being the second most important perspective into being the mainstream one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-157351-2010-11-23.html |title= La batalla de Obligado|trans-title=The battle of Obligado|language= Spanish|author= [[Horacio González]]|date= 23 November 2010|work= |publisher= [[Página 12]]|accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[divulgative historian]]s often repeat outdated misconceptions about Rosas. This is usually the case of historians from outside of Argentina, who have no bias towards the Argentine topics but unwittingly repeat cliches that have long been refuted by Argentine historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Lascano, pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johannes-Clericus-1657.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Johannes Clericus&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Jean Le Clerc''', also '''Johannes Clericus''' (March 19, 1657 in [[Geneva]] – January 8, 1736 in [[Amsterdam]]), was a [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]] [[theologian]] and [[biblical scholar]].  He was famous for promoting [[exegesis]], or critical interpretation of the [[Bible]], and was a radical of his age. He parted with [[Calvinism]] over his interpretations and left Geneva for that reason.

==Early life==
His father, Stephen Le Clerc, was professor of [[Greek language|Greek]] in Geneva. The family originally belonged to the neighborhood of [[Beauvais]] in France, and several of its members acquired some name in literature. Jean Le Clerc applied himself to the study of philosophy under [[Jean-Robert Chouet]] (1642-1731) the Cartesian, and attended the theological lectures of [[Philippe Mestrezat]], [[François Turrettini]] and [[Louis Tronchin]] ([[:de:Louis Tronchin (Theologe)|de]]) (1629-1705). In 1678-1679 he spent some time in [[Grenoble]] as tutor in a private family; on his return to Geneva he passed his examinations and received [[ordination]]. Soon afterwards he went to [[Saumur]].

In 1682 he went to [[London]], where he remained for six months, preaching on alternate Sundays in the Walloon church and in the [[Savoy Chapel]]. Due to political instability, he moved to [[Amsterdam]], where he was introduced to [[John Locke]] and to [[Philipp van Limborch]], professor at the [[Remonstrants|Remonstrant]] college. He later included Locke in the journals he edited; and the acquaintance with Limborch soon ripened into a close friendship, which strengthened his preference for the Remonstrant theology, already favorably known to him by the writings of his grand-uncle, [[Stephan Curcellaeus]] (d. 1645) and by those of [[Simon Episcopius]].

A last attempt to live at Geneva, made at the request of relatives there, satisfied him that the theological atmosphere was uncongenial, and in 1684 he finally settled in [[Amsterdam]], first as a moderately successful preacher, until ecclesiastical jealousy reportedly shut him out from that career, and afterwards as professor of philosophy, [[belles-lettres]] and Hebrew in the Remonstrant seminary. This appointment, which he owed to Limborch, he held from 1684, and in 1725 on the death of his friend he was called to occupy the chair of church history also.

Apart from literary work, Le Clerc's life at Amsterdam was uneventful. In 1691 he married a daughter of [[Gregorio Leti]]. From 1728 onward he was subject to repeated strokes of [[paralysis]], and he died 8 years later, on 8 January.

==Views==
His suspected [[Socinianism]] was the cause, it is said, of his exclusion from the chair of dogmatic theology.

==Published works==
In 1679 in Saumur were published ''Liberii de Sancto Amore Epistolae Theologicae'' (Irenopoli: Typis Philalethianis), usually attributed to Leclerc. They deal with the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], the [[Hypostatic union]] of the two natures in [[Jesus Christ]], [[original sin]], and other topics, in a manner unorthodox for the period. In 1685 he published with [[Charles Le Cène]] ''Entretiens sur diverses matières de théologie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=16260|title=Le Cène. Charles|first=Vivienne|last=Larminie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1685 he published ''Sentimens de quelques theologiens de Hollande sur l'histoire critique du Vieux Testament composée par le P. Richard Simon'', in which, while pointing out what he believed to be [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]]'s faults, he advanced views of his own. These included: arguments against the [[Moses|Mosaic]] authorship of the [[Pentateuch]]; his views as to the manner in which the five books were composed; and his opinions on the subject of [[Hierophany|divine inspiration]] in general, in particular on the [[Book of Job]], [[Book of Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], and [[Canticles]]. Simon's ''Réponse'' (1686) drew from Le Clerc a ''Defence des sentimens'' in the same year, which was followed by a new ''Réponse'' (1687).

In 1692 appeared his ''Logica sive Ars Ratiocinandi'', and also ''Ontologia et Pneumatologia''; these, with the ''Physica sive de rebus corporeis'' (1696), are incorporated with the ''Opera Philosophica'', which have passed through several editions. In his ''Logica'', Le Clerc rewrites the Catholic [[Port-Royal Logic|Port-Royal ''Logique'']] from a protestant Remonstrant perspective and supplements the ''Logique'' with analyses taken from ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay]]'' of his friend, [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnauld|first1=Antoine|last2=Nicole|first2=Pierre|title=La logique ou l'Art de penser|date=1662|publisher=Jean Guignart, Charles Savreux, &amp; Jean de Lavnay|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=John|title=An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding|date=1690|publisher=Thomas Bassett|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In turn, [[Charles Gildon]] published a partial and unattributed translation of Le Clerc's ''Logica'' as the treatise "Logic; or, The Art of Reasoning" in the second (1712) and subsequent editions of John Brightland's ''Grammar of the English Tongue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gildon|first1=Charles|title=A Grammar of the English Tongue|date=1714|publisher=John Brightland|location=London|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1728, [[Ephraim Chambers]] used Gildon's translation of Le Clerc's version of the Port-Royal ''Logique'' as one of his sources when he compiled his ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chambers|first1=Ephraim|title=Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|date=1728|publisher=James and John Knapton, John Darby, and others|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Mills]] and [[Gottfried Sellius]] later translated Chambers's ''Cyclopaedia'' into French. Their translation was appropriated by [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] as the starting point for their [[Encyclopédie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|last2=d'Alembert|first2=Jean le Rond|title=Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une société de gens de lettres|date=1751–1772|publisher=Briasson, David l'aîné, Le Breton, and Durand|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In particular, the article on définition (1754) in the ''Encyclopédie'' can be traced through this chain of writers, editors, translators, and compilers to the Port-Royal ''Logique'' through the ''Logica'' of Jean Le Clerc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bocast|first1=Alexander K|title=Chambers on Definition|date=2016|publisher=Berkeley Bridge Press|location=McLean|isbn=978-1-945208-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1693 his series of Biblical commentaries began with that on the [[Book of Genesis]]; the series was not completed until 1731. The portion relating to the [[New Testament]] books included the paraphrase and notes of [[Henry Hammond]]. Le Clerc's commentary challenged traditional views and argued the case for inquiry into the origin and meaning of the biblical books, It was hotly attacked on all sides.

His ''Ars Critica'' appeared in 1696, and, in continuation, ''Epistolae Criticae et Ecclesiasticae'' in 1700. Le Clerc produced a new edition of the Apostolic Fathers of Cotelerius ([[Jean-Baptiste Cotelier]], 1627-1686), published in 1698. He also edited journals of book notices and reviews: the ''Bibliothèque universelle et historique'' (Amsterdam, 25 vols, 1686-1693), begun with [[J. C. de la Croze]]; the ''Bibliothèque choisie'' (Amsterdam, 28 vols, 1703-1713); and the ''Bibliothèque ancienne et moderne'', (29 vols, 1714-1726).

Other works were Le Clerc's ''Parrhasiana ou, Pensées diverses sur des matiéres de critique, d'histoire, de morale et de politique avec la défense de divers ouvrages de M. L. C. par Théodore Parrhase'' (Amsterdam, 1699); and ''Vita et opera ad annum MDCCXI, amici ejus opusculum, philosophicis Clerici operibus subjiciendum'', also attributed to himself. The supplement to Hammond's notes was translated into English in 1699, ''Parrhasiana, or Thoughts on Several Subjects'', in 1700, the Harmony of the Gospels in 1701, and ''Twelve Dissertations'' out of 211.  Other works include the collected works of Erasmus, begun in 1703, and ''Harmonia evangelica'', 1700. One of his final works was his three-volume ''[http://data.bnf.fr/16582634/jean_le_clerc_histoire_des_provinces-unies_des_pays_bas/ Histoire des Provinces-Unies des Pays Bas]'', covering the history of the [[Dutch Republic]] up to the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] and published between 1723 and 1728.

{{about|the philosophical concept|the Italian political concept|Meliorism (politics)}}

'''Meliorism''' is an idea in [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] thinking holding that [[Progress (history)|progress]] is a real concept leading to an improvement of the world.  It holds that humans can, through their interference with processes that would otherwise be natural, produce an outcome which is an improvement over the aforementioned natural one.

Meliorism, as a conception of the person and society, is at the foundation of contemporary [[liberal democracy]] and [[human rights]] and is a basic component of [[liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sprc.unsw.edu.au/media/SPRCFile/dp068.pdf|title=Liberalism, gender and social policy|author=Shaver, S.|date=July 1996|editor=T. Eardly|publisher=Social Policy Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important understanding of the meliorist tradition comes from the American Pragmatic tradition.  One can read about it in the works of [[Lester Frank Ward]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].

Meliorism has also been used by [[Arthur Caplan]] to describe positions in [[bioethics]] that are in favor of ameliorating conditions which cause suffering, even if the conditions have long existed (e.g. being in favor of cures for common diseases, being in favor of serious anti-aging therapies as they are developed).

A closely related concept discussed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Marquis de Condorcet]] is that of [[perfectibility of man]].  

Condorcet's statement, "Such is the object of the work I have undertaken; the result of which will be to show, from reasoning and from facts, that no bounds have been fixed to the improvement of the human faculties; that the ''perfectibility of man'' is absolutely indefinite; that the progress of this perfectibility, henceforth above the controul of every power that would impede it, has no other limit than the duration of the globe upon which nature has placed us."&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/condorcet-outlines-of-an-historical-view-of-the-progress-of-the-human-mind "Outlines of an historical view of the progress of the human mind"] [1795]&lt;/ref&gt; anticipates James' meliorism.

Rousseau's treatment is somewhat weaker&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, J. J., (1754). [http://www.liupoliticalphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/5019_Rousseau_Discourse_on_the_Origin_of_Inequality.pdf "Discourse on the Origin of Inequality"(Translated by G. D. H. Cole)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''New Chronology''' is a [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical theory]] which argues that the conventional [[chronology]] of Middle Eastern and European history is fundamentally flawed, and that events attributed to the civilizations of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Egypt]] actually occurred during the [[Middle Ages]], more than a thousand years later. The central concepts of the New Chronology are derived from the ideas of Russian scholar [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Nikolai Morozov]] (1854–1946),&lt;ref name="billington83"&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |pages=83 |quote=The radical revisionism of Nosovsky and Fomenko's ''New Chronology of Rus'' has its origins in the attempt by Nicholai Morozov to synthesize science and history during twenty-five years in prison}}&lt;/ref&gt; although work by French scholar [[Jean Hardouin]] (1646–1729) can be viewed as an earlier predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colavito|2004}} "Today an intellectual successor to Hardouin claims that it is not classical antiquity that was forged, but instead the history of the Middle Ages. Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko has devised a system he calls the 'New Chronology'..."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the New Chronology is most commonly associated with Russian mathematician [[Anatoly Fomenko]] (born 1945), although published works on the subject are actually a collaboration between Fomenko and several other mathematicians. The concept is most fully explained in ''History: Fiction or Science?'', originally published in [[Russian language|Russian]].

The New Chronology also contains ''a reconstruction'', an alternative chronology, radically shorter than the standard historical timeline, because all ancient history is "folded" onto the Middle Ages. According to Fomenko's claims, the [[recorded history|written history]] of humankind goes only as far back as [[Anno Domini|AD]] 800, there is almost no information about events between AD 800–1000, and most known historical events took place in AD 1000–1500.

The New Chronology is rejected by mainstream [[historian]]s and is inconsistent with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating]] techniques used in the wider [[academia|scholarly community]]. The majority of scientific commentators consider The New Chronology to be [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="prezRAS1999"&gt;[http://rc.nsu.ru/text/news/Physics/057.html Проблемы борьбы с лженаукой (обсуждение в Президиуме РАН)] — {{Interlanguage link multi|Вестник Российской академии наук|ru}} 1999, том&amp;nbsp;69, №&amp;nbsp;10, с.&amp;nbsp;879—904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prezRAS2003"&gt;[http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/JOURNAL/VRAN/2004/FALSCI.HTM Чем угрожает обществу лженаука?

==History of New Chronology==
The idea of chronologies that differ from the conventional chronology can be traced back to at least the early 17th century. [[Jean Hardouin]] then suggested that many ancient historical documents were much younger than commonly believed to be. In 1685 he published a version of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' in which he claimed that most Greek and Roman texts had been forged by [[Benedictine]] monks. When later questioned on these results, Hardouin stated that he would reveal the monks' reasons in a letter to be revealed only after his death. The executors of his estate were unable to find such a document among his posthumous papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diacu | first = Florin

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]], examining the current chronology of [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Ancient Near East]], expressed discontent with prevailing theories and in ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'' proposed one of his own, which, basing its study on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]'s ''[[Argonautica]]'', changed the traditional dating of the Argonautic Expedition, the [[Trojan War]], and the [[Founding of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1887, [[Edwin Johnson (historian)|Edwin Johnson]] expressed the opinion that [[early Christianity|early Christian history]] was largely invented or corrupted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | last = Johnson | first = Edwin | authorlink = Edwin Johnson (historian) | title = Antiqua Mater | chapter = Preface | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911155951/http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | archivedate = 2006-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 [[Otto Rank]] made note of duplications in literary history of a variety of cultures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;almost all important civilized peoples have early woven myths around and glorified in poetry their heroes, mythical kings and princes, founders of religions, of dynasties, empires and cities—in short, their national heroes. Especially the history of their birth and of their early years is furnished with phantastic traits; the amazing similarity, nay literal identity, of those tales, even if they refer to different, completely independent peoples, sometimes geographically far removed from one another, is well known and has struck many an investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rank | first = Otto | authorlink = Otto Rank

Fomenko became interested in Morozov's theories in 1973. In 1980, together with a few colleagues from the mathematics department of [[Moscow State University]], he published several articles on "new mathematical methods in history" in peer-reviewed journals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The articles stirred a lot of controversy, but ultimately Fomenko failed to win any respected historians to his side. By the early 1990s, Fomenko shifted his focus from trying to convince the scientific community via peer-reviewed publications to publishing books. Beam writes that Fomenko and his colleagues were discovered by the Soviet scientific press in the early 1980s, leading to "a brief period of renown"; a contemporary review from the Soviet journal ''Questions of History'' complained, "Their constructions have nothing in common with Marxist historical science."&lt;ref name="beam"&gt;{{cite news|title=A shorter history of civilization|last=Beam|first=Alex|date=1991-09-16|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996 his theory had grown to cover Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Nosovsky G. V., Fomenko A. T., "Empire. Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, Egypt. New mathematical chronology of ancient times / Носовский Г. В., Фоменко А. Т. Империя. Русь, Турция, Китай, Европа, Египет. Новая математическая хронология древности." (in Russian), 1996, with at least 6 later editions — М.: Факториал, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fomenko's claims==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}
Central to Fomenko's New Chronology is his claim of the existence of a vast Slav-Turk empire, which he called the "Russian Horde", which he says played the dominant role in Eurasian history before the 17th century. The various peoples identified in ancient and medieval history, from the [[Scythians]], [[Huns]], [[Goths]] and [[Bulgars]], through the [[Polans (eastern)|Polyane]], [[Dulebes|Duleby]], [[Drevlyans|Drevliane]], [[Pechenegs]], to in more recent times, the [[Cossacks]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Belarusians]], are nothing but elements of the single Russian Horde. For the New Chronologists, peoples such as the Ukrainians, Belarusians, [[Mongols#Russia|Mongols]], and others who assert their national independence from Russia, are suffering from a historical delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) pp. 5, 8, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko claims that the most probable prototype of the historical Jesus was [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] (allegedly AD 1152 to 1185), the emperor of Byzantium, known for his failed reforms; his traits and deeds reflected in 'biographies' of many real and imaginary persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.
 | script-title=ru:Царь Славян | language = Russian
 | publisher = СПб.: Нева | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical [[Jesus]] is a composite figure and reflection of the Old-Testament prophet [[Elisha]] (850–800 BC?), [[Pope Gregory VII]] (1020?–1085), Saint [[Basil of Caesarea]] (330–379), and even [[Li Yuanhao]] (also known as Emperor Jingzong or "Son of Heaven" - emperor of [[Western Xia]], who reigned in 1032–48), Euclides, Bacchus and Dionysius. Fomenko explains the seemingly vast differences in the biographies of these figures as resulting from difference in languages, points of view and time-frame of the authors of said accounts and biographies. He claims that the historical Jesus may have been born in 1152 and was crucified around AD 1185 on the [[Joshua's Hill]], overlooking the [[Bosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = А.Т.Фоменко | author2 = Г.В.Носовский | title = Датировка Рождества Христова серединой XII века | language = Russian | url = http://chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | format = download | accessdate = 2008-04-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413014454/http://www.chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | archivedate = 2008-04-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also merges the cities and histories of Jerusalem, Rome and Troy into "New Rome" = Gospel [[Jerusalem]] (in the 12th and 13th centuries) = [[Troy]] = [[Yoros Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.

 | publisher = М.: Астрель, АСТ | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the south of [[Yoros Castle]] is [[Joshua's Hill]] which Fomenko alleges is the hill [[Calvary]] depicted in the Bible.

Fomenko claims the [[Hagia Sophia]] is actually the biblical [[Temple of Solomon]]. He identifies Solomon as sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1494–1566).

On the other hand, according to Fomenko the word "Rome" is a placeholder and can signify any one of several different cities and kingdoms. He claims the "First Rome" or "Ancient Rome" or "Mizraim" is an ancient Egyptian kingdom in the delta of the [[Nile]] with its capital in [[Alexandria]]. The second and most famous "New Rome" is Constantinople. The third "Rome" is constituted by three different cities: Constantinople (again), Rome in Italy, and Moscow. According to his claims, Rome in Italy was founded around AD 1380 by [[Aeneas]] and Moscow as the third Rome was the capital of the great "Russian Horde".&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Specific claims===
{{cleanup list|date=May 2015}}
In volumes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of ''History: Fiction or Science?'', Fomenko and his colleagues make numerous claims:
* Historians and translators often "assign" different dates and locations to different accounts of the same historical events, creating multiple "phantom copies" of these events. These "phantom copies" are often misdated by centuries or even millennia and end up incorporated into conventional chronology.
* This chronology was largely manufactured by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] in ''Opus Novum de emendatione temporum'' (1583) and ''Thesaurum temporum'' (1606), and represents a vast array of dates produced without any justification whatsoever, containing the repeating sequences of dates with shifts equal to multiples of the major cabbalistic numbers 333 and 360. The [[Jesuit]] [[Denis Pétau|Dionysius Petavius]] completed this chronology in ''De Doctrina Temporum'', 1627 (v.1) and 1632 (v.2).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One might wonder why we should want to revise the chronology of ancient history today and base our revision on new empirical-statistical methods. It would be worthwhile to remind the reader that in the XVI-XVII century chronology was considered to be a subdivision of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chronology | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* 37 complete Egyptian [[horoscope]]s found in Denderah, Esna, and other temples have unique valid astronomical solutions with dates ranging from AD 1000 and up to as late as AD 1700. &lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Egyptian astronomical symbols once applied to horoscopes from temples allows for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is sufficient for unique dating. There are symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation and the symbols do not change from one temple horoscope to another. The horoscopes from temples contain data about eclipses visible in Egypt allowing their exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = Astronomy Vs History | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The [[Book of Revelation]], as we know it, contains a horoscope, dated to 25 September - 10 October 1486, compiled by cabbalist [[Johannes Reuchlin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As we have already noted, the inability of the latter day commentators to comprehend the astronomical symbolism of the Apocalypse is directly resulting from the loss of knowledge about the correct chronology and the distortions introduced by historians of the XVI-XVIII century. Another possibility is that there was an unspoken general taboo on what concerned a subject quite as dangerous, which resulted in the misdating of the Apocalypse. One way or another, the understanding of the astronomical descriptions that the Apocalypse contains got lost at some point. The Apocalypse had lost its distinctive astronomical hue in the eyes of the readers. However, its “astronomical component” is not simply exceptionally important – it alone suffices for the dating of the book itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Apocalypse as seen by Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The horoscopes found in Sumerian/Babylonian tablets do not contain sufficient astronomical data; consequently, they have solutions every 30–50 years on the time axis and are therefore useless for purposes of dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Babylonian astronomical symbols once applied to clay tablets don't allow for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is not sufficient for unique dating. Either there not enough symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation or  the symbols change from one clay tablet to another. The clay tablets contain data about eclipses visible in Babylon  that could have taken place  every 30-40 years, therefore don’t allow there exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The Chinese tables of eclipses are useless for dating, as they contain too many eclipses that did not take place astronomically. Chinese tables of comets, even if true, cannot be used for dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chinese eclipse observations can neither confirm nor refute any chronology of China at all, be it veracious or erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chinese Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fomenko's methods==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}

===Statistical correlation of texts===
One of Fomenko's simplest methods is statistical [[correlation]] of texts. His basic assumption is that a text which describes a sequence of events will devote more space to more important events (for example, a period of [[war]] or an [[unrest]] will have much more space devoted to than a period of [[peace]]ful, non-eventful years), and that this irregularity will remain visible in other descriptions of the period. For each analysed text, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is devised which maps each year mentioned in the text with the number of pages (lines, letters) devoted in the text to its description (which could be zero). The function of the two texts are then compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 1

 | chapter = 1. The local maxima method | pages = 187–194
 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Fomenko compares the contemporary history of Rome written by [[Titus Livius]] with a modern history of Rome written by [[Russia]]n [[historian]] [[Vladimir Sergeevich Sergeev|V. S. Sergeev]], calculating that the two have high [[correlation]], and thus that they describe the same period of history, which is undisputed.&lt;ref name=F2&gt;{{cite book

 | chapter = 1.4. Experimental test of the maxima correlation principle | pages = 194–196
 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also compares modern texts which describe different periods, and calculates low correlation, as expected.&lt;ref name=F2/&gt; However, when he compares, for example, the ancient history of Rome and the medieval history of Rome, he calculates a high correlation, and concludes that ancient history of Rome is a copy of medieval history of Rome, thus clashing with mainstream accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical correlation of dynasties===
[[Image:Fomenko - Roman Empire parallelism.jpg|thumb|Sample Fomenko parallelism]]
In a somewhat similar manner, Fomenko compares two [[dynasty|dynasties]] of rulers using statistical methods. First, he creates a [[database]] of rulers, containing relevant information on each of them. Then, he creates "survey codes" for each pair of the rulers, which contain a number which describes degree of the match of each considered property of two rulers. For example, one of the properties is the way of death: if two rulers were both poisoned, they get value of +1 in their property of the way of death; if one ruler was poisoned and another killed in combat, they get -1; and if one was poisoned, and another died of illness, they get 0 (Fomenko claims there is possibility that chroniclers were not impartial and that different descriptions nonetheless describe the same person). An important property is the length of the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. |authorlink= Anatoly Fomenko
 | title = History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 1 | pages = 215–223

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko lists a number of pairs of unrelated dynasties &amp;ndash; for example, dynasties of kings of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and emperors of late [[Western Roman Empire]] (AD 300-476) &amp;ndash; and claims that this method demonstrates correlations between their reigns. (Graphs which show just the length of the rule in the two dynasties are the most widely known; however, Fomenko's conclusions are also based on other parameters, as described above.) He also claims that the regnal history from the 17th to 20th centuries never shows correlation of "dynastic flows" with each other, therefore Fomenko insists history was multiplied and outstretched into imaginary antiquity to justify this or other "royal" pretensions.

Fomenko uses for the demonstration of correlation between the reigns exclusively the data from the ''Chronological Tables'' of J. Blair (Moscow 1808–09). Fomenko says that Blair’s tables are all the more valuable to us since they were compiled in an epoch adjacent to the time of Scaligerian chronology. According to Fomenko these tables contain clearer signs of “Scaligerite activity” which were subsequently buried under layers of paint and plaster by historians of the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Astronomical evidence===
Fomenko examines astronomical events described in ancient texts and claims that the chronology is actually [[medieval]]. For example:

* He says the mysterious drop in the value of the lunar acceleration parameter D" ("a linear combination of the [angular] accelerations of the Earth and Moon"&lt;ref name="Newton72"&gt;[[Robert Russell Newton|R.R. Newton]], [http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/atext/newton1.htm "Astronomical Evidence Concerning Non-Gravitational Forces in the Earth–Moon System"]. ''[[Astrophysics and Space Science]]'' vol. 16 (1972), pp. 179–200.&lt;/ref&gt;) between the years AD 700–1300, which the American astronomer [[Robert Russell Newton|Robert Newton]] had explained in terms of "non-gravitational" (i.e., tidal) forces.&lt;ref name="Newton72"/&gt; By eliminating those anomalous early eclipses the New Chronology produces a constant value of D" beginning around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly T. Fomenko, ''History: Fiction or Science'' vol.I, Chronology, 2nd. ed. (Paris, London, New York: Delamere Publishing, 2006), pp.93-94, 105-6. Newton's analysis has since been criticized as suffering "from two fundamental defects. The two parameters he sought to determine were highly correlated; and he also adopted a somewhat arbitrary weighting scheme in analysing suspected observations of total solar eclipses. Many of the observations he investigated were of doubtful reliability. Hence, despite the low weight he assigned them, they had a disproportionate effect on his solutions." F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.23-2.24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* He associates initially the [[Star of Bethlehem]] with the AD 1140 (±20) [[supernova]] (now [[Crab Nebula]]) and the [[Chronology of Jesus|Crucifixion Eclipse]] with the total [[solar eclipse]] of AD 1170 (±20). He also believes that [[Crab Nebula]] [[supernova]] could not have been seen in AD 1054, but probably in AD 1153. He connects it with total eclipse of AD 1186. Moreover he holds in strong doubt the veracity of ancient Chinese astronomical data.
* He argues that the [[star catalog]] in the ''Almagest'', ascribed to the Hellenistic astronomer [[Claudius Ptolemy]], was compiled in the 15th to 16th centuries AD. With this objective in sight he develops new methods of dating old stellar catalogues and claims that the ''Almagest'' is based on data collected between AD 600 and 1300, whereby the telluric obliquity{{clarify|date=June 2013}} is well taken into account.
* He refines and completes [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Morozov's]] analysis of some ancient [[horoscopes]], most notably, the so-called [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera Zodiacs]]—two horoscopes drawn on the ceiling of the [[Hathor temple|temple of Hathor]]—and comes to the conclusion that they correspond to either the 11th or the 13th century AD. Moreover, in his ''History: Fiction or Science'' series finale, he makes computer-aided dating of all 37 Egyptian horoscopes that contain sufficient astronomical data, and claims they all fit into 11th to 19th century timeframe.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} Traditional history usually either interprets these horoscopes as belonging to the 1st century BC or suggests that they weren't meant to match any date at all.
* In his final analysis of an eclipse triad described by the ancient Greek [[Thucydides]] in ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', Fomenko dates the eclipses to AD 1039, 1046 and 1057. Because of the layered structure of the manuscript, he claims that Thucydides actually lived in medieval times and in describing the [[Peloponnesian War]] between the [[Sparta]]ns and [[Athens|Athenians]] he was actually describing the conflict between the medieval [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarrans]] and [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]] in Spain from AD 1374 to 1387.
* Fomenko claims that the abundance of dated astronomical records in cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia is of little use for dating of events, as the astronomical phenomena they describe recur cyclically every 30–40 years.

=== Rejection of common dating methods ===

On archaeological dating methods, Fomenko claims:

{{quote|Archaeological, dendrochronological, paleographical and carbon methods of dating of ancient sources and artifacts are both non-exact and contradictory, therefore there is not a single piece of firm written evidence or artifact that could be reliably and independently dated earlier than the XI century|Anatoly Fomenko|''History: Fiction or Science? (Chronology 1) [Second edition]''}}

[[Dendrochronology]] is rejected with a claim that, for dating of objects much older than the oldest still living trees, it isn't an absolute, but a [[relative dating]] method, and thus dependent on traditional chronology. Fomenko specifically points to a break of dendrochronological scales around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 | accessdate = 2006-09-09| language = Russian
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also cites a number of cases where [[carbon dating]] of a series of objects of known age gave significantly different dates. He also alleges undue cooperation between physicists and archaeologists in obtaining the dates, since most radiocarbon dating labs only accept samples with an age estimate suggested by historians or archaeologists. Fomenko also claims that carbon dating over the range of AD 1 to 2000 is inaccurate because it has too many sources of error that are either guessed at or completely ignored, and that calibration is done with a statistically meaningless number of samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 | url = http://www.univer.omsk.su/foreign/fom/fom.txt | format = .txt
 | accessdate = 2006-09-09 | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, Fomenko concludes that carbon dating is not accurate enough to be used on historical scale.

Fomenko rejects [[numismatics|numismatic]] dating as circular, being based on the traditional chronology, and points to cases of similar coins being minted in distant periods, unexplained long periods with no coins minted and cases of mismatch of numismatic dating with historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Reception==
Fomenko's historical ideas have been universally rejected by mainstream scholars, who brand them as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitaly L. Ginzburg]], [http://humanism.al.ru/en/articles.phtml?num=000051 ''Pseudoscience and the Need to Combat It'']. Ginzburg is a [[Nobel laureate]] and a member of the Commission to Combat Pseudoscience and the Falsification of Scientific Research of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt; but were popularized by former world chess champion [[Garry Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new-tradition.org/view-garry-kasparov.htm Mathematics of the Past]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newc.narod.ru/article/nx/ksprv.htm Некоторые выступления Г.

Kasparov also felt it illogical that the Romans and the Greeks living under the banner of [[Byzantium]] could fail to use the mounds of scientific knowledge left them by Ancient Greece and Rome, especially when it was of urgent military use. However, Kasparov does not support the reconstruction part of the New Chronology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=44FE98F9E4576 "Answers of Kasparov"] (in Russian). Kasparov.ru ([[gazeta.ru]]). September 6, 2006. Retrieved 2009-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian critics tended to see Fomenko's New Chronology as "an embarrassment and a potent symbol of the depths to which the Russian academy and society have generally sunk ... since the fall of Communism".&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Western critics see his views as part of a renewed Russian imperial ideology, "keeping alive an imperial consciousness and secular messianism in Russia".&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 at the Moscow International Book Fair, Anatoly Fomenko with his coauthor [[Gleb Vladimirovich Nosovsky|Gleb Nosovsky]] were awarded for their books on "New Chronology" the anti-prize called [[:ru:Антипремия «Абзац»|"Abzatz"]] (literally 'paragraph', a Russian slang word meaning 'disaster' or 'fiasco') in the category "Pochotnaya bezgramota" (the term is a pun upon "Pochotnaya gramota" ([[Russian Federation Presidential Certificate of Honour|Certificate of Honor]]) and may be translated either "Certificate of Dishonor" or literally, "Respectable Illiteracy" ) for the worst book published in Russia.

Critics have accused Fomenko of altering the data to improve the fit with his ideas and have noted that he [[Confirmation bias|violates a key rule of statistics]] by selecting matches from the historical record which support his chronology, while ignoring those which do not, creating artificial, better-than-chance correlations, and that these practices undermine Fomenko's statistical arguments.&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt; The new chronology was given a comprehensive critical analysis in a round table on "The 'Myths' of New Chronology" chaired by the dean of the department of history of [[Moscow State University]] in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;V.L.

Fomenko).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the participants in that round table, the distinguished Russian archaeologist, [[Valentin Yanin]], compared Fomenko's work to "the sleight of hand trickery of a [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]], [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/janin.htm "Зияющие высоты" академика Фоменко] (The "Gaping Heights" of Academician Fomenko); passage translated in James H. Billington, ''Russia in Search of Itself'', (Washington: Woodrow Wilson Center Press / Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 2004, pp. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Andrey Zaliznyak]] argued that by using the Fomenko's approaches one can "prove" any historical correspondence, for example, between Ancient Egyptian pharaohs and French kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2011/12/02_a_3855010.shtml|script-title=ru:«Фоменко — жертва фанатизма»|last=Малянов|first=Дмитрий|date=2 December 2011|publisher=[[Gazeta.ru]]|language=Russian|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/fomenko/zaliznk.htm|script-title=ru:Лингвистика по А.

[[James H. Billington|James Billington]], formerly professor of Russian history at [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Librarian of Congress]] from 1987-2015 placed Fomenko's work within the context of the political movement of [[Eurasianism]], which sought to tie Russian history closely to that of its Asian neighbors. Billington describes Fomenko as ascribing the belief in past hostility between Russia and the Mongols to the influence of Western historians. Thus, by Fomenko's chronology, "Russia and Turkey are parts of a previously single empire."&lt;ref name="James H. Billington 2004, pp. 82-4"/&gt; A French reviewer of Billington's book noted approvingly his concern with the phantasmagorical conceptions of Fomenko about the global "new chronology".&lt;ref name="monderusse.revues.org" /&gt;

H.G. van Bueren, professor emeritus of astronomy at the [[University of Utrecht]], concluded his scathing review of Fomenko's work on the application of mathematics and astronomy to historical data as follows:
{{quote|text=It is surprising, to say the least, that a well-known (Dutch) publisher could produce an expensive book of such doubtful intellectual value, of which the only good word that can be said is that it contains an enormous amount of factual historical material, untidily ordered, true; badly written, yes; mixed-up with conjectural nonsense, sure; but still, much useful stuff. For the rest of the book is absolutely worthless. It reminds one of the early Soviet attempts to produce [[Pathological science|tendentious science]] ([[Lysenkoism|Lysenko]]!), of [[polywater]], of [[cold fusion]], and of modern [[creationism]]. In brief: a useless and misleading book.|sign=H.G. van Bueren|source="Mathematics and Logic"&lt;ref name="Bueren 1994"/&gt;}}

===Convergence of methods in archaeological dating===

While Fomenko rejects commonly accepted dating methods, archaeologists, conservators and other scientists make extensive use of such techniques which have been rigorously examined and refined during decades of use.&lt;ref&gt;See the international journal [http://www.radiocarbon.org/ ''Radiocarbon''] for examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[dendrochronology]], Fomenko claims that this fails as an absolute dating method because of gaps in the record. However, independent dendrochronological sequences beginning with living trees from various parts of [[North America]]&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Ferguson and D. A. Graybill, [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume25/Number2/azu_radiocarbon_v25_n2_287_288_v.pdf "Dendrochronology of Bristlecone Pine: A Progress Report"], ''Radiocarbon'', 25 (1983): 287-288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minze Stuiver, [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume24/Number1/azu_radiocarbon_v24_n1_1_26_v.pdf "A High-Precision Calibration of the AD Radiocarbon Time Scale"], ''Radiocarbon'', 24 (1982): 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe&lt;ref&gt;M.

Reimer, ''et al.'', [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume46/Number3/azu_radiocarbon_v46_n3_1029_1058_v.pdf "INTCAL04 Terrestrial Radiocarbon Age Calibration, 0–26 Cal Kyr BP"], ''Radiocarbon'' 46 (2004): 1029-1058; data online at http://www.radiocarbon.org/IntCal04%20files/intcal04.14c .&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, archaeologists have developed a ''fully anchored'' dendrochronology series going back past 10,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich M, Remmele S, Kromer B, Hofmann J, Spurk M, Kaiser KF, Orcel C, Küppers M (2004).

''Radiocarbon '46'': 1111–1122.&lt;/ref&gt; "The absolutely dated tree-ring chronology now extends back to 12,410 cal BP (10,461 BC)."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, M., Remmele, S., Kromer, B., Hofmann, J., Spurk, M., Kaiser, K. F., Orcel, C., Küppers, M. "The 12,460-year Hohenheim Oak and pine tree-ring chronology from central Europe: A unique annual record for radiocarbon calibration and paleoenvironment reconstructions" ''Radiocarbon'' 2004, vol. 46, no3, pp. 1111-1122 [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16599079]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misuse of historical sources and forced pattern matching===

Critics of Fomenko's theory claim that his use of historical sources is highly selective and ignores the basic principles of sound historical scholarship.&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fomenko ... provides no fair-minded review of the historical literature about a topic with which he deals, quotes only those sources that serve his purposes, uses evidence in ways that seem strange to professionally-trained historians and asserts the wildest speculation as if it has the same status as the information common to the conventional historical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They also note that his method of statistically correlating of texts is very rough, because it does not take into account the many possible sources of variation in length outside of "importance". They maintain that differences in language, style, and scope, as well as the frequently differing views and focuses of historians, which are manifested in a different notion of "important events", make quantifying historical writings a dubious proposition at best. What's more, Fomenko's critics allege that the parallelisms he reports are often derived by alleged forcing by Fomenko of the data &amp;ndash; rearranging, merging, and removing monarchs as needed to fit the pattern.

For example, on the one hand Fomenko asserts that the vast majority of ancient sources are either irreparably distorted duplicate accounts of the same events or later forgeries. In his identification of [[Jesus]] with [[Pope Gregory VII]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fSvlaZYbcwUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;sig=2_vZeaAnuN5U6iITpdkuUK-eIlI#PPA51,M1 Book 2, Chapter 2, pg 51]&lt;/ref&gt; he ignores the otherwise vast dissimilarities between their reported lives and focuses on the similarity of their appointment to religious office by baptism. (The evangelical Jesus is traditionally believed to have lived for 33 years, and he was an adult at the time of his encounter with [[John the Baptist]]. In contrast, according to the available primary sources, Pope Gregory VII lived for at least 60 years and was born 8 years after the death of Fomenko's John-the-Baptist equivalent [[John Crescentius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06791c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope St. Gregory VII]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Critics allege that many of the supposed correlations of regnal durations are the product of the selective parsing and blending of the dates, events, and individuals mentioned in the original text.{{sfn|Colavito|2004}} Another point raised by critics is that Fomenko does not explain his altering the data (changing the order of rulers, dropping rulers, combining rulers, treating interregna as rulers, switching between theologians and emperors, etc.) preventing a duplication of the effort and effectively making this whole theory an [[ad hoc hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt;

===Selectivity in reference to astronomical phenomena===

Critics point out that Fomenko's discussion of astronomical phenomena tends to be selective, choosing isolated examples that support the New Chronology and ignoring the large bodies of data that provide statistically supported evidence for the conventional dating. For his dating of the Almagest star catalog, Fomenko arbitrarily selected eight stars from the more than 1000 stars in the catalog, one of which (Arcturus) has a large systematic error. This star has a dominant effect on Fomenko's dating.&lt;ref&gt;Yu. N. Efremov, [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/efremov.htm Астрономия и синдром “новой хронологии”] (Astronomy and the Syndrome of "New Chronology").&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis using the same method for all "fast" stars points to the antiquity of the Almagest star catalog.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Dambis and Yu. N. Efremov, "Dating Ptolemy's Star Catalogue through Proper Motions: The Hipparchan Epoch", [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000JHA....31..115D ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 31 (2000): 115-134;] see especially note 17 (p. 134).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Gorodetsky, [http://www.newchrono.net/fomenko/starwars.htm Звездные войны с историей (верификация датировки Альмагеста)] (Starry wars with history (Verification of the dating of the Almagest)).&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlins points out further that Fomenko's statistical analysis got the wrong date for the ''Almagest'' because he took as constant Earth's [[axial tilt|obliquity]] when it is a variable that changes at a very slow, but known, rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Rawlins, "Recovering Hipparchos’ Last Lost Lustrous Star", [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w43.pdf ''DIO'' 4.3 (1994): 119]. Like Dambis and Efremov, Rawlins provides evidence that the Almagest star catalog was based on observations made in the 2nd century BCE by [[Hipparchus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko's studies ignore the abundance of dated astronomical records in [[cuneiform]] texts from [[Mesopotamia]]. Among these texts is a series of [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]], which records precise astronomical observations of the Moon and planets, often dated in terms of the reigns of known historical figures extending back to the 6th century BCE. Astronomical retrocalculations for all these moving objects allow us to date these observations, and consequently the rulers' reigns, to within a single day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asger Aaboe]], ''Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy,'' (New York: Springer, 2001) pp. 39-40 {{ISBN|0-387-95136-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The observations are sufficiently redundant that only a small portion of them are sufficient to date a text to a unique year in the period 750 BCE to 100 CE. The dates obtained agree with the accepted chronology.&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Stephenson and J. M. Steele, "Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 37 (2006): 55-69. This study showed that either the description of the phenomena observed at the solar eclipse or of a set of conjunctions of the slow planets [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Mars]] were sufficient to equate [[Seleucid era|S.E.]] 175 with 137/6 BCE. Additional details in these texts provided further confirmation of this dating.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, F. R. Stephenson has demonstrated through a systematic study of a large number of [[Babylonia]]n, Ancient and Medieval European, and [[China|Chinese]] records of eclipse observations that they can be dated consistently with conventional chronology at least as far back as 600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.22-2.27.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Fomenko's missing centuries, Stephenson's studies of eclipse observations find an accumulated uncertainty in the timing of the rotation of the earth of 420 seconds at 400 BCE, and only 80 seconds at 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Espenak, [http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html Eclipse Predictions and Earth's Rotation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716020131/sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnitude and consistency of conspiracy theory===
Fomenko states that world history prior to 1600 was deliberately falsified for political reasons. The consequences of this conspiracy theory are twofold. Documents that conflict with New Chronology are said to have been edited or fabricated by conspirators; the Vatican, the Holy Roman Empire and pro-German [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; New Chronology taps traditionally Russian anti-Western thoughts and ideas of Germany as a chief enemy. Further, the theory is Russocentric diminishing achievements of other cultures and claiming major civilization accomplishments as Russian and by proposing a giant "Russian Horde" empire and eliminating historical time before its existence.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; The theory also claimed to undermine nationalism in countries neighboring Russia by positioning divisions and conflicts as fabricated.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; Unlike other popular conspiracy theories New Chronology is not [[anti-semitic]] ''per se'', but it contains claims that may be unwelcome by Jewish communities like that the [[Old Testament]] is newer than the [[New Testament]], placing Jerusalem in [[Constantinople]] and projecting stereotypes of [[Jew]]s by proposing that Jews originate from bankers in the Russian Horde that adopted the religion of Judaism, itself a derivative of Christianity and [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|not the other way round]].&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; 

The theory provides an alternate history account of the "true" history centered around a world empire called the "Russian Horde".&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; The scope of the New Chronology has been compared to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011&gt;{{cite journal |last= Halperin |first= Charles J. |year= 2011 |title= False Identity and Multiple Identities in Russian History: The Mongol Empire and Ivan the Terrible |url= http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/160 |journal= The Carl Beck Papers |publisher= The Center for Russian and East European Studies|volume= |number= 2103 |pages= 1–71|doi= 10.5195/cbp.2011.160|access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of pages has been written about it and authors address a wide range of objections.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt;

===Popularity in forums and amongst Russian imperialists===

Fomenko has published and sold over one million copies of his books in his native [[Russia]]. Many [[Internet forum]]s have appeared which aim to supplement his work with additional amateur research.&lt;ref&gt;Melleuish et al. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His critics have suggested that Fomenko's version of history appealed to the Russian reading public by keeping alive an imperial consciousness to replace their disillusionment with the failures of Communism and [[Russian oligarchs|post-Communist corporate oligarchies]].&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"/&gt;

'''''Nietzsche's Kisses''''' is a [[postmodern novel]] by [[Lance Olsen]], published in 2006 by [[Fiction Collective Two]]. It is a work of [[historiographic metafiction]].&lt;ref&gt;To hear Olsen discuss his perspective on ''Nietzsche's Kisses'', the [[biographical novel]], and historiographic metafiction with [[Jay Parini]] and [[Bruce Duffy]], see the discussion at http://ias.umn.edu/2012/09/20/duffy-parini-olsen-biographies/{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Nietzsche's Kisses'' is the narrative of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s last mad night on earth. Locked in a small room on the top floor of what would become The Nietzsche Archives in Weimar, one of the most radical and influential of nineteenth-century German philosophers hovers between dream and wakefulness, memory and hallucination, the first person, second, and third, past and present, reliving his brief love affair with feminist [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]], his stormy association with [[Richard Wagner]], and his conflicted relationship with [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]], his radically anti-Semitic sister.

==Narrative structure==
The novel is written in narrative triads: a first-person section (comprising the real-time of Nietzsche's last few hours alive), a second-person section (comprising hallucinations experienced by Nietzsche), and a third-person section (comprising Nietzsche's attempt to narrativize his own life; that triadic pattern is repeated throughout the novel.

==Reception==
In an in-depth critical article, ''[[Electronic Book Review]]'' called Olsen's novel "quite remarkable,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Eternal Hourglass of Existence|url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/fictionspresent/resisting|accessdate=4 December 2012|journal=Electronic Book Review|date=10 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said Olsen is a "fine and daring writer, equal to the material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nietzsche's Kisses|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-57366-127-0|accessdate=4 December 2012|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|date=2 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[order of magnitude]] of [[time]] is (usually) a [[decimal]] prefix or decimal order-of-magnitude quantity together with a base unit of time, like a [[microsecond]] or a [[million years]]. In some cases, the order of magnitude may be implied (usually 1), like a "[[second]]" or "[[year]]". In other cases, the quantity name implies the [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]], like "[[century]]". In most cases, the base unit is seconds or years. Prefixes are not usually used with a base unit of years, so we say "a million years", not "a megayear". Clock time and calendar time have [[duodecimal]] or [[sexagesimal]] '''orders of magnitude''' rather than decimal, i.e. a year is 12 months, and a minute is 60 seconds.

The smallest meaningful increment of time is the [[Planck time]], the time light takes to traverse the [[Planck distance]], many decimal orders of magnitude smaller than a second.  The largest ''realized'' amount of time, given known scientific data, is the [[age of the universe]], about 13.8 billion years - the time since the [[Big Bang]] as measured in the [[cosmic microwave background]] [[rest frame]].  Those amounts of time together span 60 decimal orders of magnitude.  Metric prefixes are defined spanning 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;, 48 decimal orders of magnitude which may be used in conjunction with the metric base unit of second. Metric units of time larger than the second are most commonly seen only in a few scientific contexts such as observational astronomy and materials science although this depends on author; for everyday usage and most other scientific contexts the common units of minutes (60 s), hours (3600 s or 3.6 ks), days (86 400 s), weeks, months, and years (of which there are a number of variations) are commonly used. Weeks, months and years are significantly variable units whose length crucially depends on the choice of [[calendar]] and is often not regular even with a calendar, e.g. [[leap year]]s versus regular years in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. This makes them problematic for use against a linear and regular time scale such as that defined by the SI since it is not clear as to which version of these units we are to be using. Because of this, in the table below we will not use weeks and months and the year we will use is the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] of astronomy, or 365.25 days of 86 400 s exactly, also called an [[annum]] and denoted with the symbol ''a'', whose definition is based on the average length of a year of the [[Julian calendar]] which had one leap year every and always every 4 years against common years of 365 days each. This unit is used, following the convention of [[geological science]], to form larger units of time by the application of SI prefixes to it at least up to ''giga-annum'', or Ga, equal to 1 000 000 000 a ([[short scale]]: one ''billion'' years, [[long scale]]: one ''milliard'' years).

86.4 ks (24 h): one [[day]] of Earth by standard. More exactly, the [[mean solar day]] is 86.400 002 ks due to [[tidal braking]], and increasing at the rate of approximately 2 ms/century; to correct for this time standards like [[UTC]] use [[leap seconds]] with the interval described as "a day" on them being most often 86.4 ks exactly by definition but occasionally one second more or less so that every day contains a whole number of seconds while preserving alignment with astronomical time.

'''Phaleristics''' (from the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] hero {{lang-el|Φάληρος}} ''Phaleros'' "[[Phalerus]]" via the [[Latin]] '''phalera''' "heroics"; sometimes spelled '''faleristics''') is an [[auxiliary sciences of history|auxiliary science of history]] which studies [[Order (distinction)|orders]], [[fraternity|fraternities]], and [[award item]]s, such as [[medals]] and other decorations. 

The subject includes [[orders of chivalry]] (including [[Military order (monastic society)|military orders]]), [[orders of merit]], [[fraternal order]]s. These may all in turn be official, national, state entities, or civil, religious, or academic-related one. The field of study also comprises comparative [[honour systems]], and thus in a broader sense also [[history]] ([[art history]]), [[sociology]], and [[anthropology]]. In terms of objects, these include award items such as medals and their accessories; [[ribbon bar]]s, [[badge]]s, [[pins]], award certificate documentation, etc., and phaleristics may also designate the field of [[collecting]] related items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phaleristics|url=http://www.faleristica.org/?page_id=540#1|publisher=Phaleristics Academy of Portugal|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although established as a scientific sub-discipline of history, phaleristics usually studies orders and decorations "detached from their bodies".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Winkle: ''Der Dank des Vaterlandes. Eine Symbolgeschichte des Eisernen Kreuzes 1914 bis 1936''. Essen 2007, S. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; 

King [[George VI]] of [[England]] loved the study of phaleristics, going to the extent of personally overseeing his [[uniform]] designs and ribbon placements. He is known to have designed a few British [[military decorations]] for the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Reluctant King: The Life &amp; Reign of George VI, 1895–1952 |first= Sarah |last= Bradford |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year= 1989 |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian phalerist [[Julius Iversen]] studied orders and medals in the 19th century.

'''Philosophy of history''' is the philosophical study of [[history]] and the past. The term was coined by [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Voltaire]], ''La philosophie de l'histoire'', Changuion, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
In [[contemporary philosophy]] a distinction is made between critical philosophy of history (also known as analytic) and speculative philosophy of history. The names of these types are derived from [[C. D. Broad]]'s distinction between [[critical philosophy]] and [[speculative philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. W. H. Walsh, ''Introduction to the Philosophy of History'' (1951) ch. 1 p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Gruner, "The concept of speculative philosophy of history," ''Metaphilosophy'' '''3'''(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

The former studies the past itself whereas the latter is the equivalent of what the [[philosophy of science]] is for nature.&lt;ref&gt;The Continuing Relevance of Speculative Philosophy of History, Journal of the Philosophy of History&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy of History, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there is some overlap between the two aspects, they can usually be distinguished; modern professional historians tend to be skeptical about speculative philosophy of history.

Sometimes critical philosophy of history is included under [[historiography]]. Philosophy of history should not be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas in their historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/stefan-collini/what-intellectual-history|title=What is Intellectual History?|work=historytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-modern history==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) maintained the superiority of poetry over history because poetry speaks of what ''must'' or ''should'' be [[truth|true]] rather than merely what ''is'' true.

[[Herodotus]], a fifth-century BCE contemporary of [[Socrates]], broke from the [[Homer|Homeric tradition]] of passing [[narrative]] from generation to generation in his work "Investigations" (Ancient Greek: Ἱστορίαι; Istoríai), also known as [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']]. Herodotus, regarded by some{{who|date=June 2016}} as the first systematic historian, and, later, [[Plutarch]] (46–120 CE) freely invented [[discourse|speeches]] for their historical figures and chose their historical subjects with an eye toward [[moral]]ly improving the reader. History was supposed to teach good examples for one to follow. The assumption that history "should teach good examples" influenced how writers produced history. Events of the past are just as likely to show bad examples that one should not follow, but classical historians would either not record such examples or would re-interpret them to support their assumption of history's purpose.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

From the Classical period to the [[Renaissance]], historians alternated between focusing on subjects designed to improve mankind and on a devotion to fact. History was composed mainly of [[hagiography|hagiographies]] of [[sovereignty|monarchs]] or of [[epic poetry]] describing [[hero]]ic gestures (such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''—about the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (778) during [[Charlemagne]]'s first campaign to conquer the [[Iberian peninsula]]).

In the fourteenth century, [[Ibn Khaldun]], who is considered one of the fathers of the philosophy of history, discussed his philosophy of history and society in detail in his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377). His work represents a culmination of earlier works by [[Social theory#Sociology in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic sociologists]] in the spheres of [[Islamic ethics]], [[political science]], and [[Historiography of early Islam|historiography]], such as those of [[al-Farabi]] (c. 872 – c. 950), [[Ibn Miskawayh]], al-Dawani, and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] (1201–1274).&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data". He introduced a [[scientific method]] to the philosophy of history (which Dawood considers something "totally new to his age") and he often referred to it as his "new science",&lt;ref&gt;

which is now associated with [[historiography]]. His [[historical method]] also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]], and [[systematic bias]] in history.&lt;ref name=Mowlana/&gt;

By the eighteenth century historians had turned toward a more [[positivist]] approach—focusing on [[fact]] as much as possible, but still with an eye on telling histories that could instruct and improve. Starting with [[Fustel de Coulanges]] (1830–1889) and [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903), historical studies began to move towards a more modern scientific{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} form. In the [[Victorian era]], historiographers debated less whether history was intended to improve the [[Reading (process)|reader]], and more on what causes turned history and how one could understand historical change.

==Cyclical and linear history==
{{further information|Social cycle theory}}

Narrative history tends to follow an assumption of linear progression: "this happened, and then that happened; that happened because this happened first".

Many ancient cultures held [[Religion and mythology|mythical]] concepts of history and of [[time]] that were not [[linear]]. Such societies saw history as cyclical, with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. [[Plato]] taught the concept of the [[Great Year]], and other Greeks spoke of [[aeon]]s (eons). Similar examples include the ancient doctrine of [[eternal return]], which existed in [[Ancient Egypt]], in the [[Indian religions]], among the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Pythagoreans]]' and in the [[Stoics]]' conceptions. In his ''[[Works and Days]]'', [[Hesiod]] described five [[Ages of Man]]: the [[Golden Age]], the [[Silver Age]], the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age]], which began with the [[Dorian invasion]]. Some scholars{{which?|date=July 2018}} identify just four ages, corresponding to the four metals, with the Heroic age as a description of the Bronze Age. A four-age count would match the [[Vedic time keeping|Vedic]] or Hindu ages known as the [[Kali Yuga|Kali]], [[Dwapara Yuga|Dwapara]], [[Treta Yuga|Treta]] and [[Satya Yuga|Satya]] [[yuga]]s. According to [[Jainism]], this world has no beginning or end but goes through cycles of upturns (utsarpini) and downturns (avasarpini) constantly. Many Greeks believed that just as mankind went through four [[stages of character]] during each rise and fall of history so did [[government]]. They considered [[democracy]] and [[monarchy]] as the healthy régimes of the higher ages; and [[oligarchy]] and [[tyranny]] as corrupted régimes common to the lower ages.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}}

In the East, [[Social cycle theory|cyclical theories of history]] developed in China (as a theory of [[dynastic cycle]]) and in the Islamic world in the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406).

The story of [[the Fall of Man]] from the [[Garden of Eden]], as recounted and elaborated in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], preserves traces of a moral cycle; this would give the basis for [[theodicy|theodicies]] which attempt to reconcile the existence of evil in the world with the existence of a God, providing a global explanation of history with belief in a coming [[Messianic Age]]. Some theodicies claimed that history had a progressive direction leading to an [[eschatological]] end, such as the [[Apocalypse]], organized by a superior power. [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430), [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274) and [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] (in his ''Discourse On [[Universal History]]'' of 1679) formulated such theodicies, but [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (1646-1716), who coined the term ''Théodicée'', developed the most famous philosophical theodicy. Leibniz based his explanation on the [[principle of sufficient reason]], which states that anything that happens, does happen for a specific reason. Thus, while man might see certain events as evil (such as wars, epidemics and natural disasters), such a judgement in fact only reflected human perception; if one adopted [[God's view]], "evil" events in fact only took place in the larger [[divine plan]]. In this way theodicies explained the necessity of evil as a relative element that forms part of a larger plan of history. Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason was not, however, a gesture of [[fatalism]]. Confronted with the antique [[problem of future contingents]], Leibniz invented the theory of "[[compossible worlds]]", distinguishing two types of necessity, to cope with the problem of [[determinism]].

During the [[Renaissance]], cyclical conceptions of history would become common, with proponents illustrating decay and rebirth by pointing to the [[decline of the Roman Empire]]. [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' (1513–1517) provide an example. The notion of [[Empire]] contained in itself ascendance and [[decadence]],{{cn|date=July 2018}} as in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) (which the Roman Catholic Church placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'').

[[Social cycle theory|Cyclical conceptions]] continued in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the works of authors such as [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936), [[Nikolay Danilevsky]] (1822–1885), and [[Paul Kennedy]] (1945– ), who conceived the human past as a series of repetitive rises and falls. Spengler, like [[Herbert Butterfield| Butterfield]], when writing in reaction to the carnage of the [[First World War]] of 1914–1918, believed that a civilization enters upon an era of [[Caesarism]]&lt;ref&gt;
Compare [https://books.google.com/books?id=XDWcLHxfthMC Oswald Spengler and History as Destiny], page 93: "[...] the closing years of the First World War, when Spengler was completing his work, had witnessed the passing of the feudal rule of landed aristocracy in Germany and its merging into budding forms of parliamentary plutocracy - soon to be followed by the rise of 'mobocracy' and then Caesarism."
&lt;/ref&gt;
after its soul dies.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}} Spengler thought that the soul of the West was dead and that Caesarism was about to begin.

The development of mathematical models of long-term secular sociodemographic cycles revived interest in cyclical theories of history (see, for example, ''Historical Dynamics'' (2003) by [[Peter Turchin]], or ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics''&lt;ref&gt;

==Sustainable history==
''"Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man"'' is a philosophy of history proposed by [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]], where history is defined as ''a durable progressive trajectory in which the quality of life on this planet or all other planets is premised on the guarantee of human dignity for all at all times under all circumstances.''&lt;ref&gt;Nayef R.F. Al-Rodhan, Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man: A Philosophy of History and Civilisational Triumph (Berlin: [http://www.lit-verlag.de/isbn/3-643-80005-3 LIT], 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory views history as a linear progression propelled by [[good governance]], which is, in turn, to be achieved through balancing the emotional, amoral, and egoistic elements of [[human nature]] with the human dignity needs of reason, security, [[human rights]], accountability, transparency, justice, opportunity, innovation, and inclusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcsp.ch/Globalisation/Publications/Faculty-Publications/Books-and-Edited-Volumes/Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-A-Philosophy-of-History-and-Civilisational-Triumph GCSP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314154010/http://www.gcsp.ch/Globalisation/Publications/Faculty-Publications/Books-and-Edited-Volumes/Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-A-Philosophy-of-History-and-Civilisational-Triumph |date=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Human dignity'' lies at the heart of this theory and is paramount for ensuring the sustainable history of humankind. Among other things, [[human dignity]] means having a positive sense of self and instilling individuals with respect for the communities to which they belong. Thus, reconciling humans' predisposition for emotionally self-interested behavior with the imperatives of human dignity appears as the one of the most important challenges to global policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/events/event_060710_1130.htm Geneva Press Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003094748/http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/events/event_060710_1130.htm |date=2011-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At national level, they have to protect their citizens against violence and provide them with access to food, housing, clothes, health care, and education. Basic welfare provision and security are fundamental to ensuring human dignity. Environment and ecological considerations need to be addressed as well. Finally, cultural diversity, inclusiveness and participation at all levels, of all communities are key imperatives of human dignity.

In this respect, the sustainable history philosophy challenges existing concepts of [[civilisations]], such as [[Samuel Huntington (political scientist)|Samuel Huntington's]] ''[[Clash of Civilisations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookpleasures.com/websitepublisher/articles/2610/1/-Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-Reviewed-By-Norm-Goldman-of-Bookpleasurescom/Page1.html|title=Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man Reviewed By Norm Goldman of Bookpleasures.com|work=bookpleasures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it argues that human civilisation should not be thought of as consisting of numerous separate and competing civilisations, but rather it should be thought of collectively as only one human civilisation. Within this civilisation are many geo-cultural domains that comprise'' [[sub-cultures]]. ''[[Nayef Al-Rodhan]]'' ''envisions human civilisation as an ocean into which the different geo-cultural domains flow like rivers,'' "The Ocean Model of one Human Civilization". ''At points where geo-cultural domains first enter the ocean of human civilisation, there is likely to be a concentration or dominance of that culture. However, over time, all the rivers of geo-cultural domains become one. There is fluidity at the ocean's centre and cultures have the opportunity to borrow between them. Under such historical conditions the most advanced forms of human enterprise can thrive and lead us to a'' 'civilisational triumph'. ''Nevertheless, there are cases where geographical proximity of various cultures can also lead to friction and conflict.

[[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] concludes that within an increasingly globalised, interconnected and interdependent world, human dignity cannot be ensured globally and in a sustainable way through sole national means. A genuine global effort is required to meet the minimum criteria of human dignity globally. Areas such as conflict prevention, socio-economic justice, gender equality, protection of human rights, environmental protection require a holistic approach and a common action.

==The Enlightenment's ideal of progress==
{{further information|Age of Enlightenment |Social progress}}

During the ''Aufklärung'', or Enlightenment, history began to be seen as both linear and irreversible. [[Condorcet]]'s interpretations of the various "stages of humanity" or [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]] were one of the most important formulations of such conceptions of history, which trusted [[social progress]]. As in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762) treatise on education (or the "art of training men"), the ''Aufklärung'' conceived the human species as perfectible: [[human nature]] could be infinitely developed through a well-thought [[pedagogy]]. In ''[[What is Enlightenment?]]'' (1784), [[Immanuel Kant]] defined the ''Aufklärung'' as the capacity to think by oneself, without referring to an exterior authority, be it a prince or tradition:

{{quotation|Enlightenment is when a person leaves behind a state of immaturity and dependence (''Unmündigkeit'') for which they themselves were responsible. Immaturity and dependence are the inability to use one's own [[intellect]] without the direction of another. One is responsible for this immaturity and dependence, if its cause is not a lack of intelligence or education, but a lack of determination and courage to think without the direction of another. ''[[wikt:Sapere aude|Sapere aude]]! Dare to know!'' is therefore the slogan of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].}}

In a paradoxical way, Kant supported in the same time [[enlightened despotism]] as a way of leading humanity towards its [[autonomy]]. He had conceived the process of history in his short treaty ''[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]]'' (1784). On one hand, enlightened despotism was to lead nations toward their liberation, and progress was thus inscribed in the scheme of history; on the other hand, liberation could only be acquired by a singular gesture, ''Sapere Aude''! Thus, autonomy ultimately relied on the individual's "determination and courage to think without the direction of another."

After Kant, [[G. W. F. Hegel]] developed a complex theodicy in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), which based its conception of history on [[dialectics]]: the negative (wars, etc.) was conceived by Hegel as the motor of history. Hegel argued that history is a constant process of dialectic clash, with each [[thesis]] encountering an opposing idea or event [[antithesis]]. The clash of both was "superated" in the [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]], a conjunction that conserved the contradiction between thesis and its antithesis while [[Aufheben|sublating]] it. As [[Marx]] famously explained afterwards, concretely that meant that if [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s monarchic rule in France was seen as the thesis, the [[French Revolution]] could be seen as its antithesis. However, both were sublated in [[Napoleon]], who reconciled the revolution with the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''; he conserved the change. Hegel thought that [[reason]] accomplished itself, through this dialectical scheme, in History. Through [[Manual labour|labour]], man transformed nature so he could recognize himself in it; he made it his "home." Thus, reason spiritualized nature. Roads, fields, fences, and all the modern infrastructure in which we live is the result of this spiritualization of nature. Hegel thus explained social progress as the result of the labour of reason in history. However, this dialectical reading of history involved, of course, contradiction, so history was also conceived of as constantly conflicting: Hegel theorized this in his famous [[Slave-master dialectic|dialectic of the lord and the bondsman]].

According to Hegel,
{{quotation|One more word about giving instruction as to what the world ought to be. Philosophy in any case always comes on the scene too late to give it... When philosophy paints its gray in gray, then has a shape of life grown old. By philosophy's gray in gray it cannot be rejuvenated but only understood. The [[owl of Minerva]] spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk.|&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, [[Philosophy of Right]] (1820), "Preface"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, philosophy was to explain ''Geschichte'' (history) afterward. Philosophy is always late, it is only an interpretation of what is rational in the real—and, according to Hegel, only what is recognized as rational is real. This idealist understanding of philosophy as interpretation was famously challenged by [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Theses on Feuerbach|11th thesis on Feuerbach]]'' (1845): "''Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.''"

===Social evolutionism===
{{further information|Sociocultural evolution}} &lt;!-- the time sphere --&gt;
Inspired by the Enlightenment's ideal of progress, social evolutionism became a popular conception in the nineteenth century. [[Auguste Comte]]'s (1798–1857) [[positivism|positivist]] conception of history, which he divided into the theological stage, the metaphysical stage and the positivist stage, brought upon by modern science, was one of the most influential doctrines of progress. The [[Whig interpretation of history]], as it was later called, associated with scholars of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] eras in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], such as [[Henry Maine]] or [[Thomas Macaulay]], gives an example of such influence, by looking at human history as progress from savagery and ignorance toward peace, prosperity, and science. Maine described the direction of progress as "from status to contract," from a world in which a child's whole life is pre-determined by the circumstances of his birth, toward one of mobility and choice.

The publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 introduced [[human evolution]]. However, it was quickly transposed from its original biological field to the social field, in "[[social Darwinism]]" theories. [[Herbert Spencer]], who coined the term "[[survival of the fittest]]", or [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] in ''[[Ancient Society]]'' (1877) developed evolutionist theories independent from Darwin's works, which would be later interpreted as social Darwinism. These nineteenth-century [[unilineal evolution]] theories claimed that societies start out in a ''primitive'' state and gradually become more [[civilisation|civilised]] over time, and equated the culture and technology of Western civilisation with progress.

[[Ernst Haeckel]] formulated his [[recapitulation theory]] in 1867, which stated that "[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]": the evolution of each individual reproduces the species' evolution, such as in the development of [[embryos]]. Hence, a child goes through all the steps from primitive society to modern society. This was later discredited.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Haeckel did not support Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]] introduced in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859), rather believing in a [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]].

Progress was not necessarily, however, positive. [[Arthur Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–55) was a [[decadence|decadent]] description of the evolution of the "[[Aryan race]]" which was disappearing through [[miscegenation]]. Gobineau's works had a large popularity in the so-called [[scientific racism]] theories that developed during the [[New Imperialism]] period.

After the [[World War I|first world war]], and even before [[Herbert Butterfield]] (1900–1979) harshly criticized it, the Whig interpretation had gone out of style. The bloodletting of that conflict had indicted the whole notion of linear progress. [[Paul Valéry]] famously said: "We civilizations now know ourselves mortal."

However, the notion itself didn't completely disappear. ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) by [[Francis Fukuyama]] proposed a similar notion of progress, positing that the worldwide adoption of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] as the single accredited political system and even modality of human consciousness would represent the "[[End of History]]". Fukuyama's work stems from an [[Alexandre Kojève|Kojevian]] reading of Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807).

Unlike [[Maurice Godelier]] who interprets history as a process of transformation, [[Tim Ingold]] suggests that history is a movement of [[autopoiesis]]&lt;ref&gt;Ingold, T. On the Distinction between Evolution and History. Social Evolution &amp; History,. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2002. Pp. 5-24. P. 9, [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/130380/ socionauki.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key component to making sense of all of this is to simply recognize that all these issues in social evolution merely serve to support the suggestion that how one considers the nature of history will impact the interpretation and conclusions drawn about history. The critical under-explored question is less about history as content and more about history as process.

In 2011 [[Steven Pinker]] wrote a history of violence and humanity from an evolutionary perspective in which he shows that violence has declined statistically over time.&lt;ref&gt;" The better angels of our nature, a history of violence and humanity ", by [[Steven Pinker]], published 2012 by Penguin books {{ISBN|978-0-141-03464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The validity of the "great man theory" in historical studies===
{{further|Hero#The hero in historical studies|Great man theory}}

After Hegel, who insisted on the role of "[[Great man theory|great men]]" in history, with his famous statement about [[Napoleon]], "I saw the Spirit on his horse", [[Thomas Carlyle]] argued that history was the biography of a few central individuals, ''[[hero]]es'', such as [[Oliver Cromwell]] or [[Frederick the Great]], writing that "The history of the world is but the biography of great men." His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men, of geniuses good and evil, sought to organize change in the advent of greatness. Explicit defenses of Carlyle's position have been rare in the late twentieth century. Most philosophers of history contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one he used for his portraits. A.C. Danto, for example, wrote of the importance of the individual in history, but extended his definition to include ''social individuals,'' defined as "individuals we may provisionally characterize as containing individual human beings amongst their parts. Examples of social individuals might be social classes [...], national groups [...], religious organizations [...], large-scale events [...], large-scale social movements [...], etc." (Danto, "The Historical Individual", 266, in ''Philosophical Analysis and History,'' edited by Williman H. Dray, Rainbow-Bridge Book Co., 1966). The Great Man approach to history was most popular with professional historians in the nineteenth century; a popular work of this school is the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' (1911), which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history. For example, to read about (what is known today as) the "[[Migrations Period]]," consult the biography of [[Attila the Hun]].

After [[Marx]]'s [[historical materialism|conception of a materialist history]] based on the [[class struggle]], which raised attention for the first time to the importance of social factors such as economics in the unfolding of history, [[Herbert Spencer]] wrote "You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him."

The [[Annales School]], founded by [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Marc Bloch]], were a major landmark on the shift from a history centered on [[subject (philosophy)|individual subjects]] to studies concentrating in [[geography]], economics, [[demography]], and other social forces. [[Fernand Braudel]]'s studies on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as "hero" of history, [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]]'s history of [[climate]], etc., were inspired by this School.

==Is history predetermined?==
There is disagreement about the extent to which history is ultimately deterministic (see [[historical determinism]]). Some argue that geography (see [[geographic determinism]]), economic systems (see [[economic determinism]]), or culture (see [[cultural determinism]]) prescribe "the iron laws of history" that decide what is to happen. Others see history as a long line of acts and accidents, big and small, each playing out its consequences until that process gets interrupted by the next.

It should be noted that even determinists do not rule that, from time to time, certain cataclysmic events occur to change course of history. Their main point is, however, that such events are rare and that even apparently large shocks like wars and revolutions often have no more than temporary effects on the evolution of the society.

[[Karl Marx]] is, perhaps, the most famous of the exponents of economic determinism. For him social institutions like political system, religion and culture were merely by-products of the basic economic system (see [[Base and superstructure]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://economics.mit.edu/files/9658 Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo. Under the Thumb of History? Political institutions and the Scope for Action]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even he did not see history as completely deterministic. His essay ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'' contains the most famous formulation of Marx's view of the role of the individual in history: ''Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under given circumstances directly encountered and inherited from the past.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marx2mao.com/M&amp;E/EBLB52.html|title=The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte|work=marx2mao.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Does history have a teleological sense?==
{{further|Social progress|Progress (history)}}

[[Theodicy]] claimed that history had a progressive direction leading to an [[eschatological]] end, given by a superior power. However, this transcendent teleological sense can be thought as [[Immanence|immanent]] to human history itself. Hegel probably represents the epitome of teleological philosophy of history. Hegel's teleology was taken up by [[Francis Fukuyama]] in his ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (see ''Social evolutionism'' above). Thinkers such as [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]], or [[Deleuze]] deny any teleological sense to history, claiming that it is best characterized by discontinuities, ruptures, and various time-scales, which the [[Annales School]] had demonstrated.

Schools of thought influenced by Hegel also see history as progressive, but they saw, and see, progress as the outcome of a [[dialectic]] in which factors working in opposite directions are over time reconciled (see above). History was best seen as directed by a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', and traces of the Zeitgeist could be seen by looking backward. Hegel believed that history was moving man toward "[[civilization]]", and some also claim he thought that the [[Prussia]]n state incarnated the "[[End of History]]". In his ''Lessons on the History of Philosophy'', he explains that each epochal philosophy is in a way the whole of philosophy; it is not a subdivision of the Whole but this Whole itself apprehended in a specific modality.

===Historical accounts of writing history===
{{further information|Historiography}}
A classic example of history being written by the victors—or more precisely, by the survivors&lt;ref name="wah"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Writing African History|author=Philips, John Edward|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2006|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;—would be the scarcity of unbiased information that has survived to the present about the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]]. Roman historians left tales of cruelty and [[human sacrifice]] practiced by their longtime enemies; however no Carthaginian was left alive to give their side of the story.

Similarly, we only have the [[History of Christianity|Christian]] side of how Christianity came to be the dominant religion of Europe. However, we know very little about other European religions, such as [[Paganism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} We have the European version of the [[European colonisation of the Americas|conquest of the Americas]], with an interpretation of the native version of events only emerging to popular consciousness since the early 1980s. We have [[Herodotus]]'s Greek history of the [[Persian Wars]], but the Persian recall of the events is little known in Western Culture.

In many respects, the head of state may be guilty of cruelties or even simply a different way of doing things. In some societies, however, to speak of or write critically of rulers can amount to conviction of treason and death. As such, in many ways, what is left as the "official record" of events is oft influenced by one's desire to avoid exile or execution.

However, "losers" in certain time periods often have more of an impetus than the "winners" to write histories that comfort themselves and [[self-justification|justify]] their own behavior.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt; Examples include the historiography of the [[American Civil War]], where it can be argued that the losers (Southerners) have written more history books on the subject than the winners and, until recently, dominated the national perception of history. Confederate generals such as [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]] and [[Thomas J. Jackson|Jackson]] are generally held in higher esteem than their Union counterparts. Popular films such as ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', and ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' have told the story from the Southern viewpoint. Also, despite "losing" the [[Vietnam War]], the United States produces more scholarship on the war than any other country, including Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Triumph Revisited: Historians Battle for the Vietnam War|author=Wiest, Andrew A.|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2010|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular history abounds with condemnations of the cruelty of [[African slave trade]]rs and [[Colonization of Africa|colonists]], despite the "winning" status of those people in their heyday.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt;

As is true of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|pre-Columbian populations of America]], the historical record of America being [[European colonization of the Americas|"discovered" by Europeans]] is now sometimes presented as a history of invasion, exploitation and dominance of a people who had been there before the Europeans. This reinterpretation of the historical record is called [[historical revisionism]], which can take the form of [[historical revisionism (negationism)|negationism]], which is the denial of [[genocide]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]. The revision of previously accepted historical accounts is a constant process in which "today's winners are tomorrow's losers", and the rise and fall of present institutions and movements influence the way historians see the past.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt; In the same sense, the teaching, in [[Education in France|French secondary schools]], of the [[Algerian War of Independence#Historiography of the war and of colonialism|Algerian War of Independence and of colonialism]], has been criticized by several historians, and is the subject of frequent debates. Thus, in contradiction with the February 23, 2005 [[French law on colonialism|law on colonialism]], voted by the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] conservative party, historian Benjamin Stora notes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As Algerians do not appear in their "indigenous" conditions and their sub-citizens status, as the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|history of nationalist movement]] is never evoqued, as none of the great figures of the resistance — [[Messali Hadj]], [[Ferhat Abbas]] — emerge nor retain attention, in one word, as no one explains to students what has been colonisation, we make them unable to understand why the decolonisation took place.&lt;ref name="DiploApril"&gt;[http://mondediplo.com/2001/04/04algeriatorture Colonialism through the school books - The hidden history of the Algerian war], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', April 2001 {{en icon}}/{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hero]] --&gt;

The historico-political [[discourse]] analyzed by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''Society Must Be Defended'' (1975–76) considered [[truth]] as the fragile product of a historical struggle, first conceptualized under the name of "[[race struggle]]"—however, the meaning of "race" was different from today's biological notion, being closer to the sense of "nation" (distinct from [[nation-states]]; its signification is here closer to "people"). [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], for example, was an exponent of nobility rights. He claimed that the French nobility were the racial descendants of the Franks who invaded France (while the Third Estate was descended from the conquered Gauls), and had right to power by virtue of right of conquest. He used this approach to formulate a historical thesis of the course of French political history—a critique of both the monarchy and the Third Estate. Foucault regarded him as the founder of the historico-political discourse as political weapon.

In Great Britain, this historico-political discourse was used by the bourgeoisie, the people and the aristocracy as a means of struggle against the monarchy—cf. [[Edward Coke]] or [[John Lilburne]]. In France, [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], [[Nicolas Fréret]], and then [[Sieyès]], [[Augustin Thierry]], and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]] reappropriated this form of discourse. Finally, at the end of the nineteenth century, this discourse was incorporated by racialist biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of "race" and, even more, transformed this popular discourse into a "[[state racism]]" (Nazism). According to Foucault, [[Marxist]]s also seized this discourse and took it in a different direction, transforming the [[essentialist]] notion of "race" into the historical notion of "[[class struggle]]", defined by socially structured position: capitalist or proletarian. This displacement of discourse constitutes one of the bases of Foucault's thought: discourse is not tied to the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], rather the "subject" is a construction of discourse. Moreover, discourse is not the simple [[ideological]] and mirror reflexion of an economical [[infrastructure]], but is a product and the battlefield of multiples forces—which may not be reduced to the simple dualist [[contradiction]] of two energies.

Foucault shows that what specifies this discourse from the juridical and philosophical discourse is its conception of truth: truth is no longer absolute, it is the product of "race struggle". History itself, which was traditionally the sovereign's science, the [[legend]] of his glorious feats and monument building,he(the sovereign) built monuments,fought in wars and claims victory on behalf of himself which ultimately became the discourse of the people (modern population), a political stake. The subject is not any more a neutral [[arbitrator]], judge, or [[legislator]], as in [[Solon]]'s or Kant's conceptions. Therefore, what became the "[[historical subject]]" must search in history's furor, under the "juridical code's dried blood", the multiple [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingencies]] from which a fragile [[rationality]] temporarily finally emerged. This may be, perhaps, compared to the [[sophist]] discourse in Ancient Greece. Foucault warns that it has nothing to do with [[Machiavelli]]'s or [[Hobbes]]'s discourse on war, for to this popular discourse, the [[sovereignty|Sovereign]] is nothing more than "an illusion, an instrument, or, at the best, an enemy. It is {the historico-political discourse} a discourse that beheads the king, anyway that dispenses itself from the sovereign and that denounces it".

===History and education===

{{Further information|Education|Pedagogy|Philosophy of education}}
Since [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', civic education and instruction has had a central role in politics and the constitution of a common identity. History has thus sometimes become the target of [[propaganda]], for example in [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionist]] attempts. Plato's insistence on the importance of education was relayed by Rousseau's ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'' (1762), a necessary counterpart of ''The [[Social Contract]]'' (also 1762). [[Public education]] has been seen by republican regimes and the Enlightenment as a prerequisite of the masses' progressive emancipation, as conceived by Kant in ''[[What is Enlightenment?|Was Ist Aufklärung?]]'' (What Is Enlightenment?, 1784).

The creation of modern education systems, instrumental in the construction of [[nation-states]], also passed by the elaboration of a common, national history. [[History textbooks]] are one of the many ways through which this common history was transmitted. ''[[Le Tour de France par deux enfants]]'', for example, was the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]'s classic textbook for elementary school: it described the story of two French children who, following the German annexation of the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region in 1870, go on a ''tour de France'' during which they become aware of France's diversity and the existence of the various ''[[patois]]''.

In most societies, schools and curricula are controlled by governments. As such, there is always an opportunity for governments to impose. Granted, often governments in free societies serve to protect freedoms, check [[hate speech]], and breaches of constitutional rights; but the power itself to impose is available to use the education system to influence thought of malleable minds, positively or negatively, towards truth or towards a version of truth. A recent example of the fragility of government involvement with history textbooks was the [[Japanese history textbook controversies]].

===Narrative and history===
A current popular conception considers the value of narrative in the writing and experience of history. Important thinkers in this area include [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Louis Mink]], [[W.B. Gallie]], and [[Hayden White]]. Some have doubted this approach because it draws fictional and historical narrative closer together, and there remains a perceived "fundamental bifurcation between historical and fictional narrative" (Ricœur, vol. 1, 52). In spite of this, most modern historians, such as [[Barbara Tuchman]] or [[David McCullough]], consider narrative writing important to their approaches. The theory of narrated history (or historicized narrative) holds that the structure of lived experience, and such experience narrated in both fictional and non-fictional works (literature and historiography) have in common the figuration of "temporal experience." In this way, narrative has a generously encompassing ability to "'grasp together' and integrate ... into one whole and complete story" the "composite representations" of historical experience (Ricœur x, 173). Louis Mink writes that, "the significance of past occurrences is understandable only as they are locatable in the ensemble of interrelationships that can be grasped only in the construction of narrative form" (148). Marxist theorist [[Fredric Jameson]] also analyzes historical understanding this way, and writes that "history is inaccessible to us except in textual form ... it can be approached only by way of prior (re)textualization" (82).

===History and causality===

{{see also|Causality}}

Narrative and causal approaches to history have often been contrasted or, even, opposed to one another, yet they can also be viewed as complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, M. (2014) ''History and Causality'', 127-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers of history such as Arthur Danto have claimed that "explanations in history and elsewhere" describe "not simply an event—something that happens—but a change".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, A. (1968) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many practicing historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about "larger changes", in Danto's words: to decide "what are the elements which persist through a change" is "rather simple" when treating an individual's "shift in attitude", but "it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, A. (1968) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones, and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, M. (2014) ''History and Causality'', 86-116.&lt;/ref&gt; John Gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes (following Marc Bloch) and between "routine" and "distinctive links" in causal relationships: "in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders."&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, J. L. (2002) ''The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also pointed to the difference between immediate, intermediate and distant causes. For his part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four "general concepts of causation" used in history: the "metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause"; "the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept, which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events"; "the functional/teleological/consequential concept", which is "goal-directed, so that goals are causes"; and the "realist, structurist and dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, C. (1993) ''Structures of History'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History as propaganda: Is history always written by the victors?===
In his "Society must be Defended", [[Michel Foucault]] posited that the victors of a social struggle use their political dominance to suppress a defeated adversary's version of historical events in favor of their own [[propaganda]], which may go so far as [[historical revisionism (political)|historical revisionism]]. (See ''Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse'' above.) Nations adopting such an approach would likely fashion a "universal" theory of history, a [[manifest destiny]] in the US, to support their aims, with a teleological and deterministic philosophy of history used to justify the inevitableness and rightness of their victories.

[[Wolfgang Schivelbusch]]'s ''Culture of Defeat'' took a completely different view—according to him, defeat is a major driver for the defeated to reinvent himself, while the victor—confirmed in his attitudes and methods, dissatisfied by the high losses and paltry gains made, may be less creative and fall back. The concept evokes Hegel's [[Master–slave dialectic]]s—the master is dependent of the work of the slave, the slave has to take his master's and his own interests into account, gets more knowledge and more insight as the master; and in realising that the world around him was created by his own hands he may gain self-consciousness and emancipation. Schivelbusch worked on three basic examples, the South and its [[Lost cause]] after the Civil War, France after the Franco-Prussian War 1870/71, and Germany following World War I. Wolfgang Schivelbusch view includes complex psychological and cultural responses of vanquished nations, from every level of society and sees a need and rise of creativity and various narratives for the defeated.&lt;ref&gt;The Culture of Defeat by Wolfgang Schivelbusch, trans Jefferson Chase Granta, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/29/history.highereducation1 Guardian review 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a society [[Walter Benjamin]] believed that Marxist historians must take a radically different view point from the [[bourgeois]] and [[idealist]] points of view, in an attempt to create a sort of [[People's history|history from below]], which would be able to conceive an alternative conception of history, not based, as in classical historical studies, on the philosophical and juridical discourse of [[sovereignty]]—an approach that would invariably adhere to major states (the victors') points of view.  Philosopher Paul Ricoeur asked instead for a plurality in history writing. "We carry on several histories simultaneously, in times whose periods, crises, and pauses do not coincide. We enchain, abandon, and resume several histories, much as a chess player who plays several games at once, renewing now this one, now the another" (''History and Truth'' 186). [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' is a fictional account of the manipulation of the historical record for nationalist aims and manipulation of power.

To some degree, all nations are active in the promotion of such "national stories", with ethnicity, nationalism, gender, power, heroic figures, class considerations and important national events and trends all clashing and competing within the narrative.

With regard to the [[history of science]], the introduction of new paradigms is depicted by [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''.&lt;ref name=kuhnw&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; Innovation in science or technology is not based on single experiments or ideas per se, but needs a supportive environment and technical achievements to allow for a change of perspective.

The process may lead to [[format war]]s, which leaves losers and winners behind.

==Judgement of history&lt;!--'Judgement of history' redirects here--&gt;==
For Hegel, the history of the world is also the Last Judgement. Hegel adopted the expression "[[:de:Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht|Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht]]" ("[[world history]] is a tribunal that judges the world"; a quote from [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s poem "Resignation" (published in 1786) and used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Janez Juhant, Bojan Žalec (eds.), ''Reconciliation: The Way of Healing and Growth'', LIT Verlag Münster, 2012, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plica''' (from [[Latin]] ''plica'' - fold) is a term from [[sigillography]] for the reinforcement of the lower edge of a [[charter]] or [[deed]], produced by folding up the bottom of the sheet of [[parchment]] to achieve a double thickness. 

The purpose of the fold is to provide a more secure anchorage for the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]], and to guard against the parchment being torn. Slots were normally cut in the double thickness of parchment, a cord or tag of parchment threaded through them, and the seal attached to that.

'''Political history''' is the narrative and analysis of political events, ideas, movements, organs of government, voters, parties and leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/hi/DicHist/analytic/anaV.html Politics: The historical development of economic, legal, and political ideas and institutions, ideologies and movements.] In ''The Dictionary of the History of Ideas''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is interrelated to other fields of history, especially [[diplomatic history]], as well as constitutional history and [[public history]].

Political history studies the organization and operation of power in large societies. By focusing on the elites in power, on their impact on society, on popular response, and on the relationships with the elites in other [[social history]], which focuses predominantly on the actions and lifestyles of ordinary people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jsh/39.3/parthasarathi.html/facts.about.me Parthasarathi, Prasannan, "The State and Social History]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[people's history]], which is historical work from the perspective of the common people.

In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with [[social history]] rose from 31% to 41%, and the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.

==Political world history ==
{{main|history of political thinking}}

The [[political history of the world]] is the history of the evolution of the political events, ideas, movements, leaders and entities, and the way these elements shape society as a whole; Special importance is their crystallisation into political entities such as republics, empires and so on; and the study of [[Diplomatic history|the international relations between them]].  Together with this descriptive analysis, the [[history of political thinking]] narrates the evolution of the political ideas and philosophy, and goes back to antiquity. Political history, and thus the history of political thinking throughout human existence stretches though up to Medieval period and the Renaissance. In the Age of Enlightenment, political entities expanded from basic systems of self-governance and monarchy to the complex democratic and communist systems that exist of the Industrialied and the Modern Era, in parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type boundaries, to the definite boundaries existing today.

==Aspects of political history==
The first "scientific" political history was written by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany in the 19th century.  His methodologies profoundly affected the way historians critically examine sources; see [[historiography]] for a more complete analysis of the methodology of various approaches to history. An important aspect of political history is the study of [[ideology]] as a force for historical change. One author asserts that "political history as a whole cannot exist without the study of ideological differences and their implications."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/cp/vol-02/no-02/author/ Freeman, Joanne B., "Founding Bothers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629093305/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/cp/vol-02/no-02/author/ |date=2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of political history typically centre around a single [[nation]] and its political change and development. Some historians identify the growing trend towards narrow specialization in political history during recent decades: "while a college professor in the 1940s sought to identify himself as a "historian", by the 1950s "American historian" was the designation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Jensen]], Historiography of American Political History. In Jack Greene, ed., ''Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (New York: Scribner's, 1984), vol 1. pp 1-25&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, new movements challenged traditional approaches to political history. The development of [[social history]]  shifted the emphasis away from the study of leaders and national decisions, and towards the role of ordinary people, especially outsiders and minorities. Younger scholars shifted to different issues, usually focused on race, class and gender, with little room for elites. After 1990 social history itself began to fade, replaced with postmodern and cultural approaches that rejected grand narrative.

===United States: The new political history===
Traditional political history focused on major leaders and had long played a dominant role among academic historians in the United States. These studies accounted for about 25% of the scholarly books and articles written by American historians before 1950, and about 33% into the 1960s, followed by diplomacy. The arrival in the 1960s and 1970s of a new interest in [[social history]] led to the emergence of the "new political history" which saw young scholars put much more emphasis on the voters' behavior and motivation, rather than just the politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "United States: The 'new' political history." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1968) 3#1 pp: 5-27. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259964 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "The new political history in the 1970s." in Michael G. Kammen, ed., ''The Past Before Us: Contemporary Historical Writing in the United States'' (1980) pp: 231-251.&lt;/ref&gt;  It relied heavily on quantitative methods to integrate social themes, especially regarding ethnicity and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Swierenga, "Ethnocultural political analysis: a new approach to American ethnic studies," ''Journal of American Studies'' (1971) 5#1 pp: 59-79.&lt;/ref&gt; The new social science approach was a harbinger of the fading away of interest in Great Men. The eclipse of traditional political approaches during the 1970s was a major shock, though diplomatic history fell even further. It was upstaged by social history, with a race/class/gender model. The number of political articles submitted to the ''Journal of American History'' fell by half from 33% to 15%. Patterson argued that contemporary events, especially the Vietnam War and Watergate, alienated younger scholars away from the study of politicians and their deeds.  Political history never disappeared, but it never recovered its dominance among scholars, despite its sustained high popularity among the reading public.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Patterson,  "The Persistence of Political History" in  Richard S. Kirkendall, ed. ''The Organization of American Historians and the Writing and Teaching of American History'' (2011)  pp 67-74; his statistical estimates appear on pp 70, 72&lt;/ref&gt;  Some political historians made fun of their own predicament, as when [[William Leuchtenburg]] wrote, "the status of the political historians within the profession has sunk to somewhere between that of a faith healer and a chiropractor.  Political historians were all right in a way, but you might not want to bring one home to meet the family."&lt;ref&gt;William Leuchenburg, "The Pertinence of Political History: Reflection on the Significance of the State In America," ''Journal of American History''  (Dec. 1986) 73:585-600 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1902978 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others were more analytical, as when Hugh Davis Graham observed:
:The ranks of traditional political historians are depleted, their assumptions and methods discredited, along with the Great White Man whose careers they chronicled.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Davis Graham, "The stunted career of policy history: a critique and an agenda." ''The Public Historian'' (1993): 15-37. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377943 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
Readman (2009) discusses the historiography of British political history in the 20th century. He describes how British political scholarship mostly ignored 20th century history due to temporal proximity to the recent past, the unavailability of primary sources, and the potential for bias. The article explores how transitions in scholarship have allowed for greater interest in 20th century history among scholars, which include less reliance on archival sources, methodological changes in historiography, and the flourishing of new forms of history such as oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Readman (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the course of the 1960s, however, some German historians (notably [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] and his cohort) began to rebel against this idea, instead suggesting a "Primacy of Domestic Politics" (''Primat der Innenpolitik''), in which the insecurities of (in this case German) domestic policy drove the creation of foreign policy.  This led to a considerable body of work interpreting the domestic policies of various states and the ways this influenced their conduct of foreign policy.

===France===
The French ''[[Annales School]]'' had already put an emphasis on the role of geography and economics on history, and of the importance of broad, slow cycles rather than the constant apparent movement of the "history of events" of high politics.  It downplayed politics and diplomacy. The most important work of the ''Annales'' school, [[Fernand Braudel]]'s ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'', contains a traditional Rankean diplomatic history of Philip II's Mediterranean policy, but only as the third and shortest section of a work largely focusing on the broad cycles of history in the ''longue durée'' ("long term").  The ''Annales'' were broadly influential, leading to a turning away from political history towards an emphasis on broader trends of economic and environmental change.

===Social history===
{{main|Social history}}
In the 1960s and 1970s, an increasing emphasis on giving a voice to the voiceless and writing the history of the underclasses, whether by using the quantitative statistical methods of [[social history]] or the more postmodern assessments of [[cultural history]], also undermined the centrality of politics to the historical discipline. Leff noted how social historians, "disdained political
history as elitist, shallow, altogether passe, and irrelevant to the drama of everyday lives."&lt;ref&gt;Mark H. Leff, "Revisioning US political history." ''American Historical Review'' (1995) 100#3 pp: 829-853, quote p 829. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2168607 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;


===History of political regimes and institutions===
*MaxRange data is a project that defines and shows in detail the political status and development of institutional regimes of all states in the world from 1789. MaxRange also describes the background, development, external sources and major causes behind all political changes.
MaxRange is a dataset defining level of democracy and institutional structure(regime-type) on a 100-graded scale where every value represents a unique regimetype. Values are sorted from 1-100 based on level of democracy and political accountability. MaxRange defines the value (regimetype) corresponding to all states and every month from 1789 to 2015 and updating. MaxRange is created and developed by Max Range, and is now associated with the university of Halmstad, Sweden &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hh.se/english/schoolofeducationhumanitiesandsocialsciences/research/maxrange.65441985_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is a collaborative effort between [[Queens College]] and [[Queens Library]] that was initially funded through a grant from the [[Metropolitan New York Library Council]] (METRO).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hadassah.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=keJNIWOvElH&amp;b=7657019&amp;ct=8852893 Metropolitan New York Library Council awards $70,000 in grants to support collaborative digitization projects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414220736/http://www.hadassah.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=keJNIWOvElH&amp;b=7657019&amp;ct=8852893 |date=April 14, 2012 }}" (1 November 2010). ''Hadassah News''. Retrieved 17 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Materials in the archive are made accessible to the public through a website which contains [[oral history]] interviews and photographs documenting the lives of Queens residents. The stories and images are presented alongside digitized historical photographs, maps, news clippings and other archival records. The goal of the project is to allow visitors to the site to view otherwise scattered archival materials and personal stories in a searchable database of collective memory representing the borough of Queens.

==History==
The archive began in June 2010 as an independent study for project director and archivist Natalie Milbrodt, then a Special Collections and Archives Fellow in the Queens College Libraries and a master's degree candidate in the Graduate School of Library and Information Studies. Focusing on the neighborhood of [[Flushing,_Queens|Flushing]], Milbrodt conducted oral history interviews with 20 residents in the Waldheim neighborhood, a small area less than a mile from downtown Flushing.&lt;ref&gt;The City University of New York, Queens College (30 November 2010).

== Biography ==
Sobecki is Professor of Medieval English Literature and Culture at the [[University of Groningen]], the oldest chair (founded in 1886) for English literature in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fV3w7EOWUQkC&amp;q=1886#v=snippet&amp;q=1886&amp;f=false|title=One Hundred Years of English Studies in Dutch Universities: Seventeen Papers Read at the Centenary Conference, Groningen, 15-16 January 1986|last=Bunt|first=Gerrit|date=1986|website=|publisher=Rodopi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-09-22|isbn=978-9062037896}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also holds by courtesy the Professorship of Old Germanic, established in 1881. Having received his education at the [[University of Cambridge]], Sobecki became an Assistant Professor at [[McGill University]] before being appointed at Groningen. He works on medieval English and early Tudor literature, particularly on Chaucer, Gower, manuscripts, politics, law, travel, and Anglo-European relations. Sobecki was awarded the John Hurt Fisher Prize by the John Gower Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.i.sobecki/|title=Department of English, University of Groningen|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wcu.edu/johngower/FisherPrize/index.html|title=John Hurt Fisher Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobecki has written widely on medieval and early modern topics, across 10 published and forthcoming books, and more than 50 academic articles and chapters, many of which have appeared in leading journals, including [[Speculum (journal)|''Speculum'']], ''English Literary History'', ''Studies in the Age of Chaucer'', ''Renaissance Studies'', ''[[The English Historical Review]]'', ''[[The Chaucer Review]]'', ''The Library'', ''New Medieval Literatures'', and ''[[The Review of English Studies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.i.sobecki/research/publications.html|title=Department of English, University of Groningen, Sobecki, Publications|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Michelle Karnes (University of Notre Dame), Sobecki has been appointed editor of the journal ''Studies in the Age of Chaucer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/let/organization/actueel/nieuwsberichten-2018/2018-05-18-sobecki-editor-sac?lang=en|title=Prof Sobecki appointed new co-editor Studies in the Age of Chaucer (SAC) Journal|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is completing his third authored book, ''The Material Politics of England’s Fifteenth-Century Literature'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press) and two volumes in the Oxford edition of [[Richard Hakluyt]]'s ''Principal Navigations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hakluyt.org/|title=Hakluyt Editorial Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sobecki is also editing ''The Cambridge History of Medieval Travel Writing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.i.sobecki/projects|title=Department of English, University of Groningen, Sobecki, Projects|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sun Language Theory''' ({{lang-tr|Güneş Dil Teorisi}}) was a [[Turkish nationalism|Turkish nationalist]] [[pseudoscientific]] [[linguistics|linguistic]] hypothesis developed in [[Turkey]] in the 1930s that proposed that all human [[language]]s are descendants of one proto-[[Turkic Languages|Turkic]] primal language. The theory proposed that because this primal language had close [[phonemic]] resemblances to Turkish, all other languages can essentially be traced back to Turkic roots. According to the theory, the Central Asian worshippers, who wanted to salute the omnipotence of the sun and its life-giving qualities, had done so by transforming their meaningless blabbering into a coherent set of ritual utterings, and language was born, hence the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aytürk, İlker |date=November 2004 |title=Turkish Linguists against the West: The Origins of Linguistic Nationalism in Atatürk's Turkey |journal=Middle Eastern Studies |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1–25 |location=London |publisher=Frank Cass &amp; Co (Routledge) |doi=10.1080/0026320042000282856 |issn=0026-3206 |oclc=86539631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Influences on the theory included:

* the ideas of the [[France|French]] historian [[Hilaire de Barenton]], expressed in  "L'Origine des Langues, des Religions et des Peuples", that all languages originated from [[hieroglyph]]s and [[cuneiform]] used by [[Sumer]]ians&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;
{{Cite news |title=Turks Teach New Theories |date=1936-02-09 | url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70914FC395F167B93CBA91789D85F428385F9 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |place=Istanbul}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* a paper of the [[Austria]]n linguist Hermann F. Kvergić of [[Vienna]] entitled "La psychologie de quelques éléments des langues Turques" ("The Psychology of Some Elements of the [[Turkic Languages]]")&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Laut, Jens Peter |year=2002 |title=Noch einmal zu Dr. Kvergić |journal=Turkic Languages |url=http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/1830/pdf/Laut_Noch_einmal_zu_Dr_Kvergic.pdf |format=PDF reprinted online |volume=6 |pages=120–133 |location=Wiesbaden, Germany |publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag |issn=1431-4983 |oclc=37421320 |accessdate=2007-12-05 | language=German}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], not only gave the theory official backing and material support&lt;ref&gt;
See [[Speros Vryonis]]. ''The Turkish State and History: Clio meets the Grey Wolf, 2nd Ed''. Thessaloniki: Institute for Balkan Studies, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; but also was himself a very important contributor to its development, "though clearly he did not do all the donkey work".&lt;ref name=LewisTLRbook/&gt;

==Tenets==
As described in a 1936 ''[[New York Times]]'' article on the curriculum of the newly opened School of Language, History and Geography of [[Ankara University]], the theory&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;claims that the Sumerians, being Turks, originating in Central Asia, all languages also consequently originated there and first used by the Turks. The first language, in fact, came into being in this way: Prehistoric man, i.e., Turks in the most primitive stage, was so struck by the effects of the sun on life that he made of it a deity whence sprang all good and evil. Thence came to him light, darkness, warmth and fire, with it were associated all ideas of time: height, distance, movement, size,  and give expression to his feelings. The sun was thus the first thing to which a name was given. It was "ag" (pronounced agh), and from this syllable all words in use today are derived. This, briefly, is the theory about the "sun language," and with the new conception of Turkish history it will be taught in the new Angora school.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In short, based upon a heliocentric view of the origin of civilization and human languages, the theory claimed that the Turkish language was the language which all civilized languages derived from.&lt;ref&gt;Cemal Kafadar (1996.). ''Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State''. [[University of California Press]]. P. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the words provided with false Turkish etymologies through the practice of ''[[:wikt:goropism|goropism]]'' were ''God'', attributed to the Turkish ''kut'' (blessing); ''Bulletin'' from ''belleten'' (to learn by heart); ''Electric'' from [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] ''yaltrık'' (shine).&lt;ref name=LewisTLRbook&gt;{{cite book|first=Geoffrey|last=Lewis|title=The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LewisTLRlecture&gt;{{cite web|first=Geoffrey|last=Lewis|url=http://www.turkishlanguage.co.uk/jarring.htm|title=The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success|series=Swedish Research Institute in Istanbul: The Jarring Lecture|date=11 February 2002|website=http://www.turkishlanguage.co.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann, "it is possible that the Sun Language Theory was adopted by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] in order to legitimize the Arabic and Persian words which the Turkish language authorities did not manage to uproot. This move compensated for the failure to provide a neologism for every foreignism/loanword."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckermann, Ghil’ad (2003), [http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?is=140391723X ‘‘Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew’’], Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, {{ISBN|1-4039-1723-X}}, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1284">A '''tactical event''' (Also known as a "Private Battle" in the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere) is a type of [[historical reenactment]], not usually open to the public,&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 224 "Sometimes they are closed events, in which the public is not invited to observe."&lt;/ref&gt; which is fought like a real battle with each side devising strategies and tactics to defeat their opponent(s). Tactical events have no script, a basic set of agreed-upon rules (physical boundaries, time limit, victory conditions, etc.), and onsite judges or referees,&lt;ref&gt;Hadden. p 23&lt;/ref&gt; and so could be considered a form of [[live action role-playing game]]. Tactical battles might also be considered a form of [[experimental archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hadden. p 23 "By living like the soldiers did, even for just a short time, the reenactors gain better understanding of how to wear the uniform and use the equipment."&lt;/ref&gt;

A purpose that is imposed by a human use, such as that of a fork, is called ''[[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|extrinsic]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Natural teleology, common in [[classical philosophy]] but controversial today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleology-biology/ |last=Allen |first=Colin |title=Teleological Notions in Biology |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2003}}]&lt;/ref&gt; contends that natural entities also have ''intrinsic'' purposes, irrespective of human use or opinion. For instance, Aristotle claimed that an acorn's intrinsic ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' is to become a fully grown oak tree.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' 1050a9–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Though ancient [[atomist]]s rejected the notion of natural teleology, teleological accounts of non-personal or non-human nature were explored and often endorsed in ancient and medieval philosophies, but fell into disfavor during the modern era (1600–1900). In the late 18th century, [[Immanuel Kant]] used the concept of telos as a regulative principle in his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''. Teleology was also fundamental to the speculative philosophy of [[Georg Hegel]].

Contemporary philosophers and scientists are still discussing whether teleological axioms are useful or accurate in proposing modern philosophies and scientific theories. For instance, in 2012, [[Thomas Nagel]] proposed a non-[[Darwinism|Darwinian]] account of [[evolution]] that incorporates impersonal and natural teleological laws to explain the existence of life, [[consciousness]], [[rationality]], and objective value.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Nagel, ''[[Mind and Cosmos]]'', Oxford University Press: 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the accuracy can also be considered independently from the usefulness: it is a common experience in [[pedagogy]] that a minimum of apparent teleology can be useful in thinking about and explaining Darwinian evolution even if there is no true teleology driving evolution. Thus it is easier to say that evolution "gave" wolves sharp [[canine tooth|canine teeth]] because those teeth "serve the purpose of" [[predation]] regardless of whether there is an underlying nonteleologic reality in which evolution is not an actor with intentions. In other words, because human [[cognition]] and [[learning]] often rely on the narrative structure of stories (with actors, goals, and proximal rather than distal causation), some minimal level of teleology might be recognized as useful or at least tolerable for practical purposes even by people who reject its [[cosmology|cosmologic]] accuracy. 

==Etymology==
The word ''teleology'' builds on the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:τέλος|τέλος]], ''telos'' (root: τελε-, "end, purpose")&lt;ref&gt;Eric Partridge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xA9dxrhfa5kC&amp;dq= ''Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English''], Routledge, 1977, p. 4187.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]], ''logia'', "a branch of learning". The German philosopher [[Christian von Wolff]] coined the term (in the Latin form "''teleologia''") in 1728 in his work ''Philosophia rationalis, sive logica''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Historical overview==
In western philosophy, the term and concept of teleology originated in the writings of  [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle's [[Four Causes]] give special place to each thing's telos or "final cause." In this, he followed Plato in seeing purpose in both human and sub-human nature.

===Platonic===
In the ''[[Phaedo]]'', [[Plato]] through [[Socrates]] argues that true explanations for any given physical phenomenon must be teleological. He bemoans those who fail to distinguish between a thing's necessary and sufficient causes, which he identifies respectively as [[Four causes#Material cause|material]] and [[Four causes#Final cause|final]] causes (''Phaedo'' 98–99):

{{quote|Imagine not being able to distinguish the real cause, from that without which the cause would not be able to act, as a cause. It is what the majority appear to do, like people groping in the dark; they call it a cause, thus giving it a name that does not belong to it. That is why one man surrounds the earth with a vortex to make the heavens keep it in place, another makes the air support it like a wide lid. As for their capacity of being in the best place they could be at this very time, this they do not look for, nor do they believe it to have any divine force, but they believe that they will some time discover a stronger and more immortal Atlas to hold everything together more, and they do not believe that the truly good and 'binding' binds and holds them together.|Plato, ''Phaedo'' 99}}

Plato here argues that while the materials that compose a body are necessary conditions for its moving or acting in a certain way, they nevertheless cannot be the ''sufficient'' condition for its moving or acting as it does. For example (given in ''Phaedo'' 98), if Socrates is sitting in an Athenian prison, the elasticity of his tendons is what allows him to be sitting, and so a physical description of his tendons can be listed as ''necessary conditions'' or ''auxiliary causes'' of his act of sitting (''[[Phaedo]]'' 99b; ''[[Timaenus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 46c9–d4, 69e6). However, these are only necessary conditions of Socrates' sitting. To give a physical description of Socrates' body is to say ''that'' Socrates is sitting, but it does not give us any idea why ''it came to be'' that he was sitting in the first place. To say why he was sitting and not ''not'' sitting, we have to explain what it is about his sitting that is ''good'', for all things brought about (i.e., all products of actions) are brought about because the actor saw some good in them. Thus, to give an explanation of something is to determine what about it is good. Its goodness is its ''actual cause''—its purpose, ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' or "reason for which" (''Timaeus'' 27d8–29a).

===Aristotelian===
[[Aristotle]] argued that [[Democritus]] was wrong to attempt to reduce all things to mere necessity, because doing so neglects the aim, order, and "final cause", which brings about these necessary conditions:

{{quote|[[Democritus]], however, neglecting the final cause, reduces to necessity all the operations of nature. Now, they are necessary, it is true, but yet they are for a final cause and for the sake of what is best in each case. Thus nothing prevents the teeth from being formed and being shed in this way; but it is not on account of these causes but on account of the end....|Aristotle, ''[[Generation of Animals]]'' V.8, 789a8–b15}}

In the ''Physics'' Aristotle rejected Plato's assumption that the universe was created by an intelligent designer using eternal [[Platonic form|forms]] as his model. For Aristotle, natural ends are produced by "natures" (principles of change internal to living things), and natures, Aristotle argued, do not deliberate: 
{{quote|"It is absurd to suppose that ends are not present [in nature] because we do not see an agent deliberating." |Aristotle, ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 2.8, 199b27-9;&lt;ref name="AristotleOrganon&amp;c2.8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=The Organon and Other Works| editor=| publisher= Opensource collection. Translated under the editorship of W.D. Ross. Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org)| location= |page=649 in text. n647 in page field| url=https://archive.org/details/AristotleOrganon|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also ''Physics'' 2.5–6 where "natures" are contrasted with intelligence&lt;ref name="AristotleOrganon&amp;c2.5-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=The Organon and Other Works| editor=| publisher= | location= |pages=640–644 in text. n639–643 in page field| url=https://archive.org/details/AristotleOrganon|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These Platonic and Aristotelian arguments ran counter to those presented earlier by [[Democritus]] and later by [[Lucretius]], both of whom were supporters of what is now often called [[Accidentalism (philosophy)|accidentalism]]:

{{quote|Nothing in the body is made in order that we may use it. What happens to exist is the cause of its use.|Lucretius, ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (On the Nature of Things), IV, 833; cf. 822–56.}}

==Disfavor==
Since the ''[[Novum Organum]]'' of [[Francis Bacon]], teleological explanations in physical science tend to be deliberately avoided in favor of focus on material and efficient explanations. Final and formal causation came to be viewed as false or too subjective.&lt;ref name="aristotle"&gt;"The received intellectual tradition has it that, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, revolutionary philosophers began to curtail and reject the teleology of the medieval and scholastic Aristotelians, abandoning final causes in favor of a purely mechanistic model of the Universe." {{Citation|last=Ransom Johnson|first=Monte|title=Aristotle on Teleology|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008}} pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, some disciplines, in particular within evolutionary biology, continue to use language that appears teleological when they describe natural tendencies towards certain end conditions; although some argue that these arguments ought to be, and practicably can be, rephrased in non-teleological forms, others hold that teleological language cannot always be ''easily'' expunged from descriptions in the life sciences, at least within the bounds of practical [[pedagogy]]. This is [[#Biology|discussed further below]].

==Economics==
A teleology of human aims played a crucial role in the work of [[Ludwig von Mises]] especially in the development of his science of [[praxeology]]. More specifically he believed that human action, i.e. purposeful behavior, is teleological based on the presupposition that an individual's action is governed or caused by the existence of their chosen ends. Or in other words an individual selects what they believe to be the most appropriate means to achieve a sought after goal or end. Mises however also stressed that teleology with respect to human action was by no means independent of causality as he states "no action can be devised and ventured upon without definite ideas about the relation of cause and effect, teleology presupposes causality"&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/library/ultimate-foundation-economic-science&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern and postmodern philosophy==
Historically, teleology may be identified with the philosophical tradition of [[Aristotelianism]]. The rationale of teleology was explored by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his Critique of Judgement and, again, made central to speculative philosophy by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and in the various neo-Hegelian schools{{snd}} proposing a history of our species some consider to be at variance with [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], as well as with the [[dialectical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], and with what is now called [[analytic philosophy]]{{snd}} the point of departure is not so much formal logic and scientific fact but 'identity'. (In [[Hegelianism|Hegel's]] terminology: 'objective spirit'.)

Individual human [[consciousness]], in the process of reaching for autonomy and freedom, has no choice but to deal with an obvious reality: the collective identities (such as the multiplicity of world views, ethnic, cultural and national identities) that divide the human race and set (and always have set) different groups in violent conflict with each other. Hegel conceived of the 'totality' of mutually antagonistic world-views and life-forms in history as being 'goal-driven', that is, oriented towards an end-point in history. The 'objective contradiction' of 'subject' and 'object' would eventually 'sublate' into a form of life that leaves violent conflict behind. This goal-oriented, 'teleological' notion of the 'historical process as a whole' is present in a variety of 20th-century authors, although its prominence declined drastically after the [[Second World War]].

In contrast, teleological based "[[grand narrative]]s" are eschewed by the [[postmodern]] attitude&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[The Postmodern Condition|''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'']] (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and teleology may be viewed as reductive, exclusionary and harmful to those whose stories are diminished or overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Lochhead, Judy (2000). ''Postmodern Music/Postmodern Thought'', p. 6. ({{ISBN|0-8153-3820-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this postmodern position, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has argued that a narrative understanding of oneself, of one's capacity as an independent reasoner, one's dependence on others and on the social practices and traditions in which one participates, all tend towards an ultimate good of liberation. Social practices may themselves be understood as teleologically oriented to internal goods, for example practices of philosophical and scientific inquiry are teleologically ordered to the elaboration of a true understanding of their objects. MacIntyre's book ''[[After Virtue]]'' famously dismissed the naturalistic teleology of Aristotle's 'metaphysical biology', but he has cautiously moved from that book's account of a sociological teleology toward an exploration of what remains valid in a more traditional teleological naturalism.

==Ethics==
Teleology informs the study of [[ethic]]s.

===Business ethics===
{{Main article|Business ethics}}
Business people commonly think in terms of purposeful action as in, for example, [[management by objectives]]. Teleological analysis of business ethics leads to consideration of the full range of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s in any business decision, including the management, the staff, the customers, the shareholders, the country, humanity and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Business &amp; Professional Ethics for Directors, Executives &amp; Accountants |author=Leonard J. Brooks, Paul Dunn |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9x5Yj3nApN4C&amp;pg=PT169 |page=149 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-324-59455-3 |date=2009-03-31 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical ethics===
{{Main article|Medical ethics}}
Teleology provides a moral basis for the professional ethics of medicine, as physicians are generally concerned with outcomes and must therefore know the ''telos'' of a given treatment paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-5a0nza21ZMC&amp;pg=PA78 |title=Methods in medical ethics |author=Jeremy Sugarman, Daniel P. Sulmasy |page=78 |publisher=Georgetown University Press |isbn=978-0-87840-873-3 |year=2001 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequentialism===
{{Main article|Consequentialism}}

The broad spectrum of consequentialist ethics, of which [[utilitarianism]] is a well-known example, focuses on the end result or consequences, with such principles as [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]]'s "the greatest good for the greatest number", or the Principle of Utility. Hence, this principle is teleological, but in a broader sense than is elsewhere understood in philosophy. In the classical notion, teleology is grounded in the inherent natures of things themselves, whereas in consequentialism, teleology is imposed on nature from outside by the human will. Consequentialist theories justify inherently what most people would call evil acts by their desirable outcomes, if the good of the outcome outweighs the bad of the act. So, for example, a consequentialist theory would say it was acceptable to kill one person in order to save two or more other people. These theories may be summarized by the maxim "the ends can justify the means."

Consequentialism stands in contrast to the more classical notions of [[deontological ethics]], such as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[Categorical Imperative]], and [[Aristotle]]'s [[virtue ethics]] (although formulations of virtue ethics are also often consequentialist in derivation). In deontological ethics, the goodness or badness of individual acts is primary and a desirable larger goal is insufficient to justify bad acts committed on the way to that goal, even if the bad acts are relatively minor and the goal is major (like telling a small lie to prevent a war and save millions of lives). In requiring all constituent acts to be good, deontological ethics is much more rigid than consequentialism, which varies by circumstances.

Practical ethics are usually a mix of the two.  For example, Mill also relies on deontic maxims to guide practical behavior, but they must be justifiable by the principle of utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Liberty_and_Other_Essays.html?id=m6cQfXCETnIC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=John Stuart Mill On Liberty And Other Essays |author=John Gray, Ed. |page=ix |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-283384-7 |year=1998 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==
{{See also|Four causes#The four causes in modern science}}

In modern science, explanations that rely on teleology are often, but not always, avoided, either because they are unnecessary or because whether they are true or false is thought to be beyond the ability of human perception and understanding to judge.&lt;ref name="aristotle"/&gt; But using teleology as an explanatory style, in particular within evolutionary biology, is still controversial.&lt;ref name="Hanke2004"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2004 |author=Hanke, David |chapter=Teleology: The explanation that bedevils biology |pages=143–155 |title=Explanations: Styles of explanation in science |editor=John Cornwell |place=Oxford &amp; New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860778-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWpq14vS7WQC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=%22biology+is+sick+%22&amp;q=%22biology%20is%20sick%20%22 |accessdate=18 July 2010 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
{{Main article|Teleology in biology}}

Apparent teleology is a recurring issue in [[evolutionary biology]],&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, M., &amp; Travis, J. (Eds.) (2009). ''Evolution: The First Four Billion Years''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; much to the consternation of some writers.&lt;ref name="Hanke2004"/&gt;

Statements which imply that nature has goals, for example where a species is said to do something "in order to" achieve survival, appear teleological, and therefore invalid. Usually, it is possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they do not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology even if that is not the intention. These issues have recently been discussed by John Reiss.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, John O. (2009) ''Not by Design: Retiring Darwin's Watchmaker''. Berkeley, California: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed| date=September 2011}} He argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of such teleology by rejecting the analogy of natural selection as a [[watchmaker analogy|watchmaker]]; other arguments against this analogy have also been promoted by writers such as [[Richard Dawkins]].&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1987) ''The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design''. New York: W W Norton &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors, like [[James G. Lennox|James Lennox]], have argued that Darwin was a teleologist,&lt;ref&gt;[[James G. Lennox|Lennox, James G.]] (1993). "Darwin was a Teleologist" ''Biology and Philosophy'', 8, 409-21.&lt;/ref&gt; while others like Michael Ghiselin described this claim as a myth promoted by misinterpretations of his discussions and emphasized the distinction between using teleological metaphors and being teleological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00850377 | last1 = Ghiselin | first1 = Michael T. |  year = 1994 | title = Darwin's language may seem teleological, but his thinking is another matter | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/l1324662n645244w/| journal = Biology and Philosophy | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 489–492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist philosopher [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]] has argued that all statements about processes can be trivially translated into teleological statements, and vice versa, but that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of.&lt;ref name="Ayala 1998"&gt;[[Francisco J. Ayala|Ayala, Francisco]] (1998). "Teleological explanations in evolutionary biology." ''Nature's purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Neander]] has argued that the modern concept of biological 'function' is dependent upon selection. So, for example, it is not possible to say that anything that simply winks into existence without going through a process of selection has functions. We decide whether an appendage has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, any talk of functions must be posterior to natural selection and function cannot be defined in the manner advocated by Reiss and Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Neander|Neander, Karen]] (1998). "Functions as Selected Effects: The Conceptual Analyst's Defense," in C. Allen, M. Bekoff &amp; G. Lauder (Eds.), ''Nature's Purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology'' (pp. 313–333). Cambridge, MA; London, UK: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Mayr]] states that "adaptedness... is an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' result rather than an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' goal-seeking."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst W.]] (1992). "The idea of teleology" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 53, 117–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Various commentators view the teleological phrases used in modern evolutionary biology as a type of shorthand. For example, S. H. P. Madrell writes that "the proper but cumbersome way of describing change by evolutionary adaptation [may be] substituted by shorter overtly teleological statements" for the sake of saving space, but that this "should not be taken to imply that evolution proceeds by anything other than from mutations arising by chance, with those that impart an advantage being retained by natural selection."&lt;ref&gt;Madrell SHP (1998) Why are there no insects in the open sea? ''The Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''201''':2461–2464.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. B. S. Haldane]] said, "Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public."&lt;ref&gt;Hull, D., Philosophy of Biological Science, Foundations of Philosophy Series, Prentice&amp;ndash;Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.

Selected-effects accounts, like the one Neander suggests, face objections due to their reliance on etiological accounts, which some fields lack the resources to accommodate. Many such sciences, which study the same traits and behaviors regarded by evolutionary biology, still correctly attribute teleological functions without appeal to selection history. [[Gualtiero Piccinini]] and Corey J. Maley are a proponent of one such account which focuses instead on goal-contribution. With the objective goals of organisms being survival and inclusive fitness, Piccinini and Maley define teleological functions to be “a stable contribution by a trait (or component, activity, property) of organisms belonging to a biological population to an objective goal of those organisms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maley|first=Corey J.|last2=Piccinini|first2=Gualtiero|date=2018-01-18|title=A Unified Mechanistic Account of Teleological Functions for Psychology and Neuroscience|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780199685509.001.0001/oso-9780199685509-chapter-11|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|language=en|doi=10.1093/oso/9780199685509.003.0011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Cybernetics===
[[Julian Bigelow]], [[Arturo Rosenblueth]], and [[Norbert Wiener]] have conceived of [[feedback]] mechanisms as lending a teleology to machinery. Wiener, a mathematician, coined the term '[[cybernetics]]' to denote the study of "teleological mechanisms."&lt;ref&gt;Cybernetics, or control and communication in the animal and machine' (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Cybernetics is the study of the [[communication]] and [[control theory|control]] of regulatory feedback both in living beings and machines, and in combinations of the two. In the cybernetic classification presented in "Behavior, Purpose and Teleology", teleology is feedback controlled purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenblueth |first1=Arturo |last2=Wiener |first2=Norbert |last3=Bigelow |first3=Julian |title=Behavior, Purpose and Teleology |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=21 |date=Jan 1943 |language=|jstor=184878 |doi=10.1086/286788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Conway |first=Patrick |title=Development of volitional competence |publisher=MSS Information Corp |year=1974 |pages=60 |isbn=0-8422-0424-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification system underlying cybernetics was criticized by [[Frank Honywill George]], who cited the need for an external observability to the purposeful behavior in order to establish and validate the goal-seeking behavior. In this view, the purpose of observing and observed systems is respectively distinguished by the system's subjective [[autonomy]] and objective control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=George| first=Frank Honywill |authorlink=Frank Honywill George|author2=Johnson, Les |title=Purposive behavior and teleological explanations |publisher=Gordon and Breach |url=https://www.amazon.com/Purposive-Behaviour-Teleological-Explanations-Cybernetics/dp/2881241107/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1320201377&amp;sr=1-1 |pages=xII |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4358">The '''Temple of the Stars''' is an alleged ancient temple claimed to be situated around [[Glastonbury]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]].

==Origin==
The temple is claimed by some to depict a colossal [[landscape zodiac]], a map of the stars on a gigantic scale, formed by features in the landscape (roads, streams, field boundaries, etc.).  The theory was first put forward in 1934 by [[Katherine Maltwood]], an artist who "discovered" the zodiac in a vision, and held that the "temple" was created by [[Sumer]]ians in about 2700 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Maltwood, K. E. ''A Guide to Glastonbury’s Temple of the Stars: Their Giant Effigies Described From Air Views, Maps, and From "The High History of the Holy Grail"'' (London, The Women’s Printing Society, Ltd., 1934). Her next book on the subject matter, ''Air View Supplement To A Guide To Glastonbury’s Temple of The Stars'' was published in 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea was revived in 1969 by Mary Caine in an article in the magazine ''Gandalf's Garden'' (number 4).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/GGZodiac.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Compared to Maltwood's version, she turned Scorpio upside down, added a monk to Gemini, and altered the outlines of Capricorn, Libra, and Leo.

The temple plays an important role in many [[occult]] theories. It has been associated with the [[Grail legend]], [[Uther Pendragon]], and [[King Arthur]] (according to some legends buried in Glastonbury).

==Criticisms==
The idea was examined by two independent studies, one by Ian Burrow in 1975 &lt;ref&gt;Ian Burrow, Somerset’s Planning Department staff archeologist, concluded that "while the outlines of the effigies may be plotted today, their antiquity is illusory" [http://sites.google.com/site/alisonsinc/maltwood'szodiac]&lt;/ref&gt; and the other in 1983 by Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy,&lt;ref&gt;Tom Williamson, Liz Bellamy, ''Ley Lines In Question'', pages 162-168. (Tadworth, UK: World's Work, 1983). {{ISBN|0-437-19205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the standard methods of landscape historical research.  Both studies concluded that the evidence contradicted the idea.  The eye of Capricorn identified by Maltwood was a haystack. The western wing of the Aquarius phoenix was a road laid in 1782 to run around Glastonbury, and older maps dating back to the 1620s show the road had no predecessors.  The Cancer boat (not a crab as would be expected) is made up of a network of eighteenth century drainage ditches and paths.  There are some [[Neolithic]] paths preserved in the peat of the bog formerly comprising most of the area, but none of the known paths match the lines of the zodiac features.

Glastonbury historian [[Geoffrey Ashe]] commented, "The phenomenon is akin to the [[Rorschach test|Rorschach]] ink-blot test, or to seeing pictures in a fire", and "Zodiac-finders do not themselves agree on these 'obvious figures'. I have studied these photographs; I know what I am meant to see; I honestly try to see, and I simply do not." &lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Ashe, ''Avalonian Quest'' (London: Methuen in association with Fontana Paperbacks, 1982). {{ISBN|0-413-48800-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no support for this theory, or for the existence of the "temple" in any form, from conventional archaeologists or mainstream historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rahtz|first1=Phillip|last2=Watts|first2= Lorna|title=Glastonbury Myth and archaeology|year=2003|publisher=Tempus|location=Stroud|isbn=978-0752425481|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aquitania''' is a luxury, 82-unit [[Housing cooperative|cooperative]] apartment building in the Margate Park neighborhood of the [[Uptown, Chicago|Uptown]] community of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. It is officially designated on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] by The United States Department of the Interior.

The Aquitania, known legally as the 5000 North Marine Drive Corporation, was built by [[Ralph C. Harris]] and [[Byron H. Jillson]] in the [[Classical Revival]] style. Its developer was [[George K. Spoor]], the co-founder of [[Essanay Studios]] and a producer of silent movies during the first two decades of the twentieth century. At that time, Chicago rivaled both [[New York City]] and [[Hollywood]] in film production, and Spoor was able to use his considerable wealth to plan and develop a property, which he felt was befitting the celebrities connected with Chicago's growing entertainment industry.  A legend, which purports that Essanay Studio actors Charlie Chaplain and Gloria Swanson once resided at The Aquitania, is likely unfounded.  This probable factual inaccuracy reflects nothing more than film lore since all silent film production left Chicago's Essanay studios for southern California by 1918 at the very latest, and The Aquitania was not built until 1923, although there are historical accounts of both silent-film era stars staying as guests at The Aquitania when it was a hotel in its earliest days.

When the Aquitania was built, it was situated directly on the Lake Michigan shore; subsequent development of both [[Lake Shore Drive]] and the lakefront park have moved the shore some two blocks east of the building. The fifteen-story building has a courtyard and an [[Art Moderne]] lobby. Construction was completed in 1923, and it became a cooperative in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wibiti.com/HomePageView.aspx?v=v&amp;c=0&amp;HpID=%c2%b3%5eX%e2%80%a0 Real estate Housing profiles The Aquitania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719094859/http://wibiti.com/HomePageView.aspx?v=v&amp;c=0&amp;HpID=%C2%B3%5EX%E2%80%A0 |date=2012-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Arctic Home in the Vedas''''' is a book on the origin of [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryanic People]] by [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], a mathematician turned [[astronomer]], historian, journalist, philosopher and political leader of India. It propounded the idea that the [[North Pole]] was the original home of Aryans during the pre-glacial period which they had to leave due to the ice deluge around [[8th millennium BC|8000 B.C.]] and had to migrate to the Northern parts of Europe and Asia in search of lands for new settlements. In support to his theory, Tilak presented certain [[Vedic]] hymns, [[Avestic]] passages, Vedic chronology and Vedic calendars with interpretations of the contents in detail.

The book was written at the end of 1898, but was first published in March 1903 in [[Pune]].

==Background==
Man was believed to be post-[[glacial]], and the theory of an Asiatic origin of the Aryan peoples prevailed. The age of the oldest Vedic period, however, was carried back to 4500 BC by scholars including the author himself after scientific astronomical research in correlation with the evidence found in the Vedic hymns.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Tilak cites a book by [[William Fairfield Warren|William F. Warren]], the first President of [[Boston University]], ''Paradise Found or the Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole'', as having anticipated his ideas to some extent. Warren dedicated his book to [[Max Müller]], with whom Tilak had shared ideas before the book{{clarify|reason=Tilak's book or Warren's?|date=July 2016}} was completed.

Tilak held the view that further study of Vedic hymns and Avestan passages might reveal the long vista of primitive Aryan antiquity.

==Summary of Tilak’s polar theory==
*[[Neolithic]] Aryan race in Europe cannot be regarded as [[indigenous peoples|autochthonous]], nor European Aryans descended from the [[Paleolithic]] man. Hence, question of the original Aryan home is still unsettled.
*In the early geological ages, the [[Alps]] were low, the [[Himalayas]] not yet upheaved, Asia and Africa were represented only by a group of islands and an equable and uniform climate prevailed over the whole surface of the globe. In those days, however, a warm climate prevailed in the Arctic region.
*The close of the [[Pliocene]] and the whole of the [[Pleistocene]] period were marked by violent changes of climate bringing on what is called the Glacial and Inter-Glacial epochs. A succession of cold and warm climates must have characterized these Glacial and Inter-Glacial periods which were also accompanied by extensive movements of depression and elevation of land, the depression taking place after the land was weighed down with the enormous mass of ice.
*Thus a period of glaciations was marked by elevation, extreme cold and the invasion of the ice-caps over regions of the present Temperate zone; while an inter-glacial period was accompanied by depression of land and milder and congenial climate which made even the Arctic regions habitable.
*According to the latest geological evidence, the last Glacial period must have closed and Post-Glacial must have commenced at about 10,000 years ago or 8,000 BC. There were at least two Glacial and one Inter-Glacial period, and the geographical distribution of land and water on the earth during the Inter-Glacial period was quite different from what it is at present. It was the coming on of the Glacial age that destroyed this genial climate and rendered the regions unsuited for the habitation of tropical plants and animals.
*At the North Pole, one sees the heavenly dome above seems to revolve around one like a [[potter's wheel]]. The stars will not rise and set but move round and round in horizontal planes during the long night of six months. The [[Sun]], when it is above the horizon for six months; would also appear to revolve in the same way but with some difference. The Northern celestial hemisphere will alone be visible spinning round and round and the Southern half remain invisible. The Sun going into the Northern hemisphere in his annual course will appear as coming up from the South. Living in the temperate and tropical zones, however, one sees all heavenly objects rise in the East and set in the West, some passing over the head, others traveling obliquely.
*The long dawn of two months is a special and important characteristic of the North Pole. As we descend southward, the splendor and the duration of the dawn will be witnessed on a less and less magnificent scale. But the dawn occurring at the end of the long night of two, three or more months will still be unusually long, often of several days duration.
*All these characteristics of an Arctic home are clearly recorded in several Vedic hymns and Avestic passages and they come to us sometimes as the description of the prevailing conditions or the day-to-day experience or stories told by the earlier generation and sometimes as [[myths]].

==Chronology of the post-glacial period==
[[File:Lokmanya.jpg|thumb|Tilak in his Study]]
*10,000 to 8000 BC – The destruction of the original Arctic home by the last [[Ice Age]] and the commencement of the post-Glacial period.
*8000 to 5000 BC – The age of migration from the original home. The survivors of the Aryan race roamed over the northern parts of Europe and Asia in search of lands suitable for new settlements. Tilak calls it the ''Pre-Orion Period''.
*5000 to 3000 BC. -  The Orion period, when the vernal equinox was in [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Many Vedic hymns can be traced to the early part of this period and the [[bards]] of the race seem to have not yet forgotten the real importance of the traditions of the Arctic home inherited by them. It was at this time that first attempts to reform the calendar and the [[sacrificial]] system appear to have been systematically made.
*3000 to 1400 BC – The ''[[Krittika]]'' period, when the [[Vernal equinox]] was in [[Pleiades]]. The traditions about the original Arctic home had grown dim by this time and were often misunderstood, making the Vedic hymns less and less intelligible.
*1400 to 500 BC – The Pre-Buddhistic period, when the [[Sūtra|Sutras]] and the Philosophical systems made their appearance.

==Contents==
The book has about 500 pages, containing a Preface by the Author and thirteen chapters.

'''''The Sirius Mystery''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Robert K. G. Temple]] first published by [[St. Martin's Press]] in 1976. Its second, 1998, edition is called '''''The Sirius Mystery: New Scientific Evidence of Alien Contact 5,000 Years Ago'''''.

==Overview==
The book presents the [[hypothesis]] that the [[Dogon people]] of [[Mali]], in west Africa, preserve a tradition of contact with intelligent extraterrestrial beings from the [[Sirius]] star system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These beings, who are hypothesized to have taught the arts of civilization to humans, are claimed in the book to have originated the systems of the [[Pharaoh]]s of [[Egypt]], the [[Greek mythology|mythology of Greek civilization]], and the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], among other things. Temple's theory was heavily based on his interpretation of the work of [[ethnography|ethnographers]] [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Germaine Dieterlen]]. A substantial bulk of ''The Sirius Mystery'' consists of comparative linguistic and mythological scholarship, pointing out resemblances among Dogon, Egyptian and [[Sumer]]ian beliefs and symbols. Greek and Arab myths and words are considered to a lesser extent.

The "mystery" that is central to the book is how the Dogon allegedly acquired knowledge of [[Sirius B]], the [[white dwarf]] companion star of [[Sirius A]], invisible to the naked eye. Temple did not argue that the only way that the Dogon could have obtained what he understood to be accurate information on Sirius B was by contact with an advanced civilization; he considered alternative possibilities, such as a very ancient, advanced, and lost civilization that was behind the sudden appearance of advanced civilization in both [[Egypt]] and [[Sumeria]]. He personally found the theory of alien contact more convincing, but he did not claim certainty about it. [[Noah Brosch]] explained in his book ''Sirius Matters'' that cultural transfer could have taken place between 19th century French astronomers and Dogon tribe members during the observations of the [[Solar eclipse of April 16, 1893|solar eclipse on 16 April 1893]]. The expedition, led by [[Henri Deslandres]], stayed in the field for five weeks and it is reasonable that during this time many contacts with the locals took place, and that relatively modern astronomical knowledge was then transferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brosch|first1=Noah|title=Sirius Matters|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-8319-8|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some doubts have been raised about the reliability of Griaule and Dieterlein's work on which ''The Sirius Mystery'' is based,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ramtops.co.uk/dogon.html| title = The Dogon Revisited| accessdate = 2007-10-13| author = Bernard R.

The claims about the Dogons' astronomical knowledge have been challenged. For instance, the anthropologist Walter Van Beek, who studied the Dogon after Griaule and Dieterlen, found no evidence that the Dogon considered Sirius to be a double star and/or that astronomy was particularly important in their belief system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zc3zw-YgOPkC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=Sirians+Sagan&amp;ei=22u2SfPZKJi8M6LflfEL&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA180,M1 Holberg, Jay B. ''Sirius''] Springer 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-387-48941-4}} p176&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Marcel Griaule's daughter [[Geneviève Calame-Griaule]] and an anthropologist, Luc de Heusch, came to criticize Van Beek's dismissal as "political" and riddled with "unchecked speculation", demonstrating a general ignorance of Dogon esoteric tradition.&lt;ref&gt;

==Reviews of claims==

===Ian Ridpath===
In 1978, Astronomer [[Ian Ridpath]] observed, in an article in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', "The whole Dogon legend of Sirius and its companions is riddled with ambiguities, contradictions, and downright errors, at least if we try to interpret it literally."&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ridpath, {{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/7809/sirius.html |title=''Skeptical Inquirer'' |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030217073018/http://www.csicop.org/si/7809/sirius.html |archivedate=February 17, 2003 |df= }}, Fall 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Ridpath stated that while the information that the Dogon probably gained from Europeans to some extent resembles the facts about Sirius, the presumed original Dogon knowledge on the star is very far from the facts. Ridpath concluded that the information that resembles the facts about Sirius was probably ascertained by way of cultural contamination. More recent research suggests that the contaminator was Griaule himself.&lt;ref name="coppens"/&gt;

===Carl Sagan===
Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] touched upon the issue in his book ''[[Broca's Brain]]'' (1979), seeing problems in Temple's hypothesis. As an example, Sagan believes that because the Dogon seem to have no knowledge of another planet beyond [[Saturn]] which has rings, that their knowledge is therefore more likely to have come from European, and not extraterrestrial, sources.&lt;ref name = cs-bb-1979&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Oberg===
Journalist and skeptic [[James Oberg]] collected claims that have appeared concerning Dogon mythology in his 1982 book.&lt;ref&gt;James Oberg, "[http://www.debunker.com/texts/dogon.html Chapter 6, The Sirius Mystery]", in ''UFOs and Outer Space Mysteries'', (1982) Donning Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to Oberg, the Dogons' astronomical information resembles the knowledge and speculations of European astronomical knowledge of the late 1920s. The Dogon may have acquired their astronomical knowledge, including the information on Sirius, from European visitors before their mythology was recorded in the 1930s. Oberg also points out that the Dogon were not an isolated tribe, and thus it was not even necessary for outsiders to inform the Dogon about Sirius B. They could very well have acquired such knowledge abroad, passing it on to their tribe later. Sirius B was first observed in 1862, and had been predicted in 1844 on dynamic grounds. However, Oberg does concede that such assumptions of recent acquisition are "entirely circumstantial" and have no foundation in documented evidence.

===Jason Colavito===
The skeptic [[Jason Colavito]] counts ''The Sirius Mystery'' among the body of works in a tradition of ancient astronaut ideas that was ultimately inspired by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]] in his 2005 book ''[[The Cult of Alien Gods|The Cult of Alien Gods: H. P. Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture]]''.

==Unproven claims==
One unproven aspect of the reported Dogon knowledge of the Sirius system is the assertion that the Dogon knew of another star in the Sirius system, Emme Ya, or "larger than Sirius B but lighter and dim in magnitude." A dynamical study published in 1995, based on anomalous perturbations of Sirius B (suggestive of the star being gravitationally influenced by another body) concluded that the presence of a third star orbiting Sirius could not be ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1995A&amp;A...299..621B |title=Is Sirius a triple star? |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics  |volume=299 |pages=621–628}}&lt;/ref&gt; An apparent "third star" observed in the 1920s is now confirmed as a background object,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{Blockquote|Benest and Duvent found that stable orbits with a period of up to six years exist around Sirius A. There are no stable orbits around the less massive Sirius B which exceed three years. Therefore, if Sirius C exists, it must orbit Sirius A. It is also possible to conclude that such a star could in no way be responsible for the flurry of sightings from the 1920s, it would be too faint and too close to Sirius A to have ever been seen by visual observers.&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Holberg: "Sirius: brightest diamond in the night sky". 2007. pp168&lt;/ref&gt;|J.B. Holberg}}

The former study also concluded that while a triple system for Sirius could not be fully eliminated, the probability was low.

Temple's book and the debates that followed its release publicized the existence of the Dogon tribe among many [[New Age]] followers and proponents of [[ancient astronaut]] theories. Speculation about the Dogon on numerous websites is now mingled with fact, leading to wide misunderstanding among the public about Dogon mythology. Temple, however, has stated in the reprint of ''The Sirius Mystery'' (1999) that he in no way supports what he refers to as "sinister cults" that have been inspired by his book.&lt;ref name = rkgt-tsm-1976&gt;{{Cite book

The '''theory of Phoenician discovery of the Americas''' suggests that the earliest [[Old World]] [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact|contact]] with the [[Americas]] was not with [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] or [[Norse colonization of North America|Norse settlers]], but with the [[Phoenicians]] (or, alternatively, other [[Semitic peoples]]) in the [[first millennium BC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tellier|first=Luc-Normand|title=Urban World History: An Economic and Geographical Perspective|year=2009|publisher=PUQ|page=301|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=PA301|isbn=9782760522091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the 20th century==
This theory of a Phoenician discovery of the Americas was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{citation needed|reason=No documentation proving so|date=November 2014}} In the late 18th century, a number of people speculated on the origins of the [[petroglyphs]] on [[Dighton Rock]]. [[Ezra Stiles]], then President of [[Yale College]], believed them to be Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manuel|first=Frank Edward|last2=Manuel|first2=Fritzie Prigohzy|title=James Bowdoin And The Patriot Philosophers|year=2003|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|pages=197–198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZaY5Vxx0qIC&amp;pg=PA197|isbn=9780871692474}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Court de Gébelin]], who initiated the modern usage of the [[Tarot]], argued in ''Le Monde primitif'' that they commemorated an ancient visit to the Massachusetts shore by a group of sailors from [[Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Southwick|first=Albert B.|title=Mystery of Dighton Rock|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20130110/NEWS/101109827/1020|accessdate=29 January 2013|newspaper=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]]|date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, belief in an [[House of Joseph (LDS Church)|Israelite visit to the Americas]] became a part of [[Mormonism]]. [[Ross T. Christensen]] has propounded the theory that the [[Mulekites]] in the [[Book of Mormon]] were "largely Phoenician in their ethnic origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christensen|first=Ross T|author-link=Ross T. Christensen|title=The Phoenicians and the Ancient Civilizations of America|url=http://www.ancientamerica.org/library/media/HTML/1ofnf5kk/15.%20THE%20PHOENICIANS%20AND%20THE%20ANCIENT%20CIVILIZATIONS%20OF%20AMERICA.htm?n=0|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1871 book ''Ancient America'', [[John Denison Baldwin]] said
&lt;blockquote&gt;The known enterprise of the Phoenician race, and this ancient knowledge of America, so variously expressed, strongly encourage the hypothesis that the people called Phoenicians came to this continent, established colonies in the region where ruined cities are found, and filled it with civilized life. It is argued that they made voyages on the “great exterior ocean,” and that such navigators must have crossed the Atlantic; and it is added that symbolic devices similar to those of the Phoenicians are found in the American ruins, and that an old tradition of the native Mexicans and Central Americans described the first civilizers as “bearded white men,” who “came from the East in ships.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baldwin|first=John D|author-link=John Denison Baldwin|title=The Phoenician Theory|url=http://www.djmcadam.com/phoenician-theory.html|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1870s, a stone inscription was allegedly discovered in [[Paraíba]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;The "Paraiba inscription" made the pages of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', 10 June 1968 with commentary by [[Cyrus H. Gordon]].&lt;/ref&gt; A transcription was shown to [[Ladislau de Souza Mello Netto]], director of the [[National Museum of Brazil]]. Netto accepted the inscription as genuine, but when it was later stated to be a hoax, Netto backed down and blamed foreigners for its fabrication. In the 1960s, [[Cyrus H. Gordon]] believed the inscription to be genuine and created a translation which begins, "We are Sidonian Canaanites from the city of the Mercantile King ..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cyrus H. Gordon|Gordon, Cyrus H.]], "The Canaanite Text from Brazil," ''Orientalia'', No. 37, 1968, pp. 425-436.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription's letter forms are variations that individually occurred and disappeared over a span of 800 years and so the confluence in a single piece of writing verifies the inscription as a hoax.&lt;ref name="Lemche1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lemche|first=Niels Peter|title=The Israelites in History and Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIoY7PagAOAC&amp;pg=PA181|accessdate=10 May 2014|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664227272|pages=181–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stiebing1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stiebing|first=William H.|title=Ancient Astronauts, Cosmic Collisions and Other Popular Theories about Man's Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJZYRmCQTUEC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=10 May 2014|year=1984|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=9781615926978|pages=143–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century theories==
[[File:Bat Creek Inscription 1890 Lithograph Figure 7 Inverted.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Lithograph of the [[Bat Creek inscription]], which [[Cyrus H. Gordon]] believed to be [[Paleo-Hebrew]].]]
In the 20th century, adherents have included [[Cyrus H. Gordon]], [[John Philip Cohane]], [[Ross T. Christensen]], [[Barry Fell]] and [[Mark McMenamin]]. Gordon believed that ancient Hebrew inscriptions had been found at two sites in the southeastern United States, indicating that Jews had arrived there before [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]. One of these supposed finds was the [[Bat Creek inscription]], which Gordon believed to be [[Paleo-Hebrew]], but is generally thought to be a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ramtops.co.uk/bat1.html Robert C. Mainfort, Jr., and Mary L. Kwas, "The Bat Creek Stone: Judeans In Tennessee?"

In 1996, [[Mark McMenamin]] proposed a theory that Phoenician sailors discovered the New World c. 350 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McMenamin Offers New Evidence for Controversi al Theory|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/990108/mcman.html|publisher=College Street Journal|accessdate=29 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301003714/https://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/990108/mcman.html|archivedate=1 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Phoenicia]]n state of [[Carthage]] minted gold [[stater]]s in 350 BC bearing a pattern, in the reverse [[exergue]] of the coins, which McMenamin interpreted as a map of the Mediterranean with the Americas shown to the west across the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark McMenamin|McMenamin, M.

Various theories of Phoenicians/Canaanites/Carthaginians in the New World were discussed with the evidence's being reviewed and dismissed by [[Marshall McKusick]] in ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', 1979;&lt;ref&gt;McCusick, "Canaanites in America" A New Scripture in Stone?" ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' 42.3 (Summer 1979), pp137ff.&lt;/ref&gt; he observed "in this modern day everyone wishes to be his own authority, and the personal search for cultural alternatives seems to make every idea or theory equal in value."

==21st century theories==
[[Lucio Russo]] has speculated about a probable arrival of [[Phoenicians]] in the Americas in his philologic analyses of [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Geography_(Ptolemy)|Geography]] given in [[L'America dimenticata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lucio Russo |title=L'America dimenticata: I rapporti tra civiltà e un errore di Tolomeo |date=2013 |publisher=Mondadory Education s.p.a |place=Milano |isbn=8861843204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book Ptolemy gives the coordinates of the [[Fortunate Isles]] but at the same time he shrinks the size of the world by one third compared to the size measured by [[Eratosthenes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valerio|first=Vladimiro|title=Spunti e Osservazioni dal Libro di Lucio Russo ''L’America Dimenticata. I Rapporti tra le Civiltà e un Errore di Tolomeo''|journal=Geostorie: Bollettino e Notizario|volume=XXI|pages=75—113|url=https://www.academia.edu/7275122/Spunti_e_osservazioni_dal_libro_di_Lucio_Russo_L_America_dimenticata._I_rapporti_tra_le_civilt%C3%A0_e_un_errore_di_Tolomeo_-_Suggestions_and_comments_from_the_book_of_Lucio_Russo_L_America_dimenticata._I_rapporti_tra_le_civilt%C3%A0_e_un_errore_di_Tolomeo}}(in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Russo observes that by attributing those coordinates to the [[Antilles]], the world gets back to the right size, the geographical description given by Ptolemy fits much better and certain puzzling deformations in [[Ptolemy's world map]] disappear. Russo argues that the Antilles coordinates must have been known to Ptolemy's source, which was [[Hipparchus]]. Hipparchus lived in [[Rhodes]] and may have gotten this information from Phoenicians sailors, since they had full control of the western [[Mediterranean]] in those times.

==Scholarly assessment==
Glenn Markoe says that it will "probably never be known" whether the Phoenicians ever reached the Americas. He remarks,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Proof in the form of an inscription, like the celebrated Phoenician text allegedly found in Paraíba in northern Brazil, remains unlikely. The latter, which recounts the landing of a storm-driven party from Sidon, has long been recognized as a clever forgery. If such a fateful expedition had actually occurred, the proof is more likely to be found in a handful of Phoenician pottery shards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markoe|first=Glenn|title=Phoenicians|year=2000|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smPZ-ou74EwC&amp;pg=PA13|isbn=9780520226142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ronald H. Fritze]] discusses the history of such claims from the 17th to the 20th centuries, concluding that although technically possible:

&lt;blockquote&gt;no archaeological evidence has yet been discovered to prove the contentions of Irwin, Gordon, Bailey, Fell and others. Since even the fleeting Norse presence in Vinland left definite archaeological remains at L’Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, it seems logical that the allegedly more extensive Phoenician and Carthaginian presence would have left similar evidence. The absence of such remains is strong circumstantial evidence that the Phoenicians and Carthaginians never reached the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald H. Fritze|Fritze, Ronald H]]. (2009).

'''Turn of the century''', in its broadest sense, refers to the transition from one [[century]] to another. The term is most often used to indicate a distinctive time period either before or after the beginning of a century or both before and after.

Where no specific century is stated, the term usually refers to the most recent transition of centuries.{{citation needed|date=July 2017|reason=In my experience, even in 21st century writing, this phrase always refers to the end of the 19th century.}}

In [[British English]] the phrase the 'turn of the nineteenth century' refers to the years immediately preceding and immediately following 1801, the 'turn of the twentieth century' to the years surrounding 1901, and so on.

In [[American English]] it is not so clear cut.  According to the ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'' online Q&amp;A, there is no common agreement as to the meaning of the phrase "turn of the ''n''-th century." For instance, if a statement describes an event as taking place "at the turn of the 18th century," it could refer to a period around the year 1701 or around 1800, that is, the beginning or end of that century. As such, they recommend using only "turn of the century," and only in a context that makes clear which transition is meant.&lt;ref name="Chicagoan.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/CMS_FAQ/Numbers/Numbers17.html |title=Chicago Style Q&amp;A: Numbers |publisher=The Chicago Manual of Style Online |date= |access-date=11 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519091823/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/CMS_FAQ/Numbers/Numbers17.html |archive-date=2011-05-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Turn of the century" commonly meant the transition from the 19th century to the 20th century; however, as the generations living at the end of the 20th century survived into the 21st century, the specific number of the referenced century became necessary to avoid confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salas |first1=E |date= 1 June 2008|title=At the turn of the 21st century: reflections on our science. |journal=[[Human Factors (journal)|Human Factors]] |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=351–353 |doi=10.1518/001872008x288402 |pmid=18689036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veritism''' was a socio-philosophical [[ideology]] promoted by the "Veritism Foundation" (apparently now defunct). It advocates that man has been presented with no conclusive evidence lending credence to the existence of a specific [[deity]], or supreme entity and thus has no justification for reaching any kind of conclusions on the nature of such a being other than that (as represented by humanity's current state) it is a benign force.

==Basic Propositions==

===On History===
Veritism proposes that man has been engaged in an unfruitful search for truth since his creation.
Veritism also emphasizes that some, not having found truth, or lacking direction in their own lives, have rejected the existence of [[absolute truth]], thus embracing [[atheistic]], [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] ideologies.
History is a crucial aspect in Veritism, as most of Veritistic theory rests upon the conclusion that truth must be revealed unto humanity by an external means. The past lends credence to this conclusion, as throughout human history multiple theories and ideologies have been discarded. Essentially, philosophy is a dynamic subject, constantly in a state of change: conclusions are eternally tested, challenged, and discarded, only to be quickly and efficiently replaced by those seemingly more plausible.

===On Ultimate Truth===
Veritism suggests that humanity may only theorize upon non-observable studies. Man can draw conclusions concerning solid, physical sciences such as mathematics or chemistry. But he cannot claim he has undeniably and irrefutably answered questions relative to philosophy. Thus the only logical [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] concerning [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] philosophical truth is that it simply does not exist. Yet many discard this statement, saying that it denies its own antecedent (one claims an absolute when he denies the existence of absolute truth). Yet upon examination of this particular antecedent we find that it is specific to a certain kind of truth, and thus claims only that truths asserted from a certain medium cannot be conclusive. As an example, any type of personal [[revelation]] or "vision" cannot be deemed as legitimate, as there is ultimately no way to prove that it was of divine cause or of personal accord. In Veritism the question becomes "what is the nature of truths presented?", "what is their claim?" and "is that claim plausible?"

===On Religion===
Veritism dismisses [[organized religion]] or any claim to ultimate truth as ignorant and without grounds.

===On Reality===
A veritistic view of reality is rather basic. That which can be perceived by the five senses is that which exists.

===On Ethics===
Veritistic [[ethics]] would advocate that humans have an inherent view of that which is right or wrong. This is demonstrated in law and government. The only humans lacking any type of self [[morals]] or ethical inclination are those with a mental or psychological dysfunction. Veritism consequently suggests that there are numerous cultural factors which influence behavior concerning ethics, sometimes in a negative way.
Veritistic thinking also attributes action to negative consequence. Some may subscribe to a religion simply because they fear a negative [[afterlife]]. Those who are truly moral, ethical people are those who do good with no ultimate reward, simply because it is the right thing to do.

'''World history''' or '''global history''' (not to be confused with [[diplomatic history|diplomatic]], [[transnational history|transnational]] or international history) is a field of [[historiography|historical study]] that emerged as a distinct academic field in the 1980s. It examines [[history]] from a global perspective. It is not to be confused with [[comparative history]], which, like world history, deals with the history of multiple cultures and nations, but does not do so on a global scale.  World history looks for common [[pattern]]s that emerge across all cultures. World historians use a [[theme (literature)|thematic]] approach, with two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]] (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together) and difference (how [[pattern]]s of world history reveal the diversity of the human experiences).&lt;ref&gt;J. Laurence Hare, and Jack Wells, "Promising the World: Surveys, Curricula, and the Challenge of Global History," ''History Teacher,'' 48 (Feb. 2015) pp: 371-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and parameters of the field==

Jerry H. Bentley has observed that 'the term ''world history'' has never been a clear signifier with a stable referent', and that usage of the term overlaps with [[universal history]], [[comparative history]], [[global history]], [[big history]], [[macro history]], and [[transnational history]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of world history as a distinct academic field of study can be traced to the 1960s, but the pace quickened in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gran2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Gran|title=The Rise of the Rich: A New View of Modern World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOv-dewXZi4C|accessdate=25 May 2012|date=28 February 2009|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-3171-2|page=XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key step was the creation of the World History Association and graduate programs at a handful of universities. Over the next decades scholarly publications, professional and academic organizations, and graduate programs in World History proliferated. World History has often displaced Western Civilization in the required curriculum of American high schools and universities, and is supported by new textbooks with a world history approach.

World History attempts to recognise and address two structures that have profoundly shaped professional history-writing:
# A tendency to use current [[nation-states]] to the set the boundaries and agendas of studies of the past.
# A deep legacy of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] assumptions (found especially, but not only, in Western history-writing).
Thus World History tends to study networks, connections, and systems that cross traditional boundaries of historical study like linguistic, cultural, and national borders. World History is often concerned to explore social dynamics that have led to large-scale changes in human society, such as [[industrialisation]] and the spread of [[capitalism]], and to analyse how large-scale changes like these have affected different parts of the world. Like other branches of history-writing in the second half of the twentieth century, World History has a scope far beyond historians' traditional focus on politics, wars, and diplomacy, taking in a panoply of subjects like [[gender history]], [[social history]], [[cultural history]], and [[environmental history]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H.

==History==

===Pre-modern===
The study of world history, as distinct from national history, has existed in many world cultures. However, early forms of world history were not truly global, and were limited to only the regions known by the historian.

In [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], Chinese world history, that of China and the surrounding people of [[East Asia]], was based on the [[dynastic cycle]] articulated by [[Sima Qian]] in circa 100 BC. Sima Qian's model is based on the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. Rulers rise when they united China, then are overthrown when a ruling dynasty became corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Sima Qian, ''Records of the Grand Historian: Qin Dynasty'' (3rd ed. 1995) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0231081693 excerpt and text search]; Burton Watson, ''Ssu-ma Ch'ien: Grand Historian of China'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Each new dynasty begins virtuous and strong, but then decays, provoking the transfer of Heaven's mandate to a new ruler. The test of virtue in a new dynasty is success in being obeyed by China and neighboring barbarians. After 2000 years Sima Qian's model still dominates scholarship, although the [[dynastic cycle]] is no longer used for modern Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;S. Y. Teng, "Chinese Historiography in the Last Fifty Years," ''The Far Eastern Quarterly,'' Vol. 8, No. 2 (Feb., 1949), pp. 131–156 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2049138 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), as founder of Greek historiography,&lt;ref&gt;K.H. Waters, ''Herodotus the Historian'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; presents insightful and lively discussions of the customs, geography, and history of Mediterranean peoples, particularly the Egyptians. However, his great rival [[Thucydides]] promptly discarded Herodotus's all-embracing approach to history, offering instead a more precise, sharply focused monograph, dealing not with vast empires over the centuries but with 27 years of war between Athens and Sparta. In Rome, the vast, patriotic history of Rome by Livy (59 BC-17 AD) approximated Herodotean inclusiveness;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick G. Walsh, ''Livy: His Historical Aims and Methods'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Polybius (c.200-c.118 BC) aspired to combine the logical rigor of Thucydides with the scope of Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Frank W. Walbank, ''A Historical Commentary on Polybius,'' (3 vols. 1957–82)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Asia, [[The Secret History of Mongols]] is regarded as the single significant native Mongolian account of Genghis Khan. The Secret History is regarded as a piece of classic literature in both Mongolia and the rest of the world.

In the Middle East, [[Ala'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni]] (1226–1283) was a Persian historian who wrote an account of the Mongol Empire entitled Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā (History of the World Conqueror).&lt;ref&gt;History of the World Conqueror by Ala Ad Din Ata Malik Juvaini, translated by John Andrew Boyle, Harvard University Press 1958, Project Gutenberg on line edition&lt;/ref&gt; The standard edition of Juvayni is published under the title Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā, ed. Mirza Muhammad Qazwini, 3 vol, Gibb Memorial Series 16 (Leiden and London, 1912–37). An English translation by John Andrew Boyle "The History of the World-Conqueror" was republished in 1997.

[[Rashīd al-Dīn Fadhl-allāh Hamadānī]] (1247–1318), was a Persian physician of Jewish origin, polymathic writer and historian, who wrote an enormous Islamic history, the Jami al-Tawarikh, in the Persian language, often considered a landmark in intercultural historiography and a key document on the Ilkhanids (13th and 14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, H. M. (Henry Miers), Sir; John Dowson. "10. Jámi'u-t Tawáríkh, of Rashid-al-Din". [[The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians]]. The Muhammadan Period (Vol 3.). London : Trübner &amp; Co.. https://archive.org/stream/cu31924073036737#page/n15/mode/2up.&lt;/ref&gt; His encyclopedic knowledge of a wide range of cultures from Mongolia to China to the Steppes of Central Eurasia to Persia, the Arabic-speaking lands, and Europe, provide the most direct access to information on the late Mongol era. His descriptions also highlight the manner in which the Mongol Empire and its emphasis on trade resulted in an atmosphere of cultural and religious exchange and intellectual ferment, resulting in the transmission of a host of ideas from East to West and vice versa.

One Muslim scholar, [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1409) broke with traditionalism and offered a model of historical change in ''Muqaddimah,'' an exposition of the methodology of scientific history. Ibn Khaldun focused on the reasons for the rise and fall of civilization, arguing that the causes of change are to be sought in the economic and social structure of society. His work was largely ignored in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'' ed. by N. J. Dawood, Bruce Lawrence, and Franz Rosenthal (2004) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691120544 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise the Muslim, Chinese and Indian intellectuals held fast to a religious traditionalism, leaving them unprepared to advise national leaders on how to confront the European intrusion into Asia after 1500 AD.

===Early modern===
During the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, history was written about states or nations. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that he considered important, rather than describing events in chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called ''philosophia historiae'' anymore, but merely history (''historia'').Voltaire, in the 18th century, attempted to revolutionize the study of world history. First, Voltaire concluded that the traditional study of history was flawed. The Christian Church, one of the most powerful entities in his time, had presented a framework for studying history. Voltaire, when writing ''History of Charles XII'' (1731) and ''The Age of Louis XIV'' (1751), instead choose to focus economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/voltaire-9520178|title=Voltaire|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects of history were mostly unexplored by his contemporaries and would each develop into their own sections of world history. Above all else, Voltaire regarded truth as the most essential part of recording world history. Nationalism and religion only subtracted from objective truth, so Voltaire freed himself for their influence when he recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Shank|first=J.B.|title=Voltaire|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/voltaire/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) in Italy wrote ''Scienza nuva seconda'' (The New Science) in 1725, which argued history as the expression of human will and deeds.  He thought that men are historical entities and that human nature changes over time. Each epoch should be seen as a whole in which all aspects of culture—art, religion, philosophy, politics, and economics—are interrelated (a point developed later by [[Oswald Spengler]]). Vico showed that myth, poetry, and art are entry points to discovering the true spirit of a culture. Vico outlined a conception of historical development in which great cultures, like Rome, undergo cycles of growth and decline.  His ideas were out of fashion during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], but influenced the Romantic historians after 1800.

A major theoretical foundation for world history was given by German philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], who saw the modern Prussian state as the latest (though often confused with the highest) stage of world development.

G.W.F. Hegel developed three lenses through which he believed world history could be viewed. Documents produced during a historical period, such as journal entries and contractual agreements, were considered by Hegel to be part of Original History. These documents are produced by a person enveloped within a culture, making them conduits of vital information but also limited in their contextual knowledge. Documents which pertain to Hegel’s Original History are classified by modern historians as primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Little|first=Daniel|title=Philosophy of History|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/history/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflective History, Hegel’s second lens, are documents written with some temporal distance separating the event which is discussed in the academic writing. What limited this lens, according to Hegel, was the imposition of the writers own cultural values and views on the historical event. This criticism of Reflective History was later formalized by Anthropologists Franz Boa and coined as Cultural relativism by Alain Locke. Both of these lenses were considered to be partially flawed by Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Soul and the Body in Hegel's Anthropology|last=Nicholas|first=Mowad|publisher=Loyola University Chicago|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel termed the lens which he advocated to view world history through as Philosophical History.  In order to view history through this lens, one must analyze events, civilizations, and periods objectively. When done in this fashion, the historian can then extract the prevailing theme from their studies. This lens differs from the rest because it is void of any cultural biases and takes a more analytical approach to history. World History can be a broad topic, so focusing on extracting the most valuable information from certain periods may be the most beneficial approach. This third lens, as did Hegel’s definitions of the other two, affected the study of history in the early modern period and our contemporary period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=David|title=Hegel and the Idea of Philosophical History|jstor=27744789|journal=History of Philosophy Quarterly|volume=15|issue=3|pages=369–388|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early modern historian was Adam Ferguson. Ferguson’s main contribution to the study of world history was his ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Adam. ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society. (1767).''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ferguson, world history was a combination of two forms of history. One was natural history; the aspects of our world which god created. The other, which was more revolutionary, was social history. For him, social history was the progress humans made towards fulfilling God’s plan for humanity. He believed that progress, which could be achieved through individuals pursuing commercial success, would bring us closer to a perfect society; but we would never reach one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TEE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF ADAM FERGUSON A COMMENTARY CN HIS ESSAY CK THE HISTORY OF CIVIL SOCIETY|last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|publisher=The University of Chicago|year=1969|isbn=|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also theorized that a complete dedication to commercial success could lead to societal collapse—like what happened in Rome—because people would lose morality. Through this lens, Ferguson viewed world history as humanities struggle to reach an ideal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/Ferguson/Adam%20Ferguson.htm|title=Adam Ferguson|website=www.d.umn.edu|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Home, Lord Kames was a philosopher during the Enlightenment and contributed to the study or world history. In his major historical work, ''Sketches on the History of Man'', Home’s outlined the four stages of human history which he observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kames.htm|title=Henry Home, Lord Kames|website=www.hetwebsite.net|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most primitive stage was small hunter-gatherer groups. Then, in order to form larger groups, humans transitioned into the second stage when they began to domesticate animals. The third stage was the development of agriculture. This new technology established trade and higher levels of cooperation amongst sizable groups of people. With the gathering of people into agricultural villages, laws and social obligations needed to be developed so a form of order could be maintained. The fourth, and final stage, involved humans moving into market towns and seaports where agriculture was not the focus. Instead, commerce and other forms of labor arouse in a society. By defining the stages of human history, Homes influenced his successors. He also contributed to the development of other studies such as sociology and anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/kames-on-progress-and-providence|title=Kames on Progress and Providence  - Online Library of Liberty|website=oll.libertyfund.org|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
World history became a popular genre in the 20th century with [[universal history]]. In the 1920s, several best-sellers dealt with the history of the world, including surveys ''[[The Story of Mankind]]'' (1921) by [[Hendrik Willem van Loon]] and ''[[The Outline of History]]'' (1918) by [[H.G. Wells]]. Influential writers who have reached wide audiences include [[H. G. Wells]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]], [[Carroll Quigley]], [[Christopher Dawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Bradley J. Birzer, ''Sanctifying the World: The Augustinian Life and Mind of Christopher Dawson'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lewis Mumford]]. Scholars working the field include [[Eric Voegelin]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Federici, ''Eric Voegelin: The Restoration of Order'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hardy McNeill]] and [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mann, ''The Sources of Social Power: Volume 1, A History of Power from the Beginning to AD 1760'' (1986) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/052131349X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; With evolving technologies such as dating methods and surveying laser technology called LiDAR, contemporary historians have access to knew information which changes how past civilizations are studied.

[[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] ''Decline of the West'' (2 vol 1919–1922) compared nine organic cultures: Egyptian (3400 BC-1200 BC), Indian (1500 BC-1100 BC), Chinese (1300 BC-AD 200), Classical (1100 BC-400 BC), Byzantine (AD 300–1100), Aztec (AD 1300–1500), Arabian (AD 300–1250), Mayan (AD 600–960), and Western (AD 900–1900). His book was a smashing success among intellectuals worldwide as it predicted the disintegration of European and American civilization after a violent "age of Caesarism," arguing by detailed analogies with other civilizations. It deepened the post-World War I pessimism in Europe, and was warmly received by intellectuals in China, India, and Latin America who hoped his predictions of the collapse of European empires would soon come true.&lt;ref&gt;Neil McInnes, "The Great Doomsayer: Oswald Spengler Reconsidered." ''National Interest'' 1997 (48): 65–76. Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936–1954, [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee's]] ten-volume ''A Study of History'' came out in three separate installments. He followed Spengler in taking a comparative topical approach to independent civilizations. Toynbee said they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay. Toynbee rejected Spengler's biological model of civilizations as organisms with a typical life span of 1,000 years. Like [[Sima Qian]], Toynbee explained decline as due to their moral failure. Many readers rejoiced in his implication (in vols. 1–6) that only a return to some form of Catholicism could halt the breakdown of western civilization which began with the Reformation. Volumes 7–10, published in 1954, abandoned the religious message, and his popular audience slipped away, while scholars  picked apart his mistakes.,&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Hardy McNeill|McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1963) to improve upon Toynbee by showing how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the Earth. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.''  Whatever it is called, the importance of these intercultural contacts has begun to be recognized by many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, "The Changing Shape of World History." ''History and Theory'' 1995 34(2): 8–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History education==

===United States===
[[T. Walter Wallbank]] and [[Alastair M. Taylor]] co-authored ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'', the first world-history textbook published in the United States (1942). With additional authors, this very successful work went through numerous editions up to the first decade of the twenty-first century. According to the Golden Anniversary edition of 1992, the ongoing objective of ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'' "was to present a survey of world cultural history, treating the development and growth of civilization not as a unique European experience but as a global one through which all the great culture systems have interacted to produce the present-day world. It attempted to include all the elements of history – social, economic, political, religious, aesthetic, legal, and technological."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civilization Past &amp; Present|last=Wallbank|first=T. Walter, et al.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1992|isbn=978-0-673-38867-4|location=New York|pages=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In college curricula of the United States, world history became a popular replacement for courses on [[Western Civilization]]. Professors [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]], previously of Northeastern University and now at the University of Pittsburgh's World History Center; and [[Ross E. Dunn]] at San Diego State are leaders in promoting innovative teaching methods.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, ''Navigating World History: Historians Create a Global Past'' (2003); [[Ross E. Dunn]], ed., ''The New World History: A Teacher's Companion.'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In schools of architecture in the U.S., the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] now requires that schools teach history that includes a non-west or global perspective. This reflects a decade-long effort to move past the standard Euro-centric approach that had dominated the field.&lt;ref&gt;See Points 8 and 9. http://www.naab.org/adaview.aspx?pageid=120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent themes==
In recent years, the relationship between African and world history has shifted rapidly from one of antipathy to one of engagement and synthesis. Reynolds (2007) surveys the relationship between African and world histories, with an emphasis on the tension between the area studies paradigm and the growing world-history emphasis on connections and exchange across regional boundaries. A closer examination of recent exchanges and debates over the merits of this exchange is also featured. Reynolds sees the relationship between African and world history as a measure of the changing nature of historical inquiry over the past century.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan T. Reynolds, "Africa and World History: from Antipathy to Synergy." ''History Compass'' 2007 5(6): 1998–2013. ISSN 1478-0542 Fulltext: [1. History Compass]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history#The stages of history }}

The [[Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] claims the history of the world is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory divides the history of the world into the following periods:&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Early writings'', Penguin, 1975, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Taylor 1980 p. 330"&gt;Charles Taylor, “Critical Notice”, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'' 10 (1980), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705120509/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Critique of the Gotha Programme'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=civilwar&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705030211/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Civil War in France'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Regna Darnell and Frederic Gleach argue that, in the Soviet Union, the Marxian theory of history was the only accepted orthodoxy, and stifled research into other schools of thought on history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Regna Darnell|author2=Frederic Gleach|title=Histories of Anthropology Annual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8jBlLIznIAC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2007|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=56|isbn=978-0803266636}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, adherents of Marx's theories argue that [[Stalinism|Stalin distorted]] [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicalaffairs.net/how-stalin-distorted-marxism-2/]&lt;/ref&gt;
