In [[physical cosmology]], the '''age of the universe''' is the [[cosmological time|time]] elapsed since the [[Big Bang]]. The [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|current measurement]] of the age of the [[universe]] is {{val|13.799|0.021}} billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) years&lt;!-- The universe is 8.07×10E60 "planck times" old, this is how much the observable universe has "ticked" since the plank epoch.

These include studies of the [[microwave background radiation]], and [[measurement]]s by the [[Planck satellite]], the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] and other probes.

== Explanation ==
The [[Lambda-CDM model|Lambda-CDM concordance model]] describes the evolution of the universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state over a span of about 13.8 billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[cosmological time]]. This model is well understood theoretically and strongly supported by recent high-precision [[astronomical observation]]s such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]]. In contrast, theories of the origin of the primordial state remain very speculative. If one extrapolates the Lambda-CDM model backward from the earliest well-understood state, it quickly (within a small fraction of a second) reaches a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]]. This is known as the "[[initial singularity]]" or the "[[Big Bang]] singularity". This singularity is not understood as having a physical significance in the usual sense, but it is convenient to quote times measured "since the Big Bang" even though they do not correspond to a physically measurable time. For example, "10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang" is a well-defined era in the universe's evolution. If one referred to the same era as "13.8 billion years minus 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ago", the precision of the meaning would be lost because the minuscule latter time interval is eclipsed by uncertainty in the former.

Though the universe might in theory have a longer history, the [[International Astronomical Union]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; presently use "age of the universe" to mean the duration of the Lambda-CDM expansion, or equivalently the elapsed time since the Big Bang in the current [[observable universe]].

==Observational limits==
Since the universe must be at least as old as the oldest things in it, there are a number of observations which put a lower limit on the age of the universe; these include the temperature of the coolest [[white dwarf]]s, which gradually cool as they age, and the dimmest [[turnoff point]] of [[main sequence]] [[stars]] in clusters (lower-mass stars spend a greater amount of time on the main sequence, so the lowest-mass stars that have evolved off of the main sequence set a minimum age).

==Cosmological parameters==
[[Image:Mplwp universe scale evolution.svg|thumb|400px|The age of the universe can be determined by measuring the [[Hubble constant]] today and extrapolating back in time with the observed value of density parameters (Ω). Before the discovery of [[dark energy]], it was believed that the universe was matter-dominated ([[Einstein–de Sitter universe]], green curve). Note that the [[de Sitter universe]] has infinite age, while the [[Big Crunch|closed]] universe has the least age.]]
[[File:Age Universe Planck 2013.png|thumb|400px|The value of the age correction factor, ''F'', is shown as a function of two [[cosmology|cosmological parameters]]: the current fractional matter density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and cosmological constant density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The [[Lambda-CDM model|best-fit values]] of these parameters are shown by the box in the upper left; the matter-dominated universe is shown by the star in the lower right.]]
The problem of determining the age of the universe is closely tied to the problem of determining the values of the cosmological parameters. Today this is largely carried out in the context of the [[Lambda CDM model|ΛCDM]] model, where the universe is assumed to contain normal (baryonic) matter, cold [[dark matter]], radiation (including both [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s), and a [[cosmological constant]].  The fractional contribution of each to the current energy density of the universe is given by the [[density parameter]]s Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;.  The full ΛCDM model is described by a number of other parameters, but for the purpose of computing its age these three, along with the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, are the most important.

If one has accurate measurements of these parameters, then the age of the universe can be determined by using the [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]].  This equation relates the rate of change in the [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] ''a''(''t'') to the matter content of the universe.  Turning this relation around, we can calculate the change in time per change in scale factor and thus calculate the total age of the universe by [[Integral|integrating]] this formula. The age ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is then given by an expression of the form
:&lt;math&gt;t_0 = \frac{1}{H_0} F(\Omega_r,\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda,\dots) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble's law|Hubble parameter]] and the function ''F'' depends only on the fractional contribution to the universe's energy content that comes from various components. The first observation that one can make from this formula is that it is the Hubble parameter that controls that age of the universe, with a correction arising from the matter and energy content. So a rough estimate of the age of the universe comes from the [[Hubble time]], the inverse of the Hubble parameter. With a value for &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; around {{val|68|u=km/s/Mpc}}, the Hubble time evaluates to &lt;math&gt;1/H_0&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|14.4}} billion years.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To get a more accurate number, the correction factor ''F'' must be computed. In general this must be done numerically, and the results for a range of cosmological parameter values are shown in the figure. For the [[Lambda CDM model|Planck values]] (Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (0.3086, 0.6914), shown by the box in the upper left corner of the figure, this correction factor is about ''F'' = 0.956. For a flat universe without any cosmological constant, shown by the star in the lower right corner, ''F'' = {{Frac|2|3}} is much smaller and thus the universe is younger for a fixed value of the Hubble parameter. To make this figure, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is held constant (roughly equivalent to holding the [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]] temperature constant) and the curvature density parameter is fixed by the value of the other three.

Apart from the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ([[WMAP]]) was instrumental in establishing an accurate age of the universe, though other measurements must be folded in to gain an accurate number.  [[CMB]] measurements are very good at constraining the matter content Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not as sensitive to Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; directly,&lt;ref name="anim3"/&gt; partly because the cosmological constant becomes important only at low redshift.  The most accurate determinations of the Hubble parameter ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; come from [[Type Ia supernova]]e.  Combining these measurements leads to the generally accepted value for the age of the universe quoted above.

The cosmological constant makes the universe "older" for fixed values of the other parameters. This is significant, since before the cosmological constant became generally accepted, the Big Bang model had difficulty explaining why [[globular cluster]]s in the Milky Way appeared to be far older than the age of the universe as calculated from the Hubble parameter and a matter-only universe.&lt;ref&gt;

==WMAP==
[[NASA]]'s [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) project's [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe#Nine-year data release|nine-year data release]] in 2012 estimated the age of the universe to be {{val|13.772|0.059|e=9}} years (13.772 billion years, with an uncertainty of plus or minus 59 million years).&lt;ref name="arxiv-20121220" /&gt;

However, this age is based on the assumption that the project's underlying model is correct; other methods of estimating the age of the universe could give different ages. Assuming an extra background of relativistic particles, for example, can enlarge the error bars of the WMAP constraint by one order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;

This measurement is made by using the location of the first acoustic peak in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background]] power spectrum to determine the size of the decoupling surface (size of the universe at the time of recombination).  The light travel time to this surface (depending on the geometry used) yields a reliable age for the universe.  Assuming the validity of the models used to determine this age, the residual accuracy yields a margin of error near one percent.&lt;ref name="wmap"&gt;

In 2015, the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck Collaboration]]  estimated the age of the universe to be {{val|13.813|0.038}} billion years, slightly higher but within the uncertainties of the earlier number derived from the WMAP data. By combining the Planck data with external data, the best combined estimate of the age of the universe is {{val|13.799|0.021|e=9|u=years}} old.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA on Planck 2015"/&gt;

==Assumption of strong priors==
Calculating the age of the universe is accurate only if the assumptions built into the models being used to estimate it are also accurate. This is referred to as [[strong priors]] and essentially involves stripping the potential errors in other parts of the model to render the accuracy of actual observational data directly into the concluded result.  Although this is not a valid procedure in all contexts (as noted in the accompanying caveat: "based on the fact we have assumed the underlying model we used is correct"{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--no reason to doubt this, but quotation should be cited--&gt;), the age given is thus accurate to the specified error (since this error represents the error in the instrument used to gather the raw data input into the model).

The age of the universe based on the best fit to [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|Planck 2015 data]] alone is {{val|13.813|0.038}} billion years (the estimate of {{val|13.799|0.021}} billion years uses Gaussian [[Prior probability|prior]]s based on earlier estimates from other studies to determine the combined uncertainty). This number represents an accurate "direct" measurement of the age of the universe (other methods typically involve [[Hubble's law]] and the age of the oldest stars in globular clusters, etc.). It is possible to use different methods for determining the same parameter (in this case – the age of the universe) and arrive at different answers with no overlap in the "errors". To best avoid the problem, it is common to show two sets of uncertainties; one related to the actual measurement and the other related to the systematic errors of the model being used.

An important component to the analysis of data used to determine the age of the universe (e.g. from [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]) therefore is to use a [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian statistical]] analysis, which normalizes the results based upon the priors (i.e. the model).&lt;ref name="wmap" /&gt; This quantifies any uncertainty in the accuracy of a measurement due to a particular model used.&lt;ref&gt;

{{main|Cosmic age problem|Cosmic microwave background}}
In the 18th century, the concept that the [[age of the Earth]] was millions, if not billions, of years began to appear. However, most scientists throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th century presumed that the universe itself was [[Steady State theory|Steady State]] and eternal, with maybe stars coming and going but no changes occurring at the largest scale known at the time.

The first scientific theories indicating that the age of the universe might be finite were the studies of [[thermodynamics]], formalized in the mid-19th century. The concept of [[entropy]] dictates that if the universe (or any other closed system) were infinitely old, then everything inside would be at the same temperature, and thus there would be no stars and no life. No scientific explanation for this contradiction was put forth at the time.

In 1915 [[Albert Einstein]] published the theory of [[general relativity]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Einstein |first=A.

 |title=Zur allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1917 constructed the first [[cosmological model]] based on his theory. In order to remain consistent with a steady state universe, Einstein added what was later called a [[cosmological constant]] to his equations. However, already in 1922, also using  Einstein's theory, [[Alexander Friedmann]], and independently five years later [[Georges Lemaître]], showed that the universe cannot be static and must be either expanding or contracting. Einstein's model of a static universe was in addition proved unstable by [[Arthur Eddington]].

The first direct observational hint that the universe has a finite age came from the observations of '[[recession velocity|recession velocities]]', mostly by [[Vesto Slipher]], combined with distances to the '[[nebula]]e' ([[galaxy|galaxies]]) by [[Edwin Hubble]] in a  work published in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. [[electromagnetic spectrum|Spectra]] taken of these distant galaxies showed a [[red shift]] in their [[spectral lines]] presumably caused by the [[Doppler effect]], thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.

The first reasonably accurate measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe, a numerical value now known as the [[Hubble constant]], was made in 1958 by astronomer [[Allan Sandage]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |doi=10.1086/146483
}}&lt;/ref&gt; His measured value for the Hubble constant came very close to the value range generally accepted today.

However Sandage, like Einstein, did not believe his own results at the time of discovery. His value for the age of the universe{{Elucidate|date=February 2014|reason=What was his value for the age of the universe?}} was too short to reconcile with the 25-billion-year age estimated at that time for the oldest known [[star]]s. Sandage and other astronomers repeated these measurements numerous times, attempting to reduce the [[Hubble constant]] and thus increase the resulting age for the universe. Sandage even proposed new theories of [[cosmogony]] to explain this discrepancy. This issue was finally resolved by improvements in the theoretical models used for estimating the ages of stars. As of 2013, using the latest models for stellar evolution, the estimated age of the [[oldest star|oldest known star]] is {{val|14.46|0.8}} billion years.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; finally brought an effective end to the remaining scientific uncertainty over the expanding universe. It was a chance result from work by two teams less than 60 miles apart.  In 1964, [[Arno Allan Penzias|Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] were trying to detect [[radio wave]] [[echo]]es with a supersensitive antenna. The antenna persistently detected a low, steady, mysterious [[noise (electronics)|noise]] in the [[microwave radiation|microwave region]] that was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. After testing, they became certain that the signal did not come from the [[Earth]], the [[Sun]], or [[Milky Way|our galaxy]], but from outside our own galaxy, but could not explain it. At the same time another team, [[Robert H. Dicke]], [[P. J. E. Peebles|Jim Peebles]], and [[David Todd Wilkinson|David Wilkinson]], were attempting to detect low level noise which might be left over from the [[Big Bang]] and could prove whether the Big Bang theory was correct. The two teams realized that the detected noise was in fact radiation left over from the Big Bang, and that this was strong evidence that the theory was correct. Since then, a great deal of other evidence has strengthened and confirmed this conclusion, and refined the estimated age of the universe to its current figure.

The space probes WMAP, launched in 2001, and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]], launched in 2009, produced data that determines the Hubble constant and the age of the universe independent of galaxy distances, removing the largest source of error.&lt;ref name="wmap"/&gt;

Since [[Georges Lemaître]] first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion.

American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their [[redshift]]s. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction.&lt;ref name="hubble"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Copernican principle]] (that the Earth is not the center of the universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.

Large [[particle accelerator]]s can replicate the conditions that prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement of the details of the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into [[high-energy physics|high energy regimes]]. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.

The first [[subatomic particle]]s to be formed included [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s. Though simple [[big bang nucleosynthesis|atomic nuclei formed]] within the first three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first [[Recombination (cosmology)|electrically neutral atoms formed]]. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were [[hydrogen]], along with [[helium]] and traces of [[lithium]]. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through [[gravity]] to form [[star]]s and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|within stars]] or [[supernova nucleosynthesis|during supernovae]].

The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the [[cosmic microwave background|CMB]], [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structure]], and [[Hubble's Law]].&lt;ref name=Wright2009&gt;

The governing equations were formulated by [[Alexander Friedmann]], and similar solutions were worked on by [[Willem de Sitter]]. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its [[parametrization]] as the [[Lambda-CDM model]] serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology. The Lambda-CDM model is the current "standard model" of Big Bang cosmology, [[Scientific consensus|consensus]] is that it is the simplest model that can account for the various measurements and [[Observational cosmology|observations relevant to cosmology]].

In either case, "the Big Bang" as an event is also colloquially referred to as the "birth" of our universe since it represents the point in history where the universe can be verified to have entered into a [[Equation of state (cosmology)|regime]] where the laws of physics as we understand them (specifically general relativity and the [[Standard Model|standard model of particle physics]]) work. Based on measurements of the expansion using [[Type Ia supernova]]e and measurements of temperature fluctuations in the [[cosmic microwave background]], the time that has passed since that event — otherwise known as the "[[age of the universe]]" — is 13.799 ± 0.021&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Planck Collaboration |title=Planck 2015 results.

Despite being extremely [[density|dense]] at this time—far denser than is usually required to form a [[black hole]]—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This may be explained by considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for [[gravitational collapse]] are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as [[star]]s, and do not apply to [[metric expansion of space|rapidly expanding space]] such as the Big Bang.

=== Inflation and baryogenesis ===
{{Main| Cosmic inflation|baryogenesis}}
The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneously]] and [[isotropic]]ally with a very high [[energy density]] and huge temperatures and [[pressure]]s and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds into the expansion, a [[phase transition]] caused a [[cosmic inflation]], during which the universe grew [[exponential growth|exponentially]] during which time [[Quantum fluctuation|density fluctuations]] that occurred because of the [[uncertainty principle]] were amplified into the seeds that would later form the [[Structure formation|large-scale structure]] of the universe.&lt;ref name="guth"&gt;{{cite book

This resulted in the predominance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] in the present universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c6"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. [[Explicit symmetry breaking|Symmetry breaking]] phase transitions put the [[fundamental force]]s of physics and the parameters of [[elementary particles]] into their present form.&lt;ref name="kolb_c7"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; After about 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in [[particle accelerator]]s. At about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form [[baryon]]s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by [[photon]]s (with a minor contribution from [[neutrino]]s).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million) [[kelvin]] and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's [[deuterium]] and helium [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"/&gt; Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"/&gt;

As the universe cooled, the [[rest mass]] energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]]. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Biochemistry|chemistry of life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]], during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old.&lt;ref name="Loeb_2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |format=PDF |publisher=Cambridge University Press / Astronomy Department, Harvard University |date=24 September 2014 |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/habitable.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |arxiv=1312.0613 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic acceleration ===
{{Main|Accelerating expansion of the universe}}
Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as [[dark energy]], which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the [[Hubble's law|expansion of the universe]] to slowly begin to accelerate.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[Einstein's field equation]]s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] and relationship with the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

All of this cosmic evolution after the [[inflationary epoch]] can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of [[quantum gravity|quantum gravitation]] is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]].

== Features of the model ==
The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of [[physical law]]s and the [[cosmological principle]]. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropy|isotropic]].

These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the [[fine structure constant]] over much of the [[age of the universe]] is of order 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

If the large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler [[Copernican principle]], which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.&lt;ref&gt;

===Expansion of space===
{{Main|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Metric expansion of space}}
General relativity describes spacetime by a [[metric tensor|metric]], which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, are themselves specified using a [[coordinate chart]] or "grid" that is laid down over all [[spacetime]]. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] on large scales, which uniquely singles out the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW metric). 
This metric contains a [[scale factor]], which describes how the size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a [[coordinate system]] to be made, called [[comoving coordinates]]. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their ''coordinate'' distance ([[comoving distance]]) remains constant, the ''physical'' distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the [[scale factor]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, [[metric expansion of space|space itself expands]] with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion ''in space'', but rather an expansion ''of space''.&lt;ref name="HTUW"/&gt; Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara M. Davis and Charles H. Lineweaver, ''Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the Universe''. [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808 astro-ph/0310808]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horizons===
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of [[particle horizon]]s. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a ''past horizon'' on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a ''future horizon'', which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FLRW]] model that describes our universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Our understanding of the universe back to very early times [[Big Bang#Horizon problem|suggests]] that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the universe continues to [[accelerating universe|accelerate]], there is a future horizon as well.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Etymology===
English astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]] is credited with coining the term "Big Bang" during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast, saying: "These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past."&lt;ref&gt;

It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "[[steady state universe|steady state]]" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 [[Vesto Slipher]] measured the first [[Doppler shift]] of a "[[spiral nebula]]" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was [[Shapley–Curtis debate|highly controversial]] whether or not these nebulae were "island universes" outside our [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;

}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.&lt;ref&gt;

Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the [[cosmic distance ladder]], using the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity—now known as [[Hubble's law]].&lt;ref name="hubble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="christianson"&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal [[Steady state theory|steady state]] universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory.&lt;ref&gt;

===Hubble's law and the expansion of space===
{{Main|Hubble's law|Metric expansion of space}}
{{See also|Distance measures (cosmology)|Scale factor (universe)}}
Observations of distant galaxies and [[quasar]]s show that these objects are redshifted—the [[light]] emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a [[frequency spectrum]] of an object and matching the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] pattern of [[emission line]]s or [[absorption line]]s corresponding to [[atom]]s of the [[chemical element]]s interacting with the light. These redshifts are [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniformly]] isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional [[velocity]] of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;v = H_0D&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the recessional [[velocity]] of the [[galaxy]] or other distant object,
* &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]] to the object, and
* &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is [[Hubble's constant]], measured to be {{val|70.4|+1.3|-1.4}} [[kilometres|km]]/[[second|s]]/[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] by the [[WMAP]] probe.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt;

[[Hubble's law]] has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the [[Copernican principle]]—or the universe is [[Metric expansion of space|uniformly expanding]] everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922&lt;ref name=af1922 /&gt; and Georges Lemaître in 1927,&lt;ref name=gl1927 /&gt; well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker]].

The theory requires the relation &lt;math&gt;v = HD&lt;/math&gt; to hold at all times, where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]], ''v'' is the [[recessional velocity]], and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; vary as the universe expands (hence we write &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; to denote the present-day Hubble "constant"). For distances much smaller than the size of the [[observable universe]], the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.&lt;ref name="peacock_c3"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Metric expansion of space|space is undergoing metric expansion]] is shown by direct observational evidence of the [[Cosmological principle]] and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely [[isotropic]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneous]],&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt; supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

Measurements of the effects of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1964 [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the [[microwave]] band.&lt;ref name="penzias" /&gt; Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation was found to be approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725&amp;nbsp;K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1978.

The ''surface of last scattering'' corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after ''[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]'', the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly [[Thomson scattering|scattered]] from free charged particles.

In 1989, [[NASA]] launched the [[Cosmic Background Explorer satellite]] (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements showed that the &lt;abbr title="cosmic microwave background raditation"&gt;CMB&lt;/abbr&gt; frequency spectrum is an almost perfect [[blackbody]] with no deviations at a level of 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726&amp;nbsp;K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255&amp;nbsp;K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="cobe" /&gt; [[John C. Mather]] and [[George Smoot]] were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.

During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]], found the [[shape of the universe]] to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Melchiorri |first=A., et. al. |title=A measurement of Omega from the North American test flight of BOOMERANG |volume=536 |issue=2 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=1999 |arxiv=astro-ph/9911445|doi=10.1086/312744 |pmid=10859119 |bibcode=2000ApJ...536L..63M |pages=L63–L66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Bernardis |first=P. |display-authors=etal |title=A Flat Universe from High-Resolution Maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation |pages=955–959 |journal=Nature |volume=404 |issue=6781 |year=2000 |arxiv=

In early 2003, the first results of the [[WMAP|Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific [[cosmic inflation]] models, but are consistent with the [[inflation theory]] in general.&lt;ref name="wmap1year" /&gt; The [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based [[List of cosmic microwave background experiments|cosmic microwave background experiments]] are ongoing.

===Abundance of primordial elements===
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}
Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of [[helium-4]], [[helium-3]], deuterium, and [[lithium-7]] in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen.&lt;ref name = "kolb_c4"/&gt; The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of [[photon]]s to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for &lt;chem&gt;^4He/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^2H/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^3He/H&lt;/chem&gt; and about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li/H&lt;/chem&gt;.&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for &lt;chem&gt;^4He&lt;/chem&gt;, and off by a factor of two for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li&lt;/chem&gt;; in the latter two cases there are substantial [[systematic error|systematic uncertainties]]. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to "tune" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium.&lt;ref&gt;

===Galactic evolution and distribution===
{{Main|Galaxy formation and evolution|Structure formation}}
Detailed observations of the [[Galaxy morphological classification|morphology]] and [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|distribution]] of galaxies and [[quasars]] are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as [[galaxy clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"/&gt;

Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of [[star formation]], galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"&gt;

In 2011, astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium.&lt;ref&gt;

The age of the universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of [[stellar evolution]] to [[globular clusters]] and through [[radiometric dating]] of individual [[Population II]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Problems}}Problems and related issues in physics==
{{See also|List of unsolved problems in physics}}
As with any theory, a number of mysteries and problems have arisen as a result of the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the [[horizon problem]], the [[magnetic monopole problem]], and the [[flatness problem]] are most commonly resolved with [[Cosmic inflation|inflationary theory]], but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Earman |first1=John |last2=Mosterín |first2=Jesús |date=March 1999 |title=A Critical Look at Inflationary Cosmology |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=1–49 |doi=10.1086/392675 |jstor=188736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Baryon asymmetry===
{{Main|Baryon asymmetry}}
It is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Kolb and Turner, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the [[Sakharov conditions]] must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] are violated and that the universe depart from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="sakharov"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;(Translated in ''[[Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters]]'' '''5''', 24 (1967).)
&lt;/ref&gt; All these conditions occur in the [[Standard Model]], but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.

===Dark energy===
{{Main|Dark energy}}
Measurements of the [[redshift]]–[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] relation for [[type Ia supernova]]e indicate that the expansion of the universe has been [[accelerating universe|accelerating]] since the universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large [[equation of state (cosmology)|negative pressure]], dubbed "dark energy".&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt; Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of [[gravitational lens]]es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is believed to be a property of [[vacuum energy]], but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt; According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the [[far future]] as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

The dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including Einstein's [[cosmological constant]] but also extending to more exotic forms of [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] or other modified gravity schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |journal=Particle Data Group 2014 Review of Particle Physics |date=December 2013 |arxiv=1401.0046|bibcode = 2014arXiv1401.0046M }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |work=LEVEL 5 — A Knowledgebase for Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology, NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology |date=2014-06-27 |url=https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March14/Mortonson/Mortonson_contents.html |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cosmological constant problem]], sometimes called the "most embarrassing problem in physics", results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy, and the one naively predicted from [[Planck units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rugh |first1=S.&amp;thinsp;E. |last2=Zinkernagel |first2=H. |title=The quantum vacuum and the cosmological constant problem |pages=663–705 |volume=33 |issue=4 |date=December 2002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219802000333 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(02)00033-3 |arxiv=hep-th/0012253|bibcode = 2002SHPMP..33..663R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
[[File:Cosmological Composition – Pie Chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[pie chart|Chart]] shows the proportion of different components of the universe {{spaced ndash}} about 95% is [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].]]
During the 1970s and the 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal [[baryon]]ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, [[galaxy cluster]] velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, [[gravitational lensing]] studies, and [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray measurements]] of galaxy clusters.&lt;ref&gt;

Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many [[particle physics]] candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.&lt;ref name="pdg"&gt;

===Horizon problem===
The [[horizon problem]] results from the premise that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the [[particle horizon]]—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in [[causality (physics)|causal]] contact.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; The observed isotropy of the [[Cosmic microwave background|CMB]] is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Sue Ryden|title=Introduction to cosmology|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|191–202}}

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by [[inflationary theory]] in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

[[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be [[primordial fluctuations|quantum thermal fluctuations]], which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"/&gt;{{rp|207}} Inflation predicts that the [[primordial fluctuations]] are nearly [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]] and [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spergel |first=D.

If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

A related issue to the classic horizon problem arises because in most standard cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] occurs, so inflation should not be able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the [[electroweak vacuum]] since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the [[electroweak epoch]] ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

===Magnetic monopoles===
The [[magnetic monopole]] objection was raised in the late 1970s. [[Grand unified theory|Grand unified theories]] predicted [[topological defect]]s in space that would manifest as [[magnetic monopole]]s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by [[cosmic inflation]], which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt;

===Flatness problem===
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The overall [[Shape of the universe|geometry of the universe]] is determined by whether the [[Density parameter|Omega cosmological parameter]] is less than, equal to or greater than 1. Shown from top to bottom are a [[Shape of the universe#Spherical universe|closed universe]] with positive curvature, a [[Shape of the universe#Hyperbolic universe|hyperbolic universe]] with negative curvature and a [[flat universe]] with zero curvature.]]

The [[flatness problem]] (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW).&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt; The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial [[curvature]] depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]; positive if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be ''flat''.

The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Strictly, dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant drives the universe towards a flat state; however, our universe remained close to flat for several billion years before the dark energy density became significant.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the [[Planck time]], 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds,&lt;ref name=HTUW/&gt; the fact that the universe has reached neither a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] nor a [[Big Crunch]] after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.&lt;ref&gt;

== Cause ==
{{Main|Problem of why there is anything at all}}
Physics may conclude that [[time]] did not exist before 'Big Bang', but 'started' with the &lt;!--beginning point--&gt;Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Big Bang? Quantum equation predicts universe has no beginning|url=https://phys.org/news/2015-02-big-quantum-equation-universe.html|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beginning of TIme|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-beginning-of-time.html|website=Stephen Hawking|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum fluctuation]]s, or other laws of physics that may have existed at the start of the Big Bang could then create the conditions for matter to occur.

== Ultimate fate of the universe ==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe}}

Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass [[density]] of the universe were greater than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]], then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Alternatively, if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach [[absolute zero]]—a [[Big Freeze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Griswold |first=Britt |title=What is the Ultimate Fate of the Universe? |work=Universe 101 Big Bang Theory |publisher=NASA |date=2012 |url=
http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if the proton were [[proton decay|unstable]], then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]]. The [[entropy]] of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Fred C. |last2=Laughlin |first2=Gregory |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A dying Universe: the long-term fate and evolution of astrophysical objects |pages=337–372 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=69 |issue=2 |date=1997 |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337| arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|sec VI.D}}

Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our [[event horizon]] and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a [[cosmological constant]]. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called [[phantom energy]] theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Misconceptions ==
The following is a partial list of misconceptions about the Big Bang model:

''The Big Bang as the origin of the universe:'' One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the belief that it was the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|title=Brief Answers to Cosmic Questions|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu|access-date=2017-07-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413195349/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Big Bang was "small"'': It is misleading to visualize the Big Bang by comparing its size to everyday objects. When the size of the universe at Big Bang is described, it refers to the size of the observable universe, and not the entire universe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Tamara M.|last2=Lineweaver|first2=Charles H.|date=January 2004|title=Expanding Confusion: Common Misconceptions of Cosmological Horizons and the Superluminal Expansion of the Universe|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/expanding-confusion-common-misconceptions-of-cosmological-horizons-and-the-superluminal-expansion-of-the-universe/EFEEEFD8D71E59F86DDA82FDF576EFD3|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|volume=21|issue=1|pages=97–109|doi=10.1071/as03040|arxiv = astro-ph/0310808 |bibcode = 2004PASA...21...97D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hubble's law]] violates the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]]'': Hubble's law predicts that galaxies that are beyond [[Hubble's law|Hubble Distance]] recede [[Faster-than-light|faster than the speed of light]]. However, special relativity does not apply beyond motion through space. Hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion ''of'' space, rather than ''through'' space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''[[Doppler effect|Doppler redshift]] vs [[Cosmological redshift|cosmological red-shift]]'': Astronomers&amp;nbsp;often refer to the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Speculations ==
{{Main|Cosmogony}}

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined. The Big Bang theory, built upon the equations of classical general relativity, indicates a [[essential singularity|singularity]] at the origin of cosmic time; this [[infinity#Physics|infinite]] [[energy density]] is regarded as impossible in [[experimental physics|physics]].  Still, it is known that the equations are not applicable before the time when the universe cooled down to the [[Planck temperature]], and this conclusion depends on various assumptions, of which some could never be experimentally verified. ''(Also see [[Planck epoch]].)''

One proposed refinement to avoid this would-be singularity is to develop a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;

It is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated, though speculation abounds in the field of [[cosmogony]].

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:
* Models including the [[Hartle–Hawking state|Hartle–Hawking no-boundary condition]], in which the whole of space-time is finite; the Big Bang does represent the limit of time but without any singularity.&lt;ref&gt;

* Big Bang lattice model, states that the universe at the moment of the Big Bang consists of an infinite lattice of [[fermions]], which is smeared over the [[fundamental domain]] so it has rotational, translational and gauge symmetry. The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible and hence the lowest entropy of any state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [[Brane cosmology]] models, in which inflation is due to the movement of branes in [[string theory]]; the pre-Big Bang model; the [[ekpyrotic]] model, in which the Big Bang is the result of a collision between branes; and the [[cyclic model]], a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Universe expansion-en.svg|thumb|The [[Big Bang]] theory, which states that the universe originally expanded from high or infinite density, is widely accepted by physicists.]]
'''Cosmogony''' is any model concerning the origin of either the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]].&lt;ref name=DicAstro&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=A Dictionary of Astronomy |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cosmogony Today |last=Woolfson |first=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=20 |year=1979 |issue=2 |pages=97–114|bibcode = 1979QJRAS..20...97W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a complete theoretical model has implications in both the [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]].

==Etymology==
The word comes from the [[Koine Greek]] κοσμογονία (from κόσμος "[[cosmos]], the world") and the root of γί(γ)νομαι / γέγονα ("come into a new state of being").&lt;ref name="TU-20140917"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=γίγνομαι - come into a new state of being |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ge/gona&amp;la=greek |date= |work=[[Tufts University]] |accessdate=17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[astronomy]], cosmogony refers to the study of the origin of particular astrophysical objects or systems, and is most commonly used in reference to the origin of the Universe, the Solar System, or the Earth–Moon system.&lt;ref name=DicAstro/&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday/&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Big Bang]] theory is the prevailing [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[scientific theory|model]] of the early development of the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="Wollack"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wollack|first=Edward J.|title=Cosmology: The Study of the Universe|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|work=Universe 101: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=10 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230003/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most commonly held view is that the universe originates in a  [[gravitational singularity]], which [[inflation (cosmology)|expanded extremely rapidly]] from its hot and dense state. 

[[File:Calabi-Yau.png|thumb|left|200px|Projection of a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]] from [[string theory]]. In quantum physics, there remain different, plausible theories regarding what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged along with the singularity (and therefore this universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; The main disagreement among theories is whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not.]]
Cosmologist and science communicator [[Sean M. Carroll]] explains two competing types of explanations for the origins of the singularity which is the main disagreement between the scientists who study cosmogony and centers on the question of whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not. One cosmogonical view sees time as fundamental and even eternal: The universe could have contained the singularity because the universe evolved or changed from a prior state (the prior state was "empty space", or maybe a state that could not be called "space" at all). The other view, held by proponents like [[Stephen Hawking]], says that there was no change through time because "time" itself emerged along with this universe (in other words, there can be no "prior" to the universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/04/28/a-universe-from-nothing/|title=A Universe from Nothing?, by Sean Carroll, Discover Magazine Blogs, 28 April 2012.|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it remains unclear what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged with the singularity and this universe.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;

One problem in cosmogony is that there is currently no theoretical model that explains the earliest moments of the universe's existence (during the [[Planck time]]) because of a lack of a testable theory of [[quantum gravity]]. Researchers in [[string theory]] and its extensions (for example, [[M theory]]), and of [[loop quantum cosmology]], have nevertheless proposed solutions of the type just discussed.

==Compared with cosmology==
{{quote box
|Cosmology is the study of the structure and changes in the present universe, while the scientific field of cosmogony is concerned with the origin of the universe. Observations about our present universe may not only allow predictions to be made about the future, but they also provide clues to events that happened long ago when ... the cosmos began. So the work of cosmologists and cosmogonists overlaps.

}}

Cosmogony can be distinguished from [[cosmology]], which studies the universe at large and throughout its existence, and which technically does not inquire directly into the source of its origins. There is some ambiguity between the two terms. For example, the [[cosmological argument]] from [[theology]] regarding the existence of [[God]] is technically an appeal to cosmogonical rather than cosmological ideas. In practice, there is a [[science|scientific]] distinction between cosmological and cosmogonical ideas. [[Physical cosmology]] is the science that attempts to explain all [[observation]]s relevant to the development and characteristics of the universe as a whole. Questions regarding why the universe behaves in such a way have been described by physicists and cosmologists as being extra-[[Scientific method|scientific]] (i.e., [[metaphysics|metaphysical]]), though [[speculation]]s are made from a variety of perspectives that include [[extrapolation]] of scientific theories to untested regimes (i.e., at [[Planck scale]]s), and [[philosophical]] or [[religious]] ideas.

==Theoretical scenarios==
Cosmogonists have only tentative theories for the early stages of the universe and its beginning.  {{as of|2011}}, no accelerator experiments probe energies of sufficient magnitude to provide any experimental insight into the behavior of matter at the energy levels that prevailed shortly after the [[Big Bang]].  

Proposed theoretical scenarios differ radically, and include [[string theory]] and [[M-theory]], the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]], [[Cosmic inflation|brane inflation]], the Big Bang, and the [[ekpyrotic universe]]. Some of these models are mutually compatible, whereas others are not.

'''Cosmography''' is the science that [[map]]s the general features of the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]], describing both [[heaven]] and [[Earth]] (but without encroaching on [[geography]] or [[astronomy]]). The 14th-century work ''[['Aja'ib al-makhluqat wa-ghara'ib al-mawjudat]]'' by [[Persian people|Persian]] physician [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] is considered to be an early work of cosmography.

Traditional Hindu, Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] cosmography schematize a universe centered on [[Mount Meru]] surrounded by rivers, continents and seas.  These cosmographies posit a universe being repeatedly created and destroyed over time cycles of immense lengths.
[[File:Peasants spinning.png|thumb|left|Sedentary Occupations of Peasants&lt;!---Facsimile from 
an Engraving on Wood, attributed to---&gt; &amp;ndash; by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], in the "Cosmographie" of Munster (Basle, 1552, folio).]]
In 1551, [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]], from [[Zaragoza]], Spain, published ''[[Breve compendio de la esfera y del arte de navegar]]''. Translated into English and reprinted several times, the work was of great influence in Britain for many years. He proposed spherical charts and mentioned magnetic deviation and the existence of magnetic poles.

[[Peter Heylin]]'s 1652 book ''Cosmographie'' (enlarged from his ''Microcosmos'' of 1621) was one of the earliest attempts to describe the entire world in English, and being the first known description of [[Australia]] and among the first of [[California]]. The book has 4 sections, examining the geography, politics, and cultures of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, with an addendum on ''[[Terra incognita|Terra Incognita]]'', including Australia, and extending to [[Utopia]], [[Álfheimr|Fairyland]], and the "Land of [[Chivalry|Chivalrie]]".

In 1659, Thomas Porter published a smaller, but extensive ''Compendious Description of the Whole World'', which also included a [[chronology]] of world events from [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] forward. These were all part of a major trend in the [[European Renaissance]] to explore (and perhaps comprehend) the known world.

The word was also commonly used by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in his lectures.

In [[astrophysics]], the term "cosmography" is beginning to be used to describe attempts to determine the large-scale [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|matter distribution]] and [[kinematics]] of the [[universe|observable universe]], dependent on the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] but independent of the temporal dependence of the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] on the matter/energy composition of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Debris''' or '''débris''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|d|ɛ|b|r|iː|,_|ˈ|d|eɪ|b|r|iː}}, {{IPAc-en|US|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|iː}}) is [[rubble]], wreckage, [[ruins]], [[litter]] and discarded [[waste|garbage/refuse/trash]], scattered remains of something destroyed, discarded, or as in geology, large rock fragments left by a melting glacier etc. Depending on context, ''debris'' can refer to a number of different things. The first apparent use of the French  word in English is in a 1701 description of the army of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] upon its retreat from a battle with the army of Oliver Cromwell, in England.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Sir Philip. (1701). Memoires of the Reigne of King Charles I: With a continuation to the happy restoration of King Charles II. London: Ri.Chiswell. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
In disaster scenarios, [[tornado]]s leave behind large pieces of houses and mass destruction overall. This debris also flies around the tornado itself when it is in progress. The tornado's winds capture debris it kicks up in its wind orbit, and spins it inside its vortex. The tornado's wind radius is larger than the funnel itself. tsunamis and hurricanes also bring large amounts of debris, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Earthquakes rock cities to rubble debris.

==Geological==
[[Image:ObsidianDomeCA.JPG|thumb|[[Obsidian]] debris (talus), Obsidian Dome, [[California]].]]
In [[geology]], debris usually applies to the remains of geological activity including [[landslide]]s, [[volcanic]] explosions, [[avalanches]], [[Mudslide|mudflows]] or [[Glacial lake outburst flood]]s (Jökulhlaups) and [[moraine]], [[lahars]], and [[lava]] eruptions. Geological debris sometimes moves in a [[stream]] called a [[debris flow]].  When it accumulates at the base of hillsides, it can be called "talus" or "[[scree]]".

In [[mining]], debris called ''attle'' usually consists of rock fragments which contain little or no ore.

==Marine==
{{Main|marine debris}}
[[Image:Marine debris on Hawaiian coast.jpg|thumb|[[Marine debris]] washed ashore on [[Hawaii]]]]
''Marine debris'' applies to floating garbage such as [[bottles]], [[Tin can|cans]], [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]], cruise [[ship]] waste, offshore [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] exploration and production facilities [[pollution]], and [[fishing]] paraphernalia from professional and recreational boaters. Marine debris is also called [[litter]] or [[flotsam and jetsam]]. Objects that can constitute marine debris include used [[automobile]] [[tires]], [[detergent]] [[bottles]], [[medical waste]]s, discarded fishing line and [[Net (device)|nets]], soda cans, and [[bilge]] waste solids.

In addition to being unsightly, it can pose a serious threat to marine life, [[boats]], [[human swimming|swimmers]], [[underwater diving|divers]], and others. For example, each year millions of seabirds, sea [[turtle]]s, [[fish]], and marine [[mammal]]s become entangled in marine debris, or ingest plastics which they have mistaken for food. As many as 30,000 northern fur seals per year get caught in abandoned fishing nets and either drown or suffocate. [[Whales]] mistake [[plastic]] bags for [[squid]], and [[birds]] may mistake plastic pellets for fish [[roe|eggs]]. At other times, animals accidentally eat the plastic while feeding on natural food.

The largest concentration of marine debris is the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

Marine debris most commonly originates from land-based sources. Various international agencies are currently working to reduce marine debris levels around the world.

==Meteorological==
In [[meteorology]], debris usually applies to the remains of [[human]] habitation and natural [[flora (plants)|flora]] after [[storm]] related destruction. This debris is also commonly referred to as '''storm debris'''. Storm debris commonly consists of roofing material, downed [[tree]] [[branch|limbs]], downed [[wikt:signs|signs]], downed [[power line]]s and poles, and wind-blown garbage. Storm debris can become a serious problem immediately after a storm, in that it often blocks access to individuals and communities that may require emergency services. This material frequently exists in such large quantities that disposing of it becomes a serious issue for a community. In addition, storm debris is often hazardous by its very nature, since, for example, downed power lines annually account for storm-related deaths.
{{See also|debris ball|road debris}}

==Space==
{{Main|space debris}}
''Space debris'' usually refers to the remains of [[spacecraft]] that have either fallen to [[Earth]] or are still orbiting Earth. Space debris may also consist of natural components such as chunks of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[ice]]. The problem of space debris has grown as various space programs have left legacies of launches, explosions, repairs, and discards in both low Earth [[orbit]] and more remote orbits. These orbiting fragments have reached a great enough proportion to constitute a hazard to future space launches of both [[satellite]] and manned vehicles. Various government agencies and international organizations are beginning to track space debris and also research possible solutions to the problem. While many of these  items, ranging in size from [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[Screw|bolts]] to entire satellites and spacecraft, may fall to Earth, other items located in more remote orbits may stay aloft for centuries. The velocity of some of these pieces of space junk have been clocked in excess of 17,000 miles per hour (27,000&amp;nbsp;km/h). A piece of space debris falling to Earth leaves a fiery trail, just like a [[meteor]].

A [[debris disk]] is a circumstellar disk of dust and debris in orbit around a star.

==Surgical==
In [[medicine]], debris usually refers to biological matter that has accumulated or lodged in [[surgical instruments]] and is referred to as '''surgical debris'''. The presence of surgical debris can result in cross-infections or [[nosocomial infection]]s if not removed and the affected surgical instruments or equipment properly [[disinfect]]ed.

==War==
[[Image:Boys Toys edit.jpg|thumb|right|A child plays on an abandoned tank outside [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in 1991]]
In the aftermath of a war, large areas of the region of conflict are often strewn with ''war debris'' in the form of abandoned or destroyed hardware and vehicles, mines, [[unexploded ordnance]], bullet casings and other fragments of metal.

Much war debris has the potential to be lethal and continues to kill and maim civilian populations for years after the end of a conflict. The risks from war debris may be sufficiently high to prevent or delay the return of refugees. In addition war debris may contain hazardous chemicals or radioactive components that can contaminate the land or poison civilians who come into contact with it. Many [[Mine clearance agencies]] are also involved in the clearance of war debris.

[[Land mines]] in particular are very dangerous as they can remain active for decades after a conflict, which is why they have been banned by international war regulations.

In November 2006 the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V to the 1980 Convention)
| year=2003
| publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross

came into effect with 92 countries subscribing to the treaty that requires the parties involved in a conflict to assist with the removal of unexploded ordnance following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the countries most affected by war debris are [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Laos]].

Similarly ''military debris'' may be found in and around [[firing range]]s and military training areas.

Debris can also be used as [[Cover (military)|cover]] for military purposes, depending on the situation.

==Culinary==
In South Louisiana's [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] and [[Cajun]] cultures, debris (pronounced "DAY-bree") refers to chopped organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, tripe, spleen, brain, lungs and pancreas.

In energy monitoring and targeting, a '''driving factor''' is something recurrent and measurable whose variation explains variation in energy consumption. The term ''independent variable'' is sometimes used as a synonym.

One of the most common driving factors is the weather, expressed usually as heating or cooling [[degree day]]s. In energy-intensive processes, production throughputs would usually be used. For electrical circuits feeding outdoor lighting, the number of hours of darkness can be employed. For a borehole pump, the quantity of water delivered would be used; and so on. What these examples all have in common is that on a weekly basis (say) numerical values can be recorded for each factor and one would expect particular streams of energy consumption to correlate with them either singly or in a multi-variate model.

Correlation is arguably more important than causality. Variation in the driving factor merely has to ''explain'' variation in consumption; it does not necessarily have to ''cause'' it, although that will in most scenarios be the case.

Driving factors differ from ''static'' factors, such as building floor areas, which determine energy consumption but change only rarely (if at all).

The Dukhin number is a ratio of the [[surface conductivity]] &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\kappa^{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; to the fluid bulk electrical conductivity K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; multiplied by particle size ''a'':

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Du} = \frac{\kappa^{\sigma}}{{\Kappa_m}a}.&lt;/math&gt;

There is another expression of this number that is valid when the surface conductivity is associated only with ions motion above the [[slipping plane]] in the [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. In this case, the value of the surface conductivity depends on ζ-potential, which leads to the following expression for the Dukhin number for symmetrical electrolyte with equal ions [[diffusion coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Du} = \frac{2(1+3m/z^2)}{{\kappa}a}\left(\mathrm{cosh}\frac{zF\zeta}{2RT}-1\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the parameter ''m'' characterizes the contribution of [[electro-osmosis]] into motion of ions within the double layer

:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\eta F^2 D}.&lt;/math&gt;

* ''F'' is [[Faraday constant]]
* ''T'' is [[absolute temperature]]
* ''R'' is [[gas constant]]
* ''C'' is ions concentration in bulk
* ''z'' is [[ion]] [[valence (chemistry)|valency]]
* ζ is [[electrokinetic potential]]
* ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[vacuum]] [[dielectric]] [[permittivity]]
* ε&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is fluid dielectric permittivity

'''Ecosystem health''' is a metaphor used to describe the condition of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=rapport1998&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Defining ecosystem health." Pages 18-33 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health.'' Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem condition can vary as a result of fire, [[flooding]], [[drought]], [[extinction]]s, [[invasive species]], [[climate change]], [[mining]], [[overexploitation]] in [[fishing]], [[farming]] or [[logging]], [[chemical spill]]s, and a host of other reasons. There is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1992). "Evaluating ecosystem health." ''Journal of aquatic ecosystem health'' 1:15-24&lt;/ref&gt; rather the apparent health status of an ecosystem can vary depending upon which health metrics are employed in judging it&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment. Advocates of the health metaphor argue for its simplicity as a communication tool. "Policy-makers and the public need simple, understandable concepts like health."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Judy L. (1997). "Stream health: incorporating the human dimension to advance stream ecology." ''Journal of the North American Benthological Society'' 16:439^447&lt;/ref&gt; Critics worry that ecosystem health, a "value-laden construct", is often "passed off as science to unsuspecting policy makers and the public."&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2007). "Science, scientists, and policy advocacy." ''Conservation Biology.'' 21(1): 12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
== History of the concept ==

The health metaphor applied to the environment has been in use at least since the early 1800s&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1816). "Rural economy, agricultur

''Framer's Magazine, '' 2(5):337-338.&lt;/ref&gt; and the great American conservationist [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1948) spoke metaphorically of land health, land sickness, mutilation, and violence when describing land use practices.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo (1946). "The land health concept and conservation." Pages 218-226 in Callicott, J. Baird, and Eric T.Freyfogle. (1999) ''For the Health of the Land. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem management" has been in use at least since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, H.J. (1957). "Applications of ecology in forest management." ''Ecology'' 38:46-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem health" has become widespread in the ecological literature, as a general metaphor meaning something good,&lt;ref name=Jax2010&gt;Jax, Kurt. (2010). ''Ecosystem Functioning.'' Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and as an environmental quality goal in field assessments of rivers,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, P.E. et al. (2010). "The Sustainable Rivers Audit: assessing river ecosystem health in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia." ''Marine and Freshwater Research'' 61:764–777.&lt;/ref&gt; lakes,&lt;ref&gt;Xu, F, ZF Yang, B.

''Journal of Forestry'' 95:23-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently however this metaphor has been subject of quantitative formulation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramírez-Carrillo|first=Elvia|last2=López-Corona|first2=Oliver|last3=Toledo-Roy|first3=Juan C.|last4=Lovett|first4=Jon C.|last5=León-González|first5=Fernando de|last6=Osorio-Olvera|first6=Luis|last7=Equihua|first7=Julian|last8=Robredo|first8=Everardo|last9=Frank|first9=Alejandro|date=2018-07-16|title=Assessing sustainability in North America’s ecosystems using criticality and information theory|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=7|pages=e0200382|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; using complex systems concepts such as criticality, meaning that a healthy ecosystem is in some sort of balance between adaptability (randomness) and robustness (order) . Nevertheless the universality of criticality is still under examination and is known as the Criticality Hypothesis, which states that systems in a dynamic regime shifting between order and disorder, attain the highest level of computational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility. Recent results in cell and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and computer science have great interest in the criticality hypothesis, emphasizing its role as a viable candidate general law in the realm of adaptive complex systems (see &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roli|first=Andrea|last2=Villani|first2=Marco|last3=Filisetti|first3=Alessandro|last4=Serra|first4=Roberto|date=2017-11-17|title=Dynamical Criticality: Overview and Open Questions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|journal=Journal of Systems Science and Complexity|volume=31|issue=3|pages=647–663|doi=10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|issn=1009-6124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and references therein).

== Meaning ==

The term ecosystem health has been employed to embrace some suite of environmental goals deemed desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Slocombe, D. Scott (1998). "Defining Goals and Criteria for Ecosystem-Based Management." ''Environmental Management'' 22:483–493&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Grumbine's highly cited paper&lt;ref name=grumbine1994&gt;Grumbine, R. Edward (1994). "What is ecosystem management?" ''Conservation Biology'' 8:27-38&lt;/ref&gt; "What is ecosystem management?" surveyed ecosystem management and ecosystem health literature and summarized frequently encountered goal statements:
* Conserving [[viable population]]s of [[native species]]
* Conserving [[ecosystem diversity]]
* Maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes
* Managing over long time frames to maintain evolutionary potential
* Accommodating human use and occupancy within these constraints

Grumbine describes each of these goals as a "value statement" and stresses the role of human [[values]] in setting ecosystem management goals.

It is the last goal mentioned in the survey, accommodating humans, that is most contentious. "We have observed that when groups of stakeholders work to define … visions, this leads to debate over whether to emphasize ecosystem health or human well-being … Whether the priority is ecosystems or people greatly influences stakeholders' assessment of desirable ecological and social states."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, heather M. and Karen L. McLeod (2007). "Confronting the challenges of implementing marine ecosystem-based management." ''Frontiers of Ecology and the Environment'' 5:540-548.&lt;/ref&gt; and, for example, "For some, [[wolves]] are critical to ecosystem health and an essential part of nature, for others they are a symbol of government overreach threatening their livelihoods and cultural values."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Andrew (2015). Which wolf, which trap? Socially constructing wolves and trapping in western Montana. ''Scholar Works'', University of Montana, Oral Presentations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring ecosystem health requires extensive goal-driven environmental sampling. For example, a vision for ecosystem health of [[Lake Superior]] was developed by a public forum and a series of objectives were prepared for [[habitat protection|protection of habitat]] and maintenance of populations of some 70 indigenous fish species.&lt;ref name=horns2003&gt;Horns, W.H., et al. (2003). '' Fish-community objectives for Lake Superior. '' Great Lakes Fish. Commission Special Publication. 03-01. 78 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; A suite of 80 lake health indicators was developed for the Great Lakes Basin including monitoring native fish species, exotic species, water levels, phosphorus levels, toxic chemicals, [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], fish tissue contaminants, etc.&lt;ref name=Shear2003&gt;Shear, Harvey et al. (2003). "The development and implementation of indicators of ecosystem health in the Great Lakes Basin." ''Journal of Environmental Monitoring and Assessment'' 88:119–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have attempted broad definitions of ecosystem health, such as benchmarking as healthy the historical ecosystem state "prior to the onset of [[anthropocene|anthropogenic stress]]."&lt;ref name=rapport2011&gt;Rapport, David J. and • Luisa Maffi  (2011). "Eco-cultural health, global health, and sustainability." ''Ecological Research'' 26:1039-1049&lt;/ref&gt; A difficulty is that the historical composition of many human-altered ecosystems is unknown or unknowable. Also, [[fossil record|fossil]] and [[pollen]] records indicate that the species that occupy an ecosystem [[ecologic succession|reshuffle]] through time, so it is difficult to identify one snapshot in time as optimum or "healthy.".&lt;ref name=wicklum1995&gt;Wicklum, D. and Ronald W. Davies (1995). "Ecosystem health and integrity?" ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 73:997-1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly cited broad definition states that a healthy ecosystem has three attributes:
# [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]],
# [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]], and
# "organization" (including [[biodiversity]]).&lt;ref name=rapport2011 /&gt;

While this captures significant ecosystem properties, a generalization is elusive as those properties do not necessarily co-vary in nature. For example, there is not necessarily a clear or consistent relationship between productivity and species richness.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Peter et al. (2011). "Productivity is a poor predictor of plant species richness." ''Science'' 333:1750-1752.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the relationship between  [[System resilience|resilience]] and diversity is complex, and [[ecosystem stability]] may depend upon one or a few species rather than overall diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, Anthony R. and Stephen R. Carpenter (2007). "Stability and Diversity of Ecosystems." ''Science'' 317:58-62.&lt;/ref&gt; And some undesirable ecosystems are highly productive.&lt;ref&gt;Asanova, Umut (2002). "Philosophy of ecological ethics education, considering the Issyk-Kul Lake reediation mechanisms." Jean Klerkx and Beishen Imanakanov (2002). Lake Issk-Kul: Its natural Environment Springer Science&lt;/ref&gt;

"Resilience is not desirable per se. There can be highly resilient states of ecosystems which are very undesirable from some human perspectives , such as algal-dominated [[coral reef]]s."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; Ecological [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] is a "capacity" that varies depending upon which properties of the ecosystem are to be studied and depending upon what kinds of disturbances are considered and how they are to be quantified.  Approaches to assessing it "face high uncertainties and still require a considerable amount of empirical and theoretical research."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Other authors have sought a numerical index of ecosystem health that would permit quantitative comparisons among ecosystems and within ecosystems over time.  One such system employs ratings of the three properties mentioned above: Health = system vigor x system organization x [[system resilience]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. 1992. "Toward an operational definition of ecosystem health." Pp 239-256 in Costanza, R., B. Norton, and B. Haskell. ''Ecosystem health. New Goals for Environmental Management. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologist Glenn Suter argues that such indices employ "nonsense units," the indices have "no meaning; they cannot be predicted, so they are not applicable to most regulatory problems; they have no diagnostic power; effects of one component are eclipsed by responses of other components, and the reason for a high or low index value is unknown."&lt;ref name=suter1993&gt;Suter, Glenn W. (1993). "A critique of ecosystem health concepts and indexes." ''Environmental toxicology and chemistry'' 12:1533-1539.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health indicators ==

Health [[Performance metric|metrics]] are determined by stakeholder goals, which drive ecosystem definition. An ecosystem is an abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2007). "Can we define ecosystems? On the confusion between definition and description of ecological concepts." ''Acta Biotheor'' 55:341–355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oneill2001&gt;O'Neill, Robert V. (2001). "Is it time to bury the ecosystem concept? (with full military honors, of course!)" ''Ecology'' 82:3275–3284&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ecosystems cannot be identified or found in nature. Instead, they must be delimited by an observer. This can be done in many different ways for the same chunk of nature, depending on the specific perspectives of interest."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Ecosystem definition determines the acceptable range of variability (reference conditions) and determines measurement variables. The latter are used as indicators of ecosystem structure and function, and can be used as indicators of "health".

An [[Environmental indicator|indicator]] is a variable, such as a chemical or biological property, that when measured, is used to infer trends in another (unmeasured) environmental variable or cluster of unmeasured variables (the indicandum). For example, rising [[mortality rate]] of canaries in a coal mine is an indicator of rising [[carbon monoxide]] levels. Rising [[chlorophyll-a]] levels in a lake may signal [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David A. and Pamela Welbourne (2002) ''Environmental Toxicology''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystem assessments employ two kinds of indicators, descriptive indicators and normative indicators. "Indicators can be used descriptively for a scientific purpose or normatively for a political purpose."&lt;ref name=heink2010&gt;Heink, Ulrich and Ingo Kowarik (2010) "What are indicators? On the definition of indicators in ecology and environmental planning." ''Ecological Indicators'' 10:584–593&lt;/ref&gt;

Used descriptively, high chlorophyll-a is an indicator of eutrophication, but it may also be used as an ecosystem health indicator. When used as a normative (health) indicator, it indicates a rank on a health scale, a rank that can vary widely depending on societal preferences as to what is desirable. A high chlorophyll-a level in a natural [[ecological succession|successional]] [[wetland]] might be viewed as healthy whereas a human-impacted wetland with the ''same'' indicator value may be judged unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza,  Robert, and Michael Mageau (1999). "What is a healthy ecosystem?" ''Aquatic Ecology'' 33: 105–115&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimation of ecosystem health has been criticized for intermingling the two types of environmental indicators.&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael (2006). "The values and vulnerabilities of metaphors within the environmental sciences." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:921–930&lt;/ref&gt; A health indicator is a normative indicator, and if conflated with descriptive indicators "implies that normative values can be measured objectively, which is certainly not true. Thus, implicit values are insinuated to the reader, a situation which has to be avoided."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

It can be argued that the very act of selecting indicators of any kind is [[bias]]ed by the observer's perspective&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2005). "Function and 'functioning' in ecology: what does it mean?" ''Oikos'' 111:3&lt;/ref&gt; but separation of goals from descriptions has been advocated as a step toward transparency:  "A separation of descriptive and normative indicators is essential from the perspective of the philosophy of science … Goals and values cannot be deduced directly from descriptions … a fact that is emphasized repeatedly in the literature of environmental ethics … Hence, we advise always specifying the definition of indicators and propose clearly distinguishing ecological indicators in science from policy indicators used for decision-making processes."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

And integration of multiple, possibly conflicting, normative indicators into a single measure of "ecosystem health" is problematic. Using 56 indicators, "determining environmental status and assessing [[marine ecosystem]]s health in an integrative way is still one of the grand challenges in marine ecosystems ecology, research and management"&lt;ref&gt;Borja A, et al. (2014). "Tales from a thousand and one ways to integrate marine ecosystem components when assessing the environmental status." ''Frontiers in Marine Science''. 1:72&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue with indicators is validity. Good indicators must have an independently validated high [[Predictive value of tests|predictive value]], that is high [[sensitivity (control systems)|sensitivity]] (high probability of indicating a significant change in the indicandum) and high [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]] (low probability of wrongly indicating a change). The reliability of various health metrics has been questioned&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Guy, et al. (2012). Continental-wide effects of nutrient pollution on stream ecosystem functioning. ''Science'', 336:1448-1440.&lt;/ref&gt; and "what combination of measurements should be used to evaluate ecosystems is a matter of current scientific debate."&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; Most attempts to identify ecological indicators have been [[correlation|correlative]] rather than derived from prospective testing of their predictive value&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Philip S. et al. (2015). "Learning from clinical medicine to improve the use of surrogates in ecology." ''Oikos'' 124:391-398.&lt;/ref&gt; and the selection process for many indicators has been based upon weak evidence or has been lacking in evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed A.H. et al. (2016). "How do ecologists select and use indicator species to monitor ecological change? Insights from 14 years of publication in ''Ecological Indicators''." ''Ecological Indicator''s 60:223-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases no reliable indicators are known: "We found no examples of [[invertebrates]] successfully used in [forest] monitoring programs. Their richness and abundance ensure that they play significant roles in ecosystem function but thwart focus on a few key species." And, "Reviews of species-based monitoring approaches reveal that no single species, nor even a group of species, accurately reflects entire communities. Understanding the response of a single species may not provide reliable predictions about a group of species even when the group is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a few very similar species."&lt;ref&gt;Kremsater, Laurie L. and Fred L. Bunnell (2009). "Sustaining forest-dwelling species." Pages 173-218 in Bunnell, Fred L. and Glen B. Dunsworth (2009). ''Forestry and Biodiversity''. Learning how to Sustain Biodiversity in Managed Forests. UBC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to human health: the health paradox ==

A trade-off between human health and the "health" of nature has been termed the "health paradox"&lt;ref&gt;C. Max Finlayson and Pierre Horwitz (2015). "Wetlands as settings for human health – the benefits and the paradox."  Pages 1-13 in Finlayson, C.M. et al. 2015. ''Wetlands and Human Health''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and it illuminates how human values drive perceptions of ecosystem health.

Human health has benefited by sacrificing the "health" of wild ecosystems, such as dismantling and [[dam]]ming of wild valleys, destruction of [[mosquito]]-bearing [[wetlands]], diversion of water for [[irrigation]], conversion of wilderness to [[farmland]], [[timber]] removal, and [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of [[tiger]]s, whales, ferrets, and [[wolves]].

There has been an acrimonious schism among [[conservation movement|conservationists]] and resource managers&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Heather and  &amp; Jane Lubchenco  (2014) "Working together: A call for inclusive conservation." ''Nature'' 515, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tudela, Sergi and Katherine Short (2005). "Paradigm shifts, gaps, inertia, and political agendas in ecosystem-based fisheries management." ''Marine Ecology Progress Series'' 300:282-286.&lt;/ref&gt; over the question of whether to "ratchet back human domination of the biosphere" or whether to embrace it.&lt;ref&gt;Noss, Redd et al. (2013). "Humanity's domination of nature is part of the problem: a response to Kareiva and Marvier." ''BioScience'' 63:241-242&lt;/ref&gt; These two perspectives have been characterized as utilitarian vs protectionist.&lt;ref&gt;Nijhius, Michelle (2014). "Bridging the conservation divide."  New Yorker, December 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[utilitarian]] view treats [[human health]] and [[well-being]] as criteria of ecosystem health.&lt;ref&gt;Su, Meirong et al. (2010)."Urban ecosystem health assessment: A review." ''Science of the Total Environment'' 408:2425–2434&lt;/ref&gt; For example, destruction of wetlands to control malaria mosquitoes "resulted in an improvement in ecosystem health."&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1998). "Some distinctions worth making." ''Ecosystem Health'' 4:193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;
The protectionist view treats humans as an invasive species: "If there was ever a species that qualified as an invasive pest, it is ''Homo sapiens'',"&lt;ref name=Oneill2001 /&gt;

Proponents of the utilitarian view argue that "healthy ecosystems are characterized by their capability to sustain healthy human populations,"&lt;ref name=rapport1998 /&gt; and "healthy ecosystems must be economically viable," as it is "unhealthy" ecosystems that are likely to result in increases in [[contamination]], [[infectious disease]]s, fires, floods, [[crop failure]]s and fishery collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Dimensions of ecosystem health." Pages 34-40 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health''. Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protectionist]]s argue that privileging of human health is a [[conflict of interest]] as humans have [[ecosystem destruction|demolished]] massive numbers of ecosystems to maintain their welfare, also disease and [[parasitism]] are historically normal in pre-industrial nature.&lt;ref name=wilkins1999&gt;Wilkins, D.A. (1999). "Assessing ecosystem health."  ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 14:70&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases and parasites promote ecosystem functioning, driving biodiversity and productivity,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Peter J., Andrew P. Dobson and Kevin D. Lafferty (2006). "Is a healthy ecosystem one that is rich in parasites?" ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 21:381-385.&lt;/ref&gt; and parasites may constitute a significant fraction of ecosystem biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Kuris, Armand M. et al. (2008). "Ecosystem energetic implications of parasite and free-living biomass in three estuaries." ''Nature'' 454:515-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very choice of the word "health" applied to ecology has been questioned as lacking in neutrality in a BioScience article on responsible use of scientific language: "Some conservationists fear that these terms could endorse human domination of the planet … and could exacerbate the shifting cognitive baseline whereby humans tend to become accustomed to new and often degraded ecosystems and thus forget the nature of the past."&lt;ref&gt;Kueffer, Christoph and Brendon M. H. Larson (2014). "Responsible Use of Language in Scientific Writing and Science Communication." ''BioScience'' 64(8): 719–724.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the concept and proposed alternatives ==

Criticism of ecosystem health largely targets the failure of proponents to explicitly distinguish the normative dimension from the descriptive dimension, and has included the following:
* Ecosystem health is in the eye of the beholder. It is an economic, political or ethical judgement rather than a scientific measure of environmental quality. Health ratings are shaped by the goals and preferences of environmental stakeholders.&lt;ref name=lancaster2000&gt;Lancaster, Jill (2000). "The Ridiculous Notion of Assessing Ecological Health and Identifying the Useful Concepts Underneath."''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' 6: 213-222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael S. (2006). "Science, Expertise, and the Democratization of the Decision-Making Process." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:661–668&lt;/ref&gt; "At the core of debates over the utility of ecosystem health is a struggle over which societal preferences will take precedence."&lt;ref name=lackey2003&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2003). "Appropriate use of ecosystem health and normative science in ecological policy" Pages. 175-186 in: Rapport, David J. et al. (2003)  ''Managing for Healthy Ecosystems ''  Boca Raton, Florida: Lewis Publishers, , 1510 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Health is a metaphor, not a property of an ecosystem. Health is an abstraction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10327">'''Electroacoustic phenomena''' arise when [[ultrasound]] propagates through a [[fluid]] containing [[ions]]. The associated particle motion generates [[electric]] signals because ions have [[electric charge]]. This coupling between ultrasound and [[electric field]] is called electroacoustic phenomena. The fluid might be a simple [[Newtonian liquid]], or complex [[heterogeneous]] [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]], [[emulsion]] or even a porous body. There are several different electroacoustic effects depending on the nature of the fluid.

*[[Ion vibration current]] (IVI) and potential, an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] fluid.
*[[Streaming vibration current]] (SVI) and potential, an electric signal that arises when an acoustic wave propagates through a porous body in which the pores are filled with fluid.
*[[Colloid vibration current]] (CVI) and potential, an electric signal that arises when ultrasound propagates through a [[heterogeneous]] fluid, such as a [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] or [[emulsion]].
*[[Electric sonic amplitude]] (ESA), the inverse of the CVI effect, in which an acoustic field arises when an [[electric field]] propagates through a [[heterogeneous]] fluid.

==Ion vibration current==
{{main|Ion vibration current}}
Historically, the IVI was the first known electroacoustic effect. It was predicted by Debye in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Debye.P."A method for the determination of the mass of electrolyte ions"J. Chem. Phys., 1,13-16,1933&lt;/ref&gt;

==Streaming vibration current==
{{main|Streaming vibration current}}
The streaming vibration current was experimentally observed in 1948 by Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams.M. " An Electrokinetic Transducer" The review of scientific instruments, 19, 10, 640-646, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical model was developed some 30 years later by Dukhin and others.&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S., Mischuk, N.A., Kuz'menko, B.B and Il'in, B.I. "Flow current and potential in a high-frequency acoustic field" Colloid J., 45, 5, 875-881,1983&lt;/ref&gt; This effect opens another possibility for characterizing the electric properties of the surfaces in porous bodies. A similar effect can be observed at a non-porous surface, when sound is bounced off at an oblique angle. The incident and reflected waves superimpose to cause oscillatory fluid motion in the plane of the interface, thereby generating an AC streaming current at the frequency of the sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;Glauser, A.R., Robertson P.A., Lowe, C.R., "An electrokinetic sensor for studying immersed surfaces, using focused ultrasound" Sensors Actuators B, 80, 1, 68-82, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double layer compression==
The [[electrical double layer]] can be regarded as behaving like a parallel plate capacitor with a compressible dielectric filling. When sound waves induce a local pressure variation, the spacing of the plates varies at the frequency of the excitation, generating an AC displacement current normal to the interface. For practical reasons this is most readily observed at a conducting surface.&lt;ref&gt;F.I. Kukoz, L.A. Kukoz, "The nature of audioelectro-chemical phenomena" Russ. J. Phys. Chem. 36 (1962) pp. 367-369&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore possible to use an electrode immersed in a conducting electrolyte as a microphone, or indeed as a loudspeaker when the effect is applied in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;N. Tankovsky, "Capacitive ultrasound transducer, based on the electrical double layer in electrolytes" J. App. Phys. 87 (2000) pp. 538-542&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloid vibration potential and current==
{{main|Colloid vibration current}}
Colloid vibration potential measures the AC potential difference generated between two identical relaxed electrodes, placed in the dispersion, if the latter is subjected to an ultrasonic field. When a sound wave travels through a colloidal suspension of particles whose density differs from that of the surrounding medium, inertial forces induced by the vibration of the suspension give rise to a motion of the charged particles relative to the liquid, causing an alternating electromotive force. The manifestations of this electromotive force may be measured, depending on the relation between the impedance of the suspension and that of the measuring instrument, either as colloid vibration potential or as ''colloid vibration current''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Colloid vibration potential and current was first reported by Hermans and then independently by Rutgers in 1938. It is widely used for characterizing the ζ-potential of various dispersions and emulsions. The effect, theory, experimental verification and multiple applications are discussed in the book by Dukhin and Goetz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dukhin |first=A.S. |authorlink= |author2=Goetz, P.J. |title=Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids |accessdate=2007-10-03 |date=2002 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |pages=153 |chapter=Electroacoustic Theory |chapterurl=http://www.dispersion.com/pages/theory/electroacoustictheory/electoracoustictheory.html |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electric sonic amplitude==
{{main|Electric sonic amplitude}}
Electric sonic amplitude was experimentally discovered by Cannon with co-authors in early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Oja, T., Petersen, G., and Cannon, D. "Measurement of Electric-Kinetic Properties of a Solution", US Patent 4,497,208,1985&lt;/ref&gt; It is also widely used for characterizing ζ-potential in dispersions and emulsions. There is review of this effect theory, experimental verification and multiple applications published by Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R.J. "Review. Recent developments in the electroacoustic characterization of colloidal suspensions and emulsions", Colloids and Surfaces, 141, 37-65, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of CVI and ESA==
With regard to the theory of CVI and ESA, there was an important observation made by O'Brien,&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, R.W. "Electro-acoustic effects in a dilute suspension of spherical particles" J. Fluid Mech., 190, 71-86,1988&lt;/ref&gt; who linked these measured parameters with [[dynamic electrophoretic mobility]] μ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI(ESA) = A\phi\mu_d\frac{\rho_p-\rho_m}{\rho_m}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: A is calibration constant, depending on frequency, but not particles properties;
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is particle density,
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; density of the fluid,
: φ is volume fraction of dispersed phase,

Dynamic electrophoretic mobility is similar to [[electrophoretic mobility]] that appears in [[electrophoresis]] theory. They are identical at low frequencies and/or for sufficiently small particles.

There are several theories of the dynamic electrophoretic mobility. Their overview is given in the Ref.5. Two of them are the most important.

The first one corresponds to the Smoluchowski limit. It yields following simple expression for CVI for sufficiently small particles with negligible CVI frequency dependence:

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI(ESA) = A\phi\frac{\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m\zeta\Kappa_s}{\eta\Kappa_m}\frac{\rho_p-\rho_s}{\rho_s}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: ε&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt; is vacuum dielectric permittivity,
: ε&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is fluid dielectric permittivity,
: ζ is [[electrokinetic potential]]
: η is dynamic viscosity of the fluid,
: K&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is conductivity of the system,
: K&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is conductivity of the fluid,
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is density of the system.

This remarkably simple equation has same wide range of applicability as Smoluchowski equation  for [[electrophoresis]]. It is independent on shape of the particles, their concentration.

Validity of this equation is restricted with the following two requirements.
  
First, it is valid only for a thin [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]], when the [[Debye length]] is much smaller than particle's radius a:
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}a &gt;&gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

Secondly, it neglects the contribution of the [[surface conductivity]]. This assumes a small [[Dukhin number]]:
:&lt;math&gt; Du &lt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

Restriction of the thin double layer limits applicability of this Smoluchowski type theory only to aqueous systems with sufficiently large particles and not very low ionic strength. This theory does not work well for nano-colloids, including proteins and polymers at low ionic strength. It is not valid for low- or non-polar fluids.

There is another theory that is applicable for the other extreme case of a thick double layer, when  
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}a &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

This theory takes into consideration the double layer overlap that inevitably occurs for concentrated systems with thick double layer. This allows introduction of so-called "quasi-homogeneous" approach, when overlapped diffuse layers of particles cover the complete interparticle space. The theory becomes much simplified in this extreme case, as shown by Shilov and others.&lt;ref&gt;Shilov, V.N., Borkovskaya, Y.B. and Dukhin A.S. "Electroacoustic theory for concentrated colloids with overlapped DLs at arbitrary ka. Application to nanocolloids and nonaqueous colloids". JCIS, 277, 347-358 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Their derivation predicts that surface charge density σ is a better parameter than ζ-potential for characterizing electroacoustic phenomena in such systems. An expression for CVI simplified for small particles follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI = A\frac{2{\sigma}a}{3\eta}\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}\frac{\rho_p-\rho_s}{\rho_s}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="58539">'''Emergy''' is the amount of energy that was consumed in direct and indirect transformations to make a product or service.&lt;ref name="EnvAcct"&gt;{{cite book|first = Howard T.|title = Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making|url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=P-ssAQAAMAAJ|page=370}}|year = 1996|publisher = Wiley|isbn = 978-0-471-11442-0|p = 370|last = Odum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergy is a measure of quality differences between different forms of energy. Emergy is an expression of all the energy used in the work processes that generate a product or service in units of one type of energy. Emergy is measured in units of ''emjoule''s, a unit referring to the available energy consumed in transformations. Emergy accounts for different forms of energy and resources (e.g. sunlight, water, fossil fuels, minerals, etc.) Each form is generated by transformation processes in nature and each has a different ability to support work in natural and in human systems. The recognition of these quality differences is a key concept.

==History==

The theoretical and conceptual basis for the emergy methodology is grounded in [[thermodynamics]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, [[System theory|general system theory]]&lt;ref&gt;von Bertalanffy. L. 1968. [[System theory|General System Theory]]. George Braziller Publ. New York 295 p.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems ecology]].&lt;ref name=SysEco&gt;Odum, H. T. 1983.

Odum]] over the first thirty years is reviewed in ''Environmental Accounting''&lt;ref name =EnvAcct/&gt; and in the volume edited by C. A. S. Hall titled ''Maximum Power''.&lt;ref name=SelfOrg&gt;Odum, H.T., 1995. Self organization and maximum power. Chapter 28, pp. 311-364 in ''Maximum Power'', Ed. by C .A. S. Hall, University Press of Colorado, Niwot.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===

Beginning in the 1950s, Odum analyzed [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] in ecosystems (''e.g.'' [[Silver Springs, Florida]];&lt;ref name=SilverSprings&gt;Odum, H. T. 1957.  Trophic structure and productivity of Silver Springs, Florida.  ''Ecol. Monogr''. 27:55-112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak atoll]] in the south Pacific;&lt;ref name=Eniwetok&gt;Odum, H. T. and E. P. Odum. 1955.  Trophic structure and productivity of a windward coral reef at Eniwetok Atoll, Marshall Islands.  ''Ecol. Monogr.'' 25:291-320.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galveston Bay]], Texas&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;Odum, H. T. and C. M. Hoskin. 1958.  Comparative studies of the metabolism of Texas Bays.  ''Pubi. Inst. Mar. Sci.'', Univ. Tex. 5:16-46.&lt;/ref&gt; and Puerto Rican rainforests,&lt;ref name=PR&gt;Odum, H. T. and R. F. Pigeon, eds. 1970.  ''A Tropical Rain Forest''.  Division of Technical Information, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. 1600 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others) where energies in various forms at various scales were observed. His analysis of energy flow in ecosystems, and the differences in the [[potential energy]] of sunlight, fresh water currents, wind and [[ocean current]]s led him to make the suggestion that when two or more different energy sources drive a system, they cannot be added without first converting them to a common measure that accounts for their differences in energy quality. This led him to introduce the concept of "energy of one kind" as a common denominator with the name "energy cost".&lt;ref name=FoodProd&gt;Odum, H. T. 1967.  Energetics of food production.  In: The ''World Food Problem, Report of the President's Science Advisory Committee, Panel on World Food Supply, Vol. 3''. The Whitehouse. pp. 55-94.&lt;/ref&gt; He then expanded the analysis to model food production in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=FoodProd /&gt; and in the 1970s to [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name= Congress&gt;Odum, H. T. ''et al.'' 1976.  Net Energy Analysis of Alternatives for the United States.  In ''U.S. Energy Policy: Trends and Goals'',  Part V – Middle and Long-term Energy Policies and Alternatives. 94th Congress 2nd Session Committee Print.  Prepared for the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives, 66-723, U.S. Govt.  Printing Office, Wash, DC. pp. 254–304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Man&amp;Nature&gt;Odum, H. T. and E. C. Odum. 1976.  ''Energy Basis for Man and Nature''. McGraw-Hill, NY. 297 pp&lt;/ref&gt;

Odum's first formal statement of what would later be termed emergy was in 1973:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Energy is measured by calories, [[btu]]'s, kilowatthours, and other intraconvertable units, but energy has a scale of quality which is not indicated by these measures.  The ability to do work for man depends on the energy quality and quantity and this is measurable by the amount of energy of a lower quality grade required to develop the higher grade. The scale of energy goes from dilute sunlight up to plant matter, to coal, from coal to oil, to electricity and up to the high quality efforts of computer and human [[information processing]].&lt;ref name=AMBIO&gt;Odum, H. T. 1973.  ''Energy, ecology and economics''.  Royal Swedish Academy of Science.  AMBIO 2(6):220-227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1975, he introduced a table of "Energy Quality Factors", kilocalories of sunlight energy required to make a kilocalorie of a higher quality energy,&lt;ref name=NRGQuality&gt;Odum, H. T. 1976.  'Energy quality and carrying capacity of the earth.  Response at Prize Ceremony, Institute de la Vie, Paris.  ''Tropical Ecology'' 16(l):1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; the first mention of the energy hierarchy principle which states that "energy quality is measured by the energy used in the transformations" from one type of energy to the next.

These energy quality factors, were placed on a fossil-fuel basis and called "Fossil Fuel Work Equivalents" (FFWE), and the quality of energies were measured based on a fossil fuel standard with rough equivalents of 1 kilocalorie of fossil fuel equal to 2000 kilocalories of sunlight. "Energy quality ratios" were computed by evaluating the quantity of energy in a transformation process to make a new form and were then used to convert different forms of energy to a common form, in this case fossil fuel equivalents. FFWE's were replaced with coal equivalents (CE) and by 1977, the system of evaluating quality was placed on a solar basis and termed solar equivalents (SE).&lt;ref name=NRGAnalysis&gt;Odum, H. T. 1977.  Energy analysis, energy quality and environment.  In ''Energy Analysis: A New Public Policy Tool'', M. W. Gilliland, ed.  American Association for the Advancement of Science, Selected Symposium No. 9, Wash. DC. Westview Press. pp. 55–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodied energy===

The term "[[embodied energy]]" was used for a time in the early 1980s to refer to energy quality differences in terms of their costs of generation, and a ratio called a "quality factor" for the calories (or joules) of one kind of energy required to make those of another.&lt;ref name=EnvEdu&gt;Odum, E. C., and Odum, H. T., 1980. Energy systems and environmental education. Pp. 213–231 in: ''Environmental Education- Principles, Methods and Applications'', Ed. by T. S. Bakshi and Z. Naveh. Plenum Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the term embodied energy was used by other groups who were evaluating the fossil fuel energy required to generate products and were not including all energies or using the concept to imply quality, embodied energy was dropped in favor of "embodied solar calories", and the quality factors became known as "transformation ratios".

===Introduction of the term "emergy"===

Use of the term "embodied energy" for this concept was modified in 1986 when [[David M. Scienceman|David Scienceman]], a visiting scholar at the University of Florida from Australia, suggested the term "emergy" and "emjoule" or "emcalorie" as the unit of measure to distinguish emergy units from units of available energy.&lt;ref&gt;Scienceman, D. M., 1987. "Energy and Emergy," in G. Pillet and T. Murota (eds), ''Environmental Economics: The Analysis of a Major Interface,'' R. Leimgruber, Geneva, pp. 257–276. (CFW-86-26)&lt;/ref&gt; The term transformation ratio was shortened to [[transformity]] in about the same time. It is important to note that throughout this twenty years the baseline or the basis for evaluating forms of energy and resources shifted from organic matter, to fossil fuels and finally to solar energy.

After 1986, the emergy methodology continued to develop as the community of scientists expanded and as new applied research into combined systems of humans and nature presented new conceptual and theoretical questions. The maturing of the emergy methodology resulted in more rigorous definitions of terms and nomenclature and refinement of the methods of calculating transformities. The [http://EmergySociety.org International Society for the Advancement of Emergy Research] and a biennial [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611231212/http://www.cep.ees.ufl.edu/conference.asp International Conference] at the University of Florida support this research.

==Definitions and examples==

'''''Emergy'''''— amount of energy of one form that is used in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or service. The unit of emergy is the '''emjoule''' or emergy joule. Using emergy, sunlight, fuel, electricity, and human service can be put on a common basis by expressing each of them in the emjoules of solar energy that is required to produce them. If solar emergy is the baseline, then the results are solar emjoules (abbreviated seJ). Although other baselines have been used, such as coal emjoules or electrical emjoules, in most cases emergy data are given in solar emjoules.

'''''Unit Emergy Values (UEVs)''''' — the emergy required to generate one unit of output. Types of UEVs:
:'''''Transformity''''' — emergy input per unit of available energy output. For example, if 10,000 solar emjoules are required to generate a joule of wood, then the solar transformity of that wood is 10,000 solar emjoules per joule (abbreviated seJ/J). The solar transformity of the sunlight absorbed by the earth is 1.0 by definition.

:'''''Specific emergy''''' — emergy per unit mass output. Specific emergy is usually expressed as solar emergy per gram (seJ/g). Because energy is required to concentrate materials, the unit emergy value of any substance increases with concentration. Elements and compounds not abundant in nature therefore have higher emergy/mass ratios when found in concentrated form since more environmental work is required to concentrate them, both spatially and chemically.

:'''''Emergy per unit money''''' — the emergy supporting the generation of one unit of economic product (expressed in monetary terms)''.'' It is used to convert money into emergy units. Since money is paid for goods and services, but not to the environment, the contribution to a process represented by monetary payments is the emergy that money purchases. The amount of resources that money buys depends on the amount of emergy supporting the economy and the amount of money circulating. An average emergy/money ratio in solar emjoules/$ can be calculated by dividing the total emergy use of a state or nation by its gross economic product. It varies by country and has been shown to decrease each year, which is one index of inflation. This emergy/money ratio is useful for evaluating service inputs given in money units where an average wage rate is appropriate.

:'''''Emergy per unit labor''''' — the emergy supporting one unit of direct labor applied to a process''.'' Workers apply their efforts to a process and in so doing they indirectly invest in it the emergy that made their labor possible (food, training, transport, etc). This emergy intensity is generally expressed as emergy per time (seJ/yr; seJ/hr), but emergy per money earned (seJ/$) is also used. Indirect labor required to make and supply the inputs to a process is generally measured with the dollar cost of services, so that its emergy intensity is calculated as seJ/$.

:'''''Empower''''' — a flow of emergy (i.e., emergy per unit time)''.''

==Accounting method==

Emergy accounting converts the thermodynamic basis of all forms of energy, resources and human services into equivalents of a single form of energy, usually solar. To evaluate a system, a system diagram organizes the evaluation and account for energy inputs and outflows. A table of the flows of resources, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram and all flows are evaluated. The final step involves interpreting the results.&lt;ref name=EnvAcct /&gt;

===Purpose===

In some cases, an evaluation is done to determine the fit of a development proposal within its environment. It also allows comparison of alternatives. Another purpose is to seek the best use of resources to maximize economic vitality.

===Systems diagram===

[[File:Systems diagram of a city.png|thumb|alt=A systems diagram of a city embedded in its support region showing the environmental energy and non renewable energy sources that drive the region and city system|'''Figure 1''': Energy system diagram of a city in its support region]]
System diagrams show the inputs that are evaluated and summed to obtain the emergy of a flow. A diagram of a city and its regional support area is shown in Figure 1.&lt;ref&gt;Many example diagrams can be found at [http://emergysystems.org/symbols.php EmergySystems.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309041649/http://www.emergysystems.org/symbols.php |date=2010-03-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation table===

A table (see example below) of resource flows, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram. Raw data on inflows that cross the boundary are converted into emergy units, and then summed to obtain total emergy supporting the system. Energy flows per unit time (usually per year) are presented in the table as separate line items.

*Column # 2 is the name of the item, which is also shown on the aggregated diagram.
*Column # 3 is the raw data in joules, grams, dollars or other units.
*Column # 4 shows the units for each raw data item.
*Column # 5 is the unit emergy value, expressed in solar emergy joules per unit. Sometimes, inputs are expressed in grams, hours, or dollars, therefore an appropriate UEV is used (sej/hr; sej/g; sej/$).
*Column # 6 is the solar emergy of a given flow, calculated as the raw input times the UEV (Column 3 times Column 5).

All tables are followed by footnotes that show citations for data and calculations.

===Calculating unit values===

The table allows a unit emergy value to be calculated. The final, output row (row “O” in the example table above) is evaluated first in units of energy or mass. Then the input emergy is summed and the unit emergy value is calculated by dividing the emergy by the units of the output.

===Performance indicators===

[[File:EmergyRatios5.png|thumb|alt=a basic diagram showing an economic progress that draws resources from the environment that are both renewable and non renewable energies and feedbacks from the main economy.|'''Figure 2''': Systems diagram showing flows used in the performance indicator ratios]]
Figure 2 shows non-renewable environmental contributions (N) as an emergy storage of materials, renewable environmental inputs (R), and inputs from the economy as purchased (F) goods and services. Purchased inputs are needed for the process to take place and include human service and purchased non-renewable energy and material brought in from elsewhere (fuels, minerals, electricity, machinery, fertilizer, etc.). Several ratios, or indices are given in Figure 2 that assess the global performance of a process.
* '''Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) —''' Emergy released (used up) per unit invested. The ratio is a measure of how much an investment enables a process to exploit local resources.
* '''Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR''') — The ratio of nonrenewable and imported emergy use to renewable emergy use. It is an indicator of the pressure a transformation process exerts on the environment and can be considered a measure of [[ecosystem]] stress due to a production (transformation activity.
* '''Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI''') — The ratio of EYR to ELR. It measures the contribution of a resource or process to the economy per unit of environmental loading.
* '''Areal Empower Intensity —''' The ratio of emergy use in the economy of a region to its area. Renewable and nonrenewable emergy density are calculated separately by dividing the total renewable emergy by area and the total nonrenewable emergy by area, respectively.

Other ratios are useful depending on the type and scale of the system under evaluation.
* '''Percent Renewable Emergy (%Ren''') — The ratio of renewable emergy to total emergy use. In the long run, only processes with high %Ren are sustainable.
* '''Emprice'''. The emprice of a commodity is the emergy one receives for the money spent in sej/$.
* '''Emergy Exchange Ratio (EER''') — The ratio of emergy exchanged in a trade or purchase (what is received to what is given). The ratio is always expressed relative to a trading partner and is a measure of the relative trade advantage of one partner over the other.
* '''Emergy per capita —''' The ratio of emergy use of a region or nation to the population. Emergy per capita can be used as a measure of potential, average standard of living of the population.
* '''Emergy-based energy return on investment''' was introduced as a way to bridge and improve the concept of [[Energy returned on energy invested]] to also include environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Y.|last2=Feng|first2=L.|last3=Wang|first3=J.|last4=Höök|first4=M|title=Emergy-based energy return on investment method for evaluating energy exploitation|journal=Energy|date=2017|volume=128|issue=6|pages=540–549|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

The recognition of the relevance of energy to the growth and dynamics of [[complex systems]] has resulted in increased emphasis on  environmental evaluation methods that can account for and interpret the effects of matter and energy flows at all scales in systems of humanity and nature. The following table lists some general areas in which the emergy methodology has been employed.

Net-Energy Analysis and the Energy Requirements of Energy Systems. Praeger Publishers, New York, 289 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergy theory has been criticized for allegedly offering an energy theory of value to replace other [[Labor theory of value|theories of value]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} The stated goal of emergy evaluations is to provide an "ecocentric" valuation of systems, processes. Thus it does not purport to replace economic values but to provide additional information, from a different point of view.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The idea that a [[calorie]] of sunlight is not equivalent to a calorie of fossil fuel or electricity strikes many as absurd, based on the [[Newton's laws of motion|1st Law]] definition of energy units as measures of heat (i.e. Joule's [[mechanical equivalent of heat]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sciubba, E., 2010. On the Second-Law inconsistency of Emergy Analysis. Energy 35, 3696-3706.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have rejected the concept as impractical since from their perspective it is impossible to objectively quantify the amount of sunlight that is required to produce a quantity of oil. In combining systems of humanity and nature and evaluating environmental input to economies, mainstream economists criticize the emergy methodology for disregarding market values.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

'''Energy customer switching''' is a concept stemming from the [[Energy market|global energy markets]]. The concept refers to the action of one energy customer [[customer switching|switching]] [[energy supplier]], a switch is essentially seen as the free (by choice) movement of a customer. In addition to that a switch can include:

* A re-switch: When a customer switches for the second or subsequent time. 
* A switch-back: When a customer switches back to his/her former or previous supplier.

If a customer moves, there is often a switch, however this will only be counted if the customer is not dealing with the incumbent in the new area of residence.

The above is the official definition of switching and is being used by public energy institutions such as [[CEER]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceer.eu|title=Welcome - ceer.eu|website=www.ceer.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; [[ERGEG]] (forerunner to ACER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acer.europa.eu/Pages/ACER.aspx|title=Home|website=www.acer.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The definition was originally developed by Dr Philip E. Lewis, international switching expert.

Switching is a key concept to understanding [[competition (economics)|competition]]-related issues on the global energy markets as the switching level of a concrete market reveals the state of the competition; High switching rates equals high level of competition and low switching rates equals limited competition. Thus measuring and assessing switching rates is necessary in order to have a correct impression of the energy markets. The action of switching is often done via a [[price comparison website]] or by the traditional [[door-to-door]] sales method, where a salesperson assists the customer in switching.

'''Energy monitoring and targeting''' (M&amp;T) is an energy efficiency technique based on the standard [[management]] axiom stating that “you cannot manage what you cannot measure”. M&amp;T techniques provide [[Energy engineering|energy manager]]s with feedback on operating practices, results of energy management projects, and guidance on the level of energy use that is expected in a certain period. Importantly, they also give early warning of unexpected excess consumption caused by equipment malfunctions, operator error, unwanted user behaviours, lack of effective maintenance and the like.

The foundation of M&amp;T lies in determining the normal relationships of energy consumptions to relevant driving factors (HVAC equipment, production though puts, weather, occupancy available daylight, etc.) and the goal is to help business managers:

* Identify and explain excessive energy use
* Detect instances when consumption is unexpectedly higher or lower than would usually have been the case
* Visualize energy consumption trends (daily, weekly, seasonal, operational…)
* Determine future energy use and costs when planning changes in the business
* Diagnose specific areas of wasted energy
* Observe how changes to relevant driving factors impact energy efficiency
* Develop performance targets for energy management programs
* Manage energy consumption, rather than accept it as a fixed cost

The ultimate goal is to reduce energy costs through improved [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and energy management control. Other benefits generally include increased resource efficiency, improved [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] budgeting and reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions.

==History==
M&amp;T is an established technique that was first launched as a national program in the [[UK]] in 1980, and has since then spread throughout Europe. These techniques are now{{When|date=July 2014}} also rapidly growing in America.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Goals and benefits==
Throughout the numerous M&amp;T projects implemented since the 1980s, a certain number of benefits have proved to be recurrent:
* Energy cost savings: generally 5% of the original energy expenses, according to [[The Carbon Trust]]. Carbon Trust has conducted a study over 1000 [[Small Business|small businesses]] and has concluded that on average an organization could save 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced metering for SMEs |url=https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209000820/https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |archivedate=December 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduction in [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions: lower energy consumption helps reduce emissions
* Financing: measured energy reductions help obtain [[grant (money)|grants]] for energy efficiency projects
* Improved product and service costing: [[Utility submeter|sub-metering]] allows the division of the energy bill between the different processes of an [[industry]], and can be calculated as a [[production cost]]
* Improved [[budgeting]]: M&amp;T techniques can help forecast energy expenses in the case of changes in the business, for example
* Waste avoidance: helps diagnose energy waste in any process.

==Technique==

=== Key principles ===
Monitoring and Targeting techniques rely on three main principles, which form a constant [[feedback]] cycle, therefore improving control of energy use.

====Monitoring====
Monitoring [[information]] of energy use, in order to establish a basis for energy management and explain [[deviation (statistics)|deviations]] from an established pattern. Its primary goal is to maintain said pattern, by providing all the necessary data on energy consumption, as well as certain [[driving factors]], as identified during preliminary investigation ([[production, costs, and pricing|production]], weather, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodengineeringmag.com/articles/90655-energy-management-crunching-the-numbers|title=Energy management: crunching the numbers|last=Labs|first=Wayne|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Food Engineering Magazine|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reporting====
The final principle is the one which enables ongoing control of energy use, achievement of targets and verification of savings: reports must be issued to the appropriate managers. This in turn allows [[decision-making]] and actions to be taken in order to achieve the targets, as well as confirmation or denial that the targets have been reached.

===Procedures===
Before the M&amp;T measures themselves are implemented, a few preparatory steps are necessary. First of all, key energy consumers on the site must be identified. Generally, most of the energy consumption is concentrated in a small number of processes, like heating, or certain [[machinery]]. This normally requires a certain survey of the [[building]] and the equipment to estimate their energy consumption level.

It is also necessary to assess what other [[measurements]] will be required to [[analysis|analyze]] the consumption appropriately. This data will be used to [[chart]] against the energy consumption: these are underlying factors which influence the consumption, often [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] (for industry processes) or exterior [[temperature]] (for heating processes), but may include many other variables.

Once all variables to be measured have been established, and the necessary meters installed, it is possible to initiate the M&amp;T procedures.

====Measure====
The first step is to compile the data from the different meters.  Low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. The frequency at which the data is compiled varies according to the desired reporting interval, but can go once every 30 seconds to once every 15 minutes. Some measurements can be taken directly from the meters, others must be calculated. These different measurements are often called streams or channels.

Driving factors such as production or [[degree day]]s also constitute streams and must be collected at intervals to match.

====Define the base-line====
The data compiled must then be plotted on a [[chart|graph]] in order to define the general consumption base-line. Consumption rates are plotted in a [[scatter plot]] against [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] or any other variable previously identified, and the [[best fit line]] is identified. This graph is the image of the business’ average energy performance, and conveys a lot of information:

* The [[y-intercept]] gives the minimal consumption in the absence of the variable (no [[production, costs, and pricing|production]], zero [[degree-day]]...). This is the base load of the system, the minimal consumption when it is not operating.
* The [[slope]] represents the relationship between the consumption and the previously identified [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. This represents the efficiency of the process.
* The scatter is the degree of variability of the consumption with operational factors.
The [[slope]] is not used quite as often for M&amp;T purposes. However, a high [[y-intercept]] can mean that there is a fault in the process, causing it to use too much energy with no performance, unless there are specific distinctive features which lead to high base loads. Very scattered points, on the other hand, may reflect other significant factors playing in the variation of the energy consumption, other than the one plotted in the first place, but it can also be the illustration of a lack of control over the process.

====Monitor variations====
The next step is to monitor the difference between the expected consumption and the actual measured consumption. One of the tools most commonly used for this is the [[control chart|CUSUM]], which is the CUmulative SUM of differences. This consists in first calculating the difference between the expected and actual performances (the [[best fit line]] previously identified and the points themselves).

The [[CUSUM]] can then be plotted against time on a new [[chart|graph]], which then yields more information for the energy efficiency specialist. [[Variance]]s scattered around zero usually mean that the process is operating normally. Marked variations, increasing or decreasing steadily usually reflect a modification in the conditions of the process.

[[Image:CUSUM graph.jpg|right|Example of a CUSUM graph]]In the case of the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph, the [[slope]] becomes very important, as it is the main indicator of the [[savings]] achieved. A [[slope]] going steadily down indicates steady [[savings]]. Any variation in the [[slope]] indicates a change in the process. For example, in the graph on the right, the first section indicated no [[savings]]. However, in September (beginning of the yellow line), an energy efficiency measure must have been implemented, as [[savings]] start to occur. The green line indicates an increase in the [[savings]] (as the [[slope]] is becoming steeper), whereas the red line must reflect a modification in the process having occurred in November, as [[savings]] have decreased slightly.

====Identify causes====
Energy efficiency specialists, in collaboration with building [[managers]], will decipher the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph and identify the causes leading to variations in the consumption. This can be a change in [[behaviour]], a modification to the process, different exterior conditions, etc. These changes must be monitored and the causes identified in order to promote and enhance good behaviour, and discourage bad ones.

====Set targets====
Once the base line has been established, and causes for variations in energy consumption have been identified, it is time to set targets for the future. Now with all this information in hand, the targets are more realistic, as they are based on the building’s actual consumption.
Targeting consists in two main parts: the measure to which the consumption can be reduced, and the [[timeframe]] during which the compression will be achieved.

A good initial target is the [[best fit line]] identified during step 2. This line represents the [[average]] historical performance. Therefore, keeping all consumption below or equal to the historical average is an achievable target, yet remains a challenge as it involves eliminating high consumption peaks.

Some companies, as they improve their energy consumption, might even decide to bring their [[average]] performance down to their historical best. This is considered a much more challenging target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicenergy.com/live-energy-monitoring/building-energy-use/case-studies/|title=Building Energy Generation &amp; Usage|work=Case Studies|publisher=Logic Energy|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monitor results====
This brings us back to step 1: measure consumption. One of the specificities of M&amp;T is that it is an ongoing process, requiring constant [[feedback]] in order to consistently improve performance. Once the targets are set and the desired measures are implemented, repeating the procedure from the start ensures that the managers are aware of the success or failure of the measures, and can then decide on further action.

===Examples===
An example with some features of an M&amp;T application is the [[ASU Campus Metabolism]], which provides real-time and historic energy use and generation data for facilities of [[Arizona State University]] on a public web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cm.asu.edu/|title=DGLux5 by DGLogik|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many utilities also offer customers electric interval data monitoring services. [[Xcel Energy]] is an example of an investor owned utility that offers its customer electric and natural gas monitoring services under the product name InfoWise from Xcel Energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xcelenergy.com/infowise/|title=InfoWise from Xcel Energy - Xcel Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is administered by Power TakeOff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.PowerTakeOff.com|title=PowerTakeOff – EMIS Behavioral Programming|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a third party partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xcelenergy.com/infowise/|title=InfoWise from Xcel Energy - Xcel Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness''''' is a documentary/art film released in June 2015 that takes audiences through farms and urban landscapes in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]], interviewing leading practitioners in the [[Natural farming|Natural Farming]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Ryoseok|title=Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3709036/|last2=Kawaguchi|last3=Korn|first2=Yoshikazu|first3=Larry|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film began when an environmental artist (Patrick M. Lydon) and an environmental book editor (Suhee Kang), had a chance meeting in Seoul, South Korea, and began conducting short interviews together with leaders in the ecology and social justice movements. Upon meeting Korean farmer Seong Hyun Choi however, the two were so impressed by his ecological mindset and way of working, that they set out to produce a feature film about the movement. Lydon and Kang ended up quitting their jobs, giving away most of their possessions, and becoming voluntarily homeless for four years in order to afford producing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kimchiandbasil.com/interview-final-straw/|title=Final straw: food, earth, happiness - Kimchi&amp;Basil|date=2016-02-20|work=Kimchi&amp;Basil|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/a-root-solution/|title=A ‘Root’ Solution {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/21/lydon-ghost-ship-raises-broad-questions-about-art-and-culture/|title=Lydon: Ghost Ship raises big questions about arts and culture|last=|first=|date=|website=San Jose Mercury News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is split into three sections 1) Modern Life, 2) Foundations and Mindset of Natural Farming, and 3) Natural Farming in Practice and Life. According to the filmmakers, as they began to understand more about how natural farming itself was not rooted in methods, but in a way of thinking, they chose to explore the life philosophies and ways of thinking of natural farming practitioners in a more free-flowing and artistic way, rather than an instructive one; the result is an unconventional documentary that features slow paced musical interludes alongside interviews. Reviewers have called both "meditative, and mindful," and "an inspiring call to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mindfulpie.com/one-straw-revolution/|title=Love nature, eat well – Mindful Pie|website=mindfulpie.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/|title=Eco Farming|last=|first=|date=July 1, 2015|work=Clean Eating Magazine|access-date=August 1, 2015|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Active Interest Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and musician [[Alicia Bay Laurel]] called the film "both art and documentary".

== Production ==
Lydon and Kang spent what they call a "meager" life savings to make the film, along with the volunteer efforts of farmers, translators, writers, musicians they had met during their journey. Although the film was filmed, written, and edited entirely by the two directors, they readily admit that the process of making the film was co-operative effort, with more than 200 volunteers directly involved in the process in some way. The soundtrack was recorded with professional musicians from each of the three countries where filming took place, all of whom donated their time to contribute to the film project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the continued help of international volunteers, the film is available in four languages (English, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese), and three more (Chinese, Portuguese, French) are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cbjournalism.com/2016/03/24/filmmaker-spotlight-patrick-lydon-suhee-king/|title=Filmmaker Spotlight: Patrick Lydon &amp; Suhee King|date=2016-03-24|website=Chelsea Breaks the News|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/the-documentary/|title=The Documentary {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated by the lack of distribution and film festival options for low- and no-budget films, the filmmakers made the decision to manage distribution and touring in the same way they went about filming, through co-operative effort. With the help of volunteers, independent theater owners, and community organizers, they launched an extensive tour throughout Japan and South Korea from 2015-2016, eventually screening the film at over 130 venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/tour-dates-and-screenings/|title=Tour Dates and Screenings {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than simply screening the film, the filmmakers decided to transition their existing media production organization ''SocieCity,'' into a vehicle for art and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artseverywhere.ca/2016/03/07/social-practice-artwork-a-restaurant-and-garden-serving-up-connections-to-urban-nature/|title=Social Practice Artwork: A Restaurant and Garden Serving up Connections to Urban Nature|last=|first=|date=|website=artseverywhere.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a point of hosting interactive events along with their screenings and in several cases, stayed in communities for up to three months at a time to build natural gardens and host a project they call REALtimeFOOD, a grown-to-order restaurant which connects the ideas from the film with real-world practices in farming, food, and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/barndining_/220514125842|title=Bar&amp;Dining Magazine : 네이버 블로그|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://setouchiexplorer.com/real-time-food-project-day-one-worlds-slowest-restaurant-opening/|title=REAL time FOOD Project - Day One - World's Slowest Restaurant Opening|date=2016-09-18|work=Setouchi Explorer|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, these efforts were funded by grants from local philanthropic organizations and/or supported by the communities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chishimatochi.info/found/index.php/archives/service/1961|title=おおさか創造千島財団  » 2015年度|website=www.chishimatochi.info|language=ja|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablepractice.org/2013/11/15/final-straw/|title=Final Straw|date=2013-11-15|website=The CSPA|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interested in the unconventional way the film was being made and toured, multiple magazines and newspapers in Japan and Korea followed the directors during several parts of their journey, notably ESSEN, Bar and Dining, and Road magazines, and Shikoku Shinbun and Huffington Post newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shikoku-newspaper-english.pdf|title=Connecting to Life with Natural Farming in Megijima|last=|first=|date=September 18, 2016|work=Shikoku Shinbun|access-date=17 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/salimstory/story_b_8476176.html|title="모든 것이 연결되어 있다는 깨달음이 시작"|website=허핑턴포스트|language=ko-KR|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://navercast.naver.com/magazine_contents.nhn?rid=1095&amp;contents_id=45426|title=내일의 식문화를 일구는 사람들이 보내 온 새해 편지|access-date=2017-04-18|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the tour, the film was eventually picked up by festivals including Tassie Eco Film Festival and Belleville Doc Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downtowndocfest.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Belleville%20Downtown%20DocFest%20Program_2016.pdf|title=Belleville International Documentary Festival - Official Program|last=|first=|date=1 February 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1805">A '''Gold universe''' is a [[cosmology|cosmological]] model of the [[universe]].  In these models, the universe starts with a [[Big Bang]] and expands for some time, with increasing [[entropy]] and a  [[thermodynamic]] [[arrow of time]] pointing in the direction of the expansion.  After the universe reaches a low-density state, it recontracts, but entropy now decreases, pointing the thermodynamic arrow of time in the opposite direction, until the universe ends in a low-entropy, high-density [[Big Crunch]]. 
There are two models of the universe which support the possibility of a reversed direction of time. The first begins with a state of low entropy at the Big Bang which continually increases until the Big Crunch. The second, a Gold Universe, posits that entropy will increase only until a moment of contraction, then gradually decrease. This latter model suggests the universe will become more orderly after the moment of contraction. The Gold model has been linked to the possibility of retrocausal change, questions concerning the preservation of information in a time-reversed universe (states of decreasing entropy), and [[Causality (physics)|causation]] in general.  The Gold Universe is named after the cosmologist [[Thomas Gold]], who proposed the model in the 1960s.

This '''timeline of the Big Bang''' shows a sequence of events as currently theorized by scientists. 

It is a [[logarithmic scale]] that shows &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10}&lt;/math&gt; ''second'' instead of ''second''. For example, one microsecond is &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10} 0.000 001 = 10 \cdot (-6) = -60&lt;/math&gt;. To convert −30 read on the scale to second calculate &lt;math&gt;10^{-\frac{30}{10}} = 10^{-3} = 0.001&lt;/math&gt; second = one millisecond. On a logarithmic time scale a step lasts ten times longer than the previous step.

{{duplication}}&lt;!--what is the point of keeping two timelines with exactly the same scope, one "graphical" and the other in html table format?--&gt;
This more than 20-billion-year '''timeline of our universe''' shows the best estimates of major events from the universe's beginning to anticipated future events. Zero on the scale is the present day. A large step on the scale is one billion years; a small step, one hundred million years. The past is denoted by a minus sign: e.g., the oldest rock on Earth was formed about four billion years ago and this is marked at -4e+09 years, where 4e+09 represents 4 times 10 to the power of 9. The "[[Big Bang]]" event most likely happened 13.8 billion years ago; see [[age of the universe]].

The '''Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit''' ('''GZK limit''') is a theoretical upper limit on the energy of [[cosmic ray]] [[proton]]s traveling from other galaxies through the intergalactic medium to our galaxy. The limit is {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}}, or about 8&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]s. The limit is set by slowing-interactions of the protons with the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] over long distances (~160 million light-years). The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected. For example, one [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]] has been detected which appeared to possess a record {{val|3.12|e=20|u=eV}} (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 35&amp;nbsp;mph baseball).

The GZK limit is derived under the assumption that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are protons. Measurements by the largest cosmic-ray observatory, the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]], suggest that most ultra-high energy cosmic rays are heavier elements.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aab|first1=Aexander|last2=others|title=Inferences on Mass Composition and Tests of Hadronic Interactions from 0.3 to 100 EeV using the water-Cherenkov Detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory|journal=Submitted to Phys. Rev. D|date=2017|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07249.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the argument behind the GZK limit does not apply in the originally simple form and there is no fundamental contradiction in observing cosmic rays with energies that violate the limit.

In the past, the apparent violation of the GZK limit has inspired cosmologists and theoretical physicists to suggest other ways that circumvent the limit. These theories propose that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced nearby our galaxy or that [[Lorentz covariance]] is violated in such a way that protons do not lose energy on their way to our galaxy.

==Computation==
The limit was independently computed in 1966 by [[Kenneth Greisen]],&lt;ref name="Greisen1966"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greisen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |date=1966 |title=End to the Cosmic-Ray Spectrum? |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=16 |issue=17 |pages=748&amp;ndash;750 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.16.748 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1966PhRvL..16..748G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vadim Kuzmin (physicist)|Vadim Kuzmin]], and [[Georgiy Zatsepin]],&lt;ref name="Zatsepin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zatsepin |first=G. T. |last2=Kuz'min |first2=V. A. |date=1966 |title=Upper Limit of the Spectrum of Cosmic Rays |journal=Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters |volume=4 |issue= |pages=78&amp;ndash;80 |bibcode=1966JETPL...4...78Z |url=http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/1624/article_24846.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on interactions between [[cosmic ray]]s and the photons of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). They predicted that cosmic rays with energies over the threshold energy of {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}} would interact with cosmic microwave background photons &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}&lt;/math&gt;, relatively [[blueshift]]ed by the speed of the cosmic rays, to produce [[pion]]s via the [[Delta baryon|&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; resonance]],

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow p + \pi^0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow n + \pi^+.&lt;/math&gt;
Pions produced in this manner proceed to decay in the standard pion channels—ultimately to photons for neutral pions, and photons, positrons, and various neutrinos for positive pions. Neutrons decay also to similar products, so that ultimately the energy of any cosmic ray proton is drained off by production of high energy photons plus (in some cases) high energy electron/positron pairs and neutrino pairs.

The pion production process begins at a higher energy than ordinary electron-positron [[pair production]] (lepton production) from protons impacting the CMB, which starts at cosmic ray proton energies of only about {{val|e=17|ul=eV}}. However, pion production events drain 20% of the energy of a cosmic ray proton as compared with only 0.1% of its energy for electron positron pair production. This factor of 200 is from two sources: the pion has only about ~130 times the mass of the leptons, but the extra energy appears as different kinetic energies of the pion or leptons, and results in relatively more kinetic energy transferred to a heavier product pion, in order to conserve momentum. The much larger total energy losses from pion production result in the pion production process becoming the limiting one to high energy cosmic ray travel, rather than the lower-energy light-lepton production process.

The pion production process continues until the cosmic ray energy falls below the pion production threshold. Due to the mean path associated with this interaction, extragalactic cosmic rays traveling over distances larger than {{val|50|ul=Mpc}} ({{val|163|ul=Mly}}) and with energies greater than this threshold should never be observed on Earth. This distance is also known as GZK horizon.

==Cosmic ray paradox==
{{unsolved|physics|Why is it that some cosmic rays appear to possess [[energy|energies]] that are theoretically too high, given that there are no possible near-Earth sources, and that rays from distant sources should have scattered off the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]?}}

A number of observations have been made by the largest cosmic ray experiments [[Akeno Giant Air Shower Array]], [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector]], the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] and [[Telescope Array Project]] that appeared to show cosmic rays with energies above this limit (called [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]]s, or EECRs). The observation of these particles was the so-called '''GZK paradox''' or '''cosmic ray paradox'''.

These observations appear to contradict the predictions of [[special relativity]] and [[particle physics]] as they are presently understood. However, there are a number of possible explanations for these observations that may resolve this inconsistency.
*The observations could be due to an instrument error or an incorrect interpretation of the experiment, especially wrong energy assignment.
*The cosmic rays could have local sources well within the GZK horizon (although it is unclear what these sources could be).
*Cosmic rays are mostly heavier nuclei with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; nucleons. The energy per nucleon in a nucleus is by a factor &lt;math&gt;1/A&lt;/math&gt; lower, which correspondingly pushes the effective GZK limit for the whole nucleus up by a factor &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. For iron nuclei (the heaviest abundant element in cosmic rays), the corresponding energy limit for the whole nucleus is {{val|2.8|e=21|u=eV}}, which is well beyond the energies of detected ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

===Weakly interacting particles===
Another suggestion involves ultra-high energy weakly interacting particles (for instance, [[neutrino]]s) which might be created at great distances and later react locally to give rise to the particles observed. In the proposed Z-burst model, an ultra-high energy cosmic neutrino collides with a relic anti-neutrino in our galaxy and annihilates to hadrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fargion |first1=D. |last2=Mele |first2=B. |last3=Salis |first3=A. |title=Ultra–High‐Energy Neutrino Scattering onto Relic Light Neutrinos in the Galactic Halo as a Possible Source of the Highest Energy Extragalactic Cosmic Rays |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=June 1999 |volume=517 |issue=2 |pages=725–733 |doi=10.1086/307203 |arxiv=astro-ph/9710029 |bibcode=1999ApJ...517..725F }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process proceeds via a (virtual) Z-boson:

&lt;math&gt;\nu + \bar{\nu}\rightarrow Z\rightarrow \text{hadrons}&lt;/math&gt;

The cross section for this process becomes large if the center of mass energy of the neutrino antineutrino pair is equal to the Z-boson mass (such a peak in the cross section is called "resonance"). Assuming that the relic anti-neutrino is at rest, the energy of the incident cosmic neutrino has to be:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{m_{Z}^{2}}{2 m_{\nu}}= 4.2\times 10^{21} \left(\frac{\text{eV}}{m_{\nu}}\right)\text{eV}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the Z-boson and &lt;math&gt;m_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the neutrino.

===Other theories===
A number of exotic theories have been advanced to explain the AGASA observations, including [[doubly special relativity]]. However, it is now established that standard doubly special relativity does not predict any GZK suppression (or GZK cutoff), contrary to models of Lorentz symmetry violation involving an absolute rest frame.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Other possible theories involve [[Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray#Relation with dark matter|a relation with dark matter]], decays of exotic super-heavy particles beyond those known in the [[Standard Model]].

==Controversy about cosmic rays above the GZK limit==
A suppression of the cosmic ray flux which can be explained with the GZK limit has been confirmed by the latest generation of cosmic ray observatories. A former claim by the [[AGASA]] experiment that there is no suppression was overruled. It remains controversial, whether the suppression is due to the GZK effect. The GZK limit only applies if ultra-high energy cosmic rays are mostly protons.

In July 2007, during the 30th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Mérida, Yucatán, México, the [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|High Resolution Fly's Eye Experiment]] (HiRes) and the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] (Auger) presented their results on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. HiRes observed a suppression in the UHECR spectrum at just the right energy, observing only 13 events with an energy above the threshold, while expecting 43 with no suppression. This was interpreted as the first observation of the GZK limit.&lt;ref name="Abbasi2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbasi |first=R. U. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |title=First Observation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Suppression |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=100 |issue= 10|pages=101101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.101101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=18352170 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703099 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.100j1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auger confirmed the flux suppression, but did not claim it to be the GZK limit: instead of the 30 events necessary to confirm the AGASA results, Auger saw only two, which are believed to be heavy nuclei events.&lt;ref name="Abraham2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abraham |first=J. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 | title=Observation of the suppression of the flux of cosmic rays above 4×10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; eV |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=061101–1–061101–7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.061101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0806.4302 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.101f1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flux suppression was previously brought into question when the AGASA experiment found no suppression in their spectrum{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. According to [[Alan Andrew Watson|Alan Watson]], spokesperson for the Auger Collaboration, AGASA results have been shown to be incorrect, possibly due to the systematic shift in energy assignment.

In 2010 and the following years, both the Pierre Auger Observatory and HiRes confirmed again a flux suppression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010|title=Measurement of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays above {{val|e=18|u=eV}} using the Pierre Auger Observatory|url=|journal=Phys. Lett. B|volume=685|issue=4&amp;ndash;5|pages=239&amp;ndash;246|arxiv=1002.1975|bibcode=2010PhLB..685..239A|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.02.013|pmid=|quote=|author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1010.2690|author1=Sokolsky|author2=for the HiRes Collaboration|title=Final Results from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) Experiment|class=astro-ph.HE|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in case of the Pierre Auger Observatory the effect is statistically significant at the level of 20 standard deviations.

After the flux suppression was established, a heated debate ensued whether cosmic rays that violate the GZK limit are protons. The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest observatory, found with high statistical significance that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are not purely protons, but a mixture of elements which is getting heavier with increasing energy.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"/&gt;
The [[Telescope Array Project]], a joint effort from members of the HiRes and AGASA collaborations, agrees with the former HiRes result that these cosmic rays look like protons.&lt;ref name="Hanlon2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanlon|first1=William|last2=others|title=Telescope Array Composition Summary|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=536|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/536/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is based on data with lower statistical significance, however. The area covered by Telescope Array is about one third of the area covered by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the latter has been running for a longer time.

The controversy was partially resolved in 2017, when a joint working group formed by members of both experiments presented a report at the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference.&lt;ref name="deSouza2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Souza|first1=Vitor|last2=others|title=Testing the agreement between the Xmax distributions measured by the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Observatories|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=522|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/522/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, the raw experimental results are not in contradiction with each other. The different interpretations are mainly based on the use of different theoretical models (Telescope Array uses an outdated model for its interpretation), and the fact that Telescope Array has not collected enough events yet to distinguish the pure proton hypothesis from the mixed-nuclei hypothesis.

===Extreme Universe Space Observatory on Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO)===
[[Extreme Universe Space Observatory|EUSO]], which was scheduled to fly on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2009, was designed to use the atmospheric-[[fluorescence]] technique to monitor a huge area and boost the statistics of UHECRs considerably. EUSO is to make a deep survey of UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) from space, extending the measured energy spectrum well beyond the GZK-cutoff. It is to search for the origin of UHECRs, determine the nature of the origin of UHECRs, make an all-sky survey of the arrival direction of UHECRs, and seek to open the astronomical window on the extreme-energy universe with neutrinos. The fate of the EUSO Observatory is still unclear since NASA is considering early retirement of the ISS.

===The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to resolve inconsistencies===
Launched in June 2008, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] (formerly GLAST) will also provide data that will help resolve these inconsistencies.
*With the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, one has the possibility of detecting gamma rays from the freshly accelerated cosmic-ray nuclei at their acceleration site (the source of the UHECRs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ormes |first=Jonathan F. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2000 |title=The origin of cosmic rays: What can the Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope say? |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=528 |issue= |pages=445&amp;ndash;448 |id= |doi=10.1063/1.1324357 |quote= |arxiv=astro-ph/0003270}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*UHECR protons accelerated (see also [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]) in astrophysical objects produce ''secondary electromagnetic cascades'' during propagation in the cosmic microwave and infrared backgrounds, of which the GZK-process of pion production is one of the contributors.

==Possible sources of UHECRs==
In November 2007, researchers at the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] announced that they had evidence that UHECRs appear to come from the [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGNs) of energetic galaxies powered by matter swirling onto a supermassive black hole. The cosmic rays were detected and traced back to the AGNs using the [[Philippe Véron|Véron-Cetty-Véron]] catalog. These results are reported in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2007 |title=Correlation of the Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays with Nearby Extragalactic Objects |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5852 |pages=938&amp;ndash;943 |doi=10.1126/science.1151124 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0711.2256 |pmid=17991855 |bibcode = 2007Sci...318..938P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the strength of the correlation with AGNs from this particular catalog for the Auger data recorded after 2007 has been slowly diminishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2010 |title=Update on the correlation of the highest energy cosmic rays with nearby extragalactic matter |journal=Astropart.

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

'''Intelligent Energy''' is a fuel cell engineering company focused on the development and commercialisation of its PEM fuel cell technologies for a range of markets including automotive, stationary power and UAVs. We are headquartered in the UK, with offices and representation in the US, Japan, India, and China.

== History ==

The origins of Intelligent Energy began at [[Loughborough University]] in the UK during the late 1980s, when the University became one of Europe’s first research and development centres for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology. In 1995, the UK’s first kW-level PEM fuel cell stack was produced by the R&amp;D team.  In June of that year, Advanced Power Sources (APS) Ltd was founded as a spin-out from Loughborough University by Paul Adcock, Phil Mitchell, Jon Moore and Anthony Newbold, and was the first company in the UK formed specifically to address the development and commercialisation of PEM fuel cells.

Founded by Harry Bradbury, Intelligent Energy was established in 2001, acquiring Advanced Power Sources Ltd, together with its personnel and fuel cell related intellectual property that originated from research conducted by both APS and Loughborough University into PEM fuel cell technology. This triggered investment and enabled the company to grow its business activities.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[http://www.cleantechinvestor.com/portal/mainmenucomp/companiesi/586-intelligent-energy-/11138-profile-intelligent-energy-published-in-cleantech-infocus-uk-innovation-in-fuel-cells-and-hydrogen.html Profile: Intelligent Energy - October 2012].

Retrieved 18 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligent Energy was acquired by Meditor Energy, part of the Meditor Group, in October 2017.

== Technology ==

Intelligent Energy's fuel-cell technology is divided into two platforms: air-cooled (AC) and evaporatively-cooled (EC). The air-cooled fuel cell systems use low-power fans to provide cooling and the oxidant supply for operation. Heat from the fuel cell stack is conducted to cooling plates and removed through airflow channels,  a simplified and cost-effective system for the power range from a few watts to several kilowatts. They  are used in a wide range of UAV, stationary power and automotive applications for two-wheel and small car range extender applications.

Evaporatively-cooled (EC) fuel cell systems provide power generation from a few kilowatts up to 200&amp;nbsp;kW. Efficient thermal management of the EC fuel cell stack reduces system complexity, mass and cost. These  systems are designed for high-volume, low-cost manufacturing, and use modular architecture that can be quickly modified to suit the application.

== Market sectors ==

=== Automotive ===

The firm's fuel cell stacks have been developed for  small and large cars, scooters and motorbikes. 
In 2010, the company was involved in the development of the report entitled “A portfolio of power-trains for Europe: a fact-based analysis. The role of Battery Electric Vehicles, Plug-In Hybrids and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles”, produced by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] with input from car manufacturers, oil and gas suppliers, utilities and industrial gas companies, wind turbine and electrolyser companies as well as governmental and non-governmental organisations. The report concluded, amongst other findings, that fuel cell vehicles are technology ready, and cost competitive, and that decarbonisation targets for Europe are unlikely to be met without the introduction of fuel cell powertrains.&lt;ref name="n"&gt;[http://www.fch-ju.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Power_trains_for_Europe.pdf/ A portfolio of power-trains for Europe: a fact-based analysis].

The importance of the interface depends on the type of system: the bigger the quotient area/volume, the greater the effect the interface will have. Consequently, interfaces are very important in systems with large interface area-to-volume ratios, such as [[colloid]]s.

Interfaces can be flat or curved. For example, [[oil]] droplets  in a [[salad dressing]] are spherical but the interface between water and air in a glass of water is mostly flat.

[[Surface tension]] is the physical property which rules interface processes involving liquids. For a liquid film on flat surfaces, the liquid-vapor interface keeps flat to minimize interfacial area and system [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]. For a liquid film on rough surfaces, the [[surface tension]] tends to keep the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] flat, while the [[disjoining pressure]] makes the film conformal to the substrate. The equilibrium meniscus shape is a result of the competition between the [[capillary pressure]] and [[disjoining pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl5037066 Han Hu, Christopher R. Weinberger, and Ying Sun ''[[Nano Lett.]]'', 14 (12), pp 7131–7137 (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfaces may cause various [[optical phenomena]], such as [[refraction]].  [[Lens (optics)|Optical lenses]] serve as an example of a practical application of the interface between [[glass]] and air.

One topical interface system is the gas-liquid interface between [[aerosols]] and other atmospheric molecules.

Knowledge of the '''location of Earth''' has been shaped by 400 years of telescopic observations, and has expanded radically in the last century. Initially, Earth was believed to be the [[Geocentric model|center of the Universe]],  
which consisted only of those planets visible with the [[classical planet|naked eye]] and an outlying sphere of [[fixed stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas S. |last=Kuhn |title=The Copernican Revolution |pages=5–20 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=1957 |isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the acceptance of the [[heliocentric model]] in the 17th century, observations by [[William Herschel]] and others showed that the Sun lay within a vast, disc-shaped [[galaxy]] of stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1781: William Herschel Reveals the Shape of our Galaxy|url=http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|accessdate=19 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326182039/http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|archivedate=26 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century, observations of [[spiral nebula]]e revealed that our galaxy was one of billions in an [[expanding universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spiral Nebulae and the Great Debate|publisher=[[Eberly College of Science]]|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l9_p2.html|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1929: Edwin Hubble Discovers the Universe is Expanding|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1929|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; grouped into clusters and [[supercluster]]s. By the end of the 20th century, the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|overall structure]] of the visible universe was becoming clearer, with superclusters forming into a vast web of [[galactic filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|voids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1989: Margaret Geller and John Huchra Map the Universe|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1989|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superclusters, filaments and voids are the largest coherent structures in the Universe that we can observe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structure of the Universe|author= Villanueva, John Carl |publisher=[[Universe Today]]|year=2009|url=http://www.universetoday.com/37360/structure-of-the-universe/|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At still larger scales (over 1000 [[megaparsec]]s{{efn|name=parsec|A parsec (pc) is the distance at which a star's [[parallax]] as viewed from Earth is equal to one [[second of arc]], equal to roughly 206,000&amp;nbsp;AU or 3.0857×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km.

It is still undetermined whether the Universe is [[Infinity|infinite]].

A '''material''' is a [[chemical substance]] or [[mixture]] of substances that constitute an object. Materials can be pure or impure, a singular composite or a complex mix, living or non-living matter, whether natural or man-made, either concrete or abstract. Materials can be classified based on different properties such as [[physical property|physical]] and [[chemical property|chemical properties]] (see [[List of materials properties]]), [[geological]], [[biological]], choreographical, or [[property (philosophy)|philosophical properties]]. In the physical sense, materials are studied in the field of [[materials science]].

In [[industry]], materials are inputs to [[wiktionary:production|production]] or [[list of manufacturing processes|manufacturing processes]]. They may either be [[raw material]], that is, unprocessed, or processed before being used in more advanced production processes, either by [[distillation]] or [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] (synthetic materials).

Types of materials include:
*[[Biomaterial]], of biological origin
*[[Composite material]], composed of multiple materials with differing physical properties
*[[Textile]]s, sometimes referred to as "material"
*[[Genetic material]]

==Classification of materials==
Materials are classified according to many different criteria including their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their intended applications whether it is thermal, optical, electrical, magnetic, or combined. As their methods of usage dictate their physical appearance, they can be designed, tailored, and/or prepared in many forms such as powders, thin or thick films, and plates and could be introduced/studied in a single or multi layers. End products could be pure materials or doped ones with most useful compounds are those with controlled added impurities.The dopants could be added chemically or mixed and implanted physically. In case the impurities were added chemically, the dopants/co-dopants on substitutional/interstitial sites should be optimized and investigated thoroughly as well as any stresses instigated by their presence within the structure; whereas in the case of the physical mixing, the influence of the degree of heterogeneity of the prepared hybrid composites ought to be studied.The different physical and chemical preparation techniques can be used solely or combined including solid state synthesis, hydrothermal, sol-gel, precipitations and coprecipitations, spin coating, physical vapor deposition, and spray pyrolysis. Types of impurities along with their amounts are usually dictated by types of matrices to be added to, and their ability to maximize the desired products’ usefulness. Among the most commonly used characterization techniques are X-ray diffraction (XRD) either single crystal or powder, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), UV-Vis absorption Spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), and Photoluminescence spectrometry. In addition, it is usually considered of extreme importance to find theoretical models that can confirm and/or predict the experimental findings and assist in discussion, assignment, and the explanation of results and outcomes. Also, vision and room for future modification and development should always be pinpointed. Hence, one can classify the material as a smart one if its presence can serve multi purposes within the final product.

{{quantum mechanics}}
'''Matter waves''' are a central part of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], being an example of [[wave–particle duality]]. All [[matter]] can exhibit [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave. The concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɔɪ}}) in 1924. It is also referred to as the ''de Broglie hypothesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, R.]], ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]'', Penguin 1990 Edition, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Matter waves are referred to as ''de Broglie waves''.

The ''de Broglie wavelength'' is the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}}, associated with a massive particle and is related to its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}.&lt;/math&gt;

Wave-like behavior of matter was first experimentally demonstrated by [[George Paget Thomson]]'s thin metal diffraction experiment,&lt;ref name=GPTdiff&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomson, G. P. | title = Diffraction of Cathode Rays by a Thin Film | journal = Nature | volume = 119 | issue = 3007 | pages = 890 | year = 1927 | doi = 10.1038/119890a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v119/n3007/pdf/119890a0.pdf | format = PDF |bibcode = 1927Natur.119Q.890T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently in the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] both using electrons, and it has also been confirmed for other [[elementary particle]]s, neutral [[atom]]s and even [[molecule]]s. Recently, it was also found that investigating the elementary process of diffusion gives the theoretical evidence of the relation of matter wave, regardless of the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;Okino, T. (2018) Quantum Effect on Elementary Process of Diffusion and Collective Motion of Brown Particles, Journal Modern Physics 9, pp. 1007-1028.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus revealed that the relation of matter wave is now not a hypothesis but an actual equation relevant to a characteristic of micro particle. The wave-like behavior of matter is crucial to the modern theory of atomic  structure and [[particle physics]].

==Historical context==
At the end of the 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields which propagated according to [[Maxwell's equations]], while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (See [[wave–particle duality#Brief history of wave and particle viewpoints|history of wave and particle viewpoints]]). In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of black body thermal radiation, [[Max Planck]] proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta. Light quanta are now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck–Einstein relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;
and a momentum
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{E}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ν''}} (lowercase [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) and {{math|''λ''}} (lowercase [[Lambda|Greek letter lambda]]) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, {{math|''c''}} the speed of light, and {{math|''h''}} the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1917).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern convention, frequency is symbolized by ''f'' as is done in the rest of this article. Einstein’s postulate was confirmed experimentally by [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]] and [[Arthur Compton]] over the next two decades.

==de Broglie hypothesis==
[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of '''de Broglie waves''' in 1d – real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the color [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versa. The result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[plane wave]]. Bottom: [[wave packet]].]]
De Broglie, in his 1924 PhD thesis, proposed that just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, [[electron]]s also have wave-like properties. By rearranging the momentum equation stated in the above section, we find a relationship between the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}} associated with an electron and its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship is now known to hold for all types of matter: all matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves.

{{quote|When I conceived the first basic ideas of wave mechanics in 1923–24, I was guided by the aim to perform a real physical synthesis, valid for all particles, of the coexistence of the wave and of the corpuscular aspects that Einstein had introduced for photons in his theory of light quanta in 1905.|De Broglie&lt;ref&gt;Louis de Broglie [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ "The Reinterpretation of Wave Mechanics" Foundations of Physics, Vol. 1 No. 1 (1970)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] published an [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] describing how a matter wave should evolve—the matter wave analogue of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell’s equations]]—and used it to derive the [[Emission spectrum|energy spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]].

==Experimental confirmation==
[[File:Wave-particle duality.gif|right|thumb|200px|Demonstration of a matter wave in diffraction of electrons]]

Matter waves were first experimentally confirmed to occur in [[George Paget Thomson]]'s cathode ray diffraction experiment&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; and the [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson-Germer experiment]] for electrons, and the de Broglie hypothesis has been confirmed for other elementary particles. Furthermore, neutral atoms and even molecules have been shown to be wave-like.

===Electrons===
{{further|Davisson–Germer experiment|Electron diffraction}}
In 1927 at Bell Labs, [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] [[Davisson–Germer experiment|fired]] slow-moving [[electron]]s at a [[crystal]]line [[nickel]] target. The angular dependence of the diffracted electron intensity was measured, and was determined to have the same [[diffraction|diffraction pattern]] as those predicted by [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg]] for [[x-ray]]s. At the same time George Paget Thomson at the University of Aberdeen was independently firing electrons at very thin metal foils to demonstrate the same effect.&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis, diffraction was a property that was thought to be exhibited only by waves. Therefore, the presence of any [[diffraction]] effects by matter demonstrated the wave-like nature of matter. When the de Broglie wavelength was inserted into the [[Bragg's law|Bragg condition]], the observed diffraction pattern was predicted, thereby experimentally confirming the de Broglie hypothesis for electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Dardo, ''Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics'', Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a pivotal result in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. Just as the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated the particle nature of light, the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] showed the wave-nature of matter, and completed the theory of [[wave–particle duality]]. For [[physicist]]s this idea was important because it meant that not only could any particle exhibit wave characteristics, but that one could use [[wave equation]]s to describe phenomena in matter if one used the de Broglie wavelength.

The effect has also been used to explain the spatial version of the [[quantum Zeno effect]], in which an otherwise unstable object may be stabilised by rapidly repeated observations.&lt;ref name="zeno"/&gt;

===Molecules===
Recent experiments even confirm the relations for molecules and even [[macromolecule]]s that otherwise might be supposed too large to undergo quantum mechanical effects. In 1999, a research team in [[Vienna]] demonstrated diffraction for molecules as large as [[fullerene]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Wave-particle duality of C60| first=M.| last=Arndt| author2=O.

The de Broglie equations relate the [[wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}} to the [[momentum]] {{math|''p''}}, and [[frequency]] {{math|''f''}} to the total energy {{math|''E''}} of a particle:&lt;ref name="Resnick 1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles |edition=2nd |first=R. |last=Resnick |first2=R. |last2=Eisberg |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=1985 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-87373-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \lambda = h/p\\
&amp; f = E/h
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]. The equations can also be written as

&amp; E = \hbar \omega\\

In each pair, the second equation is also referred to as the [[Planck–Einstein relation]], since it was also proposed by [[Max Planck|Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].

===Special relativity===
Using two formulas from [[special relativity]], one for the [[Momentum#Relativistic|relativistic momentum]] and one for the relativistic mass energy

:&lt;math&gt;E = m c^2 = \gamma m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = m\vec{v} = \gamma m_0 \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;

allows the equations to be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\lambda =\,\, \frac {h}{\gamma m_0v}\, =\, \frac {h}{m_0v}\,\,\,\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\
&amp; f = \frac{\gamma\,m_0c^2}{h} = \frac {m_0c^2}{h} \bigg/ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; denotes the particle's [[Invariant mass|rest mass]], &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its [[velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stationary states |first=Alan |last=Holden |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1971 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-501497-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W.S.C. (2002). ''Introducing Special Relativity'', Taylor &amp; Francis, London, {{ISBN|0-415-27761-2}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Broglie, L. (1970). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ The reinterpretation of wave mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics'' '''1'''(1): 5–15, p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; See below for details of the derivation of the de Broglie relations. Group velocity (equal to the particle's speed) should not be confused with [[phase velocity]] (equal to the product of the particle's frequency and its wavelength). In the case of a non-[[dispersion relation|dispersive medium]], they happen to be equal, but otherwise they are not.

====Group velocity====
[[Albert Einstein]] first explained the [[wave–particle duality]] of light in 1905.  [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that any particle should also exhibit such a duality. The velocity of a particle, he concluded, should always equal the group velocity of the corresponding wave. The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the particle's speed.

Both in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum physics, we can identify the group velocity of a particle's wave function with the particle velocity.  [[Quantum mechanics]] has very accurately demonstrated this hypothesis, and the relation has been shown explicitly for particles as large as [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"/&gt;

De Broglie deduced that if the duality equations already known for light were the same for any particle, then his hypothesis would hold.  This means that

:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{\partial (E/\hbar)}{\partial (p/\hbar)} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial p}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''}} is the total [[energy]] of the particle, {{math|''p''}} is its [[momentum]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the reduced Planck constant. For a free non-relativistic particle it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \frac{1}{2}\frac{p^2}{m} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{p}{m}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''}} is the [[mass]] of the particle and {{math|''v''}} its velocity.

Also in [[special relativity]] we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the rest mass of the particle and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum. But (see below), using that the phase velocity is {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''/''p'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''v''}}, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}\\
    &amp;= \frac{c^2}{v_p}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the velocity of the particle regardless of wave behavior.

====Phase velocity====
In [[quantum mechanics]], particles also behave as waves with [[complex number|complex]] phases. The [[phase velocity]] is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.

By the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{E/\hbar}{p/\hbar} = \frac{E}{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum, we have

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{E}{p} = \frac{m c^2}{m v} = \frac{\gamma m_0 c^2}{\gamma m_0 v} = \frac{c^2}{v} = \frac{c}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the total energy of the particle (i.e. [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]] plus [[kinetic energy]] in the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] sense), ''p'' the [[momentum]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and β the speed as a fraction of ''c''. The variable ''v'' can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed &lt;math&gt;v &lt; c &lt;/math&gt; for any particle that has mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} &gt; c, \,&lt;/math&gt;

and as we can see, it approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for details.

===Four-vectors===
{{Main|Four-vector}}

Using four-vectors, the De Broglie relations form a single equation:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}= \hbar\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.

Likewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega_o}{c^2}\right)\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:[[Four-momentum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{p}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-vector#Four-wavevector|Four-wavevector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{k}} \right) = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \frac{\omega}{v_p}\mathbf{\hat{n}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = \gamma(c,\vec{\mathbf{u}}) = \gamma(c,v_g \hat{\mathbf{n}}) &lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretations==
The physical reality underlying de Broglie waves is a subject of ongoing debate. Some theories treat either the particle or the wave aspect as its fundamental nature, seeking to explain the other as an [[Emergence|emergent property]]. Some, such as the [[hidden variable theory]], treat the wave and the particle as distinct entities. Yet others propose some intermediate entity that is neither quite wave nor quite particle but only appears as such when we measure one or the other property. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the nature of the underlying reality is unknowable and beyond the bounds of scientific inquiry.

Schrödinger's quantum mechanical waves are conceptually different from ordinary physical waves such as water or sound. Ordinary physical waves are characterized by undulating real-number 'displacements' of dimensioned physical variables at each point of ordinary physical space at each instant of time. Schrödinger's "waves" are characterized by the undulating value of a dimensionless complex number at each point of an abstract multi-dimensional space, for example of configuration space.

At the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] reported as follows:

{{quote|If one wishes to calculate the probabilities of excitation and ionization of atoms [M. Born, Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange, ''Z. f. Phys.'', '''37''' (1926), 863; [Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange], ''ibid.'', '''38''' (1926), 803] then one must introduce the coordinates of the atomic electrons as variables on an equal footing with those of the colliding electron. The waves then propagate no longer in three-dimensional space but in multi-dimensional configuration space. From this one sees that the quantum mechanical waves are indeed something quite different from the light waves of the classical theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1928). Quantum mechanics, pp. 143–181 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, p. 166; this translation at p. 425 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the same conference, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] reported likewise.

{{quote|Under [the name 'wave mechanics',] at present two theories are being carried on, which are indeed closely related but not identical. The first, which follows on directly from the famous doctoral thesis by L. de Broglie, concerns waves in three-dimensional space. Because of the strictly relativistic treatment that is adopted in this version from the outset, we shall refer to it as the ''four-dimensional'' wave mechanics. The other theory is more remote from Mr de Broglie's original ideas, insofar as it is based on a wave-like process in the space of ''position coordinates'' (''q''-space) of an arbitrary mechanical system.[Long footnote about manuscript not copied here.] We shall therefore call it the ''multi-dimensional'' wave mechanics. Of course this use of the ''q''-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately, in this version also, the process to be described is one in space and time. In truth, however, a complete unification of the two conceptions has not yet been achieved. Anything over and above the motion of a single electron could be treated so far only in the ''multi''-dimensional version; also, this is the  one that provides the mathematical solution to the problems posed by the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger, E.]] (1928). Wave mechanics, pp. 185–206 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, pp. 185–186; this translation at p. 447 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, Heisenberg reiterated this:

{{quote|An important step forward was made by the work of Born [''Z. Phys.'', '''37''': 863, 1926 and '''38''': 803, 1926] in the summer of 1926. In this work, the wave in configuration space was interpreted as a probability wave, in order to explain collision processes on Schrödinger's theory. This hypothesis contained two important new features in comparison with that of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater]]. The first of these was the assertion that, in considering "probability waves", we are concerned with processes not in ordinary three-dimensional space, but in an abstract configuration space (a fact which is, unfortunately, sometimes overlooked even today); the second was the recognition that the probability wave is related to an individual process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955). The development of the interpretation of the quantum theory, pp. 12–29, in ''[[Niels Bohr]] and the Development of Physics: Essays dedicated to Niels Bohr on the occasion of his seventieth birthday'', edited by [[Wolfgang Pauli|W. Pauli]], with the assistance of [[Léon Rosenfeld|L. Rosenfeld]] and [[Victor Weisskopf|V. Weisskopf]], Pergamon Press, London, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is mentioned above that the "displaced quantity" of the Schrödinger wave has values that are dimensionless complex numbers. One may ask what is the physical meaning of those numbers. According to Heisenberg, rather than being of some ordinary physical quantity such as, for example, Maxwell's electric field intensity, or mass density, the Schrödinger-wave packet's "displaced quantity" is probability amplitude. He wrote that instead of using the term 'wave packet', it is preferable to speak of a probability packet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927). Über den anschlaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik, ''Z. Phys.'' '''43''': 172–198, translated by eds. [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, J.A.]], [[Wojciech Zurek|Zurek, W.H.]] (1983), at pp. 62–84 of ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, p. 73. Also translated as 'The actual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics' [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19840008978.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The probability amplitude supports calculation of probability of location or momentum of discrete particles. Heisenberg recites Duane's account of particle diffraction by probabilistic quantal translation momentum transfer, which allows, for example in Young's two-slit experiment, each diffracted particle probabilistically to pass discretely through a particular slit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', translated by C. Eckart, F. C. Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one does not need necessarily think of the matter wave, as it were, as 'composed of smeared matter'.

These ideas may be expressed in ordinary language as follows. In the account of ordinary physical waves, a 'point' refers to a position in ordinary physical space at an instant of time, at which there is specified a 'displacement' of some physical quantity. But in the account of quantum mechanics, a 'point' refers to a configuration of the system at an instant of time, every particle of the system being in a sense present in every 'point' of configuration space, each particle at such a 'point' being located possibly at a different position in ordinary physical space. There is no explicit definite indication that, at an instant, this particle is 'here' and that particle is 'there' in some separate 'location' in configuration space. This conceptual difference entails that, in contrast to de Broglie's pre-quantum mechanical wave description, the quantum mechanical probability packet description does not directly and explicitly express the Aristotelian idea, referred to by Newton, that causal efficacy propagates through ordinary space by contact, nor the Einsteinian idea that such propagation is no faster than light. In contrast, these ideas are so expressed in the classical wave account, through the [[Green's function]], though it is inadequate for the observed quantal phenomena. The physical reasoning for this was first recognized by Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, A. (1986).

Miller, Plenum Press, New York, {{ISBN|978-1-4684-8773-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==De Broglie's phase wave and periodic phenomenon==
De Broglie's thesis started from the hypothesis, "that to each portion of energy with a proper mass {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} one may associate a periodic phenomenon of the frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} , such that one finds: {{math|''hν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is to be measured, of course, in the rest frame of the energy packet. This hypothesis is the basis of our theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Broglie | first1 = L. | authorlink = Louis de Broglie | year = 1923 | title = Waves and quanta | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 112 | issue = 2815| page = 540 | doi=10.1038/112540a0| bibcode = 1923Natur.112..540D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie, L.]] (1924).

De Broglie followed his initial hypothesis of a periodic phenomenon, with frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, associated with the energy packet. He used the special theory of relativity to find, in the frame of the observer of the electron energy packet that is moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, that its frequency was apparently reduced to

:&lt;math&gt;f = \nu_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda f = E/p=v_\mathrm p\,.&lt;/math&gt;

using the same notation as above. The quantity &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of what de Broglie called the "phase y wave". Its wavelength is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. De Broglie reasoned that his hypothetical intrinsic particle periodic phenomenon is in phase with that phase wave. This was his basic matter wave conception. He noted, as above, that &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;, and the phase wave does not transfer energy.&lt;ref name="Medicus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009). ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}, pp. 30–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of waves being associated with matter is correct, de Broglie did not leap directly to the final understanding of quantum mechanics with no missteps. There are conceptual problems with the approach that de Broglie took in his thesis that he was not able to resolve, despite trying a number of different fundamental hypotheses in different papers published while working on, and shortly after publishing, his thesis.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;{{cite web

These difficulties were resolved by [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who developed the wave mechanics approach, starting from a somewhat different basic hypothesis.

The '''maximum power principle''' or '''Lotka's principle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tilley |first1=David Rogers |title=Howard T. Odum’s contribution to the laws of energy |journal=Ecological Modelling |date=2004 |volume=178 |pages=121–125 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.032 |url=http://www.unicamp.br/fea/ortega/extensao/davidtilley-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed as the fourth [[Principles of energetics|principle of energetics]] in [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] [[thermodynamics]], where an example of an open system is a biological cell. According to [[Howard T. Odum]], "The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Odum 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;311&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chen (2006) has located the origin of the statement of maximum power as a formal principle in a tentative proposal by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922a, b). Lotka's statement sought to explain the Darwinian notion of evolution with reference to a physical principle. Lotka's work was subsequently developed by the [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] in collaboration with the Chemical Engineer Richard C. Pinkerton, and later advanced by the Engineer [[Myron Tribus]].

While Lotka's work may have been a first attempt to formalise evolutionary thought in mathematical terms, it followed similar observations made by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Vito Volterra|Volterra]] and Ludwig [[Boltzmann]], for example, throughout the sometimes controversial history of natural philosophy.  In contemporary literature it is most commonly associated with the work of Howard T. Odum.

The significance of Odum's approach was given greater support during the 1970s, amid times of [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], where, as Gilliland (1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;100) observed, there was an emerging need for a new method of analysing the importance and value of energy resources to economic and environmental production. A field known as [[energy analysis]], itself associated with [[net energy]] and [[EROEI]], arose to fulfill this analytic need. However, in energy analysis intractable theoretical and practical difficulties arose when using the [[energy unit]] to understand, a) the conversion among concentrated fuel types (or [[energy types]]), b)  the contribution of labour, and c) the contribution of the environment.

==Philosophy and theory==
Lotka said (1922b: 151): 
{{cquote|The principle of natural selection reveals itself as capable of yielding information which the first and second laws of thermodynamics are not competent to furnish. The two fundamental laws of thermodynamics are, of course, insufficient to determine the course of events in a physical system. They tell us that certain things cannot happen, but they do not tell us what does happen.}}

Gilliland noted that these difficulties in analysis in turn required some new theory to adequately explain the interactions and transactions of these different energies (different concentrations of fuels, labour and environmental forces). Gilliland (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101) suggested that Odum's statement of the maximum power principle (H.T.Odum 1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–87) was, perhaps, an adequate expression of the requisite theory:
{{cquote|That theory, as it is expressed by the maximum power principle, addresses the empirical question of why systems of any type or size organize themselves into the patterns observed. Such a question assumes that physical laws govern system function. It does not assume, for example, that the system comprising economic production is driven by consumers; rather that the whole cycle of production-consumption is structured and driven by physical laws.}}

This theory Odum called maximum power theory. In order to formulate maximum power theory Gilliland observed that Odum had added another law (the maximum power principle) to the already well established laws of thermodynamics. In 1978 Gilliland wrote that Odum's new law had not yet been validated (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101). Gilliland stated that in maximum power theory the [[second law efficiency]] of thermodynamics required an additional physical concept: "the concept of second law efficiency under maximum power" (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101):

{{cquote|Neither the first or second law of thermodynamics include a measure of the rate at which energy transformations or processes occur. The concept of maximum power incorporates time into measures of energy transformations. It provides information about the rate at which one kind of energy is transformed into another as well as the efficiency of that transformation.}} 
     
In this way the concept of maximum power was being used as a principle to quantitatively describe the selective law of biological [[evolution]]. Perhaps H.T.Odum's most concise statement of this view was (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;62):

{{cquote|Lotka provided the theory of natural selection as a maximum power organizer; under competitive conditions systems are selected which use their energies in various structural-developing actions so as to maximize their use of available energies. By this theory systems of cycles which drain less energy lose out in comparative development. However Leopold and Langbein have shown that streams in developing erosion profiles, meander systems, and tributary networks disperse their potential energies more slowly than if their channels were more direct. These two statements might be harmonized by an optimum efficiency maximum power principle (Odum and Pinkerton 1955), which indicates that energies which are converted too rapidly into heat are not made available to the systems own use because they are not fed back through storages into useful pumping, but instead do random stirring of the environment.}}

The Odum–Pinkerton approach to Lotka's proposal was to apply [[Ohm's law]] – and the associated [[maximum power theorem]] (a result in [[electric power|electrical power]] systems) – to ecological systems. Odum and Pinkerton defined "power" in electronic terms as the rate of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], where Work is understood as a "[[Thermodynamic free energy|useful energy]] transformation". &lt;!-- (In electrical engineering and physics, "[[Power (physics)|power]]" is defined as the rate of doing work or consuming energy, without any distinction between "useful energy" and any other energy.) --&gt;The concept of maximum power can therefore be defined as the '''''maximum''' rate of '''useful''' energy transformation''. Hence the underlying philosophy aims to unify the theories and associated laws of electronic and thermodynamic systems with biological systems. This approach presupposed an [[Analogical models|analogical view]] which sees the world as an ecological-electronic-economic engine.

==Proposals for maximum power principle as 4th thermodynamic law==
{{quotation|It has been pointed out by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] that the fundamental object of contention in the life-struggle, in the evolution of the organic world, is available energy. In accord with this observation is the principle that, in the struggle for existence, the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in directing available energy into channels favorable to the preservation of the species.|A.J. Lotka 1922a, p. 147}}

{{quotation|...it seems to this author appropriate to unite the biological and physical traditions by giving the Darwinian principle of natural selection the citation as the ''fourth law of thermodynamics'', since it is the controlling principle in rate of heat generation and efficiency settings in irreversible biological processes.|H.T. Odum 1963, p. 437}}

{{quotation|...it may be time to recognize the maximum power principle as the fourth thermodynamic law as suggested by Lotka.|H.T. Odum 1994}}

==Definition in words==
{{cquote|The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency. (H.T. Odum 1995, p. 311)}}

{{cquote|...the maximum power principle ... states that systems which maximize their flow of energy survive in competition. In other words, rather than merely accepting the fact that more energy per unit of time is transformed in a process which operates at maximum power, this principle says that systems organize and structure themselves naturally to maximize power. Systems regulate themselves according to the maximum power principle. Over time, the systems which maximize power are selected for whereas those that do not are selected against and eventually eliminated. ... Odum argues ... that the free market mechanisms of the economy effectively do the same thing for human systems and that our economic evolution to date is a product of that selection process. (Gilliland 1978, pp. 101–102)}}

Odum et al. viewed the [[maximum power theorem]] as a principle of '''power-efficiency reciprocity selection''' with wider application than just electronics. For example, Odum saw it in open systems operating on solar energy, like both photovoltaics and photosynthesis (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Like the maximum power theorem, Odum's statement of the maximum power principle relies on the notion of 'matching', such that high-quality energy maximizes power by matching and amplifying energy (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;262, 541): "in surviving designs a matching of high-quality energy with larger amounts of low-quality energy is likely to occur" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;260). As with electronic circuits, the resultant rate of energy transformation will be at a maximum at an intermediate power efficiency. In 2006, T.T. Cai, C.L. Montague and J.S. Davis said that, "The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source." (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;317). In several texts H.T. Odum gave the [[Atwood machine]] as a practical example of the 'principle' of maximum power.

=== Mathematical definition ===
The mathematical definition given by H.T. Odum is formally analogous to the definition provided on the [[maximum power theorem]] article. (For a brief explanation of Odum's approach to the relationship between ecology and electronics see [[Howard T. Odum#Ecological analog of Ohm.27s Law|Ecological Analog of Ohm's Law]])

==Contemporary ideas==
Whether or not the principle of maximum power efficiency can be considered the fourth law of thermodynamics and the fourth principle of energetics is moot. Nevertheless, H.T. Odum also proposed a corollary of maximum power as the organisational principle of evolution, describing the evolution of [[microbiological]] systems, [[economic systems]], [[planet]]ary systems, and [[astrophysical]] systems. He called this corollary the '''[[Maximum empower#Empower and maximum empower|maximum empower]]''' principle.  This was suggested because, as S.E. Jorgensen, M.T. Brown, H.T. Odum (2004) note,

{{quotation|Maximum power might be misunderstood to mean giving priority to low level processes. ... However, the higher level transformation processes are just as important as the low level processes. ... Therefore, Lotka's principle is clarified by stating it as the principle of self organization for maximum ''empower''. |p. 18}}

C. Giannantoni may have confused matters when he wrote "The "Maximum Em-Power Principle" (Lotka–Odum) is generally considered the "Fourth Thermodynamic Principle" (mainly) because of its practical validity for a very wide class of physical and biological systems" (C. Giannantoni 2002, § 13, p.&amp;nbsp;155). Nevertheless,  Giannantoni has proposed the Maximum Em-Power Principle as the fourth principle of thermodynamics (Giannantoni 2006).

The preceding discussion is incomplete. The "maximum power" was discovered several times independently, in physics and engineering, see: Novikov (1957), El-Wakil (1962), and Curzon and Ahlborn (1975). The incorrectness of this analysis and design evolution conclusions was demonstrated by Gyftopoulos (2002).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9251">[[File:Romuvan ritual fire.png|thumb|An ''aukuras'', a type of fire altar found in [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a modern Pagan faith characterised as a "nature religion".]]

A '''nature religion''' is a religious movement that believes [[nature]] and the [[Natural environment|natural world]] is an embodiment of divinity, sacredness or spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"/&gt; Nature religions include [[indigenous religion]]s [[Nature worship|practiced]] in various parts of the world by cultures who consider the environment to be imbued with spirits and other sacred entities. It also includes [[modern Paganism|contemporary Pagan]] faiths which are primarily concentrated in Europe and North America.

The term "nature religion" was first coined by the American [[religious studies]] scholar [[Catherine Albanese]], who used it in her work ''Nature Religion in America: From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age'' (1991) and later went on to use it in other studies. Following on from Albanese's development of the term it has since been used by other academics working in the discipline.

==Definition==
Catherine Albanese described nature religion as "a symbolic center and the cluster of beliefs, behaviours, and values that encircles it", deeming it to be useful for shining a light on aspects of history that are rarely viewed as religious.{{sfn|Albanese|1991|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}}
In a paper of his on the subject, the Canadian religious studies scholar Peter Beyer described "nature religion" as a "useful analytical abstraction" to refer to "any religious belief or practice in which devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to note that in this way nature religion was not an "identifiable religious tradition" such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Christianity]] are, but that it instead covers "a range of religious and quasi-religious movements, groups and social networks whose participants may or may not identify with one of the many constructed religions of global society which referred to many other nature religion."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 16"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anastasianism is a Russian-originated modern Pagan movement that sacralises environmental and human nativity (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]''), and is therefore regarded as a "nature religion".]]

===Common characteristics===
Peter Beyer noted the existence of a series of common characteristics which he believed were shared by different nature religions. He remarked that although "one must be careful not to overgeneralise", he suspected that there were a series of features which "occur sufficiently often" in those nature religions known to recorded scholarship to constitute a pattern.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

The first of these common characteristics was nature religion's "comparative resistance to institutionalisation and legitimisation in terms of identifiable socio-religious authorities and organisations", meaning that nature religionists rarely formed their religious beliefs into large, visible socio-political structures such as churches. Furthermore, Beyer noted, nature religionists often held a "concomitant distrust of and even eschewing of politically orientated power".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Instead of this, he felt that among nature religious communities, there was "a valuing of community as non-hierarchical" and a "conditional optimism with regard to human capacity and the future."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

In the sphere of the environment, Beyer noted that nature religionists held to a "holistic conception of reality" and "a valorisation of physical place as vital aspects of their spiritualities".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Similarly, Beyer noted the [[individualism]] which was favoured by nature religionists. He remarked that those adhering to such beliefs typically had respect for "charismatic and hence purely individual authority" and place a "strong emphasis on individual paths" which led them to believe in "the equal value of individuals and groups". Along similar lines, he also commented on the "strong experiential basis" to nature religionist beliefs "where personal experience is a final arbiter of truth or validity".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

==Use within academia==
In April 1996, the [[University of Lancaster]] in North West England held a conference on contemporary Paganism entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-10-01|title=Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s. Conference at the Lake District Campus of Lancaster University, 9th to 13th April 1996|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/reli.1996.0031|journal=Religion|volume=26|issue=4|pages=373–376|doi=10.1006/reli.1996.0031|issn=0048-721X}}&lt;/ref&gt;", and ultimately led to the publication of an academic anthology of the same name two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This book, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World'', was edited by members of the University's Department of Religious Studies, a postgraduate named Joanne Pearson and two professors, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of [[Wicca]], the [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed the view that the category of "nature religion" was problematic from a "historical perspective" because it solely emphasises the "commonalities of belief and attitude to the natural world" that are found between different religions and in doing so divorces these different belief systems from their distinctive socio-cultural and historical backgrounds.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=8}}

'''Open energy system database''' projects employ [[open data]] methods to collect, [[Data cleansing|clean]], and republish energy-related [[dataset]]s for open use.  The resulting information is then available, given a suitable [[open license]], for statistical analysis and for building numerical [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|models]], including [[open energy system models]].  Permissive licenses like [[Creative Commons]] [[CC0]] and {{nowrap|[[CC BY]]}} are preferred, but some projects will house data made public under market transparency regulations and carrying unqualified [[copyright]].

The databases themselves may furnish information on national power plant fleets, renewable generation assets, transmission networks, [[time series]] for electricity loads, dispatch, [[Spot contract|spot prices]], and cross-border trades, weather information, and similar.  They may also offer other energy statistics including fossil fuel imports and exports, gas, oil, and coal prices, emissions certificate prices, and information on [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] costs and benefits.

Much of the data is sourced from official or semi-official agencies, including [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  Data is also [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] using public [[wiki]]s and public upload facilities.  Projects usually also maintain a strict record of the [[wiktionary:provenance|provenance]] and version histories of the datasets they hold.  Some projects, as part of their mandate, also try to persuade primary data providers to release their data under more liberal licensing conditions.{{efn|For example, in 2016 the [[#Open Power System Data|Open Power System Data]] project persuaded four German [[transmission system operator]]s to adopt open licensing.&lt;ref name="osi-2016"/&gt;}}

Two drivers favor the establishment of such databases.  The first is a wish to reduce the duplication of effort that accompanies each new analytical project as it assembles and processes the data that it needs from primary sources.  And the second is an increasing desire to make [[public policy]] energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Better transparency dictates the use of open information, able to be accessed and scrutinized by third-parties, in addition to releasing the [[source code]] for the models in question.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"/&gt;

&lt;!-- The projects listed here are deemed suitable for inclusion through having pending or published academic literature or by being reported in secondary sources. --&gt;

== General considerations ==

=== Background ===

In the mid-1990s, energy models used structured text files for data interchange but efforts were being made to migrate to [[relational database management system]]s for data processing.&lt;ref name="groscurth-1995-075bf0"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | first1 = Helmuth-M | last1 = Groscurth
 | date = 1 July 1995
 | title = Design and management of energy databases

 | volume = 17
 | number = 4
 | pages = 445–457
 | doi = 10.1080/00908319508946093
 | issn = 0090-8312
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These early efforts however remained local to a project and did not involve online publishing or open data principles.

The first energy information portal to go live was [[#OpenEI|OpenEI]] in late 2009, followed by [[#reegle|reegle]] in 2011.

A 2012 paper marks the first scientific publication to advocate the [[crowdsourcing]] of energy data.&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | access-date = 2016-06-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 PhD thesis by Chris Davis also discusses the crowdsourcing of energy data in some depth.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;  A 2016 thesis surveyed the spatial ([[geographic information system|GIS]]) information requirements for energy planning and finds that most types of data, with the exception of energy expenditure data, are available but nonetheless remain scattered and poorly coordinated.&lt;ref name="berndtsson-2016-msc"&gt;
{{cite thesis

 | access-date = 2017-03-07
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of open data, a 2017 paper concludes that energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last1 = Pfenninger | first1 = Stefan

 | access-date = 2017-02-03
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213–214}}  The paper also lists the benefits of open data and open models and discusses the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|211–213}}  A one-page opinion piece from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"&gt;&lt;!-- alternative url: http://www.nature.com/news/energy-scientists-must-show-their-workings-1.21517 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Database design ===

[[Data models]] are central to the design and organization of databases.  Open energy database projects generally try to develop and adhere to well resolved data models, using [[De facto standard|de{{nbsp}}facto]] and [[Technical standard|published standards]] where applicable.  Some projects attempt to coordinate their data models in order to harmonize their data and improve its utility.  Defining and maintaining suitable [[metadata]] is also a key issue.  The [[Information lifecycle management|life-cycle management]] of data includes, but is not limited to, the use of [[version control]] to track the provenance of incoming and [[Data cleansing|cleansed]] data.  Some sites allow users to comment on and rate individual datasets.

=== Dataset copyright and database rights ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  As noted, most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources.  But many of the publicly available energy datasets carry no license, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Copyright protected material cannot lawfully be circulated, nor can it be modified and republished.

{{anchor|ec-regulation-543-2013}}Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped much because the associated information is again not licensed to enable modification and republication.  Transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013.&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | author = European Commission
 | title = Commission Regulation (EU) No 543/2013 of 14 June 2013 on submission and publication of data in electricity markets and amending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council
 | date = 15 June 2013
 | journal = Official Journal of the European Union
 | volume = L&amp;nbsp;163
 | pages = 1–12
 | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:163:0001:0012:EN:PDF
 | access-date = 2016-12-01
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, 543/2013 "is only an obligation to publish, not an obligation to license".&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;{{rp|slide{{nnbsp}}14}}  Notwithstanding, 543/2013 does enable downloaded data to be computer processed with legal certainty.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Energy databases with hardware located with the European Union are protected under a general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the legal status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | first1 = Lina | last1 = Boecker
 | date = 21 November 2016
 | title = Energy databases: protection and licensing
 | publisher = JBB Rechtsanwaelte

 | access-date = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Database rights not waived by public sector providers significantly restrict the amount of data a user can lawfully access.

A December 2017 submission by energy researchers in Germany and elsewhere highlighted a number of concerns over the re-use of public sector information within the Europe Union.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Robbie
 | last2 = Brown | first2 = Tom
 | last3 = De Felice | first3 = Matteo
 | title = Submission on the re-use of public sector information: with an emphasis on energy system datasets — Release 09
 | date = 10 December 2017
 | location = Berlin, Germany
 | url = https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/uploads/default/original/1X/d659fda325438884e6e78b372772ed7069633f97.pdf
 | access-date = 2017-12-13
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The submission drew heavily on a recent legal opinion covering electricity data.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Jaeger | first1 = Till
 | title = Legal aspects of European electricity data — Legal opinion
 | date = 24 July 2017
 | publisher = JBB Rechtsanwälte
 | location = Berlin, Germany
 | url = https://open-power-system-data.org/legal-opinion.pdf
 | access-date = 2017-10-13
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy statistics ===

National and international energy statistics are published regularly by governments and international agencies, such as the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]].&lt;ref name="iea-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Key world energy statistics
 | date = 2016
 | publisher = International Energy Agency (IEA)
 | location = Paris, France
 | url = https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf
 | access-date = 2016-12-15
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016 the United Nations issued guidelines for energy statistics.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"&gt;&lt;!-- print ISBN: 978-92-1-161584-5 --&gt;
&lt;!-- PDF dated: 23 September 2016  --&gt;
{{cite book|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/IRES_edited2.pdf|title=International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES) — ST/ESA/STAT/SER.M/93|date=2016|publisher=Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations|isbn=978-92-1-056520-2|location=New York, NY, USA|access-date=2016-12-17}}  Annotated as final edited version prior to typesetting.  Also covers energy-related greenhouse gas emissions accounting.
&lt;/ref&gt;  While the definitions and sectoral breakdowns are useful when defining models, the information provided is rarely in sufficient detail to enable its use in high-resolution energy system models.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|213}}

=== Published standards ===

There are few published standards covering the collection and structuring of high-resolution energy system data.  The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[Common Information Model (electricity)|Common Information Model]] (CIM) defines data exchange protocols for low and high voltage electricity networks.

== Open energy system database projects ==

Energy system models are data intensive and normally require detailed information from a number of sources.  Dedicated projects to collect, collate, document, and republish energy system datasets have arisen to service this need.  Most database projects prefer open data, issued under [[Copyright|free licenses]], but some will accept datasets with proprietary licenses in the absence of other options.

The [[OpenStreetMap]] project, which uses the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL), contains geographic information about energy system components, including transmission lines.  Wikipedia itself has a growing set of information related to national energy systems, including descriptions of individual power stations.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;{{rp|156–159}}

The following [[#table-open-energy-system-database-projects|table]] summarizes projects that specifically publish open energy system data.  Some are general repositories while others (for instance, [[#oedb|oedb]]) are designed to interact with open energy system models in real-time.

{{anchor|tag-linked-open-data}} Three of the projects listed work with [[Linked data#Linked open data|linked open data]] (LOD), a method of publishing structured data on the [[World Wide Web|web]] so that it can be networked and subject to [[Semantic query|semantic queries]].  The overarching concept is termed the [[semantic web]].  Technically, such projects support [[Representational state transfer|RESTful APIs]], [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], and the [[SPARQL]] query language.

The energydata.info project from the [[World Bank Group]], [[Washington, DC]], USA is an energy database portal designed to support national development by improving public access to energy information.&lt;ref name="energydata-info-website"&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as sharing data, the platform also offers tools to visualize and analyze energy data.  Although the World Bank Group has made available a number of dataset and apps, external users and organizations are encouraged to contribute.  The concepts of open data and open source development are central to the project.  energydata.info uses its own [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[CKAN]] open source data portal as its web-based platform.  The Creative Commons [[Creative Commons license|CC BY 4.0]] license is preferred for data but other open licenses can be deployed. Users are also bound by the terms of use for the site.&lt;ref name="energydata-info-terms-of-use"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017|01}}, the database held 131{{nbsp}}datasets, the great majority related to [[Developing country|developing countries]].  The datasets are tagged and can be easily filtered.  A number of download formats, including [[Geographic information system|GIS]] files, are supported: [[Comma-separated values|CSV]], [[Microsoft Excel|XLS]], [[Office Open XML|XLSX]], [[ArcGIS]], [[Esri]], [[GeoJSON]], [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], and [[Shapefile|SHP]].  Some datasets are also offered as [[HTML]].  Again, {{as of|lc=yes|2017|01}}, four apps are available.  Some are web-based and run from a browser.

The OpenEnergy Platform (OEP) is a collaborative versioned [[dataset]] repository for storing open energy system model datasets.  A dataset is presumed to be in the form of a [[table (database)|database table]], together with [[metadata]].  Registered users can upload and download datasets manually using a web-interface or programmatically via an [[Application programming interface|API]] using [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] calls.  Uploaded datasets are screened for integrity using deterministic rules and then subject to confirmation by a moderator.  The use of versioning means that any prior state of the database can be accessed (as recommended in this 2012 paper).&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the repository is specifically designed to interoperate with energy system models.  The [[Front and back ends|backend]] is a [[PostgreSQL]] [[object-relational database]] under [[Apache Subversion|subversion]] [[version control]].  Open source licenses are specific to each dataset.  Unlike other database projects, users can download the current version (the public tables) of the entire [[PostgreSQL]] database or any previous version.  Initial development is being lead by the Reiner Lemoine Institute, [[Berlin]], Germany.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The platform was originally implemented by the [[University of Flensburg]], [[German Institute for Economic Research|DIW Berlin]], the [[Technical University of Berlin]], and the energy economics consultancy Neon Neue Energieökonomik, all from Germany.  The first phase of the project, from August 2015 to July 2017, was funded by the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy]] (BMWi) for {{val|490000|p=€}}.&lt;ref name="fischer-2015"&gt;

Developers collate and harmonize data from a range of government, regulatory, and industry sources throughout Europe.  The website and the metadata utilize English, whereas the original material can be in any one of [[Languages of European Union|24{{nbsp}}languages]].  Datasets follow the emerging [[Comma-separated values#OKI frictionless tabular data package|frictionless data package]] standard being developed by [[Open Knowledge International]] (OKI).  The website was launched on 28{{nbsp}}October 2016.  {{as of|2018|06}}, the project offers the following primary packages, for Germany and other European countries:

* details, including [[geolocation]], of conventional power plants and renewable energy power plants
* aggregated generation capacity by technology and country
* hourly [[time series]] covering electrical load, day-ahead electricity spot prices, and wind and solar resources
* a script to filter and download [[NASA]] MERRA-2 satellite weather data{{efn|name=merra-2|
MERRA-2 stands for Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2.  The [[Remote sensing|remote-sensed]] data is provided unencumbered by the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] research laboratory.

In addition, the project hosts selected contributed packages:

* electricity demand and self-generation time series for representative south German households
* simulated [[Photovoltaics|PV]] and wind generation [[capacity factor]] time series for Europe, generated by the [[#Renewables.ninja|Renewables.ninja]] project

To facilitate analysis, the data is aggregated into large structured files (in [[comma-separated values|CSV]] format) and loaded into data packages with standardized machine-readable metadata (in [[JSON]] format).&lt;ref name="oki-data-package"&gt;

The licensing conditions for the data itself depends on the source and varies in terms of openness.  Previous versions of the datasets and scripts can be recovered in order to track changes or replicate earlier studies.  The project also engages with energy data providers, such as [[transmission system operator]]s (TSO) and [[European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity|ENTSO-E]], to encourage them to make their data available under [[Copyright#Free licences|open licenses]] (for instance, [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] and [[Open Database License|ODbL]] licenses).&lt;ref name="osi-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  While much of its data is from US government sources, the platform is intended to be open and global in scope.

OpenEI provides two mechanisms for contributing structured information: a [[semantic wiki]] (using [[MediaWiki]] and the [[Semantic MediaWiki]] extension) for collaboratively-managed resources and a [[dataset]] upload facility for contributor-controlled resources.  US government data is distributed under a [[CC0]] [[public domain]] dedication, whereas other contributors are free to select an open data license of their choice.  Users can rate data using a five-star system, based on accessibility, adaptability, usefulness, and general quality.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt;  Individual datasets can be manually downloaded in an appropriate format, often as [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt; [[Scripting language|Scripts]] for processing data can also be shared through the site.  In order to build a community around the platform, a number of [[Internet forum|forums]] are offered covering energy system data and related topics.&lt;ref name="openei-homepage"/&gt;

Most of the data on OpenEI is exposed as [[Linked data#Linked open data|linked open data]] (LOD) (described [[#tag-linked-open-data|elsewhere]] on this page).

OpenGridMap provides a tailored [[Geographic information system|GIS]] web application, layered on [[OpenStreetMap]], which contributors can use to upload and edit information directly.  The same database automatically stores field recordings submitted by the mobile app.  Subsequent classification by experts allows normal citizens to document and photograph electrical components and have them correctly identified.  The project is experimenting with the use of hobby drones to obtain better information on associated facilities, such as [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] installations.  Transmission line data is also sourced from and shared with OpenStreetMap.  Each component [[Row (database)|record]] is verified by a moderator.

Once sufficient data is available, the transnet software is run to produce a likely network, using [[Correlation and dependence|statistical correlation]], [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi partitioning]], and [[minimum spanning tree]] (MST) algorithms.  The resulting network can be exported in [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] (separate files for nodes and lines), [[XML]], and [[Common Information Model (electricity)|CIM]] formats.  CIM models are well suited for translation into software-specific data formats for further analysis, including [[Power system simulation|power grid simulation]].  Transnet also displays [[descriptive statistics]] about the resulting network for visual confirmation.&lt;ref name="rivera-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

The project is motivated by the need to provide datasets for high-resolution energy system models, so that energy system transitions (like the German ''[[Energiewende]]'') can be better managed, both technically and policy-wise.&lt;ref name="energate-messenger-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapid expansion of [[Renewable energy|renewable generation]] and the anticipated uptake of [[electric vehicle]]s means that electricity system models must increasingly represent distribution and transmission networks in some detail.

{{as of|2017}}, OpenGridMap techniques have been used to estimate the low voltage network in the German city of [[Garching bei München|Garching]] and to estimate the high voltage grids in several other countries.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally released as a specialized [[internet search engine]], reegle was relaunched in 2011 as an information portal.

reegle offers and utilizes [[linked data#linked open data|linked open data]] (LOD) (described [[#tag-linked-open-data|elsewhere]] on this page).&lt;ref name="bauer-and-kaltenboeck-2012"/&gt;{{rp|43–46}}  Sources of data include [[United Nations|UN]] and [[World Bank]] databases, as well as dedicated partners around the world.  reegle maintains a comprehensive structured [[glossary]] (driven by an LOD-compliant [[Thesaurus (information retrieval)|thesaurus]]) of energy and climate compatible development terms to assist with the tagging of datasets.  The glossary also facilitates intelligent web searches.{{efn|
Alternative interfaces to the glossary, provided by the Climate Tagger project, include a [http://www.climatetagger.net/climate-thesaurus/tree tree view] and an [http://www.climatetagger.net/glossary alphabetic view].

[[Renewables.ninja]] is a website that can calculate the hourly power output from [[photovoltaics|solar photovoltaic]] installations and [[wind farm]]s located anywhere in the world.  The website is a joint project between the [https://www.usys.ethz.ch/en/ Department of Environmental Systems Science], [[ETH Zurich]], [[Zürich]], Switzerland and the [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/environmental-policy/ Centre for Environmental Policy], [[Imperial College London]], [[London]], United Kingdom.  The website went live during September 2016.  The resulting time series are provided under a Creative Commons {{nowrap|CC BY-NC 4.0}} license and the underlying power plant models are published using a [[BSD-new]] license.  {{as of|2017|02}}, only the solar model, written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], has been released.&lt;ref name="renewables-ninja-website"&gt;

The project relies on weather data derived from [[meteorological reanalysis]] models and weather [[Meteosat|satellite images]].  More specifically, it uses the 2016 MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset from [[NASA]]{{nnbsp}}{{efn|name=merra-2}} and satellite images from CM-SAF SARAH.&lt;ref name="mueller-etal-2015"&gt;

The website displays an interactive world map to aid the selection of a site.  Users can then choose a plant type and enter some technical characteristics.  {{as of|2017|02}}, only year 2014 data can be served, due to technical restrictions.  The results are automatically plotted and are available for download in hourly [[comma separated values|CSV]] format with or without the associated weather information.  The site offers an [[Application programming interface|API]] for programmatic dataset recovery using token-based authorization.  Examples deploying [[cURL]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are provided.

A number of studies have been undertaking using the power production datasets underpinning the website (these studies predate the launch of the website), with the bulk focusing on energy options for [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="staffel-and-green-2014"&gt;

[[File:Earth's atmosphere.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The interface between the Earth's surface and outer space. The [[Kármán line]] at an altitude of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} is shown. The layers of [[atmosphere of Earth|the atmosphere]] are drawn to scale, whereas objects within them, such as the [[International Space Station]], are not.]]

'''Outer space''', or just '''space''', is the expanse that exists beyond the [[Earth]] and between [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a [[hard vacuum]] containing a low density of particles, predominantly a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] as well as [[electromagnetic radiation]], [[magnetic field]]s, [[cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos]], [[cosmic dust|dust]], and [[cosmic ray]]s. The baseline [[temperature]], as set by the [[cosmic background radiation|background radiation]] from the [[Big Bang]], is {{Convert|2.7|K|C F|abbr=out}}.&lt;ref name="CBE2008" /&gt; The [[Warm–hot intergalactic medium|plasma between galaxies]] accounts for about half of the [[baryonic matter|baryonic (ordinary) matter]] in the universe; it has a [[number density]] of less than one [[hydrogen atom]] per [[cubic metre]] and a temperature of millions of kelvins;&lt;ref name=baas41_908/&gt; local concentrations of this plasma have condensed into [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called [[dark matter]], which interacts with other matter through [[gravitation]]al but not [[electromagnetic force]]s.{{sfn|Freedman|Kaufmann|2005|pp=573, 599–601}}&lt;ref name="Trimble 1987" /&gt; Observations suggest that the majority of the [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass-energy]] in the [[observable universe]] is a poorly understood [[vacuum energy]] of space, which astronomers label ''[[dark energy]]''.&lt;ref name="nasa_darkenergy" /&gt;{{sfn|Freedman|Kaufmann|2005|pp=650–653}} Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the [[Universe]], but even galaxies and [[star system]]s consist almost entirely of empty space.

Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth's surface. However, the [[Kármán line]], an altitude of {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} above sea level,{{sfn|O'Leary|2009|p=84}}&lt;ref name=space_begin/&gt; is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international [[space law]] was established by the [[Outer Space Treaty]], which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of [[national sovereignty]] and permits all states to freely [[space exploration|explore outer space]]. Despite the drafting of [[UN resolution]]s for the peaceful uses of outer space, [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been tested in Earth orbit.

Humans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the advent of high-altitude [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon flights]], followed by manned [[rocket launch]]es. [[Earth orbit]] was first achieved by [[Yuri Gagarin]] of the Soviet Union in 1961, and [[unmanned spacecraft]] have since reached all of the known [[planet]]s in the [[Solar System]]. Due to the high cost of getting into space, manned [[spaceflight]] has been limited to low Earth orbit and the [[Moon]].

Outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and [[radiation]]. [[Microgravity]] also has a negative effect on human [[physiology]] that causes both [[muscle atrophy]] and [[Spaceflight osteopenia|bone loss]]. In addition to these health and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high.

== Discovery ==
In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] suggested that ''nature abhors a vacuum'', a principle that became known as the ''[[Horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui]]''. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE [[Ontology|ontological]] argument by the Greek philosopher [[Parmenides]], who denied the possible existence of a void in space.{{sfn|Grant|1981|p=10}} Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the [[Western culture|West]] it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty.{{sfn|Porter|Park|Daston|2006|p=27}} As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher [[René Descartes]] argued that the entirety of space must be filled.{{sfn|Eckert|2006|p=5}}

In [[ancient China]], the 2nd-century astronomer [[Zhang Heng]] became convinced that space must be infinite, extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the Sun and the stars. The surviving books of the Hsüan Yeh school said that the heavens were boundless, "empty and void of substance". Likewise, the "sun, moon, and the company of stars float in the empty space, moving or standing still".{{sfn|Needham|Ronan|1985|pp=82–87}}

The Italian scientist [[Galileo Galilei]] knew that air had mass and so was subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil [[Evangelista Torricelli]] to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury [[barometer]] and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]] reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air, then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the [[air pressure]] is lower.{{sfn|Holton|Brush|2001|pp=267–268}} In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the [[Puy de Dôme]] mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.{{sfn|Cajori|1917|pp=64–66}}

In 1650, German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] constructed the first vacuum pump: a device that would further refute the principle of ''horror vacui''. He correctly noted that the atmosphere of the Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the [[density]] gradually declining with altitude. He concluded that there must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.{{sfn|Genz|2001|pp=127–128}}

Back in the 15th century, German theologian [[Nicolaus Cusanus]] speculated that the [[Universe]] lacked a center and a circumference. He believed that the Universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained.{{sfn|Tassoul|Tassoul|2004|p=22}} These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]] in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican [[heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] to the concept of an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies.{{sfn|Gatti|2002|pp=99–104}} English philosopher [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void.{{sfn|Kelly|1965|pp=97–107}} This concept of an aether originated with [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies move.{{sfn|Olenick|Apostol|Goodstein|1986|p=356}}

The concept of a Universe filled with a [[luminiferous aether]] remained in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate.{{sfn|Hariharan|2003|p=2}} In 1887, the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking for changes in the [[speed of light]] depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the [[null result]] indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or [[frame of reference]].{{sfn|Olenick|Apostol|Goodstein|1986|pp=357–365}}{{sfn|Thagard|1992|pp=206–209}}

The first professional [[astronomer]] to support the concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman [[Thomas Digges]] in 1576.{{sfn|Maor|1991|p=195}} But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer [[Friedrich Bessel]]. He showed that the star [[61 Cygni]] had a [[stellar parallax|parallax]] of just 0.31&amp;nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 [[light year]]s.{{sfn|Webb|1999|pp=71–73}} In 1917, [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber Curtis]] noted that [[nova]]e in spiral nebulae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than galactic novae, suggesting that the former are 100 times further away.&lt;ref name=Curtis1988/&gt; The distance to the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] was determined in 1923 by American astronomer [[Edwin Hubble]] by measuring the brightness of [[cepheid variable]]s in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by [[Henrietta Leavitt]].&lt;ref name=csiro_20041025/&gt; This established that the Andromeda galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the [[Milky Way]].{{sfn|Tyson|Goldsmith|2004|pp=114–115}}

The earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist [[Charles Édouard Guillaume|Charles É. Guillaume]] in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6&amp;nbsp;K. British physicist [[Arthur Eddington]] made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18&amp;nbsp;K in 1926. German physicist [[Erich Regener]] used the total measured energy of [[cosmic ray]]s to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8&amp;nbsp;K in 1933.&lt;ref name="Apeiron2_3_79"/&gt;

The modern concept of outer space is based on the [[Big Bang cosmology|"Big Bang" cosmology]], first proposed in 1931 by the Belgian physicist [[Georges Lemaître]].&lt;ref name=nature127_3210_706/&gt; This theory holds that the universe originated from a very dense form that has since undergone continuous [[Hubble's law|expansion]]. The background energy released during the initial expansion has steadily decreased in density, leading to a 1948 prediction by American physicists [[Ralph Alpher]] and [[Robert Herman]] of a temperature of 5&amp;nbsp;K for the temperature of space.&lt;ref name="Apeiron2_3_79"/&gt;

The term ''outward space'' was used in 1842 by the English poet Lady [[Emmeline Stuart-Wortley]] in her poem "The Maiden of Moscow".{{sfn|Stuart Wortley|1841|p=410}} The expression ''outer space'' was used as an astronomical term by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1845.{{sfn|Von Humboldt|1845|p=39}} It was later popularized in the writings of [[H. G. Wells]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="entymonline"/&gt; The shorter term ''space'' is older, first used to mean the region beyond Earth's sky in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' in 1667.&lt;ref name=harper2001/&gt;

At left is depicted the rapid [[Inflationary epoch|inflation]] from the initial state, followed thereafter by steady expansion to the present day, shown at right.]]
{{Main|Big Bang}}
According to the Big Bang theory, the very early Universe was an extremely hot and dense state about [[age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]]&lt;ref name=planck_2013 /&gt; which rapidly [[Metric expansion of space|expanded]]. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination epoch]]. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space.&lt;ref name="SciAm301_1_36"/&gt; Matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create [[star]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and other [[astronomical object]]s, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space.{{sfn|Silk|2000|pp=105–308}} As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe.&lt;ref name="SciAm301_1_36"/&gt; This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.

The present day [[shape of the universe]] has been determined from measurements of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background]] using satellites like the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]]. These observations indicate that the [[spatial geometry]] of the observable universe is "[[Flatness (cosmology)|flat]]", meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe, except for local gravity.&lt;ref name="WMAP"/&gt; The flat Universe, combined with the measured mass density of the Universe and the accelerating [[Hubble's law|expansion of the Universe]], indicates that space has a non-zero [[vacuum energy]], which is called [[dark energy]].{{sfn|Sparke|Gallagher|2007|pp=329–330}}

Estimates put the average energy density of the present day Universe at the equivalent of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, [[dark matter]], and [[baryonic matter]] (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters.&lt;ref name=nasa_wmap/&gt; The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and [[black hole]]s—to conditions in vast [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] that have much lower density, at least in terms of visible matter.&lt;ref name=aj89_1461/&gt; Unlike matter and dark matter, dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.&lt;ref name=rvmphys_75_559 /&gt;

Outer space is the closest known approximation to a [[perfect vacuum]]. It has effectively no [[friction]], allowing stars, [[planets]], and [[moons]] to move freely along their ideal [[orbit]]s, following the [[Planetary formation|initial formation]] stage. However, even the deep vacuum of [[Outer space#Intergalactic|intergalactic space]] is not devoid of [[matter]], as it contains a few [[hydrogen atoms]] per cubic meter.&lt;ref name=pasj20_230/&gt; By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per cubic meter.{{sfn|Borowitz|Beiser|1971}}&lt;ref name=patrick/&gt; The low density of matter in outer space means that [[electromagnetic radiation]] can travel great distances without being scattered: the [[mean free path]] of a [[photon]] in intergalactic space is about 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km, or 10 billion light years.{{sfn|Davies|1977|p=93}} In spite of this, [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], which is the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[scattering]] of photons by dust and gas, is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic [[astronomy]].&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick2004/&gt;

Stars, planets, and moons retain their [[atmosphere]]s by gravitational attraction. Atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary: the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space.{{sfn|Chamberlain|1978|p=2}} The Earth's atmospheric [[pressure]] drops to about {{nowrap|0.032 }}[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] at {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off}} of altitude,&lt;ref name=squire2000/&gt; compared to 100,000 Pa for the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) definition of [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard pressure]]. Above this altitude, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to [[radiation pressure]] from the [[Sun]] and the [[dynamic pressure]] of the [[solar wind]]. The [[thermosphere]] in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to [[space weather]].&lt;ref name=jmsj_85B_193/&gt;

The temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic]] activity of the gas, as it is on Earth. However, the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas, meaning that the gas and radiation are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].{{sfn|Prialnik|2000|pp=195–196}}{{sfn|Spitzer|1978|p=28–30}} All of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the [[Big Bang]], which is known as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). (There is quite likely a correspondingly large number of [[neutrino]]s called the [[cosmic neutrino background]].&lt;ref name="fp2_30"/&gt;) The current [[black body]] temperature of the background radiation is about {{convert|3|K|C F|0|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=apj707_2_916/&gt; The gas temperatures in outer space are always at least the temperature of the CMB but can be much higher. For example, the [[corona]] of the Sun reaches temperatures over 1.2–2.6&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=apj325_442/&gt;

Magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale [[dynamo]]s, creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10&amp;nbsp;μ[[Gauss (unit)|G]]. The [[Davis–Greenstein effect]] causes elongated [[Cosmic dust|dust grains]] to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]. This has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. [[Magnetohydrodynamics|Magneto-hydrodynamic]] processes in [[Active galactic nucleus|active]] [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] produce their characteristic [[Astrophysical jet|jets]] and [[radio lobe]]s. Non-thermal [[Astronomical radio source|radio sources]] have been detected even among the most distant, [[redshift|high-z]] sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.&lt;ref name=WielebinskiBeck2010/&gt;

Outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field, there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic [[subatomic particle]]s known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]] up to an extreme 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV of [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name=rmp83_3_907/&gt; The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of [[electron]]s is only about 1% of that of protons.{{sfn|Lang|1999|p=462}} Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a [[Health threat from cosmic rays|health threat]] to space travelers.{{sfn|Lide|1993|p=11{{hyphen}}217&lt;!-- Note: this is not a page range --&gt;}} According to astronauts, like [[Don Pettit]], space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an [[arc welding]] torch.&lt;ref name=ls2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="PopSicSmell"/&gt;

Despite the harsh environment, several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA [[BIOPAN]] facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology_11_4_281"/&gt; Seeds of ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'' germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology_12_5_517"/&gt; A strain of ''[[bacillus subtilis]]'' has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology_12_5_498"/&gt; The [[Panspermia|lithopanspermia]] hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world.

Even at relatively low altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere, conditions are hostile to the human body. The altitude where atmospheric pressure matches the [[vapor pressure of water]] at the [[Human body temperature|temperature of the human body]] is called the [[Armstrong line]], named after American physician [[Harry G. Armstrong]]. It is located at an altitude of around {{convert|19.14|km|mi|abbr=on}}. At or above the Armstrong line, fluids in the throat and lungs boil away. More specifically, exposed bodily liquids such as saliva, tears, and liquids in the lungs boil away. Hence, at this altitude, human survival requires a pressure suit, or a pressurized capsule.{{sfn|Piantadosi|2003|pp=188–189}}

Once in space, sudden exposure of unprotected humans to very low [[Atmospheric pressure|pressure]], such as during a rapid decompression, can cause [[pulmonary barotrauma]]—a rupture of the lungs, due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest.&lt;ref name=ajeas2_4_573/&gt; Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture.&lt;ref name=krebs_pilmanis1996/&gt; Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=ajeas2_4_573/&gt;

As a consequence of rapid decompression, [[oxygen]] dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the [[partial pressure]] gradient. Once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain, humans lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes.&lt;ref name=bmj286/&gt; Blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3&amp;nbsp;kPa, and this condition is called [[ebullism]].&lt;ref name=jramc157_1_85/&gt; The steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels, so some blood remains liquid.{{sfn|Billings|1973|pp=1–34}}&lt;ref name=landis20070807/&gt; Swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a [[pressure suit]]. The Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS), a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts, prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa.&lt;ref name=am39_376/&gt; Supplemental oxygen is needed at {{Convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss, while above {{Convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism.{{sfn|Ellery|2000|p=68}} Most space suits use around 30–39&amp;nbsp;kPa of pure oxygen, about the same as on the Earth's surface. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause [[decompression sickness]] and [[air embolism|gas embolisms]] if not managed.{{sfn|Davis|Johnson|Stepanek|2008|pp=270–271}}

[[Human evolution|Humans evolved]] for life in Earth [[Gravitation|gravity]], and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience [[space motion sickness]]. This can cause [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], headaches, [[lethargy]], and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in [[muscle atrophy]] and deterioration of the [[Human skeleton|skeleton]], or [[spaceflight osteopenia]]. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise.&lt;ref name=spp22_15/&gt; Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the [[cardiovascular system]], decreased production of [[red blood cell]]s, balance disorders, and a weakening of the [[immune system]]. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.&lt;ref name=cmaj180_13_1317/&gt;

For long-duration space travel, radiation can pose an [[acute health hazard]].
Exposure to high-energy, ionizing [[cosmic rays]] can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the [[white blood cell]] count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of [[cancer]], plus damage to the [[Human eye|eyes]], [[nervous system]], [[Human lung|lungs]] and the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]].&lt;ref name=nsbri_radiation/&gt; On a round-trip [[Mars]] mission lasting three years, a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut's body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei.&lt;ref name=curtis_and_Letaw/&gt; The energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research is needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.&lt;ref name=sas4_11_1013/&gt;

There is no clear boundary between [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the density of the atmosphere gradually decreases as the altitude increases. There are several standard boundary designations, namely:
* The [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] has established the [[Kármán line]] at an altitude of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics. This is used because at an altitude of about {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, as [[Theodore von Kármán]] calculated, a vehicle would have to travel faster than [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]] to derive sufficient [[aerodynamic lift]] from the atmosphere to support itself.{{sfn|O'Leary|2009|p=84}}&lt;ref name=space_begin/&gt;
* The United States designates people who travel above an altitude of {{convert|50|mi|km}} as [[astronaut]]s.{{sfn|Wong|Fergusson|2010|p=16}}
* [[NASA]]'s Space Shuttle used 400,000 feet (76&amp;nbsp;mi, 122&amp;nbsp;km) as its [[atmospheric reentry|re-entry]] altitude (termed the Entry Interface), which roughly marks the boundary where [[atmospheric drag]] becomes noticeable, thus beginning the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with aerodynamic control surfaces.&lt;ref name=petty20030213/&gt;

In 2009, scientists reported detailed measurements with a Supra-Thermal Ion Imager (an instrument that measures the direction and speed of ions), which allowed them to establish a boundary at {{Convert|118|km|mi|abbr=on}} above Earth. The boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the Earth's atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space, which can reach speeds well over {{Convert|268|m/s|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=thompton20090409/&gt;&lt;ref name=jgr114/&gt;

The [[Outer Space Treaty]] provides the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states, and includes in its definition of ''outer space'' the Moon and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national [[sovereignty]]. It also prohibits the deployment of [[nuclear weapon]]s in outer space. The treaty was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of 2017, 105 state parties have either ratified or acceded to the treaty. An additional 25 states signed the treaty, without ratifying it.&lt;ref name="unoosa2" /&gt;.&lt;ref name=unoosa/&gt;

Since 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple United Nations resolutions. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space.&lt;ref name=garros/&gt; Four additional [[space law]] treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]]. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China.{{sfn|Wong|Fergusson|2010|p=4}} The 1979 [[Moon Treaty]] turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.&lt;ref name=esf20071105/&gt;

In 1976, eight equatorial states ([[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Indonesia]]) met in [[Bogotá]], Colombia. With their "Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries", or "the Bogotá Declaration", they claimed control of the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country.&lt;ref name=bogota1976/&gt; These claims are not internationally accepted.&lt;ref name=aasl31_2006/&gt;

== Earth orbit ==
A spacecraft enters orbit when its [[Centripetal force|centripetal]] [[acceleration]] due to [[Gravitation|gravity]] is less than or equal to the [[centrifugal force|centrifugal]] acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity. For a [[low Earth orbit]], this velocity is about {{Convert|7800|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on}};&lt;ref name=hill1999/&gt; by contrast, the fastest manned airplane speed ever achieved (excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft) was {{Convert|2200|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on}} in 1967 by the [[North American X-15]].&lt;ref name=shiner20071101/&gt;

To achieve an orbit, a [[spacecraft]] must travel faster than a [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]. The energy required to reach Earth orbital velocity at an altitude of {{Convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} is about 36&amp;nbsp;[[Megajoule|MJ]]/kg, which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude.&lt;ref name=dimotakis1999/&gt; Spacecraft with a [[Apsis|perigee]] below about {{Convert|2,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} are subject to drag from the Earth's atmosphere,{{sfn|Ghosh|2000|pp=47–48}} which decreases the orbital altitude. The rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite's cross-sectional area and mass, as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere. Below about {{Convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}}, decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days. Once a satellite descends to {{Convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}}, it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=slsa/&gt; The [[escape velocity]] required to pull free of Earth's gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about {{Convert|11200|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=williams2010/&gt;

== Regions ==
Space is a partial vacuum: its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and "winds" that dominate within them, and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond. Geospace extends from Earth's atmosphere to the outer reaches of Earth's magnetic field, whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space.{{sfn|Schrijver|Siscoe|2010|p=363}} Interplanetary space extends to the heliopause, whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref name=universetoday_interplanetaryspace /&gt; Interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy, where it fades into the intergalactic void.&lt;ref name=jpl_interstellarspace /&gt;

[[wikt:geospace|Geospace]] is the region of outer space near Earth, including the upper atmosphere and [[magnetosphere]].{{sfn|Schrijver|Siscoe|2010|p=363}} The [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s lie within the geospace. The outer boundary of geospace is the [[magnetopause]], which forms an interface between the Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind. The inner boundary is the [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref name=geospace/&gt; The variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the Sun and the solar wind; the subject of geospace is interlinked with [[heliophysics]] -- the study of the Sun and its impact on the planets of the Solar System.{{sfn|Fichtner|Liu|2011|pp=341–345}}

The day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure -- the subsolar distance from the center of the Earth is typically 10 Earth radii. On the night side, the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a [[magnetotail]] that sometimes extends out to more than 100–200 Earth radii.{{sfn|Koskinen|2010|pp=32, 42}}&lt;ref name=HonesJr1986/&gt; For roughly four days of each month, the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the Moon passes through the magnetotail.{{sfn|Mendillo|2000|p=275}}

Geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities, the motions of which are controlled by the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. [[Geomagnetic storm]]s can disturb two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, interfering with shortwave radio communication and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location and timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Space Weather &amp; Telecommunications |first=John M. |last=Goodman |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4465qvHUZusC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=effect+space+weather+shortwave+gps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis_6eZ88rXAhVCx1QKHcYaB4kQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create [[aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]] seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the [[geomagnetic pole]]s.&lt;ref name=oecd/&gt;

Although it meets the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on [[satellite]]s.&lt;ref name=slsa/&gt; This region contains material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters Earth's atmosphere periodically.&lt;ref name=portree_loftus1999/&gt;

====Cislunar space====
[[File:Artist's concept of Cislunar Spacecraft Configuration.jpg|right|thumb|Proposed spacecraft for manned cislunar travel in the [[2020s in spaceflight|2020s]]]]

[[gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]] keeps the [[Moon]] in orbit at an [[lunar distance (astronomy)|average distance]] of {{cvt|384403|km|mi}}. The region outside [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and extending out to just beyond the [[orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]], including the [[Lagrangian point]]s, is sometimes referred to as '''cislunar space'''.&lt;ref name=sr2165/&gt;

The region of space where Earth's gravity remains dominant against gravitational [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] from the Sun is called the [[Hill sphere]].&lt;ref name=yoder1995/&gt; This extends well out into translunar space to a distance of roughly 1% of the mean distance from Earth to the Sun,{{sfn|Barbieri|2006|p=253}} or {{convert|1.5|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}}.

'''Deep space''' has different definitions as to where it starts. It has been defined by the United States government and others as any region beyond cislunar space.{{sfn|Dickson|2010|p=57}}{{sfn|United States|p=536}}{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=97}}&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; The [[ITU-R|International Telecommunication Union responsible for radio communication]] (including satellites) defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance ({{Val|2e6|u=km}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/art1.pdf |title=ITU-R Radio Regulations, Article 1, Terms and definitions, Section VIII, Technical terms relating to space, paragraph 1.177. |publisher=International Telecommunication Union |accessdate=2018-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interplanetary space ===
{{main|Interplanetary medium}}
[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp 1995O1.jpg|right|thumb|The sparse plasma (blue) and dust (white) in the tail of [[comet Hale–Bopp]] are being shaped by pressure from [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] and the solar wind, respectively|alt=At lower left, a white coma stands out against a black background. Nebulous material streams away to the top and left, slowly fading with distance.]]
Interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere (the [[heliosphere]]) for billions of kilometers into space. This wind has a particle density of 5–10 [[proton]]s/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is moving at a velocity of {{Convert|350|-|400|km/s|mph|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Papagiannis|1972|pp=12–149}} Interplanetary space extends out to the [[Astropause|heliopause]] where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the Sun.&lt;ref name=universetoday_interplanetaryspace /&gt; The distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind.&lt;ref name=phillips2009/&gt;

The volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum, with a mean free path of about one [[astronomical unit]] at the orbital distance of the Earth. However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various subatomic particles. There is also gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and dust, small [[meteor]]s, and several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=asp2003/&gt; A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the [[zodiacal light]].&lt;ref name="leinert_grun_1990"/&gt;

Interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the Sun.{{sfn|Papagiannis|1972|pp=12–149}} There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of charged particles such as the Van Allen radiation belts. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.&lt;ref name=ssr69_3_215/&gt;

=== Interstellar space ===
{{main|Interstellar medium}}
{{Redirect|Interstellar space|the album|Interstellar Space}}
[[File:52706main hstorion lg.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bow shock]] formed by the [[magnetosphere]] of the young star [[LL Orionis]] (center) as it collides with the [[Orion Nebula]] flow|alt=Patchy orange and blue nebulosity against a black background, with a curved orange arc wrapping around a star at the center.]]
Interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma.&lt;ref name=jpl_interstellarspace /&gt; The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by [[stellar wind]]s or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a [[planetary nebula]].&lt;ref name="Ferrière2001"/&gt; The cataclysmic explosion of a [[supernova]] generates an expanding [[shock wave]] consisting of ejected materials that further enrich the medium.&lt;ref name="witt2001"/&gt; The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; particles per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name=Boulares1990/&gt; but cold [[molecular clouds]] can hold 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn|Prialnik|2000|pp=195–196}}&lt;ref name="Ferrière2001"/&gt;

A [[List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|number of molecules]] exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1&amp;nbsp;[[Micrometre|μm]] dust particles.{{sfn|Rauchfuss|2008|pp=72–81}} The tally of molecules discovered through [[radio astronomy]] is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as [[molecular cloud]]s allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the [[trihydrogen cation]]. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant [[carbon monoxide]] to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.&lt;ref name="PNAS103_33_12232"/&gt;

The local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]]s (pc) of the Sun, which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the Solar System. This volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the [[Local Bubble]], which is characterized by a lack of dense, cold clouds. It forms a cavity in the [[Orion Arm]] of the Milky Way galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the [[constellation]]s of [[Ophiuchus]] and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. (The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250&amp;nbsp;pc or more.) This volume contains about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the [[Stellar-wind bubble|astrospheres]] that surround these stars, with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium. The Local Bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000&amp;nbsp;K and radii of 0.5–5&amp;nbsp;pc.&lt;ref name=redfield2006/&gt;

When stars are moving at sufficiently high [[peculiar velocities]], their astrospheres can generate [[bow shock]]s as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades it was assumed that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer|Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX)]] and NASA's [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a [[Mach number|subsonic]] bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium.&lt;ref name=bow_science/&gt;&lt;ref name=bow/&gt; A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the [[Heliosphere#Termination shock|termination shock]] and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).&lt;ref name=bow/&gt;

=== Intergalactic space ===
[[File:LH 95.jpg|thumb|right|[[LH 95|A]] [[star]]-forming region in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], perhaps the closest Galaxy to Earth's [[Milky Way]]]]
{{See also|Intracluster medium}}
Intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies. Studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies show that the Universe has a foam-like structure, with [[Galaxy groups and clusters|clusters and groups of galaxies]] lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space. The remainder forms huge voids that are mostly empty of galaxies. Typically, a [[Void (astronomy)|void]] spans a distance of (10–40) ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc, where ''h'' is the [[Hubble constant]] in units of {{nowrap|100 km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.{{sfn|Wszolek|2013|p=67}}

Surrounding and stretching between galaxies, there is a [[rarefaction|rarefied]] plasma&lt;ref name=jafelice_opher1992/&gt; that is organized in a [[galaxy filament|galactic filamentary]] structure.&lt;ref name=wadsley2002/&gt; This material is called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The density of the IGM is 5–200 times the average density of the Universe.&lt;ref name="apj_714_1715"/&gt; It consists mostly of ionized hydrogen; i.e. a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons. As gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids, it heats up to temperatures of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K,&lt;ref name=baas41_908/&gt; which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei; this is why the IGM is ionized. At these temperatures, it is called the [[warm–hot intergalactic medium]] (WHIM). (Although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards, 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; K is often called "warm" in astrophysics.) Computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the Universe might exist in this warm–hot, rarefied state.&lt;ref name="apj_714_1715" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ssr134_1_141/&gt;&lt;ref name="apjs_182_378"/&gt; When gas falls from the filamentary structures of the WHIM into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments, it can heat up even more, reaching temperatures of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K and above in the so-called intracluster medium.&lt;ref name="apj546_100"/&gt;

== Exploration and applications ==
{{Main|Space exploration|Space colonization|Space manufacturing}}
[[File:As08-16-2593.jpg|right|thumb|The first image taken of the entire Earth by astronauts was shot during the [[Apollo 8]] mission|alt=An blue-white disk against a black background. Brown areas of ground are visible in some areas through openings in the swirling white clouds. The lower left of the disk is in partial shadow.]]

For the majority of human history, space was explored by observations made from the Earth's surface—initially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope. Prior to the advent of reliable rocket technology, the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through the use of balloon flights. In 1935, the U.S. ''[[Explorer II]]'' manned balloon flight had reached an altitude of {{Convert|22|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ssr13_2_199/&gt; This was greatly exceeded in 1942 when the third launch of the German [[V-2 rocket|A-4 rocket]] climbed to an altitude of about {{Convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}}. In 1957, the unmanned satellite ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' was launched by a Russian [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7 rocket]], achieving Earth orbit at an altitude of {{Convert|215|-|939|km|mi}}.{{sfn|O'Leary|2009|pp=209–224}} This was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961, when [[Yuri Gagarin]] was sent into orbit on [[Vostok 1]]. The first humans to escape low-Earth orbit were [[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]] and [[William Anders]] in 1968 on board the U.S. [[Apollo 8]], which achieved lunar orbit{{sfn|Harrison|2002|pp=60–63}} and reached a maximum distance of {{Convert|377349|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Earth.{{sfn|Orloff|2001}}

The first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the Soviet [[Luna 1]], which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959.{{sfn|Hardesty|Eisman|Krushchev|2008|pp=89–90}} In 1961, [[Venera 1]] became the first planetary probe. It revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first fly-by of [[Venus]], although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the 1962 fly-by of Venus by [[Mariner 2]].{{sfn|Collins|2007|p=86}} The first fly-by of Mars was by [[Mariner 4]] in 1964. Since that time, unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many [[minor planet]]s and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as observation of the Earth.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=7, 68–69}} In August 2012, [[Voyager 1]] became the first man-made object to leave the Solar System and enter [[interstellar space]].&lt;ref name="mike_wall"/&gt;

The absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This is evidenced by the spectacular pictures sent back by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], allowing light from more than 13&amp;nbsp;billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed.&lt;ref name=hubblesite_cosmicdawn /&gt; However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The [[Interplanetary dust cloud|interplanetary zodiacal dust]] emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an [[infrared telescope]] out past the dust increases its effectiveness.&lt;ref name=esa105/&gt; Likewise, a site like the [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]] could shield a [[radio telescope]] from the [[Electromagnetic interference|radio frequency interference]] that hampers Earth-based observations.&lt;ref name=maccone2001/&gt;

Unmanned spacecraft in Earth orbit are an essential technology of modern civilization. They allow direct monitoring of [[Weather satellite|weather conditions]], relay [[Communications satellite|long-range communications]] like television, provide a means of [[Satellite navigation|precise navigation]], and allow [[remote sensing]] of the Earth. The latter role serves a wide variety of purposes, including tracking soil moisture for agriculture, prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs, detection of diseases in plants and trees, and [[Spy satellite|surveillance]] of military activities.{{sfn|Razani|2012|pp=97–99}}

The deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes, such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces.&lt;ref name=chapman1991/&gt; However, like [[asteroid mining]], [[space manufacturing]] requires significant investment with little prospect of immediate return.&lt;ref name="IJA10_307"/&gt; An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: ${{Inflation|US|6000|2006|r=-3|fmt=c}}–{{Inflation|US|20000|2006|r=-3|fmt=c}} per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate.&lt;ref name="jsr43_3_696"/&gt; Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include [[non-rocket spacelaunch]], [[momentum exchange tether]]s, and [[space elevators]].{{sfn|Bolonkin|2010|p=xv}}

[[Interstellar travel]] for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility. The distances to the nearest stars will require new technological developments and the ability to safely sustain crews for journeys lasting several decades. For example, the [[Daedalus Project]] study, which proposed a spacecraft powered by the [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of [[Deuterium]] and [[Helium-3|He&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], would require 36 years to reach the nearby [[Alpha Centauri]] system. Other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include [[light sail]]s, [[Bussard ramjet|ramjets]], and [[beam-powered propulsion]]. More advanced propulsion systems could use [[antimatter]] as a fuel, potentially reaching [[Relativistic speed|relativistic velocities]].&lt;ref name=Crawford1990/&gt;

In [[religion]] and [[esotericism]], the term "'''physical universe'''" or "'''material universe'''" is used to distinguish the [[nature|physical]] [[matter]] of the [[universe]] from a proposed [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[supernatural]] essence. 

In the [[Book of Veles]], and perhaps in traditional [[Slavic mythology]], the physical universe is referred to as [[Jav, Prav and Nav|Yav]]. [[Gnosticism]] holds that the physical universe was created by a [[Demiurge]]. In [[Dharmic religion]]s [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] is believed to be the illusion of a physical universe.

[[Physicalism]], a type of [[monism]], holds that only physical things exist. This is also known as [[metaphysical naturalism]].

The '''relational theory of space''' is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory according to which [[space]] is composed of relations between objects, with the implication that it cannot exist in the absence of matter. Its opposite is the [[container space|container]] theory. A [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[physics|physical]] theory implies a [[relation (philosophy)|relational metaphysics]], but not the other way round: even if space is composed of nothing but relations between [[observer (relativity)|observer]]s and [[event (relativity)|event]]s, it would be conceptually possible for all observers to agree on their measurements, whereas relativity implies they will disagree. [[Newtonian physics]] can be cast in [[Galilean invariance|relational terms]], but Newton insisted, for philosophical reasons, on [[Absolute time and space|absolute]] (container) space. The subject was famously debated by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and a supporter of Newton's in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]].

An absolute approach can also be applied to [[time]], with, for instance, the implication that there might have been vast epochs of time before the first [[event (philosophy)|event]].&lt;ref&gt;''Physics and Metaphysics: Theories of Space and Time'' by Jennifer Trusted, Routledge, 1991 {{ISBN|0-415-05948-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sociology of space''' is a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] that mostly borrows from theories developed within the discipline of [[geography]], including the sub fields of [[human geography]], [[economic geography]], and [[feminist geography]]. The "sociology" of space examines the social and material constitution of spaces. It is concerned with understanding the social practices, institutional forces, and material complexity of how humans and spaces interact. The sociology of space is an inter-disciplinary area of study, drawing on various theoretical traditions including [[Marxism]], [[postcolonialism]], and [[Science and Technology Studies]], and overlaps and encompasses theorists with various academic disciplines such as [[geography]] and [[architecture]].  Edward T. Hall developed the study of [[Proxemics]] which concentrates on the empirical analysis of space in psychology.  

== Definition of space ==
Space is one of the most important concepts within the disciplines of social science as it is fundamental to our understanding of geography. The term "space" has been defined variously by scholars:

In general terms, the Oxford English Dictionary defines space in two ways;

1. A continuous extension viewed with or without reference to the existence of objects within it.  
2. The interval between points or objects viewed as having one, two or three dimensions.

However, the human geographers’ interest is in the objects within the space and their relative position, which involves the description, explanation and prediction of the distribution of phenomena. Thus, the relationships between objects in space is the central of the study.

[[Michel Foucault]] defines space as;
“The space in which we live, which draws us out of ourselves, in which the erosion of our lives, our time and our history occurs, the space that claws and gnaws at us, is also, in itself, a heterogeneous space…..we live inside a set of relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kham|first=Miriam|title=Tahiti Intertwined: Ancestral Land, Tourist Postcard, and Nuclear Test Site|journal=American Anthropologist|date=March 2000|volume= 102| issue = 1|series=New Series|pages=7–26|jstor=683535|doi=10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Thrift]] also defines space as;
"The outcome of a series of highly problematic temporary settlements that divide and connect things up into different kinds of collectives which are slowly provided with the meaning which render them durable and sustainable." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, "space" is the social space in which we live and create relationships with other people, societies and surroundings. Space is an outcome of the hard and continuous work of building up and maintaining collectives by bringing different things into alignments. All kinds of different spaces can and therefore do exist which may or may not relate to each other. Thus, through space, we can understand more about social action.

== History of the sociology of space ==

[[Georg Simmel]] has been seen as the classical sociologist who was most important to this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last1 = Urry | first1 = John | contribution = The Sociology of Space and Place  | series = Blackwell companion to sociology | pages = 5 | year = 2004|isbn=1-4051-2267-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel wrote on "the sociology of space" in his 1908 book "Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation". His concerns included the process of metropolitanisation and the separation of leisure spaces in modern economic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Theory and Method |last=Jary| first=David |url =http://www.reading.ac.uk/RevSoc/archive/volume10/number1/10-1b.htm | year=1997 |accessdate =2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of [[space]] long played a subordinate role in sociological theory formation. Only in the late 1980s did it come to be realised that certain changes in society cannot be adequately explained without taking greater account of the spatial components of life. This shift in perspective is referred to as the [[topological turn]]. The space concept directs attention to organisational forms of juxtaposition. The focus is on differences between places and their mutual influence. This applies equally for the micro-spaces of everyday life and the macro-spaces at the nation-state or global levels.

The theoretical basis for the growing interest of the social sciences in space was set primarily by English and French-speaking sociologists, philosophers, and human geographers. Of particular importance is [[Michel Foucault| Michel Foucault’s]] essay on “Of Other Spaces”,&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1991, orig. 1967), »Andere Räume«, in: Wentz, Martin (Hg.), Stadt-Räume, Frankfurt a. M./New York, S. 65–72&lt;/ref&gt; in which the author proclaims the “age of space”, and [[Henri Lefebvre| Henri Lefebvre’s]] seminal work “La production de l’espace”.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri (1991, orig. 1974), The Production of Space, D. Nicholson-Smith trans., Oxford: Basil Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-14048-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter provided the grounding for Marxist spatial theory on which [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], [[Manuel Castells]], [[Edward Soja]], and others have built. Marxist theories of space, which are predicated on a structural, i.e., capitalist or global determinants of spaces and the growing homogenization of space, are confronted by action theoretical conceptions, which stress the importance of the corporeal placing and the perception of spaces as albeit habitually predetermined but subjective constructions. One example is the theory of space of the German sociologist [[Martina Löw]].&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2001), Raumsoziologie, Frankfurt a. M.&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches deriving from the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse have attracted greater attention in recent years. Also in contrast to (neo)Marxist concepts of space, British geographer [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]]&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999a), Power-Geometries and the Politics of Space-Time, Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999b), »Spaces of Politics«, in: Massey, Doreen/Allen, John/Sarre, Philip (Hg.), Human Geography Today, Cambridge/Oxford/Malden, S. 279–294&lt;/ref&gt; and German sociologist [[Helmuth Berking]],&lt;ref&gt;Berking, Helmuth (1998), »›Global Flows and Local Cultures‹. Über die Rekonfiguration sozialer Räume im Globalisierungsprozeß«, in: Berliner Journal für Soziologie, 8, 3, S. 381–392&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, emphasise the heterogeneity of local contexts and the place-relatedness of our knowledge about the world.

== Duality of space ==

[[Martina Löw]] developed the idea of a "relational" model of space, which focuses on the “orderings”&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2008), »The Constitution of Space: The Structuration of Spaces Through the Simultaneity of Effects and Perception«, in: European Journal of Social Theory, 1, 11&lt;/ref&gt; of living entities and social goods, and examines how space is constituted in processes of perception, recall, or ideation to manifest itself as societal structure. From a social theory point of view, it follows on from the theory of structuration proposed by [[Anthony Giddens]],&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1984), The Constitution of Society. Outline of the Theory of Structuration. Cambridge: Polity&lt;/ref&gt; whose concept of the “duality of structure” Löw extends sociological terms into a “duality of space.” The basic idea is that individuals act as social agents (and constitute spaces in the process), but that their action depends on economic, legal, social, cultural, and, finally, spatial structures. Spaces are hence the outcome of action. At the same time, spaces structure action, that is to say spaces can both constrain and enable action.

With respect to the constitution of space, Löw distinguishes analytically between two, generally mutually determining factors: “spacing” and “synthesis.” Spacing refers to the act of placing or the state of being placed of social goods and people in places. According to Löw, however, an ordering created through placings is only effectively constituted as space where the elements that compose it are actively interlinked by people – in processes of perception, ideation, or recall. Löw calls this synthesis. This concept has been empirically tested in studies such as those by [[Lars Meier]] (who examined the constitution of space in the everyday life of financial managers in London and Singapore), [[Cedric Janowicz]] (who carried out an ethnographical-space sociological study of food supply in the Ghanaian city of [[Accra]]), and [[Silke Streets]] (who looked at processes of space constitution in the creative industries in Leipzig).

== Marxist approaches ==

The most important proponent of Marxist spatial theory was [[Henri Lefebvre]]. He proposed "social space" to be where the [[relations of production]] are reproduced and that dialectical contradictions were spatial rather than temporal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lefebvre, Henri | title=The Survival of Capitalism: Reproduction of the Relations of Production | publisher=Allison &amp; Busby | year=1973 | isbn=0-85031-173-X}}, p17-19&lt;/ref&gt; Lefèbvre sees the societal production of space as a dialectical interaction between three factors. Space is constituted:

* by “spatial practice,” meaning space as reproduced in everyday life
* by the “representation of space”, meaning space as developed cognitively
* and by “spaces of representation,” by which Lefebvre means complex symbolisations and ideational spaces.

In Lefebvre’s view of the 1970s, this spatial production resulted in a space of non-reflexive everydayness marked by alienation, dominating through mathematical-abstract concepts of space, and reproduced in spatial practice. Lefebvre sees a line of flight from alienated spatiality in the spaces of representation – in notions of non-alienated, mythical, pre-modern, or artistic visions of space.

Marxist spatial theory was given decisive new impetus by [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], in particular, who was interested in the effects of the transition from [[Fordism]] to “flexible accumulation” on the experience of space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (1989), The Condition of Postmodernity, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; He shows how various innovations at the economic and technological levels have breached the crisis-prone inflexibility of the Fordist system, thus increasing the turnover rate of capital. This causes a general acceleration of economic cycles. According to Harvey, the result is “time-space compression.” While the feeling for the long term, for the future, for continuity is lost, the relationship between proximity and distance becomes more and more difficult to determine.

== Postcolonial theories of space ==

Theories of space that are inspired by the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse focus on the heterogeneity of spaces. According to [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]], calling a country in Africa a “developing country” is not appropriate, since this expression implies that spatial difference is temporal difference (Massey 1999b). This logic treats such a country not as different but merely as an early version of countries in the “developed” world, a view she condemns as "Eurocentrism." In this vein, [[Helmuth Berking]] criticises theories that postulate the increasing homogenisation of the world through globalisation as “globocentrism.” He confronts this with the distinctiveness and importance of local knowledge resources for the production of (different and specific) places. He claims that local contexts form a sort of framework or filter through which global processes and globally circulating images and symbols are appropriated, thus attaining meaning. For instance, the film character [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]] is a different figure in radical rightwing circles in Germany than in the black ghettoes of the Chicago Southside, just as [[McDonald’s]] means something different in Moscow than in Paris.

== Third Space ==
[[Henri Lefebvre]] (see also [[Edward Soja]]) says that (social) space is a (social) product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. He explains space embraces a multitude of intersection in his great book, “Production of Space”. That means that we need to consider how the various modes of spatial production relate to each other.

He argues that there are three aspects to our spatial existence, which exist in a kind of triad:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lefebvre|first=Henri|title=Marxist &amp; Social Constructivist Approaches to Place|url=http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~janzb/courses/hum3930b/lefebvre1.htm|publisher=Pegasus|accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. First Space
(Physical space/perceived space)
"The spatial practice of a society secretes that society's space; it propounds and presupposes it, in a dialectical interaction; it produces it slowly and surely as it masters and appropriates it."

2. Second Space
(Mental space/conceived space)
"Conceptualized space, the space of scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers, as of a certain type of artist with a scientific bent -- all of whom identify what is lived and what is perceived with what is conceived."

3. Third Space
(Social space/lived space)
"Space as directly lived through its associated images and symbols."

Even though there are many disciplines in the study of Human Geography, the most well-known approach is “The third space” formulated by [[Edward Soja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. Smith|first=Susan|title=Introducing Human Geographies|year=1999|publisher=Arnold|location=London|pages=12–22|chapter=Society-Space|editor=Paul Cloke |editor2=Philip Crang |editor3=Mark Goodwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In unitary theory, there are three approaches; first space, second space and third space. First space is physical space, and spaces are measurable and mappable. The second space is a mental or conceived space which comes from our thinking and ideas. However, the third space is a social space/lived space which is a social product that is a space created by society under oppression or marginalization that want to reclaim the space of inequality and make it into something else. Soja argues that our old ways to thinking about space (first and second space theories) can no longer accommodate the way the world works because he believed that spaces may not be contained within one social category, they may include different aspects of many categories or developed within the boundaries of a number of category. For instance, two different cultures combine together and emerge as a third culture. This third hybrid space displaces the original values that constitute it and set up new values and perspectives that is different from the first two spaces. Thus, the third space theory can explain some of the complexity of poverty, social exclusion and social inclusion, gender and race issues.

== Rational view of space ==
In the work of geographer and critical theorist [[Nigel Thrift]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote a rational view of space in which, rather than seeing space being viewed as a container within which the world proceeds, space should be seen as a co-product of these proceedings. He explained about four constructed space in modern human geography. 
There are four different kinds of space according to how modern geography thinks about space. They are 1. Empirical Construction of Space, 2. Unblocking space, 3. Image space and 4. Place Space.

'''First Space''' is the empirical construction of space. Empirical space refers to the process whereby the mundane fabric of daily life is constructed. These simple things like, cars, houses, mobiles, computers and roads are very simple but they are great achievements of our daily life and they play very important role in making up who we are today. For example, today’s technology such as GPS did not suddenly come into existence; in fact, it is laid down in the 18th century and developed throughout time. The first space is real and tangible, and it is also known as physical space.
'''Second space''' is the unblocking space. This type of space refers to the process whereby routine pathways of interaction as set up around which boundaries are often drawn. The routine may include the movement of office workers, the interaction of drunk teenagers, and the flow of goods, money, people, and information. Unlike the old time in geography when people accepted a space as blocked boundary (Example: A capitalist space, neoliberal space or city space), we began to realize that there is no such thing like boundaries in space. The space of the world is flowing and transforming continuously that it is very difficult to describe in a fixed way. The second space is ideology/conceptual and it is also known as mental space. For example, the second space will explain the behaviors of people from different social class and the social segregation among rich and poor people. 
'''Third space''' is the image space that refers to the process whereby the images has produced new kind of space. The images may be in different form and shape; ranging from painting to photograph, from portrait to post card, and from religious theme to entertainment. Nowadays, we are highly influenced by images in many ways and these certain images can tell us new social and cultures values, or something new about how we see the world. Images, symbols and sign do have some kind of spatial expression. 
'''Fourth space''' is the place that refers to the process whereby spaces are ordered in ways that open up affective and other embodied potentials. Place space has more meaning than a place, and it can represent as different type of space. This fourth type of space tries to understand that place is a vital actor in bringing up people's lives in certain ways and place will let us to understand all kind of things which are hidden form us..

==Scale: the local and the global==
Andrew Herod &lt;ref&gt;Harod, A. 2003. "Scale: the local and the global".  Key Concepts in Geography. London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that scale, within human geography, is typically seen in one of the two ways: either as a real material thing which actually exists and is the result of political struggle and/or social process, or as a way of framing our understanding of the world. People’s lives across the globe have been re-scaling by contemporary economic, political, cultural and social processes, such as [[globalization]], in complex ways. As a result, we have seen the creation of [[supra-national]] political bodies such as the [[European Union]], the devolution of political power from the nation-state to regional political bodies.&lt;ref&gt;PoliticalGeography. 1997. Special Issue on " The political geography of scale".Political Geography.&lt;/ref&gt; We have also experienced the increasing homogenization and ‘[[Americanization]]’ through the process of globalization while the locals’ tendencies (or counter force)among people who defend traditional ways of life increase around the world .The process of re-scaling people‘s lives and the relationship between the two extremes of our scaled lives- the ‘global’ and the ‘local’ were brought into question.

===Ontological status of the global and the local===
Until the 1980s, theorizing the concept of ‘scale’ itself was taken for granted although physical and human geographers looked at issues from ‘regional scale’ or‘national scale’. The questions such as whether scale is simply a mental device categorizing and ordering the world or whether scales really exists as material social products, particularly, were debated among [[materialists]] and [[idealists]]. Some geographers draw upon Immanuel Kant’s idealist philosophy that scales were handy conceptual mechanism for ordering the world while others, by drawing upon Marxist ideas of materialism, argue that scales really exist in the world and they were the real social products. For those idealists based on Kantian‘s inspiration, the ‘global’ is defined by the geologically given limits of the earth and the ‘local’ is defined as a spatial resolution useful for comprehending the process and practices. For materialists, the ‘national’ scale is a scale that had to be actively created through economic and political processes but not a scale existed in a logical hierarchy between global and the regional.

The notion of ‘becoming’ and the focus on the politics of producing scales have been central to materialist&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P.J. 1982. "A materialist framework for political geography", Transactions, Institute of British Geographers.&lt;/ref&gt; arguments concerning the global scale. It is important to recognize that social actors may have to work just as hard to become ‘local’as they have to work to become ‘global’. People paid attention to how transnational corporations have ‘gone global’, how institutions of governance have‘become’ supra-national and how labour unions have sought to ‘globalize’ their operations to match those of an increasingly ‘globalized’ city.

For the scale ‘global’ and ‘local’, Kevin Cox mentioned that moving from the local to the global scale ‘is not a movement from one discrete arena to another’ but a process of developing networks of associations that allow actors to shift between various spaces of engagement. According to his view, ‘scale’ is seen as a process rather than as a fixed entity and, in other words, the global and the local are not static ’arenas’within which social life plays out but are constantly made by social actions.For example, a political organization might attempt to go ‘global’ to engage with actors or opportunities outside of its own space; likewise, a transnational corporation may attempt to ‘go local’ through tailoring its products and operations in different places.

===Discourses of the global and the local===
[[J. K. Gibson-Graham|Gibson-Graham]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibson-Graham, J.K. 2002. "Beyond global vs. local: economic politics outside the binary frame" in: A. Herold and M.W. Wright(eds) . Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) has identified at least six ways in which the relationship between the local and the global is often viewed.

1. The global and the local are seen as interpretive frames for analyzing situations

2. Drawing on Dirlik, Gibson-Graham suggests that in such a representation, the global is ‘something more than the national or regional ..anything other than the local’. Meaning that, the global and the local each derive meaning from what they are not.

3. According to French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]], the local and the global ‘offer different points of view on networks that are by nature neither local nor global, but are more or less long and more or less connected. Also, in Latour’s view, it is impossible to distinguish where the local ends and the global begins.

4. The concept ‘The global is local’ was proposed by Gibson-Graham. For instance, multinational firms are actually ‘multi local‘ rather than ‘global’.

5. The local is global. In this view, the local is an entry point to the world of global flows which encircle the planet.

6. The global and the local are actually the processes rather than the locations. All spaces are the hybrids of global and local; so they are ‘glocal.’

There are some western thoughts that greater size and extensiveness imply domination and superior power, such that the local is often represented as ‘small and relatively powerless, defined and confined by the global’. So, the global is a force and the local is its field of play. However, the local can serve as a powerful scale of political organization; the global is not a scale just controlled by capital – those who challenge capital can also organize globally( Herod, A). There has been the concept ‘Think globally and act locally’ viewed by [[neoliberals]].

===Metaphors of scale===
For representing how the world is scaled, there are five different and popular metaphors: they are the ladder, concentric circles, Matryoshka nesting dolls, earthworm burrows and tree roots. First, in using such a metaphor of hierarchical ladder, the global as the highest rung on the ladder is seen to be above the local and all other scales. Second, the use of concentric metaphor leaves us with a particular way of conceptualizing the scalar relationship between places. In this second metaphor, the local is seen as a relatively small circle, with the regional as a larger circle encompassing it, while the national and the global scales are still larger circles encompassing the local and the regional. For the hierarchy of Russian Matryoshka nesting dolls, the global can contain other scales but this does not work the other way round; for instance, the local cannot contain the global. For the fourth metaphor concerning with thinking on scale, what French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]] argued is that a world of places is ‘networked’ together. Such the metaphor leaves us with an image of scale in which the global and the local are connected together and not totally separated from each other.  For the tree roots metaphor similar with the earthworm burrow metaphor, as the earthworm burrows or tree roots penetrating different strata of the soil, it is difficult to determine exactly where one scale ends and another begins. When thinking about the use of metaphor, it should be aware that the choice of metaphor over another is not made on the basis of which is empirically a ‘more accurate’representation of something but, on the basis of how someone is attempting to understand a particular phenomenon.

Such an appreciation of metaphors is important because it suggests that how we talk about scale impacts upon the ways in which we engage socially and politically with our scaled world and that may impact on how we conduct our social, economic and political praxis and so make landscapes ( Herod,A&lt;ref&gt;Herod, A., Wright, M.W (eds). 2002. Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; )

[[File:3D coordinate system.svg|thumb|right|A right-handed three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]] used to indicate positions in space.&lt;!--(See diagram description for needed correction.)--&gt;]]
'''Space''' is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which [[Physical body|objects]] and events have relative position and direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068962/space|title=Space – Physics and Metaphysics|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical space is often conceived in three [[linear]] [[dimension]]s, although modern [[physics|physicists]] usually consider it, with [[time]], to be part of a boundless four-dimensional [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] known as [[spacetime]]. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical [[universe]]. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a [[conceptual framework]].

Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' of [[Plato]], or [[Socrates]] in his reflections on what the Greeks called ''[[khôra]]'' (i.e. "space"), or in the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' of [[Aristotle]] (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of ''topos'' (i.e. place), or in the later "geometrical conception of place" as "space ''qua'' extension" in the ''Discourse on Place'' (''Qawl fi al-Makan'') of the 11th-century Arab polymath [[Alhazen]].&lt;ref&gt;Refer to Plato's ''Timaeus'' in the Loeb Classical Library, [[Harvard University]], and to his reflections on ''khora''. See also Aristotle's ''Physics'', Book IV, Chapter 5, on the definition of ''topos''. Concerning Ibn al-Haytham's 11th century conception of "geometrical place" as "spatial extension", which is akin to [[Descartes]]' and Leibniz's 17th century notions of ''extensio'' and ''analysis situs'', and his own mathematical refutation of Aristotle's definition of ''topos'' in natural philosophy, refer to: [[Nader El-Bizri]], "In Defence of the Sovereignty of Philosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place", ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'' ([[Cambridge University Press]]), Vol. 17 (2007), pp. 57–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the [[Renaissance]] and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly during the early development of [[classical mechanics]]. In [[Isaac Newton]]'s view, space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space.&lt;ref&gt;French, A. J.; Ebison, M. G. (1986). ''Introduction to Classical Mechanics''. Dordrecht: Springer, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[natural philosopher]]s, notably [[Gottfried Leibniz]], thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects, given by their [[distance]] and [[direction (geometry)|direction]] from one another. In the 18th century, the philosopher and theologian [[George Berkeley]] attempted to refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his ''Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision''. Later, the [[metaphysic]]ian [[Immanuel Kant]] said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of the outside world—they are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences. Kant referred to the experience of "space" in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' as being a subjective "pure ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' form of intuition".

In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], in which space is conceived as ''curved'', rather than ''flat''. According to [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], space around [[gravitational field]]s deviates from Euclidean space.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. (1995). ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. New York: Dove. (Original edition: ''Philosophical Foundations of Physics''. New York: Basic books, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental [[tests of general relativity]] have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.

== Philosophy of space ==

=== Galilei ===
[[Galileo Galilei|Galilean]] and [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] theories about space, matter and motion are at the foundation of the [[Scientific Revolution]], which is understood to have culminated with the publication of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' in 1687.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855123|title=Space from Zeno to Einstein : classic readings with a contemporary commentary|date=1999|publisher=MIT Press|others=Huggett, Nick.|isbn=058505570X|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=42855123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's theories about space and time helped him explain the movement of objects. While his theory of space is considered the most influential in Physics, it emerged from his predecessors' ideas about the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janiak|first=Andrew|year=2015|title=Space and Motion in Nature and Scripture: Galileo, Descartes, Newton|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science|volume=51|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the pioneers of [[modern science]], Galilei revised the established [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] ideas about a [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] cosmos. He backed the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] theory that the universe was [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]], with a stationary sun at the center and the planets—including the Earth—revolving around the sun. If the Earth moved, the Aristotelian belief that its natural tendency was to remain at rest was in question. Galilei wanted to prove instead that the sun moved around its axis, that motion was as natural to an object as the state of rest. In other words, for Galilei, celestial bodies, including the Earth, were naturally inclined to move in circles. This view displaced another Aristotelian idea—that all objects gravitated towards their designated natural place-of-belonging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47691120|title=Time and space|last=1958–|first=Dainton, Barry,|date=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=0773523022|location=Montreal|oclc=47691120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== René Descartes ===
[[René Descartes|Descartes]] set out to replace the Aristotelian worldview with a theory about space and motion as determined by [[natural law]]s. In other words, he sought a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] foundation or a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] explanation for his theories about matter and motion. [[Cartesian space]] was [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] in structure—infinite, uniform and flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time and Space|last=Dainton|first=Barry|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was defined as that which contained matter; conversely, matter by definition had a spatial extension so that there was no such thing as empty space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Cartesian notion of space is closely linked to his theories about the nature of the body, mind and matter.  He is famously known for his "cogito ergo sum" (I think therefore I am), or the idea that we can only be certain of the fact that we can doubt, and therefore think and therefore exist. His theories belong to the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] tradition, which attributes knowledge about the world to our ability to think rather than to our experiences, as the [[Empiricism|empiricists]] believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/428970574|title=Descartes : a very short introduction|last=Tom.|first=Sorell,|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191540363|location=Oxford|oclc=428970574}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posited a clear distinction between the body and mind, which is referred to as the [[Mind–body dualism|Cartesian dualism]].

=== Leibniz and Newton ===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|[[Gottfried Leibniz]]|upright|thumb]]
Following Galilei and Descartes, during the seventeenth century the [[philosophy of space and time]] revolved around the ideas of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], a German philosopher-mathematician, and [[Isaac Newton]], who set out two opposing theories of what space is. Rather than being an entity that independently exists over and above other matter, Leibniz held that space is no more than the collection of spatial relations between objects in the world: "space is that which results from places taken together".&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, Fifth letter to Samuel Clarke. By H. G. Alexander (1956). ''The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, pp. 55–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Unoccupied regions are those that ''could'' have objects in them, and thus spatial relations with other places. For Leibniz, then, space was an idealised [[abstraction]] from the relations between individual entities or their possible locations and therefore could not be [[continuous probability distribution|continuous]] but must be [[discrete probability distribution|discrete]].&lt;ref&gt;Vailati, E. (1997). ''Leibniz &amp; Clarke: A Study of Their Correspondence''. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
Space could be thought of in a similar way to the relations between family members. Although people in the family are related to one another, the relations do not exist independently of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. (1992). ''Philosophy of Physics''. Boulder: Westview Press, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
Leibniz argued that space could not exist independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for the location of the material world in each universe. But since there would be no observational way of telling these universes apart then, according to the [[identity of indiscernibles]], there would be no real difference between them. According to the [[principle of sufficient reason]], any theory of space that implied that there could be these two possible universes must therefore be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|[[Isaac Newton]]|upright|thumb]]
Newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on [[observation]] and experimentation. For a [[Relational theory|relationist]] there can be no real difference between [[inertial frame of reference|inertial motion]], in which the object travels with constant [[velocity]], and [[non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial motion]], in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions. But Newton argued that since non-inertial motion generates [[force]]s, it must be absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the example of [[Bucket argument|water in a spinning bucket]] to demonstrate his argument. Water in a [[bucket]] is hung from a rope and set to spin, starts with a flat surface. After a while, as the bucket continues to spin, the surface of the water becomes concave. If the bucket's spinning is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave as it continues to spin. The concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the bucket and the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Newton_bucket.html|title=Newton's bucket|work=st-and.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Newton argued, it must be a result of non-inertial motion relative to space itself. For several centuries the bucket argument was considered decisive in showing that space must exist independently of matter.

=== Kant ===
[[Image:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]
In the eighteenth century the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] developed a theory of [[knowledge]] in which knowledge about space can be both ''a priori'' and ''[[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, knowledge about space is ''synthetic'', in that statements about space are not simply true by virtue of the meaning of the words in the statement. In his work, Kant rejected the view that space must be either a substance or relation. Instead he came to the conclusion that space and time are not discovered by humans to be objective features of the world, but imposed by us as part of a framework for organizing experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=John Randolph |authorlink=John Lucas (philosopher) |title= Space, Time and Causality |page=149 |isbn=0-19-875057-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Euclidean geometry ===
{{main|Non-Euclidean geometry}}

[[Image:Sphere closed path.svg|thumb|150px|left|[[Spherical geometry]] is similar to [[elliptical geometry]]. On a [[sphere]] (the [[Surface (topology)|surface]] of a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]) there are no [[parallel line]]s.]]Euclid's ''Elements'' contained five postulates that form the basis for Euclidean geometry. One of these, the [[parallel postulate]], has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries. It states that on any [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] on which there is a straight line ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a point ''P'' not on ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', there is exactly one straight line ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' on the plane that passes through the point ''P'' and is parallel to the straight line ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. Until the 19th century, few doubted the truth of the postulate; instead debate centered over whether it was necessary as an axiom, or whether it was a theory that could be derived from the other axioms.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1830 though, the Hungarian [[János Bolyai]] and the Russian [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] separately published treatises on a type of geometry that does not include the parallel postulate, called [[hyperbolic geometry]]. In this geometry, an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of parallel lines pass through the point ''P''. Consequently, the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180° and the ratio of a [[circle]]'s [[circumference]] to its [[diameter]] is greater than [[pi]]. In the 1850s, [[Bernhard Riemann]] developed an equivalent theory of [[elliptical geometry]], in which no parallel lines pass through ''P''. In this geometry, triangles have more than 180° and circles have a ratio of circumference-to-diameter that is less than [[pi]].

=== Gauss and Poincaré ===
[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]]]
[[Image:Young Poincare.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Henri Poincaré]]]]

Although there was a prevailing Kantian consensus at the time, once non-Euclidean geometries had been formalised, some began to wonder whether or not physical space is curved. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], a German mathematician, was the first to consider an empirical investigation of the geometrical structure of space. He thought of making a test of the sum of the angles of an enormous stellar triangle, and there are reports that he actually carried out a test, on a small scale, by [[triangulation|triangulating]] mountain tops in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. pp. 134–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henri Poincaré]], a French mathematician and physicist of the late 19th century, introduced an important insight in which he attempted to demonstrate the futility of any attempt to discover which geometry applies to space by experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Jammer, Max (1954). ''Concepts of Space. The History of Theories of Space in Physics''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the predicament that would face scientists if they were confined to the surface of an imaginary large sphere with particular properties, known as a [[sphere-world]]. In this world, the temperature is taken to vary in such a way that all objects expand and contract in similar proportions in different places on the sphere. With a suitable falloff in temperature, if the scientists try to use measuring rods to determine the sum of the angles in a triangle, they can be deceived into thinking that they inhabit a plane, rather than a spherical surface.&lt;ref&gt;A medium with a variable index of refraction could also be used to bend the path of light and again deceive the scientists if they attempt to use light to map out their geometry.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the scientists cannot in principle determine whether they inhabit a plane or sphere and, Poincaré argued, the same is true for the debate over whether real space is Euclidean or not. For him, which geometry was used to describe space was a matter of [[Conventionalism|convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Euclidean geometry]] is simpler than non-Euclidean geometry, he assumed the former would always be used to describe the 'true' geometry of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Einstein ===
[[Image:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Albert Einstein]]]]
In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published his [[special theory of relativity]], which led to the concept that space and time can be viewed as a single construct known as ''[[spacetime]]''. In this theory, the [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is the same for all observers—which has [[relativity of simultaneity|the result]] that two events that appear simultaneous to one particular observer will not be simultaneous to another observer if the observers are moving with respect to one another. Moreover, an observer will measure a moving clock to [[time dilation|tick more slowly]] than one that is stationary with respect to them; and objects are measured [[length contraction|to be shortened]] in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.

Subsequently, Einstein worked on a [[general theory of relativity]], which is a theory of how [[gravity]] interacts with spacetime. Instead of viewing gravity as a [[Force field (physics)|force field]] acting in spacetime, Einstein suggested that it modifies the geometric structure of spacetime itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the general theory, time [[gravitational time dilation|goes more slowly]] at places with lower gravitational potentials and rays of light bend in the presence of a gravitational field. Scientists have studied the behaviour of [[binary pulsar]]s, confirming the predictions of Einstein's theories, and non-Euclidean geometry is usually used to describe spacetime.

== Mathematics ==
{{main|Three-dimensional space}}
{{distinguish|Space (mathematics)}}
In modern mathematics [[Mathematical space|spaces]] are defined as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] with some added structure. They are frequently described as different types of [[manifold]]s, which are spaces that locally approximate to Euclidean space, and where the properties are defined largely on local connectedness of points that lie on the manifold. There are however, many diverse mathematical objects that are called spaces. For example, [[vector space]]s such as [[function space]]s may have infinite numbers of independent dimensions and a notion of distance very different from Euclidean space, and [[topological space]]s replace the concept of distance with a more abstract idea of nearness.

== Physics ==
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}
Space is one of the few [[fundamental quantity|fundamental quantities]] in [[physics]], meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because nothing more fundamental is known at the present. On the other hand, it can be related to other fundamental quantities. Thus, similar to other fundamental quantities (like time and [[mass]]), space can be explored via [[measurement]] and experiment.

Today, our [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] space is viewed as embedded in a four-dimensional [[spacetime]], called [[Minkowski space]] (see [[special relativity]]).  The idea behind space-time is that time is [[hyperbolic-orthogonal]] to each of the three spatial dimensions.

=== Relativity ===
{{main|Theory of relativity}}
Before [[Einstein]]'s work on relativistic physics, time and space were viewed as independent dimensions. Einstein's discoveries showed that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one object–[[spacetime]]. It turns out that distances in [[Spacetime#Space-like interval|space]] or in [[Spacetime#Time-like interval|time]] separately are not invariant with respect to Lorentz coordinate transformations, but distances in Minkowski space-time along [[space-time interval]]s are—which justifies the name.

In addition, time and space dimensions should not be viewed as exactly equivalent in Minkowski space-time. One can freely move in space but not in time. Thus, time and space coordinates are treated differently both in [[special relativity]] (where time is sometimes considered an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] coordinate) and in [[general relativity]] (where different signs are assigned to time and space components of [[spacetime]] [[metric tensor|metric]]).

Furthermore, in [[Einstein's general theory of relativity]], it is postulated that space-time is geometrically distorted- ''curved'' -near to gravitationally significant masses.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, John A. ''A Journey into Gravity and Spacetime''. Chapters 8 and 9, [[Scientific American]], {{ISBN|0-7167-6034-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of this postulate, which follows from the equations of general relativity, is the prediction of moving ripples of space-time, called [[gravitational wave]]s. While indirect evidence for these waves has been found (in the motions of the [[Hulse–Taylor binary]] system, for example) experiments attempting to directly measure these waves are ongoing at the [[LIGO]] and [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] collaborations. LIGO scientists reported the [[first observation of gravitational waves|first such direct observation of gravitational waves]] on 14 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castelvecchi|first1=Davide|last2=Witze|first2=Alexandra|title=Einstein's gravitational waves found at last|url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=Nature News|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL"&gt;{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 |journal=[[Phys.

=== Cosmology ===
{{main|Shape of the universe}}
Relativity theory leads to the [[cosmology|cosmological]] question of what shape the universe is, and where space came from. It appears that space was created in the [[Big Bang]], 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = Cosmic Detectives
|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Cosmic_detectives
|publisher = The European Space Agency (ESA)
|date = 2 April 2013
|accessdate = 26 April 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and has been expanding ever since. The overall shape of space is not known, but space is known to be expanding very rapidly due to the [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]].

== Spatial measurement ==
{{main|Measurement}}
The measurement of ''physical space'' has long been important. Although earlier societies had developed measuring systems, the [[SI|International System of Units]], (SI), is now the most common system of units used in the measuring of space, and is almost universally used.

Currently, the standard space interval, called a standard meter or simply meter, is defined as the [[speed of light|distance traveled by light in a vacuum]] during a time interval of exactly 1/299,792,458 of a second. This definition coupled with present definition of the second is based on the [[special theory of relativity]] in which the [[speed of light]] plays the role of a fundamental constant of nature.

== Geographical space ==
{{See also|Spatial analysis}}

[[Geography]] is the branch of science concerned with identifying and describing places on [[Earth]], utilizing spatial awareness to try to understand why things exist in specific locations. [[Cartography]] is the mapping of spaces to allow better navigation, for visualization purposes and to act as a locational device. [[Geostatistics]] apply statistical concepts to collected spatial data of Earth to create an estimate for unobserved phenomena.

Geographical space is often considered as land, and can have a relation to [[ownership]] usage (in which space is seen as [[property]] or territory). While some cultures assert the rights of the individual in terms of ownership, other cultures will identify with a communal approach to land ownership, while still other cultures such as [[Australian Aboriginals]], rather than asserting ownership rights to land, invert the relationship and consider that they are in fact owned by the land. [[Spatial planning]] is a method of regulating the use of space at land-level, with decisions made at regional, national and international levels. Space can also impact on human and cultural behavior, being an important factor in architecture, where it will impact on the design of buildings and structures, and on farming.

Ownership of space is not restricted to land. Ownership of [[airspace]] and of [[International waters|waters]] is decided internationally. Other forms of ownership have been recently asserted to other spaces—for example to the radio bands of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] or to [[cyberspace]].

[[Public space]] is a term used to define areas of land as collectively owned by the community, and managed in their name by delegated bodies; such spaces are open to all, while [[private property]] is the land culturally owned by an individual or company, for their own use and pleasure.

[[Abstract space]] is a term used in [[geography]] to refer to a hypothetical space characterized by complete homogeneity. When modeling activity or behavior, it is a conceptual tool used to limit [[extraneous variables]] such as terrain.

== In psychology ==
Psychologists first began to study the way space is perceived in the middle of the 19th century. Those now concerned with such studies regard it as a distinct branch of [[psychology]]. Psychologists analyzing the perception of space are concerned with how recognition of an object's physical appearance or its interactions are perceived, see, for example, [[visual space]].

Other, more specialized topics studied include [[amodal perception]] and [[object permanence]]. The [[perception]] of surroundings is important due to its necessary relevance to survival, especially with regards to [[hunting]] and [[self preservation]] as well as simply one's idea of [[personal space]].

Several space-related [[phobia]]s have been identified, including [[agoraphobia]] (the fear of open spaces), [[wikt:astrophobia|astrophobia]] (the fear of celestial space) and [[claustrophobia]] (the fear of enclosed spaces).

The understanding of three-dimensional space in humans is thought to be learned during infancy using [[visual perception#Unconscious inference|unconscious inference]], and is closely related to [[hand-eye coordination]]. The visual ability to perceive the world in three dimensions is called [[depth perception]].

== In the Social Sciences ==
Space has been studied in the social sciences from the perspectives of [[Marxism]], [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[urban theory]] and [[critical geography]]. These theories account for the effect of the history of colonialism, transatlantic slavery and globalization on our understanding and experience of space and place. The topic has garnered attention since the 1980s, after the publication of [[Henri Lefebvre]]'s ''The Production of Space .'' In this book, Lefebvre applies Marxist ideas about the production of commodities and accumulation of capital to discuss space as a social product. His focus is on the multiple and overlapping social processes that produce space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henri Lefebvre on Space : Architecture, Urban Research, and the Production of Theory.|last=Stanek|first=Lukasz|publisher=Univ of Minnesota Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Condition of Postmodernity,'' [[David Harvey]] describes what he terms the "[[time-space compression]]." This is the effect of technological advances and capitalism on our perception of time, space and distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199874002/obo-9780199874002-0025.xml|title=Time-Space Compression – Geography – Oxford Bibliographies – obo|access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the modes of production and consumption of capital affect and are affected by developments in transportation and technology. These advances create relationships across time and space, new markets and groups of wealthy elites in urban centers, all of which annihilate distances and affect our perception of linearity and distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spaces of Capital : Towards a Critical Geography|last=Harvey|first=David|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=244–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Thirdspace,'' [[Edward Soja]] describes space and spatiality as an integral and neglected aspect of what he calls the "[[trialectics of being]]," the three modes that determine how we inhabit, experience and understand the world. He argues that critical theories in the Humanities and Social Sciences study the historical and social dimensions of our lived experience, neglecting the spatial dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33863376|title=Thirdspace : journeys to Los Angeles and other real-and-imagined places|last=W.|first=Soja, Edward|date=1996|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1557866740|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=33863376}}&lt;/ref&gt; He builds on Henri Lefebvre's work to address the dualistic way in which humans understand space—as either material/physical or as represented/imagined. Lefebvre's "lived space"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22624721|title=The production of space|last=1901–1991.|first=Lefebvre, Henri,|date=1991|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631140484|location=Oxford, OX, UK|oclc=22624721}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soja's "thridspace" are terms that account for the complex ways in which humans understand and navigate place, which "firstspace" and "Secondspace" (Soja's terms for material and imagined spaces respectively) do not fully encompass.

[[Postcolonialism|Postcolonial]] theorist [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]]'s concept of [[Third Space Theory|Third Space]] is different from Soja's Thirdspace, even though both terms offer a way to think outside the terms of a [[Binary opposition|binary]] logic. Bhabha's Third Space is the space in which hybrid cultural forms and identities exist. In his theories, the term [[Hybridity|hybrid]] describes new cultural forms that emerge through the interaction between colonizer and colonized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/824119565|title=Postcolonial studies : the key concepts|last=1946–|first=Ashcroft, Bill,|others=Griffiths, Gareth, 1943–, Tiffin, Helen., Ashcroft, Bill, 1946–|isbn=9780415661904|edition= Third|location=London|oclc=824119565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1050">The '''streaming vibration current''' ('''SVI''') and the associated '''streaming vibration potential''' is an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a porous body in which the pores are filled with fluid.

Streaming vibration current was experimentally observed in 1948 by M. Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. "An Electrokinetic Transducer" The review of scientific instruments, 19, 10, 640–646, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical model was developed some 30 years later by Dukhin and coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S., Mischuk, N.A., Kuz’menko, B.B and Il’in, B.I. "Flow current and potential in a high-frequency acoustic field" Colloid J., 45, 5, 875–881,1983&lt;/ref&gt; This effect opens another possibility for characterizing the electric properties of the surfaces in porous bodies.

A '''wormhole''' (or '''Einstein–Rosen bridge''') is a speculative structure linking separate points in [[spacetime]], and is based on a [[Solutions of the Einstein field equations|solution of the Einstein field equations]]. A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel with two ends, each at separate points in spacetime (i.e., different locations or different points of time). More precisely it is a transcendental bijection of the spacetime continuum, an asymptotic projection of the [[Calabi–Yau]] manifold manifesting itself in [[Anti-de Sitter space]]. 

Wormholes are consistent with the [[general theory of relativity]], but whether wormholes actually exist remains to be seen.

A wormhole could connect extremely long distances such as a billion [[light year]]s or more, short distances such as a few [[meter]]s, different [[multiverse|universes]], or different points in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1998-08-03|title=Focus: Wormhole Construction: Proceed with Caution|url=https://physics.aps.org/story/v2/st7|journal=Physics|language=en-US|volume=2|pages=|via=American Physical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visualization ==
[[File:Wormhole-demo.png|thumb|Wormhole visualized]]
For a simplified notion of a wormhole, [[space]] can be visualized as a two-dimensional (2D) surface. In this case, a wormhole would appear as a hole in that surface, lead into a [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|3D]] tube (the inside surface of a [[cylinder]]), then re-emerge at another location on the 2D surface with a hole similar to the entrance. An actual wormhole would be analogous to this, but with the spatial dimensions raised by one. For example, instead of circular holes on a [[2D plane]], the entry and exit points could be visualized as spheres in [[3D space]].

Another way to imagine wormholes is to take a sheet of paper and draw two somewhat distant points on one side of the paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the [[Spacetime|spacetime continuum]], and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this way it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.


== Terminology ==
In 1928, [[Hermann Weyl]] proposed a wormhole hypothesis of matter in connection with mass analysis of [[electromagnetic field]] energy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weyl | first1 = H. | title = Feld und Materie | doi = 10.1002/andp.19213701405 | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 65 | issue = 14| year = 1921 | pages=541–563| bibcode = 1921AnP...370..541W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, Erhard  (ed.), ''Hermann Weyl's Raum - Zeit - Materie and a General Introduction to His Scientific Work'', 2001, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; however, he did not use the term "wormhole" (he spoke of "one-dimensional tubes" instead).&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/ "Hermann Weyl"]: entry in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[theoretical physicist]] [[John Archibald Wheeler]] (inspired by Weyl's work)&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; coined the term "wormhole" in a 1957 paper co-authored by [[Charles Misner]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Misner | first1 = C. W. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = J. A. | title = Classical physics as geometry | doi = 10.1016/0003-4916(57)90049-0 | journal = Ann.

{{quote|This analysis forces one to consider situations... where there is a net flux of lines of force, through what [[topologist]]s would call "a [[Handle decomposition|handle]]" of the multiply-connected space, and what physicists might perhaps be excused for more vividly terming a "wormhole".|Charles Misner and John Wheeler in ''[[Annals of Physics]]''}}

=== Modern definitions ===
Wormholes have been defined both [[Geometry and topology|''geometrically'' and ''topologically'']].{{elucidate|are these definitions equivalent?|date=March 2017}} From a topological point of view, an intra-universe wormhole (a wormhole between two points in the same universe) is a [[Compact space|compact]] region of spacetime whose boundary is topologically trivial, but whose interior is not [[simply connected]]. Formalizing this idea leads to definitions such as the following, taken from [[Matt Visser]]'s ''Lorentzian Wormholes'' (1996).&lt;ref name="Visser1996" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

{{quote|If a [[Minkowski space]]time contains a compact region Ω, and if the topology of Ω is of the form Ω ~ R × Σ, where Σ is a three-manifold of the nontrivial topology, whose boundary has topology of the form ∂Σ ~ S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and if, furthermore, the [[hypersurface]]s Σ are all spacelike, then the region Ω contains a quasipermanent intrauniverse wormhole.}}

Geometrically, wormholes can be described as regions of spacetime that constrain the incremental deformation of closed surfaces. For example, in Enrico Rodrigo's ''The Physics of Stargates, ''a wormhole is defined informally as: {{quote|a region of spacetime containing a "[[world tube]]" (the time evolution of a closed surface) that cannot be continuously deformed (shrunk) to a [[world line]] (the time evolution of a point).}}

The equations of the theory of [[general relativity]] have valid solutions that contain wormholes. The first type of wormhole solution discovered was the ''Schwarzschild wormhole''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;,&lt;ref name=Dobrev&gt;Vladimir Dobrev (ed.), ''Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics: Varna, Bulgaria, June 2015'', Springer, 2016, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; which would be present in the [[Schwarzschild metric]] describing an ''eternal black hole'', but it was found that it would collapse too quickly for anything to cross from one end to the other. Wormholes that could be crossed in both directions, known as [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]], would only be possible if [[exotic matter]] with negative [[energy density]] could be used to stabilize them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:FY221c15.png|thumb|An artist's impression of a wormhole from an observer's perspective, crossing the [[event horizon]] of a Schwarzschild wormhole that bridges two different universes. The observer originates from the right, and another universe becomes visible in the center of the wormhole's shadow once the horizon is crossed, the observer seeing light that has fallen into the [[black hole]] interior region from the other universe; however, this other universe is unreachable in the case of a Schwarzschild wormhole, as the bridge always collapses before the observer has time to cross it, and everything that has fallen through the event horizon of either universe is inevitably crushed in the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]].]]

Schwarzschild wormholes, also known as ''Einstein–Rosen bridges''&lt;ref name=Dobrev/&gt; (named after [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Nathan Rosen]]),&lt;ref name=ER/&gt; are connections between areas of space that can be modeled as [[vacuum solution]]s to the [[Einstein field equations]], and that are now understood to be intrinsic parts of the [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates#The maximally extended Schwarzschild solution|maximally extended]] version of the [[Schwarzschild metric]] describing an eternal black hole with no charge and no rotation. Here, "maximally extended" refers to the idea that the [[spacetime]] should not have any "edges": it should be possible to continue this path arbitrarily far into the particle's future or past for any possible trajectory of a free-falling particle (following a [[geodesic]] in the spacetime).

In order to satisfy this requirement, it turns out that in addition to the black hole interior region that particles enter when they fall through the [[event horizon]] from the outside, there must be a separate [[white hole]] interior region that allows us to extrapolate the trajectories of particles that an outside observer sees rising up ''away'' from the event horizon. And just as there are two separate interior regions of the maximally extended spacetime, there are also two separate exterior regions, sometimes called two different "universes", with the second universe allowing us to extrapolate some possible particle trajectories in the two interior regions. This means that the interior black hole region can contain a mix of particles that fell in from either universe (and thus an observer who fell in from one universe might be able to see light that fell in from the other one), and likewise particles from the interior white hole region can escape into either universe. All four regions can be seen in a spacetime diagram that uses [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates]].

In this spacetime, it is possible to come up with [[coordinate system]]s such that if a [[hypersurface]] of constant time (a set of points that all have the same time coordinate, such that every point on the surface has a [[space-like]] separation, giving what is called a 'space-like surface') is picked and an "embedding diagram" drawn depicting the curvature of space at that time, the embedding diagram will look like a tube connecting the two exterior regions, known as an "Einstein&amp;ndash;Rosen bridge". Note that the Schwarzschild metric describes an idealized black hole that exists eternally from the perspective of external observers; a more realistic black hole that forms at some particular time from a collapsing star would require a different metric. When the infalling stellar matter is added to a diagram of a black hole's history, it removes the part of the diagram corresponding to the white hole interior region, along with the part of the diagram corresponding to the other universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/collapse.html#kruskal |title=Collapse to a Black Hole |publisher=Casa.colorado.edu |date=2010-10-03 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Einstein&amp;ndash;Rosen bridge was discovered by [[Ludwig Flamm]] in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flamm|title=Beiträge zur Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie|date=1916|journal=[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]|volume=XVII|page=448}} ("Comments on Einstein's Theory of Gravity")&lt;/ref&gt; a few months after Schwarzschild published his solution, and was rediscovered by Albert Einstein and his colleague Nathan Rosen, who published their result in 1935.&lt;ref name=ER&gt;A. Einstein and N. Rosen, "The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity," ''Phys. Rev.'' '''48'''(73) (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="focus032505"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindley|first1=David|title=Focus: The Birth of Wormholes|url=http://physics.aps.org/story/v15/st11|website=Physics|publisher=American Physical Society|accessdate=20 February 2016|date=Mar 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1962, [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and [[Robert W. Fuller]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Fuller and J. A. Wheeler, "Causality and Multiply-Connected Space-Time," ''Phys. Rev.'' '''128'''(919) (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; showing that this type of wormhole is unstable if it connects two parts of the same universe, and that it will pinch off too quickly for light (or any particle moving slower than light) that falls in from one exterior region to make it to the other exterior region.

According to general relativity, the [[gravitational collapse]] of a sufficiently compact mass forms a singular Schwarzschild black hole. In the [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan]]–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity, however, it forms a regular Einstein–Rosen bridge. This theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the [[affine connection]] and regarding its antisymmetric part, the [[torsion tensor]], as a dynamical variable. Torsion naturally accounts for the quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum ([[spin (physics)|spin]]) of matter. The minimal coupling between torsion and [[Dirac spinor]]s generates a repulsive spin–spin interaction that is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction prevents the formation of a gravitational singularity.{{clarify|date=April 2015}} Instead, the collapsing matter reaches an enormous but finite density and rebounds, forming the other side of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poplawski, Nikodem J. |authorlink=Nikodem Popławski |year=2010 |title=Cosmology with torsion: An alternative to cosmic inflation |journal=Phys.

Although Schwarzschild wormholes are not traversable in both directions, their existence inspired [[Kip Thorne]] to imagine traversable wormholes created by holding the "throat" of a Schwarzschild wormhole open with [[exotic matter]] (material that has negative mass/energy).

Other non-traversable wormholes include ''Lorentzian wormholes'' (first proposed by John Archibald Wheeler in 1957), wormholes creating a [[spacetime foam]] in a general relativistic spacetime manifold depicted by a [[Lorentzian manifold]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.

Lorentzian traversable wormholes would allow travel in both directions from one part of the universe to another part of that same universe very quickly or would allow travel from one universe to another. {{anchor|Ellis-Bronnikov precedence}}&lt;!--'Ellis wormhole' redirects here--&gt;The possibility of traversable wormholes in general relativity was first demonstrated in a 1973 paper by Homer Ellis&lt;ref name="ellis1"&gt;

Ellis thoroughly analyzed the topology and the [[geodesic]]s of the [[Ellis drainhole]], showing it to be geodesically complete, horizonless, singularity-free, and fully traversable in both directions.  The drainhole is a solution manifold of Einstein's field equations for a vacuum space-time, modified by inclusion of a scalar field minimally coupled to the [[Ricci tensor]] with antiorthodox polarity (negative instead of positive).  (Ellis specifically rejected referring to the scalar field as 'exotic' because of the antiorthodox coupling, finding arguments for doing so unpersuasive.)  The solution depends on two parameters: &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, which fixes the strength of its gravitational field, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which determines the curvature of its spatial cross sections.  When &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is set equal to 0, the drainhole's gravitational field vanishes.  What is left is the [[Ellis wormhole]], a nongravitating, purely geometric, traversable wormhole.
[[Kip Thorne]] and his graduate student [[Mike Morris (physicist)|Mike Morris]], unaware of the 1973 papers by Ellis and Bronnikov,  manufactured, and in 1988 published, a duplicate of the Ellis wormhole for use as a tool for teaching general relativity. For this reason, the type of traversable wormhole they proposed, held open by a spherical shell of [[exotic matter]], was from 1988 to 2015 exclusively referred to in the literature as a ''Morris–Thorne wormhole''. Later, other types of traversable wormholes were discovered as allowable solutions to the equations of general relativity, including a variety analyzed in a 1989 paper by [[Matt Visser]], in which a path through the wormhole can be made where the traversing path does not pass through a region of exotic matter. However, in the pure [[Gauss–Bonnet gravity]] (a modification to general relativity involving extra spatial dimensions which is sometimes studied in the context of [[brane cosmology]]) exotic matter is not needed in order for wormholes to exist—they can exist even with no matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Elias Gravanis|author2=Steven Willison|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.75.084025|year=2007|title='Mass without mass' from thin shells in Gauss-Bonnet gravity|issue=8|pages=084025|volume=75|journal=Phys. Rev. D |arxiv=gr-qc/0701152|bibcode=2007PhRvD..75h4025G}}&lt;/ref&gt; A type held open by negative mass [[cosmic string]]s was put forth by Visser in collaboration with [[John G. Cramer|Cramer]] ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="naturalwormholes"/&gt; in which it was proposed that such wormholes could have been naturally created in the early universe.

Wormholes connect two points in spacetime, which means that they would in principle allow [[time travel|travel in time]], as well as in space. In 1988, Morris, Thorne and Yurtsever worked out explicitly how to convert a wormhole traversing space into one traversing time by accelerating one of its two mouths.&lt;ref name="time travel"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446|title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition|date=1988|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=Kip|last3=Yurtsever|first3=Ulvi|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=61|issue=13|pages=1446–1449|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/9262/1/MORprl88.pdf|pmid=10038800|bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to general relativity, it would not be possible to use a wormhole to travel back to a time earlier than when the wormhole was first converted into a time 'machine'. Until this time it could not have been noticed or have been used.&lt;ref name="Thorne1994" /&gt;{{Rp|504}}

== Raychaudhuri's theorem and exotic matter ==
To see why [[exotic matter]] is required, consider an incoming light front traveling along geodesics, which then crosses the wormhole and re-expands on the other side. The [[congruence (general relativity)|expansion]] goes from negative to positive. As the wormhole neck is of finite size, we would not expect caustics to develop, at least within the vicinity of the neck. According to the optical [[Raychaudhuri's theorem]], this requires a violation of the [[averaged null energy condition]]. Quantum effects such as the [[Casimir effect]] cannot violate the averaged null energy condition in any neighborhood of space with zero curvature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fewster|first=Christopher J.|author2=Ken D.

==Modified general relativity==
In some hypotheses where [[Alternatives to general relativity|general relativity is modified]], it is possible to have a wormhole that does not collapse without having to resort to exotic matter. For example, this is possible with R^2 gravity, a form of [[f(R) gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1506.00988|title=Exotica ex nihilo: Traversable wormholes &amp; non-singular black holes from the vacuum of quadratic gravity|journal=Physical Review D|volume=92|issue=4|pages=043516|last1=Duplessis|first1=Francis|last2= Easson|first2=Damien A.|year=2015|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.92.043516|bibcode=2015PhRvD..92d3516D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Faster-than-light travel ==

[[File:Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA.jpg|alt=Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA Digital art by Les Bossinas (Cortez III Service Corp.), 1998|thumb|Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for [[NASA]]]]

The impossibility of faster-than-light relative speed only applies locally. Wormholes might allow effective superluminal ([[faster-than-light]]) travel by ensuring that the speed of light is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them ''outside'' the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to make the journey if it took a path through the space ''outside'' the wormhole. However, a light beam traveling through the same wormhole would of course beat the traveler.

== Time travel ==
{{main|Time travel}}

If [[#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]] exist, they could allow [[time travel]].&lt;ref name="time travel"/&gt; A proposed time-travel machine using a traversable wormhole would hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion system]], and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both of these methods, [[time dilation]] causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become "younger", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently ''through'' the wormhole than ''outside'' it, so that [[Synchronization|synchronized]] clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.&lt;ref name="Thorne1994"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thorne | first = Kip S. | authorlink = Kip Thorne | title = Black Holes and Time Warps | publisher = W. W. Norton | year= 1994 | isbn = 978-0-393-31276-8| title-link = Black Holes and Time Warps }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|502}} This means that an observer entering the "younger" end would exit the "older" end at a time when it was the same age as the "younger" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside. One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine;&lt;ref name="Thorne1994" /&gt;{{rp|503}} It is more of a path through time rather than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/0503097|title=Wormholes and Time Travel?

According to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as "[[exotic matter]]". More technically, the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various [[energy condition]]s, such as the null energy condition along with the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. However, it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition,&lt;ref name="Visser1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Visser | first = Matt | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = Lorentzian Wormholes | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year= 1996 | isbn = 978-1-56396-653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}} and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the [[Casimir effect]] in quantum physics.&lt;ref name="casimir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npl.washington.edu/av/altvw69.html |title=NASA Goes FTL Part 1: Wormhole Physics |website=Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact Magazine|year=1994|accessdate=December 2, 2006|last1=Cramer|first1=John G. |authorlink=John G.

In 1993, [[Matt Visser]] argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other,&lt;ref name="visser_1"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matt | last = Visser | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = From wormhole to time machine: Comments on Hawking's Chronology Protection Conjecture | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 47 | year = 1993 | issue = 2 | pages = 554–565 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.47.554| arxiv=hep-th/9202090|bibcode = 1993PhRvD..47..554V }}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise prevent information from passing through the wormhole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/0204022|title=The quantum physics of chronology protection|last1=Visser|first1=Matt|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the two mouths could not be brought close enough for [[causality (physics)|causality]] violation to take place. However, in a 1997 paper, Visser hypothesized that a complex "[[Roman ring]]" (named after Tom Roman) configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine, although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible.&lt;ref name="visser_2"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matt | last = Visser | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = Traversable wormholes: the Roman ring | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 55 | year = 1997 | issue = 8 | pages = 5212–5214 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5212| arxiv=gr-qc/9702043|bibcode = 1997PhRvD..55.5212V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interuniversal travel&lt;!--'Interuniversal travel', 'Inter-universal travel' and 'Everett phone' redirect here--&gt; ==
A possible resolution to the paradoxes resulting from wormhole-enabled time travel rests on the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]].

In 1991 [[David Deutsch]] showed that quantum theory is fully consistent (in the sense that the so-called [[density matrix]] can be made free of discontinuities) in spacetimes with closed timelike curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=David |title=Quantum Mechanics Near Closed Timelike Lines|date=1991|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=44|issue=10|page=3197|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197|bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later it was shown that such model of closed timelike curve can have internal inconsistencies as it will lead to strange phenomena like distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states and distinguishing proper and improper mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brun|display-authors=etal |title=Localized Closed Timelike Curves Can Perfectly Distinguish Quantum States|date=2009|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=102|issue=21|page=210402|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.210402|bibcode=2009PhRvL.102u0402B|pmid=19519086|arxiv=0811.1209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pati |author2=Chakrabarty|author3=Agrawal|title=Purification of mixed states with closed timelike curve is not possible|date=2011|journal=[[Physical Review A]]|volume=84|issue=6|page=062325|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevA.84.062325|bibcode = 2011PhRvA..84f2325P |arxiv = 1003.4221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the destructive positive feedback loop of virtual particles circulating through a wormhole time machine, a result indicated by semi-classical calculations, is averted. A particle returning from the future does not return to its universe of origination but to a parallel universe. This suggests that a wormhole time machine with an exceedingly short time jump is a theoretical bridge between contemporaneous parallel universes.&lt;ref name="Rodrigo2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodrigo|first=Enrico|title=The Physics of Stargates|publisher=Eridanus Press|date= 2010|page=281|isbn= 978-0-9841500-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because a wormhole time-machine introduces a type of nonlinearity into quantum theory, this sort of communication between parallel universes is consistent with [[Joseph Polchinski]]'s proposal of an '''Everett phone'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polchinski|first=Joseph |title=Weinberg's Nonlinear quantum Mechanics and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=66|issue=4|pages=397–400 |date=1991 |bibcode=1991PhRvL..66..397P|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.66.397 |pmid=10043797}}&lt;/ref&gt; (named after [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]]) in [[Steven Weinberg]]'s formulation of nonlinear quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Rodrigo, ''The Physics of Stargates: Parallel Universes, Time Travel, and the Enigma of Wormhole Physics'', Eridanus Press, 2010, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of communication between parallel universes has been dubbed '''interuniversal travel'''.&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Walker, [https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg23331111-100-14-interuniversal-travel-i-wouldnt-start-from-here/ "Inter-universal travel: I wouldn't start from here], ''[[New Scientist]]'' (1 February 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metrics ==
Theories of ''wormhole metrics'' describe the spacetime geometry of a wormhole and serve as theoretical models for time travel. An example of a (traversable) wormhole [[metric tensor|metric]] is the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raine |first1=Derek |last2=Thomas |first2=Edwin |date=2009 |title= Black Holes: An Introduction |publisher=Imperial College Press |page=143 |isbn=978-1-84816-383-6 | edition=2nd|doi=10.1142/p637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2= - c^2 dt^2 + dl^2 + (k^2 + l^2)(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2),&lt;/math&gt;

first presented by Ellis (see [[Ellis wormhole]]) as a special case of the [[Ellis drainhole]].

One type of non-traversable wormhole [[metric tensor|metric]] is the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild solution]] (see the first diagram):

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2= - c^2 \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}} + r^2(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2).&lt;/math&gt;

The original Einstein–Rosen bridge was described in an article published in July 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=A.|last2=Rosen|first2=N.|title=The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity|journal=Physical Review|date=1 July 1935|volume=48|issue=1|pages=73–77|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.73|bibcode = 1935PhRv...48...73E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBPpRqxY8Uw|title=Leonard Susskind {{!}} 'ER = EPR' or 'What's Behind the Horizons of Black Holes?'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Schwarzschild spherically symmetric static solution 
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{2m}{r}} dr^2 - r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + (1 - \frac{2m}{r})dt^2&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; = proper time, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; = 1)

If one replaces &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; according to
&lt;math&gt;u^2 = r - 2m&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -4(u^2 + 2m)du^2 - (u^2 + 2m)^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + \frac{u^2}{u^2 + 2m} dt^2&lt;/math&gt;

{{Quote|text=The four-dimensional space is described mathematically by two congruent parts or "sheets", corresponding to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0 and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; &lt; 0, which are joined by a hyperplane &lt;math&gt;r = 2m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; = 0 in which &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; vanishes. We call such a connection between the two sheets a "bridge".|author=A. Einstein, N. Rosen, "The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity"}}

For the combined field, gravity and electricity, Einstein and Rosen derived the following Schwarzschild static spherically symmetric solution
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{1} = \phi_{2} = \phi_{3} = 0, \phi_{4} = \frac{\epsilon}{4},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - \frac{1}{( 1 - \frac{2m}{r} - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2 r^2})} dr^2 - r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) +
(1 - \frac{2m}{r} - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2 r^2}) dt^2&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = electrical charge)

The field equations without denominators in the case when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = 0 can be written
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{\mu \nu} = \phi_{\mu,\nu} - \phi_{\nu,\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^2 \phi_{\mu\nu;\sigma}g^{\nu\sigma} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^2 (R_{ik} + \phi_{i\alpha}\phi_{k}^{\alpha} - \frac{1}{4} g_{ik} \phi_{\alpha\beta}\phi^{ab}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In order to eliminate singularities, if one replaces &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; according to the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;u^2 = r^2 - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = 0 one obtains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150903081506.htm|title=Magnetic wormhole connecting two regions of space created for the first time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uab.cat/web/newsroom/news-detail/magnetic-wormhole-created-for-first-time-1345668003610.html?noticiaid=1345689132054|title=Magnetic wormhole created for first time}}&lt;/ref&gt;
