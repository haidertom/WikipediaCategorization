      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5019">In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, '''abuse of rights''' (also known as Prohibition of Chicane) is the exercise of a [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]] only to cause annoyance, harm, or injury to another. The abuser is liable for the harm caused by their actions. Some examples of this are [[abuse of power]], [[barratry (common law)|barratry]], [[frivolous litigation|frivolous]] or [[vexatious litigation]], a [[spite fence]] or [[spite wall|wall]], [[forum shopping]], [[abuse of process]], [[malicious prosecution]], [[tax avoidance]] (vs. [[Tax avoidance#Anti-avoidance measures|anti-avoidance rules]], [[step transaction doctrine]], [[economic substance]]), etc. The principle is a creature of case law and was expanded from the neighborhood law doctrine of ''[[aemulatio vicini]]'' under the ''[[jus commune]]''. This principle departs from the classical theory that “he who uses a right injures no one” (= ''neminem laedit qui suo iure utitur''), instead embracing the maxim “a right ends where abuse begins” (= ''le droit cesse où l'abus commence'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Planiol]], ''Traité élémentaire de droit civil'', 11th edn., No. 871, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation ==
The [[:de:Rechtsmissbrauch|abuse of rights]] principle is laid out in German law by the so-called ''Schikaneverbot'' ‘ban on vexatiousness’ ([[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]] [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__226.html §226]). It reads as follows:
{{Verse translation|{{lang|de|Die Ausübung eines Rechts ist unzulässig, 
wenn sie nur den Zweck haben kann, einem anderen Schaden zuzufügen.}}
|
The exercise of a right is unlawful if its purpose 
is only to cause harm to another.}}

Article 2 of the ''Titre préliminaire'' to the [[Swiss Civil Code]] states: 
{{Verse translation|{{lang|fr|Chacun est tenu d'exercer ses droits et d'exécuter ses obligations selon les règles de la bonne foi. L'abus manifeste d'un droit n'est pas protégé par la loi.}}|Everyone is expected to exercise their rights and fulfill their [[Law of obligations|obligations]] according to the rules of [[Good faith (law)|good faith]]. The manifest abuse of a right is not protected by [[statute]].}}

Articles 19, 20 and 21 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]] state that:

* Art. 19. “Every person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due and observe honesty and good faith.”
* Art. 20. “Every person who, contrary to law, wilfully or negligently causes damage to another, shall indemnify the latter for the same.”
* Art. 21. “Any person who wilfully causes loss or injury to another in manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage.”

== Conditions ==
At least one of four conditions is required to invoke the doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abuse of Rights|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/a/abuse-of-rights/|work=uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*the predominant motive for exercising the right is to cause harm
*no serious or legitimate interest exists for judicial protection
*the exercise of the right is ''contra bonos mores'' or violates [[good faith]] or elementary fairness (equity)
*the right is exercised for a purpose other than its intended legal purpose.

The principle does not exist in [[Common law|common law jurisdictions]].

In [[Scots law]] (which is mixed civil/common law jurisdiction), abuse of rights is called ''aemulatio vicini'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strange Gods in the Twenty-First Century: the Doctrine of Aemulatio Vicini|author=Elspeth Reid|url=http://edinburgh.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.3366/edinburgh/9780748623358.001.0001/upso-9780748623358-chapter-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Albania]] the right to access to public information is guaranteed by the Constitution and by the Law on the Right to Information approved in 2014 and providing for a sound legal framework regulating access to public information.&lt;ref name=ECPMF&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ecpmf.eu/news/ecpmf/interviews-balkan/rudina-hoxha-editor-follow-business-albania |title="A problem is its efficient implementation"  |last= |first= |date=12 January 2017 |website=Ecpmf.eu |publisher=European Centre for Press and Media Freedom |access-date= 25 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite some significant progress toward securing the right to information over the last years, notable weakness remains in the functioning of the system and in the implementation of the law. Access is still a challenge in a country with a strong culture of secrecy and confidentiality.&lt;ref name=WB&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |title=Implementing Right to Information. A Case study of Albania |url=http://www.right2info.org/resources/publications/publications/wb_implementing-rti_albania_2012 |publisher= The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / the World Bank |access-date= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Albania provides both constitutional and legal guarantees of the right to information. Efforts to establish a constitutional and legal framework securing citizens' right to access public information date back to the early 1990s during Albania's transition from a Communist country to a multi-party democratic system.&lt;ref name=WB/&gt;

The Constitution, effective since 1998, enshrined this right in Article 23 and provides for the right of every person to access information held by state bodies and to attend public meetings.&lt;ref name=OSCE&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Banisar |date=April 2006 |title= Comments and Legal Regulations on Access to Information and State Secrets in Albania |url=https://www.osce.org/fom/18934?download=true  |publisher= OSCE. The Representative on Freedom of the Media |access-date= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the parliament passed the Law 8503, the ''Right to Information about Official Documents law'', becoming the first country in the region to adopt a legislation on freedom of information.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; Currently, access to information is regulated by the Law on the Right to Information approved in 2014, which is an upgrade of previous laws and regulations.&lt;ref name="BIRN"&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 2006 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf  
|publisher= Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) |access-date= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albania has also committed itself to realize the right to access public information through several  international agreements. In 2002, Albania ratified the Convention on access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters ([[Aarhus Convention]]) which requires the adoption of laws on access to environmental information. Moreover, as a member of the [[Council of Europe]], Albania has committed to comply with a 2002 recommendation on access to official document.&lt;ref name="OSCE" /&gt;

==Legal Framework==

The new Right to Information Law of Albania has been assessed by many experts as one of the most important steps towards transparency and accountability, bringing Albanian legislation closer with the best international standards.&lt;ref name=IDFI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://idfi.ge/en/new%E2%80%93freedom%E2%80%93of%E2%80%93ifnromation%E2%80%93legislation%E2%80%93albania  |title=New Right to Information Law in Albania |last= |first= |date= 7 November 2014 |website=Idfi.ge |publisher= Institute for Development of Freedom of Information (IDFI) |access-date=25 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/new-foia-law-could-usher-era-of-transparency-in-albania   |title=Albania Rights Groups Hail New New FOI Law |last= |first= |date= 1 October 2014 |website=BalkanInsight.com |publisher=BalkanInsight |access-date=25 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new law provided greater access for the public to official documents, and sets forth a system of penalties for public officials who refused to disclose information.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; The new legislation includes also an array of new concepts, such as the possibility of reclassifying secret documents, the release of partial information and the use of [[Information and communications technology|ICTs]] to make information held py public bodies available and accessible to the public.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; The law also establishes the obligation to appoint coordinators for access to information by every public authority charged with the task of supervising the authority’s responses to information requests and created the institution of a Commissioner for the Right to Information and Protection of Personal Data charged with supervising and monitoring compliance with the law and appeals bodies and procedures in cases of refusal or partial disclosure.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; Under the new law the Commissioner has the faculty to use disciplinary sanctions against those violating the requirements established in the law.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; The sanction system for failure to respect the right to information has been strengthened with the introduction of heavy administrative sanctions for officials violating the law.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt;

Furthermore, the new has broadened the scope of the definition of the term “public information” defined as any data registered in any form and format, maintained by a public authority as well as the definition of the term “public authority” which now encompasses commercial companies where the state hold the majority of shares, as well as any legal entity exercising public functions.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; Proactivity of publication for certain categories of information has been introduced.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt;

The law establishes that requests for information of public interest can be made orally or in writing.&lt;ref name="BIRN" /&gt; The provision of information is free of charge: the law only enables public bodies to charge the costs for photocopying; no charge can be applied to electronic delivery.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

Public bodies are obliged to give an answer within 10 days from the submission of the request (under the previous legal framework it was 40).&lt;ref name=ECPMF/&gt; In case the request is rejected, the applicant has the right to appeal to the Commissioner and then to the courts.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

Exceptions to the right to information are established by the law, including for reasons of national security and international and intergovernmental relations.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

Despite the improvements introduced by the new legal framework, the effectiveness of its implementation still remains to be seen. According to the journalist Rudina Hoxha, one of the problem is that the two institutions that should monitor the application of the law, meaning the Information and Data Protection Commissioner and the Ombudsman, have in fact a counseling character and even though by the law they are entitled to apply sanctions, this happens very rarely.&lt;ref name=ECPMF/&gt;

According to a 2016 report by the NGO ''Mjaft Movement'', Albanian public institutions comply with their obligations to provided public information under FOI requests only in 42% of the cases. To test and monitor the application of the new law, the organisation submitted 230 requests for information to different public bodies, including central institutions, local ones, justice institutions and public universities. Out of 230 requests, only 98 replies were obtained. Only 80 of these answers disclosed the required information. The remaining 18 were cases of incomplete information provision.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albanian-institutions-difficulties-in-doing-transparency-07-11-2016   |title=Albanian institutions fail a transparency test |last= |first= |date= 12 July 2016 |website=BalkanInsight.com |publisher=BalkanInsight |access-date=25 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report found out that Albanian municipalities were the most problematic and opaque institutions in terms of applying the FOI law. The main problem concerned non-compliance with the obligation to appoint the coordinator on the right to information and great lack of transparency on budget and financial issues.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt;

The right of access to information in Cyprus is guaranteed in constitutional provisions on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] but the legal framework is seriously flawed, with no law on access to information in the Southern [[Republic of Cyprus]] of the country and a law that falls below [[Council of Europe]] standards in the [[Northern Cyprus|Northern part of Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The right to access to public information is provided in different ways in the two parts of the island, in which Cyprus is ''de facto'' divided.

As to 2011, a research by the [[Open Cyprus Project]] showed that there was a level of 75% of [[administrative silence]] island-wide, in response to information requests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmediafreedom.eu/Publications/Reports/The-Right-of-Access-to-Information-in-Cyprus.-Report-and-Recommendations|title=The Right of Access to Information in Cyprus. Report and Recommendations|last=|first=|date=November 2011|website=rcmediafreedom.eu|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of the respondents to this survey stated that, in practice, access to key documents is not possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since late 2013, a draft law on the Right to Access Public Information is being discussed in the Parliament of the (Southern) Republic of Cyprus. 

'''On 22 December 2017 the law has finally been approved (Law number 184(I)/2017)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non-ind/2017_1_184/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Northern Cyprus ==
The right to access public information is granted by Article No. 24 of the Constitution of Northern Cyprus. Even if the Constitutional article echoes Article No. 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), experts say that the possibilities to restrict the fundamental right of  access to public information are provided in an overbroad manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specifically, Article No. 10 (2) ECHR says that the conditions and restrictions imposed on the right to freedom of expression have to be “necessary in a democratic society”. Instead, even if the Constitution of Northern Cyprus- under Article No. 24- provides for a test of whether a restriction to such a right is necessary, it does not specify the key qualification of being necessary in a democratic society, as required by Article 10 of the ECHR.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The relevant laws regulating the right to access public information in the Northern part of Cyprus are: the Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006; the Public Officials Law No. 7 of 1979; the State Procurement Regulation; the Rules and Procedures of the Parliament and the Personal Data Protection Act No. 89 of 2007.

The Right to Access Information Law obliges “public bodies” to process all information requests, regardless of the means by which they are submitted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2011 research recommends that, with regard to the Access to Information Law in the Northern part of the country, the scope of the law should be extended to all classes of information held by public bodies. Also, according to experts, an implementing regulation should be approved, clarifying the administrative procedure to request and receive information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, the Access to Information Assessment Commission foreseen by the law has not been appointed yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/nat/11269|title=Open Cyprus Project: Results|last=|first=|date=February 24, 2011|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Republic of Cyprus ==
The Cypriot government couldn't sign or ratify the 2009 [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on Access to Official Documents]] as it did not have a transparency law that meets the Convention’s minimum standard. Until 2017, Cyprus was the only country in Europe, other than Luxembourg, without a law guaranteeing the right of access to information.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/28182|title=Civil society warn Cyprus’ draft transparency law under threat if excessive exceptions persist|last=|first=|date=March 31, 2017|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. But as of 2018, the law has been published (Law 184(I)/2017)

The relevant laws with regard to the right to access public information are the following:
* Article No. 19 and 29 of the Constitution;
* the Act regarding Personal Data N. 138 of 2001, which makes clear that this data can be accessed only by the affected person (s);
* the Act on Re-Use of Existing Information Held by Public Sector Bodies, No. 132 of 2006: it ensures that when the authority grants one user permission to make use of a large volume of information, it must grant other users access on the same  terms;
* the Press Law No. 145 o 1985: it grants a general right of access to all information held by public bodies;
* the Environmental Information Law No. 119 of 2004, which clearly grants access to information on a non- discriminatory basis;
* the State Archives Law No. 208 of 1991, for information held in archives. It does not grant a general public access before a thirty-year period;
* the State Secrets Law No. 2016 of 2002;
* the Public Service Law No. 1 of 1990;
* the Public Procurement Law No.1 of 200;
* the Public Aid Law No. 30 of 2001;
* the Administrative Principles Law No. 158 of 1999.
According to experts, these non-specific laws that might grant access to some classes of information, such as environmental information or archives, require amendments to comply with the basic international and European standards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since April 2014, the Republic of Cyprus has been holding public consultations aimed at drafting a Freedom of Information Law, which as to 2017 has to be enacted.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2015/10/18/ministry-defends-planned-freedom-of-information-law/|title=Ministry defends planned freedom of information law|last=Psyllides|first=George|date=October 18, 2015|website=cyprus-mail.com|publisher=Cyprus Mail Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the Cypriot Justice Minister [[Ionas Nicolaou]] expressed his commitment to adopt a strong access to information (Freedom of Information) law that will be “one of the best in the [[European Union]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/20942|title=Access Info welcomes Cyprus’ commitment to strong FOI law|last=Pavlou|first=Andreas|date=October 21, 2015|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, in February 2017, the association [[Access Info Europe]] has addressed the Cypriot Parliament asking to review such a draft. In particular, Access Info Europe advocated for the removal of  the fees for making information requests and for cutting down the possible 60 days extension for complex requests which has been included in the draft.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/27727|title=Cypriot lawmakers challenged to ensure FOI is free and exceptions are limited|last=|first=|date=March 1, 2017|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2017/02/18/ngo-calls-foi-fees-axed/|title=NGO calls for FOI fees to be axed|last=Andreou|first=Evie|date=February 18, 2017|website=cyprus-mail.com|publisher=Cyprus Mail Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to Access Info, also the regime of possible exceptions needs to be reviewed. Currently, the draft includes absolute exceptions, with no [[public interest]] test.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, under the international and European transparency standards, when disclosure of information is denied  requesters must be given clear reasons as to why the exception has been applied.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In March 2017, the recommendations elaborated by Access Info Europe were sent to the Cypriot Parliament Legal Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/Comments_FOIlaw_cyprus_parliamentarycommittee_28feb2016.pdf|title=Σχόλια από Access Info Europe περί το νομοσχέδιο που ρυθμίζει το δικαίωμα πρόσβασης σε ληροφορίες του δημόσιου τομέα (Comments from Access Info Europe on the draft law regulating the right of access to Public Sector Information)|last=|first=|date=February 28, 2016|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|language=Greek|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2015, [[Citizen Service Centres]] have been established all over the island in order to provide multiple services as an alternative channel for dealing with public agencies/organizations. They work through a single 4-digit number (1434) which citizens can call in order to obtain information with respect to approximately 90 services offered by the CSCs, such as eligibility criteria for submitting an application, documents that need to be submitted, fees charged etc. Through this Call Centre, citizens can also submit applications for 18 services relating to the issuing of specific documents/licenses/certificates etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/csr2016/nrp2016_cyprus_en.pdf|title=EUROPE 2020- Cyprus National Reform Programme 2016|last=|first=|date=April 2016|website=ec.europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Access to information, just as [[media independence]] and pluralism remain critical issues in the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]].&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/article/moldova-stakeholder-submission-universal-periodic-review |title=Moldova: stakeholder Submission for the Universal Periodic Review |last= |first= |date=28 March 2016 |website=Freedomhouse.org |publisher= Freedom House|access-date=23 January 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous calls for media legislation reform, the government of Moldova has not made significant steps to improve access to information according to the country's international obligations, including a convention with the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name=Jurnal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jurnal.md/en/politic/2016/10/14/access-to-information-more-and-more-difficult-in-moldova-things-that-are-in-fact-of-public-interest-are-excessively-and-abusively-kept-secret/  |title=Access to information, more and more difficult in Moldova; “Things that  are, in fact, of public interest are excessively and abusively kept secret” |last= |first= |date=14 October 2016 |website=Jurnal.md |publisher=Jurnal online |access-date=23 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public officials widely impede access to public information through refusals, delays or incomplete answers, without sanctions.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; In 2014, the [[Independent Journalism Center (IJC)]] presented to Parliament amendments to improve the law on access to information, provide additional guarantees for journalists and limit unjustified limitations of access to public information by public officials. However, the draft law has not yet been adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= November 2015 |title= Report on the State of Media in Eastern Partnership Countries |url= http://archive.eap-csf.eu/assets/files/Report%20on%20state%20of%20media%20in%20EaP%20countries_Nov%202015.pdf |publisher= Eastern Partnership. Civil Society Forum |access-date= 23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Executive Director of the [[Association of Independent Press]], Petru Macovei, overall the law on access to information is good, but it is compromised by a non-collaborative attitude of the public authorities.&lt;ref name=Jurnal/&gt;

==Legal framework==

The right to access public information in guaranteed by Article 34 of the Moldovan Constitution and is regulated by the Law on Access to Information which was adopted in 2000.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rti-rating.org/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/files/pdf/Moldova.pdf Republic of Moldova. The Law on Access Information. Retrieved 23 January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The law establishes that information of public interest can be requested in writing or orally. Information can be consulted at the institution’s premises or can be received stored in an electronic support or in hardcopy.  Viewing documents on the institution’s premises is free of charge, while reasonable fees can be charged for the cost of photocopying, transcribing, translating or delivering the documents.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url= http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf |publisher= Balkan Investigative Report Network (BIRN) |access-date= 23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the law, documents of public interest must be provided within 15 working days, which can be extended by five days in case of requests of large numbers of documents.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; If the request is rejected, the applicant can exercise its right of appeal to the relevant courts, and if the court decides on behalf of the applicant, the law imposes penalties in form of fines to the government body which has violated the law.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; Exceptions justifying limitation to the disclosure regime are specified in the law and include state secrets, information on the military, intelligence, economic, foreign policy or criminal proceedings, information concerning ongoing lawsuit, personal data, confidential business data, and preliminary results of scientific and technical research.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Access to information in practice==

In practice, compliance with the Law on Access to Information remains weak just as its implementation which is not supported by the full authority of the bodies responsible for its enforcement. The [[Ombudsman]] in Moldova has the authority to supervise the implementation of the law, but this office lacks the capacity and the resources to exercise its role.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; Investigative journalists and civil society organisations face numerous difficulties when requesting access to public information, including obstruction by public officials, refusals and delays in replying to requests, as well as incomplete responses to requests for information.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; To justify their denials, public officials frequently cite laws that conflict with the Law on Access to Information, in particular the Law on State Secrets and the Law on Trade Secrets.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

One of the problem in enforcing the right to access public information is impunity, meaning that the law establishes only insignificant fines on public offices who fail to provide due access to information. Also, in many cases, the information provided by state bodies is shaped in the officials' favor, giving the impression that authorities are behaving in compliance with the law, while in fact depriving the requester the information they are seeking. Moreover, in many cases officials do not provide public interest information without the approval from a supervisor and often refuse to answers telephone calls from journalists, thus increasing the time for getting the required information.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Another problem concerns the costs for obtaining public information and the fees charged to the requester, despite some improvements made recently, such as the introduction of a public register through the [[E-government|E-Government]] service in 2014. This affects in particular newsrooms and investigative journalists that must pay large sums of money for getting data useful for their investigative work.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montenegro]], access to information is a right guaranteed by the Constitution and regulated under the law. Montenegro first adopted the Law on Free Access to Information in 2005; in 2013 a new law entered into force, providing a better standard of protection for freedom of information than the previous legal act.&lt;ref name=MANS&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |title=Freedom of information in Montenegro. Analysis of the Legal Framework, Practice and Implementation of ECHR Case Law and other International Standards with Recommendations for Improvement |url=http://www.mans.co.me/en/wp-content/uploads/fai/FreedomOfInformation-Internship.pdf |publisher=MANS. Network for Affirmation of NGO Sector  |issue= |access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite some positive developments achieved with the adoption of the new Law, Montenegro still has problems with its implementation.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-ngo-doubts-govt-s-plan-to-open-public-records-04-01-2016 |title=Montenegro Plan to Open Public Records Doubted |last= |first= |date=1 April 2016 |website=Balkaninsight.com |publisher= BalkanInsight |access-date=9 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Montenegro started the process of reforming the current law: a draft proposal was formulated by the Culture of Ministry in 2016 following some pressure from the [[European Union]] to align Montenegrin legislation with EU standards.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Legal framework==
The Constitution of Montenegro states, in Article 51, that everyone shall have the right of access to public information held by state authorities and organisations exercising public functions.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt; Furthermore, the '''2013 Law on Free Access to Information''' establishes a precise procedure for obtaining public information. The law entitles any natural or legal person the right to access information held in any form by state and local authorities, public companies and other entities which exercise public functions. Public authorities have 15 working days for deciding on the disclosure of a required information.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt;

The new law introduced a new supervisory body, called Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Free Access to Information which works on the appeal process of freedom of information requests.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt; Another positive development in the 2013 law is the introduction of fines to be imposed upon public bodies which fail to fulfill with their duties with regard to access to information.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==
According to the 2016 [[European Commission]] Progress Report on Montenegro, the law on Access to public information lack effective monitoring and supervision.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; According to the newspaper [[Vijesti]], the experience of journalists and NGOs in the country shows that, despite FOI legal provisions, in practice it is difficult to get information of public importance. &lt;ref name=OBCT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Montenegro/Montenegro-i-silenzi-della-pubblica-amministrazione-177586 |title=Montenegro: i silenzi della pubblica amministrazione |last=Čađenović |first=Ivan |date=10 February 2017 |website=balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucasto Transeuropa / Vijesti |access-date=21 February 2017 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last years the proportion of requests refused by public authorities in Montenegro improved from 24% in 2014 to 18% in 2015. Also, the 2016 budget of the Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Access to Information was increased by 50%.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Montenegro 2016 Report |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_montenegro.pdf  |publisher=European Commission |access-date=9 February  2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited capacity and resources of the Agency was an issue of concern for some NGOs advocating for access to information.&lt;ref name="MANS" /&gt;

In 2015, out of a total of 4.434 requests for access to information, the information requested was not provided in 805 cases.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; The Agency for Personal Data Protection and Free Access to Information received a total of 1.431 complaints in 2015. The majority of cases received by the Agency concerned [[administrative silence]]: in these cases the request remained unanswered.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt;

The majority of FOI requests, around 70%, are filed by NGOs, among which stands the NGO MANS.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; This data shows the low awareness and knowledge by the general public of the right of access to information and its legal provisions.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; In the majority of cases applicants are get the required information with large delays, beyond the time frame established by the law, and often after having filed a complaint to the Ombudsbam.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

Another issue of concern is that court decisions on cases concerning access to information are not effectively enforced.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; The report of the EC also points out that in some cases public authorities in Montenegro seem to abuse the possibility of declaring requested documents confidential in order to avoid their disclosure.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; Indeed, according to the NGO MANS, the law includes a series of unnecessary reasons for exceptions for limiting disclosure. The formulation of the exceptions enshrined in the law seems to be too vague and too general, thus giving room for public institutions to interpret it in a way that restricts access to information.&lt;ref name="MANS" /&gt;

Another reason of concern is the high percentage of requests that remain unanswered.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

According to the [[Balkan Insight|Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] (BIRN), problems in realizing the right of access to public information arise in particular when journalists and NGOs seek information about the privatization process or seek information that could potentially reveal cases of corruption or illegal activity. &lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2015 |title=Montenegro 2015 Human Rights Report. Executive Summary |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/253093.pdf |publisher=US State Department|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NGO MANS, the respect of the law on access to public information is particularly problematic when it comes to make public information concerning enterprises where the State owns the majority of shares.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

The EC Progress Report recommends to enhance the implementation of the law especially in corruption-prone cases.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

[[Access to public information in Europe|Access to public information]] and [[freedom of information]] (FOI) refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' [[accountability]], boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.

On 13 January 2011, the ''[[Verkhovna Rada]]'' (the Parliament of Ukraine) adopted two laws on access to information: The Law of Ukraine “On Access to Public Information”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/laws/ukraine-the-law-on-access-to-public-information.pdf|title=THE LAW OF UKRAINE On Access to Public Information|last=|first=|date=2011|website=article19.org|publisher=Article 19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new wording of the Law of Ukraine “On Information” (1992).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zakon0.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2657-12|title=Law No. 2938-VI On Information|last=|first=|date=2011|website=zakon0.rada.gov.ua|publisher=Holos Ukrainy official daily|language=Ukrainian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They entered into force on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2011/3/article30.en.html|title=Ukraine- Law on Access to Public Information Adopted|last=Shevchenko|first=Taras|date=March 2011|website=merlin.obs.coe.int|publisher=IRIS Merlin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art. 5 of the Law of Ukraine "On Information" provides the «right for information» which includes the possibility of free collection, usage, distribution, storage and protection of information necessary for the exercise of person’s rights, freedoms and legitimate interests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3158729|title=The Information Law of Ukraine|last=Kormych|first=Borys|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=Odesa|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Both of the laws were criticized in 2012 by the London-based association advocating for free expression [[Article 19]], which considered that they lack provisions to ensure that the [[Right to privacy|rights to privacy]] and [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and information are appropriately balanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3391/en/ukraine:-data-protection-act-and-related-legislation|title=Ukraine: Data Protection Act and related legislation|last=|first=|date=July 26, 2012|website=article19.org|publisher=ARTICLE 19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2012/07/ukraine-access-data-laws-criticized-by-article-19/|title=Ukraine Access, Data Laws Criticized by Article 19|last=|first=|date=July 30, 2012|website=freedominfo.org|publisher=Freedominfo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 2015, the Ukrainian Parliament approved a law to encourage government agencies to release and provide more information from the country’s archive of Soviet-era [[KGB]] files. The information would be transferred to the Institute of National Remembrance and be declassified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/04/ukraine-passes-open-data-bill-soviet-files-available/|title=Ukraine Passes Open Data Bill; Soviet Files Available|last=|first=|date=April 30, 2015|website=freedominfo.org|publisher=Freedominfo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ukraines-parliament-votes-open-soviet-era-kgb-archives-public-1876756|title=Ukraine’s Parliament Votes To Open Soviet-Era KGB Archives To Public|last=Lynch|first=Dennis|date=September 4, 2015|website=ibtimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the same law  encourages to publish free operational data, statistics and reports on government websites and on the national open data web platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.gov.ua/|title=National open data web platform|last=|first=|date=|website=data.gov.ua|language=Ukrainian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2014, the Parliament of Ukraine passed the draft law No. 0947. According to experts, it makes a variety of improvements related to access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cedem.org.ua/en/Analytics/373/|title=Centre for Democracy and Rule of Law (CEDEM)|last=|first=|date=|website=cedem.org.ua|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, fines are added for ungrounded refusals to disclose information, for an untimely or incomplete provision of information, or the provision of false information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2014/04/amendments-approved-ukrainian-access-law/|title=Amendments Approved to Ukrainian Access Law|last=|first=|date=April 18, 2014|website=freedominfo.org|publisher=Freedominfo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Independent Reporting Mechanism]] (IRM) of the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OPG) organization &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/irm/irm-reports|title=IRM Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2016, Ukraine’s progress for improving access to information, corruption prevention mechanisms, and bringing citizens in government decision making is “truly impressive”- especially considering the difficult political situation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/open-government-partnership/2016/03/21/new-report-ukraine-finds-progress-access-information|title=NEW REPORT ON UKRAINE FINDS PROGRESS IN ACCESS TO INFORMATION, BUT MORE EFFORTS ARE NEEDED IN GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY|last=|first=|date=March 21, 2016|website=opengovpartnership.org|publisher=Open Government Partnership|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the IRM,  the country fell short in delivering on promises made to improve government accountability and fight corruption. In particular, according to an expert, Ukraine needs to further open public contracting, including in publicly owned enterprises, and to bring more transparency to natural resource extraction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to IRM, also, in its next [[OPG National Plan]], Ukraine should provide for among its commitments for a system of electronic disclosure so that public officials’ assets are verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/ukraine/irm|title=Ukraine- Progress Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bewareofdog.JPG|thumb|Notice at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]]]]

'''Beware of the dog''' (also rendered as '''Beware of dog''') is a [[warning sign]] indicating that a dangerous dog is within. Such signs may be placed to deter [[burglary]] even if there is no dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=How young house burglars choose targets|author=R Wright, RH Logie|journal=The Howard Journal of Criminal Justice|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Deconstructing the fort|author=C Wilkinson|journal=Journal of Australian Studies|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Warning signs of this sort have been found in [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] buildings such as the [[House of the Tragic Poet]] in [[Pompeii]], which contains a [[mosaic]] with the caption ''[[cave canem]]'' ({{IPA-la|ˈka.weː ˈka.nẽ|pron}}). Some suppose that these warnings may sometimes have been intended to prevent visitors from stepping upon small, delicate dogs of the [[Italian Greyhound]] type.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OI6G9fCwlwC&amp;pg=PR7|pages=10–11|year=2004|title=The Rosetta bone|isbn=978-0-7645-4421-7|author=Cheryl S. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
Under [[English law]], placing such a sign does not relieve the owner of responsibility for any harm which may come to people attacked by the dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Commentaries on the Liberty of the Subject and the Laws of England|author=James Paterson|year=1877|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A treatise on the law of torts|page=285|author=[[Charles G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2055">Like the other autonomous member churches of the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]] has its own system of [[canon law]]. Unlike the [[Canon law of the Church of England|system of canon law in the Church of England]], which continues to be drawn from the canon law of the [[Western church]], English ecclesiastical law did not remain in force in the Episcopal Church after the [[American Revolution]].{{sfn|Podmore|2008|p=127}} There are two parallel systems of canon law within the church operating on a national level, governed by the [[General Convention]], and on a diocesan level, with each diocesan convention empowered to create constitutions and canons. Diocesan constitutions do not require the approval of the General Convention. The Episcopal Church is notable among Anglican Churches for the extent to which the Constitution and Canons of the General Convention leave matters to regulation at the diocesan and parochial levels.{{sfn|Podmore|2008|p=134}}

The '''capacity''' of [[natural person|natural]]  and [[juridical person|juridical]] persons ([[legal person]]s) in general, determines whether they may make binding amendments to their [[rights]], [[duty|duties]] and [[obligation]]s, such as getting [[marriage|married]] or [[Mergers and acquisitions|merging]], entering into [[contract]]s, making [[gift (law)|gifts]], or writing a valid [[will (law)|will]]. Capacity is an aspect of [[status (law)|status]] and both are defined by a person's ''personal law'':
*for natural persons, the law of [[domicile (law)|domicile]] or ''[[lex domicilii]]'' in [[common law]] [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, and either the law of [[nationality]] or ''[[lex patriae]]'', or of [[habitual residence]] in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] states;
*for juridical persons, the law of the place of [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]], the ''[[lex incorporationis]]'' for [[company (law)|companies]] while other forms of business entity derive their capacity either from the law of the place in which they were formed or the laws of the states in which they establish a presence for trading purposes depending on the nature of the entity and the transactions entered into.
When the [[law]] limits or bars a person from engaging in specified activities, any [[Contract|agreements]] or [[contract]]s to do so are either [[Voidable contract|voidable]] or [[Void contract|void]] for '''incapacity'''.  Sometimes such legal incapacity is referred to as ''incompetence''.  For comparison, see [[Competence (law)]].

==Discussion==
As an aspect of the [[social contract]] between a state and its [[citizen]]s, the state adopts a role of protector to the weaker and more vulnerable members of society. In [[public policy (law)|public policy]] terms, this is the policy of ''[[parens patriae]]''. Similarly, the state has a direct social and economic interest in promoting trade, so it will define the forms of business enterprise that may operate within its territory, and lay down rules that will allow both the businesses and those that wish to contract with them a fair opportunity to gain value. This system worked well until social and commercial mobility increased. Now persons routinely trade and travel across state boundaries (both physically and electronically), so the need is to provide stability across state lines given that laws differ from one state to the next. Thus, once defined by the personal law, persons take their capacity with them like a passport whether or however they may travel. In this way, a person will not gain or lose capacity depending on the accident of the local laws, e.g. if A does not have capacity to marry her cousin under her personal law (a rule of [[consanguinity]]), she cannot [[evasion (law)|evade]] that law by travelling to a state that does permit such a marriage (see [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]]). In Saskatchewan Canada, an exception to this law allows married persons to become the common law spouse of other(s) prior to divorcing the first spouse. This law is not honored amongst other Canadian provinces.

===Natural persons===
{{see also|Testamentary capacity}}
Standardized classes of person have had their freedom restricted. These limitations are exceptions to the general policy of [[freedom of contract]] and the detailed [[human rights|human]] and [[civil rights]] that a person of ordinary capacity might enjoy. Hence, for example, freedom of movement may be modified, the [[right to vote]] may be withdrawn, etc. As societies have developed more equal treatment based on gender, race and ethnicity, many of the older incapacities have been removed. For example, [[English law]] used to treat married women as lacking the capacity to own property or act independently of their husbands (the last of these rules was repealed by the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973, which removed the wife's domicile of dependency for those marrying after 1974, so that a husband and wife could have different domiciles).

====Minor (law)====
{{main article|Minor (law)}}

The definition of an ''infant'' or ''minor'' varies, each state reflecting local [[culture]] and [[prejudice]]s in defining the [[age of majority]], [[marriageable age]], [[voting age]], etc. In many [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, legal [[contract]]s, in which (at least) one of the contracting parties is a minor, are voidable by the minor.  For a minor to undergo [[medical procedure]], [[consent]] is determined by the minor's parent(s) or [[legal guardian]](s).  The right to vote in the United States is currently set at 18 years, while the right to buy and consume [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is often set at 21 years by U.S. [[state law]].  Some laws, such as marriage laws, may differentiate between the sexes and allow women to marry younger. There are instances in which a person may be able to gain capacity earlier than the prescribed time through a process of [[Emancipation of minors|emancipation]]. Conversely, many states allow the inexperience of childhood to be an excusing condition to criminal liability and set the [[age of criminal responsibility]] to match the local experience of emerging behavioral problems (see ''[[doli incapax]]''). For sexual crimes, the [[age of consent]] determines the potential liability of [[adult]] accused.

As an example of liability in contract, the law in most of Canada provides that an infant is not bound by the contracts he or she enters into except for the purchase of necessaries and for beneficial contracts of service. Infants must pay fair price only for necessary goods and services. However, the [[British Columbia]] ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040617060433/http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/I/96223_01.htm Infants Act]'' (RSBC 1996 c.223) declares all contracts, including necessities and beneficial contracts of service, are unenforceable against an infant. Only student loans and other contracts made specifically enforceable by statute will be binding on infants in that province.

In contracts between an adult and an infant, adults are bound but infants may escape contracts at their option (i.e. the contract is voidable). Infants may ratify a contract on reaching age of majority. In the case of executed contracts, when the infant has obtained some benefit under the contract, he/she cannot avoid obligations unless what was obtained was of no value. Upon repudiation of a contract, either party can apply to the court. The court may order restitution, damages, or discharge the contract. All contracts involving the transfer of real estate are considered valid until ruled otherwise.

====Minors and Contractual Capacity====
A [[Minor (law)|minor]] (typically under 18) can disaffirm a contract made, no matter the case. However, the entire contract must be disaffirmed. Depending on the jurisdiction, the minor may be required to return any of the goods still in his possession. Also, [[barter]] transactions such as purchasing a [[retail]] item in exchange for a cash payment are generally recognized through a [[legal fiction]] not to be contracts due to the absence of promises of future action.  A minor may not disavow such a trade.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy E. &lt;u&gt;[http://www.randybarnett.com/aconsent.htm A Consent Theory of Contracts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925033415/http://www.randybarnett.com/aconsent.htm |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/u&gt; Columbia Law Review (March, 1986) pp. 299, fn 123&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Disaffirmance''' - it  must be timely. For example, a contract that goes beyond two years of reaching the age of majority would be considered ratified. Minors are still allowed to disaffirm, even if their age is misrepresented. They will not face tort violations. Some states don't allow disaffirmance if the consideration cannot be returned.
*'''Obligations''' - most states hold that a minor only must return the goods (consideration) if the goods are still in the minor’s possession. Many states are requiring that the minor restore the adult (other party) to the state they were in before the contract was made. Minors are beginning to be held responsible for damages, wear, tear, etc. of the good in question upon return. A suit for tort is considered by some states to be an enforcement of the contract and is not allowed.
*'''Liability''' - for necessities, (1) the item contracted for must be necessary for minor’s existence, (2) the value must be up to that of the current standard of living or financial/social status (not excessive in value), (3) the minor must not be under the care of a parent/guardian who is required to supply the item. A minor could be held liable for a contract for the purchase of luxury items (those that are not in the financial/social/standard of living range).
*'''Ratification''' - accepting and giving legal force to an obligation. Express ratification (for a minor) is expressly stating, orally or in writing that he/she intends to be bound by the contract. Implied ratification is when the conduct of the minor is inconsistent with that of disaffirmance or when minor fails to disaffirm an executed contract within a reasonable period.
Generally, the courts base their determination on whether the minor, after reaching the age of majority, has had ample opportunity to consider the nature of the contractual obligations he or she entered into as a minor and the extent to which the adult party to the contract has performed.&lt;ref&gt;Jentz, Gaylord A. and Roger LeRoy Miller &lt;u&gt;Business Law Today: The Essentials&lt;/u&gt; South-Western College/West, Ohio, 2003 pp. 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;
As one court put it, "the purpose of the infancy doctrine is to protect 'minors from foolishly squandering their wealth through improvident contracts with crafty adults who would take advantage of them in the marketplace.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Hauer v. Union State Bank of Wautoma'', 192 Wis. 2d 576, 593 (1995), quoting ''Halbman v. Lemke'', 99 Wis. 2d 241, 245 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insanity, mental illness, or mental/medical condition====
{{See also|Insanity|mental disorder}}
Individuals may have an inherent physical condition which prevents them from achieving the normal levels of performance expected from persons of comparable age, or their inability to match current levels of performance may be caused by contracting an illness. Whatever the cause, if the resulting condition is such that individuals cannot care for themselves, or may act in ways that are against their interests, those persons are vulnerable through dependency and require the protection of the state against the risks of abuse or exploitation. Hence, any agreements that were made are voidable, and a court may declare that person a ward of the state and grant [[power of attorney]] to an appointed [[legal guardian]].

In England and Wales, this is a specific function of the [[Court of protection|Court of Protection]], and all matters concerning persons who have lost, or expect soon to lose, mental capacity are regulated under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]. This makes provision for [[Lasting power of attorney|lasting powers of attorney]] under which decisions about the health, welfare and financial assets of a person who has lost capacity may be dealt with in that person's interests.

In Ireland the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was passed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|last=(eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie|language=en|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act addresses the capicity of people with intellectual disabilities. The general principles are set out in section 8 of the Act.

This sort of problem sometimes arises when people suffer some form of medical problem such as unconsciousness, [[coma]], extensive [[paralysis]], or delirious states, from accidents or illnesses such as [[stroke]]s, or often when older people become afflicted with some form of medical/mental [[disability]] such as [[Huntington's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Lewy body]] disease, or similar dementia.  Such persons are often unable to consent to medical treatment and otherwise handle their financial and other personal matters.  If the afflicted person has prepared documents beforehand about what to do in such cases, often in a revocable living [[Trust law|trust]] or related documents, then the named legal guardian may be able to take over their financial and other affairs.  If the afflicted person owns his/her property jointly with a spouse or other able person, the able person may be able to take over many of the routine financial affairs.  Otherwise, it is often necessary to petition a court, such as a [[probate court]], that the afflicted person lacks legal capacity and allow a legal guardian to take over their financial and personal affairs.  Procedures and court review have been established, dependent on the area of jurisdiction, to prevent exploitation of the incapacitated person by the guardian.  The guardian periodically provides a financial accounting for court review.

In the [[Criminal Law]], the traditional common law [[M'Naghten Rules]] [[excuse]]d all persons from liability if they did not understand what they were doing or, if they did, that they did not know it was wrong. The consequences of this excuse were that those accused were detained indefinitely or until the medical authorities certified that it was safe to release them back into the community. This consequence was felt to be too draconian and so statutes have introduced new defenses that will limit or reduce the liability of those accused of committing offenses if they were suffering from a mental illness at the relevant time (see the [[insanity defense|insanity]] and [[mental disorder defense|mental disorder]] defenses).

====Drunkenness or drug abuse====
Although individuals may have consumed a sufficient quantity of intoxicant or drug to reduce or eliminate their ability to understand exactly what they are doing, such conditions are self-induced and so the law does not generally allow any defense or excuse to be raised to any actions taken while incapacitated. The most generous states do permit individuals to repudiate agreements as soon as sober, but the conditions to exercising this right are strict.

====Bankruptcy====
{{See also|Bankruptcy}}
If individuals find themselves in a situation where they can no longer pay their debts, they lose their status as credit-worthy and become bankrupt. States differ on the means whereby their outstanding liabilities can be treated as discharged and on the precise extent of the limits that are placed on their capacities during this time but, after discharge, they are returned to full capacity. In the United States, some [[U.S. state|states]] have spendthrift laws under which an irresponsible spender may be deemed to lack capacity to enter into contracts (in Europe, these are termed prodigality laws) and both sets of laws may be denied extraterritorial effect under public policy as imposing a potentially penal status on the individuals affected.

====Enemy aliens and/or terrorists====
During times of war or civil strife, a state will limit the ability of its citizens to offer help or assistance in any form to those who are acting against the interests of the state. Hence, all commercial and other contracts with the "enemy", including terrorists, would be considered void or suspended until a cessation of hostilities is agreed.

===Business entities===
*[[Corporations]]
The extent of an artificial person's capacity depends on the law of the place of incorporation and the enabling provisions included in the [[constitutional documents|constitutive documents]] of incorporation. The general rule is that anything not included in the corporation's capacity, whether expressly or by implication, is ''[[ultra vires]]'', i.e. "beyond the power" of the corporation, and so may be unenforceable by the corporation, but the rights and interests of innocent third parties dealing with the corporations are usually protected.
*General and limited partnerships
There is a clear division between the approach of states to the definition of partnerships. One group of states treats [[general partnership|general]] and [[limited partnership|limited]] partnerships as aggregate. In terms of capacity, this means that they are no more than the sum of the natural persons who conduct the business. The other group of states allows partnerships to have a separate legal personality which changes the capacity of the "firm" and those who conduct its business and makes such partnerships more like corporations.
*Unions
In some states, [[trade union]]s have limited capacity unless any contract made relates to union activities.
*[[Insolvency]]
When a business entity becomes insolvent, an [[Administrator (law)|administrator]], receiver, or other similar legal functionary may be appointed to determine whether the entity shall continue to trade or be sold so that the creditors may receive all or a proportion of the money owing to them. During this time, the capacity of the entity is limited so that its liabilities are not increased unreasonably and to the detriment of the existing creditors.

In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past [[precedent]]ial decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as ''[[stare decisis]]''). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a "[[Case of first impression|matter of first impression]]"), and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision).&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury v. Madison'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=5&amp;page=137 5 U.S. 137] (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.")&lt;/ref&gt; The court states an [[legal opinion|opinion]] that gives reasons for the decision, and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as [[precedent]] to bind future judges and litigants.

Jensen'', 244 U.S. 205, 222 (1917) (Oliver Wendell Holmes, dissenting).  By the early 20th century, legal professionals had come to reject any idea of a higher or natural law, or a law above the law.

== Definitions ==
The term ''common law'' has many connotations. The first three set out here are the most-common usages within the legal community. Other connotations from past centuries are sometimes seen, and are sometimes heard in everyday speech.

=== Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law {{Anchor|Disambiguate_statute}} ===
The first definition of "common law" given in ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 10th edition, 2014, is "The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASELAW, [contrast] STATUTORY LAW."  &lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334|quote=1. The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASE LAW [contrast to] STATUTORY LAW.}}  ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' is the most-used legal dictionary used among legal professionals in the U.S.{{cite web|url=https://library.law.yale.edu/us-legal-dictionaries|title=U.S. Legal Dictionaries|last=|first=|date=|website=library.law.yale.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is given as the first definition in modern legal dictionaries, is characterized as the “most common” usage among legal professionals, and is the usage frequently seen in decisions of courts.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DuhaimeDef1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonProbateDef1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USvTexas"&gt;For an example of this usage in a decision of the United States Supreme Court, see the quote from ''United States v Texas'' in the section “[[Common law#Interaction with statute|Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law]]” below.&lt;/ref&gt; In this connotation, "common law" distinguishes the authority that promulgated a law. For example, the law in most [[Anglo-America]]n [[jurisdiction]]s includes "[[statute|statutory law]]" enacted by a [[legislature]], "[[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]]" (in the U.S.) or “[[Primary and secondary legislation|delegated legislation]]” (in the U.K.) promulgated by [[executive branch]] agencies pursuant to delegation of rule-making authority from the legislature, and common law or "[[case law]]", ''i.e.'', decisions issued by [[courts]] (or [[quasi-judicial]] [[tribunal]]s within agencies).&lt;ref name="salmond32"&gt;{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|first connotation]] can be further differentiated into
; (a) pure common law: arising from the traditional and inherent authority of courts to define what the law is, even in the absence of an underlying statute or regulation. Examples include most [[criminal law]] and [[procedural law]] before the 20th century, and even today, most [[contract law]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Allen Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts, §&amp;nbsp;1.7, Aspen (2004) (although certain fields of contract law have been modified by statute, "judicial decisions [remain] the dominant primary source of contract law.")&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[law of torts]].&lt;ref name="SpeiserLawOfTorts"&gt;Stuart Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts, §§&amp;nbsp;1:2, 1:5, and 1:6, Thompson Reuters (2013) (describing common law development of tort law in England and the United States, and the "little reluctance [of courts] to overrule (or disapprove statements in) decisions in tort law either now deemed wrong or inadvisedly considered" and disinclination toward any contention that change must be by legislation).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute"&gt;''E.g.'', Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch 341 (defining a new rule of contract law with no basis in statute); ''Marbury v. Madison'', 137 5 U.S. 137 (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.");''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916) (discussed [[common law#CL Common Law Evolves|elsewhere in this article]], adjudicating the tort of negligence that existed in no statute, and expanding the law to cover parties that had never been addressed by statute);  Alexander Hamilton, ''[[The Federalist]]'', Nos. 78 and 81 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), 521–530, 541–55 ("The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution, is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body."); see [[rule against perpetuities]] for a judicially created law originating in 1682 that governs the validity of trusts and [[future interests]] in [[real property]], [[Rule in Shelley's Case]] for a rule created by judges in 1366 or before, and [[life estate]] and [[fee simple]] for rules of real property ownership that were judicially created in the late 12th century as the crown began to give law-making power to courts.&lt;/ref&gt;
; (b) interstitial common law: court decisions that analyze, interpret and determine the fine boundaries and distinctions in law promulgated by other bodies. This body of common law, sometimes called "interstitial common law", includes judicial interpretation of the [[Constitution]], of legislative statutes, and of [[Regulation (law)|agency regulations]], and the application of law to specific facts.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;
Publication of decisions, and indexing, is essential to the development of common law, and thus governments and private publishers publish [[law reports]].&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, large legal publishers include West Publishing and Lexis. In the UK, examples of private reports are the [[All England Law Reports]] and the [[Lloyd's Law Reports]]&lt;/ref&gt; While all decisions in [[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions]] are precedent (at varying levels and scope as discussed throughout the article on [[precedent]]), some become "leading cases" or "landmark decisions" that are cited especially often.

=== Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems {{Anchor|Disambiguate_civil_law}} ===
''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 2, differentiates "common law" jurisdictions and legal systems from "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" or "[[Codification (law)|code]]" jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef1"/&gt; Common law systems place great weight on court decisions, which are considered "law" with the same force of law as statutes—for nearly a millennium, common law courts have had the authority to make law where no legislative statute exists, and statutes mean what courts interpret them to mean.&lt;ref&gt;It is characteristic of the common law to adopt an approach based "on precedent, and on the development of the law incrementally and by analogy with established authorities".  ''Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police'', Supreme Court, [2018] UKSC 4, para.21.[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/4.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in civil law jurisdictions (the legal tradition that prevails, or is combined with common law, in Europe and most non-Islamic, non-common law countries), courts lack authority to act if there is no statute.  Civil law judges tend to give less weight to judicial precedent, which means that a civil law judge deciding a given case has more freedom to interpret the text of a statute independently (compared to a common law judge in the same circumstances), and therefore less predictably. For example, the [[Napoleonic code]] expressly forbade French judges to pronounce general principles of law.&lt;ref&gt;"5. The judges are forbidden to pronounce, by way of general and legislative determination, on the causes submitted to them." [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/book1/c_preliminary.html Code of Napoleon, Decree of March 5, 1803, Law 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The role of providing overarching principles, which in common law jurisdictions is provided in judicial opinions, in civil law jurisdictions is filled by giving greater weight to scholarly literature, as explained [[Common law#CL academic writings|below]].

Common law systems trace their history to England, while civil law systems trace their history through the [[Napoleonic Code]] back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radford.edu/~junnever/law/commonlaw.htm|title=Description and History of Common Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html|title=The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law as opposed to equity {{Anchor|3. Law as opposed to equity}} ===
''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 4, differentiates "common law" (or just "law") from "[[equity (law)|equity]]".&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334|quote=4. The body of law derived from law courts as opposed to those sitting in equity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salmond32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef2"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage | last = Garner | first= Bryan A. | year = 2001 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = New York | edition = 2nd, revised | ref = harv|p=177|quote=Second, with the development of equity and equitable rights and remedies, ''common law'' and equitable courts, procedure, rights, and remedies, etc., are frequently contrasted, and in this sense ''common law'' is distinguished from ''equity.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1873, [[England and Wales|England]] had two complementary court systems: courts of "law" which could only award [[Monetary damages|money damages]] and recognized only the legal owner of property, and courts of "equity" ([[courts of chancery]]) that could issue [[injunction|injunctive relief]] (that is, a [[court order]] to a party to do something, give something to someone, or stop doing something) and recognized [[trust (law)|trusts]] of property. This split propagated to many of the colonies, including the United States. For most purposes, most jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal system and most states, have merged the two courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule2.htm Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 2] ("There is one form of action—the civil action.") (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friedmanxix"&gt;{{harvnb|Friedman|2005|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, even before the separate courts were merged, most courts were permitted to apply both law and equity, though under potentially different procedural law. Nonetheless, the historical distinction between "law" and "equity" remains important today when the case involves issues such as the following:
* categorizing and prioritizing [[rights to property]]—for example, the same article of property often has a "[[Equitable title#Equitable versus legal title|legal title]]" and an "[[equitable title]]", and these two groups of ownership rights may be held by different people.
* in the United States, determining whether [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Seventh Amendment's]] right to a [[jury trial]] applies (a determination of a fact necessary to resolution of a "common law" claim)&lt;ref&gt;"In Suits at common law ... the right of [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law."&lt;/ref&gt; vs. whether the issue will be decided by a [[judge]] (issues of what the law is, and all issues relating to equity).
* the standard of review and degree of deference given by an appellate tribunal to the decision of the lower tribunal under review (issues of law are reviewed ''de novo'', that is, "as if new" from scratch by the appellate tribunal, while most issues of equity are reviewed for "abuse of discretion", that is, with great deference to the tribunal below).
* the remedies available and rules of procedure to be applied.
Courts of equity rely on common law principles of binding precedent.

=== Archaic meanings and historical uses {{Anchor|4. Historical uses}} ===

In addition, there are several historical (but now archaic) uses of the term that, while no longer current, provide background context that assists in understanding the meaning of "common law" today.

In one usage that is now archaic, but that gives insight into the history of the common law, "common law" referred to the pre-Christian system of law, imported by the Saxons to England, and dating to before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], and before there was any consistent law to be applied.&lt;ref name="JeffersonToCooper"&gt;One example of this usage is in a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Dr. Thomas Cooper. {{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/jefferson_cooper.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=February 10, 1814|quote=Authorities for what is common law may therefore be as well cited, as for any part of the Lex Scripta, and there is no better instance of the necessity of holding the judges and writers to a declaration of their authorities than the present; where we detect them endeavoring to make law where they found none, and to submit us at one stroke to a whole system, no particle of which has its foundation in the common law. For we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England, and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that time to the date of Magna Carta, which terminates the period of the common law, or lex non scripta, and commences that of the statute law, or Lex Scripta. This settlement took place about the middle of the fifth century. But Christianity was not introduced till the seventh century; the conversion of the first christian king of the Heptarchy having taken place about the year 598, and that of the last about 686. Here, then, was a space of two hundred years, during which the common law was in existence, and Christianity no part of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JeffersonToCartwright&gt;Another example of this usage is in another letter of Jefferson, to John Cartright.{{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter To Major John Cartwright|url=http://www.yamaguchy.com/library/jefferson/cartwright.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=June 5, 1824|quote=I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction, at length, of the judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions, that Christianity is a part of the common law. The proof of the contrary, which you have adduced, is incontrovertible; to wit, that the common law existed while the Anglo-Saxons were yet Pagans, at a time when they had never yet heard the name of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a character had ever existed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That usage is obsolete today. It is both underinclusive and overinclusive, as discussed [[Common law#CL Misconceptions|in the section on "misconceptions"]].

"Common law" as the term is used today in common law countries contrasts with ''[[ius commune]]''. While historically the ''ius commune'' became a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all.&lt;ref name="Ius Commune' p.20"&gt;[[David John Ibbetson]], ''Common Law and Ius Commune'' p.20 (2001) {{ISBN|978-0-85423-165-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] dealt with lawsuits in which the Monarch had no interest, i.e., between commoners.

''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 3 is "General law common to a country as a whole, as opposed to special law that has only local application."&lt;ref name="Blacks10th"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary – Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; From at least the 11th century and continuing for several centuries after that, there were several different circuits in the royal court system, served by [[Circuit court|itinerant judges]] who would travel from town to town dispensing the King's justice in "[[assize]]s". The term "common law" was used to describe the law held in common between the circuits and the different stops in each circuit.&lt;ref name="Blacks10th" /&gt; The more widely a particular law was recognized, the more weight it held, whereas purely local customs were generally subordinate to law recognized in a plurality of jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Blacks10th" /&gt;

=== Misconceptions and imprecise nonlawyer usages{{anchor|CL_Misconceptions}} ===

A number of misconceptions of the term "common law" exist in popular culture and non-lawyer sources.
* Under the modern view, “common law” is not grounded in “custom” or "ancient usage", but rather acquires force of law instantly (without the delay implied by the term "custom" or "ancient") when pronounced by a higher court, because and to the extent the proposition is stated in judicial opinion.&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificBrooding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions" /&gt; From the earliest times through the late 19th century, the dominant theory was that the common law was a pre-existent law or system of rules, a social standard of justice that existed in the habits, customs, and thoughts of the people. Under this older view, the legal profession considered it no part of a judge's duty to make new or change existing law, but only to expound and apply the old. By the early 20th century, largely at the urging of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] (as discussed throughout this article), this view had fallen into the minority view: Holmes pointed out that the older view worked undesirable and unjust results, and hampered a proper development of the law. In the century since Holmes, the dominant understanding has been that common law “decisions are themselves law, or rather the rules which the courts lay down in making the decisions constitute law”.&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions" /&gt; The reality of the modern view can be seen in practical operation: under the old "pre-existing custom" view, (a) jurisdictions could not logically diverge from each other (but nonetheless did), (b) a new decision logically needed to operate retroactively (but did not), and (c) there was no standard to decide which English medieval customs should be "law" and which should not. All three tensions resolve under the modern view: (a) the common law in different jurisdictions may diverge, (b) new decisions need not have retroactive operation, and (c) court decisions are effective immediately as they are issued, not years later, or after they become "custom", and questions of what "custom" might have been at some "ancient" time are simply irrelevant.
* Common law, as the term is used among lawyers in the present day, is not frozen in time, and no longer beholden to 11th, 13th, or 17th century English law. Rather, the common law evolves daily and immediately as courts issue precedential decisions (as explained [[Common law#Principles Common Law Evolves|later in this article]]), and all parties in the legal system (courts, lawyers, and all others) are responsible for up-to-date knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'' ended prayer in public schools immediately, and same-sex marriage became legal throughout the United States immediately on the Supreme Court’s decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no fixed reference point (for example the 11th or 18th centuries) for the definition of "common law", except in a handful of isolated contexts.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution#The historical test|applicability of the Seventh Amendment]]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of what was "customary" in the 13th or 17th or 18th century has no part of the common law today; much of the common law today has no antecedent in those earlier centuries. Among legal professionals (lawyers and judges), the change in understanding occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (as explained [[Common law#History and Holmes|later in this article]]),&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions" /&gt; though lay dictionaries were decades behind in recognizing the change.
* The common law is not "unwritten". Common law exists in writing—as must any law that is to be applied consistently—in the written decisions of judges.&lt;ref name="GarnerUsageDef0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blacks10thDef1" /&gt;
* Common law is not the product of "universal consent". Rather, the common law is often anti-majoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', No. 10 and 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, Alexander M. "The Least Dangerous Branch." Yale University Press; 2d Ed. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic principles of common law ==

=== Common law adjudication ===

In a common law jurisdiction several stages of research and analysis are required to determine "what the law is" in a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Kent Gionfriddo, Thinking Like a Lawyer: The Heuristics of Case Synthesis, 40 Texas Tech. L.Rev. 1 (Sep. 2007) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1012220] [https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1209]&lt;/ref&gt; First, one must ascertain the facts. Then, one must locate any relevant statutes and cases. Then one must extract the principles, analogies and statements by various courts of what they consider important to determine how the next court is likely to rule on the facts of the present case. Later decisions, and decisions of higher courts or legislatures carry more weight than earlier cases and those of lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, one integrates all the lines drawn and reasons given, and determines "what the law is". Then, one applies that law to the facts.

In practice, common law systems are considerably more complicated than the simplified system described above. The decisions of a court are binding only in a particular [[jurisdiction]], and even within a given jurisdiction, some courts have more power than others. For example, in most jurisdictions, decisions by [[appellate courts]] are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction, and on future decisions of the same appellate court, but decisions of lower courts are only non-binding persuasive authority. Interactions between common law, [[constitutional law]], [[statutory law]] and [[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]] also give rise to considerable complexity.

=== The common law evolves to meet changing social needs and improved understanding {{anchor|CL_Common_Law_Evolves}} ===
[[File:Holmes Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Oliver Wendell Holmes to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902.]]
[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] cautioned that "the proper derivation of general principles in both common and constitutional law ... arise gradually, in the emergence of a consensus from a multitude of particularized prior decisions."&lt;ref&gt;Frederic R. Kellog, Law, Morals, and Justice Holmes, 69 Judicature 214 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Cardozo|Justice Cardozo]] noted the "common law does not work from pre-established truths of universal and inflexible validity to conclusions derived from them deductively", but "[i]ts method is inductive, and it draws its generalizations from particulars".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 22–23 (1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

The common law is more malleable than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, to adapt to new trends in political, legal and [[social philosophy]]. Second, the common law evolves through a series of [[incrementalism|gradual steps]], that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects.&lt;ref&gt;The beneficial qualities of the common law's incrementalist evolution was most eloquently expressed by the future [[Lord Mansfield]], then Solicitor General Murray, in the case of ''Omychund v. Barker'', who contended that "a statute very seldom can take in all cases; therefore the common law, that works itself pure by rules drawn from the fountain of justice, is for that reason superior to an [[Act of Parliament|act of parliament]]." I Atk. 21, 33, 26 Eng. Rep. 15, 22–23 (Ch. 1744)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).

One example of the gradual change that typifies evolution of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule through most of the 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in [[privity of contract]]. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Winterbottom v. Wright'', 10 M&amp;W 109, 152 Eng.Rep. 402, 1842 WL 5519 (Exchequer of pleas 1842)&lt;/ref&gt; the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The ''Winterbottom'' court recognized that there would be "absurd and outrageous consequences" if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.

A first exception to this rule arose in 1852, in the case of ''[[Thomas v. Winchester]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/thomas_winchester.htm ''Thomas v. Winchester''], 6 N.Y. 397 (N.Y. 1852)&lt;/ref&gt; when New York's highest court held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb, and then selling the mislabeled poison through a dealer who would be expected to resell it, put "human life in imminent danger". ''Thomas'' relied on this reason to create an exception to the "privity" rule. In, 1909, New York held in ''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.''&lt;ref&gt;''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.'', 195 N.Y. 478, 480 (N.Y. 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; that a coffee urn manufacturer was liable to a person injured when the urn exploded, because the urn "was of such a character inherently that, when applied to the purposes for which it was designed, it was liable to become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed".

Yet the privity rule survived. In ''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'',&lt;ref&gt;''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'', 221 F. 801 (2nd Cir. 1915)&lt;/ref&gt; (decided in 1915 by the federal appeals court for New York and several neighboring states), the court held that a car owner could not recover for injuries from a defective wheel, when the automobile owner had a contract only with the automobile dealer and not with the manufacturer, even though there was "no question that the wheel was made of dead and ‘dozy‘ wood, quite insufficient for its purposes." The ''Cadillac'' court was willing to acknowledge that the case law supported exceptions for "an article dangerous in its nature or likely to become so in the course of the ordinary usage to be contemplated by the vendor". However, held the ''Cadillac'' court, "one who manufactures articles dangerous only if defectively made, or installed, e.g., tables, chairs, pictures or mirrors hung on the walls, carriages, automobiles, and so on, is not liable to third parties for injuries caused by them, except in case of willful injury or fraud,"
[[File:Cardozo Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Benjamin Cardozo to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1932.]]
Finally, in the famous case of ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916)[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1916, [[Benjamin Cardozo|Judge Benjamin Cardozo]] for New York's highest court pulled a broader principle out of these predecessor cases. The facts were almost identical to ''Cadillac'' a year earlier: a wheel from a wheel manufacturer was sold to Buick, to a dealer, to MacPherson, and the wheel failed, injuring MacPherson. Judge Cardozo held:

{{quote|It may be that Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. have extended the rule of Thomas v. Winchester. If so, this court is committed to the extension. The defendant argues that things imminently dangerous to life are poisons, explosives, deadly weapons—things whose normal function it is to injure or destroy. But whatever the rule in Thomas v. Winchester may once have been, it has no longer that restricted meaning. A scaffold (Devlin v. Smith, supra) is not inherently a destructive instrument. It becomes destructive only if imperfectly constructed. A large coffee urn (Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co., supra) may have within itself, if negligently made, the potency of danger, yet no one thinks of it as an implement whose normal function is destruction. What is true of the coffee urn is equally true of bottles of aerated water (Torgesen v. Schultz, 192 N. Y. 156). We have mentioned only cases in this court. But the rule has received a like extension in our courts of intermediate appeal. In Burke v. Ireland (26 App. Div. 487), in an opinion by CULLEN, J., it was applied to a builder who constructed a defective building; in Kahner v. Otis Elevator Co. (96 App. Div. 169) to the manufacturer of an elevator; in Davies v. Pelham Hod Elevating Co. (65 Hun, 573; affirmed in this court without opinion, 146 N. Y. 363) to a contractor who furnished a defective rope with knowledge of the purpose for which the rope was to be used. We are not required at this time either to approve or to disapprove the application of the rule that was made in these cases. It is enough that they help to characterize the trend of judicial thought.

We hold, then, that the principle of ''Thomas v. Winchester'' is not limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. ... There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.}}

Cardozo's new "rule" exists in no prior case, but is inferrable as a synthesis of the "thing of danger" principle stated in them, merely extending it to "foreseeable danger" even if "the purposes for which it was designed" were not themselves "a source of great danger". ''MacPherson'' takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure. Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle of ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright|Winterbottom]]'', that "absurd and outrageous consequences" must be avoided, and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above: "There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable." But while adhering to the underlying principle that ''some'' boundary is necessary, ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.|MacPherson]]'' overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary, that is, the privity formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons, totally irrelevant. Rather, the most important factor in the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing.

The example of the evolution of the law of negligence in the preceding paragraphs illustrates two crucial principles: (a) The common law evolves, this evolution is in the hands of judges, and judges have "made law" for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="SpeiserLawOfTorts" /&gt; (b) The [[ratio decidendi|reasons given for a decision]] are often more important in the long run than the outcome in a particular case. This is the reason that judicial opinions are usually quite long, and give rationales and policies that can be balanced with judgment in future cases, rather than the bright-line rules usually embodied in statutes.

=== Publication of decisions ===

All law systems rely on written publication of the law,&lt;ref name="BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil" /&gt; so that it is accessible to all. Common law decisions are published in [[law reports]] for use by lawyers, courts and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=148|title=Legal Dictionary – Law.com|work=Law.com Legal Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the American Revolution, Massachusetts became the first state to establish an official Reporter of Decisions. As newer states needed law, they often looked first to the Massachusetts Reports for authoritative precedents as a basis for their own common law.&lt;ref name="BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil"&gt;Social Law Library, Common Law or Civil Code?, Boston Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States federal courts relied on private publishers until after the Civil War, and only began publishing as a government function [[United States Reports#history|in 1874]]. [[West (publisher)|West Publishing in Minnesota]] is the largest private-sector publisher of law reports in the United States. Government publishers typically issue only decisions "in the raw," while private sector publishers often add indexing, editorial analysis, and similar finding aids.

=== Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law{{anchor|Interaction_with_statute}} ===

In common law legal systems, the common law is crucial to understanding almost all important areas of law. For example, in [[English law|England and Wales]], in English Canada, and in most states of the [[Law of the United States|United States]], the basic law of [[contract]]s, [[tort]]s and [[property law|property]] do not exist in statute, but only in common law (though there may be isolated modifications enacted by statute). As another example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1877,&lt;ref&gt;''Meister v. Moore'', 96 U.S. 76 (1877) ("No doubt a statute may take away a common law right, but there is always a presumption that the legislature has no such intention unless it be plainly expressed.")&lt;/ref&gt; held that a [[Michigan]] statute that established rules for [[solemnization]] of marriages did not abolish pre-existing [[common-law marriage]], because the statute did not affirmatively require statutory solemnization and was silent as to preexisting common law.

In almost all areas of the law (even those where there is a statutory framework, such as contracts for the sale of goods,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/ Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2, on Contracts for the Sales of Goods]&lt;/ref&gt; or the criminal law),&lt;ref&gt;[[Model Penal Code]] as adopted in several states, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/nycodes/c82.html New York's Penal Law]&lt;/ref&gt; legislature-enacted statutes generally give only terse statements of general principle, and the fine boundaries and definitions exist only in the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]]. To find out what the precise law is that applies to a particular set of facts, one has to locate [[precedent]]ial decisions on the topic, and reason from those decisions by [[analogy]].

In ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions (in the sense opposed to "civil law")]], legislatures operate under the assumption that [[statute]]s will be interpreted against the backdrop of the pre-existing common law. As the United States Supreme Court explained in ''United States v Texas'', 507 U.S. 529 (1993):

:Just as longstanding is the principle that "[s]tatutes which invade the common law ... are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident." ''Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson'', 343 U.S. 779, 783 (1952); ''Astoria Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino'', 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991). In such cases, Congress does not write upon a clean slate. ''Astoria'', 501 U.S. at 108. In order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must "speak directly" to the question addressed by the common law. ''Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham'', 436 U. S. 618, 625 (1978); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', 451 U. S. 304, 315 (1981).

For example, in most U.S. states, the criminal statutes are primarily codification of pre-existing common law. ([[Codification (law)|Codification]] is the process of enacting a statute that collects and restates pre-existing law in a single document—when that pre-existing law is common law, the common law remains relevant to the interpretation of these statutes.) In reliance on this assumption, modern statutes often leave a number of terms and fine distinctions unstated—for example, a statute might be very brief, leaving the precise definition of terms unstated, under the assumption that these fine distinctions will be inherited from pre-existing common law. (For this reason, many modern American law schools teach the common law of crime as it stood in England in 1789, because that centuries-old English common law is a necessary foundation to interpreting modern criminal statutes.)

With the transition from English law, which had common law crimes, to the new legal system under the [[U.S. Constitution]], which prohibited [[ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' laws]] at both the federal and state level, the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States. It was settled in the case of [[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']],&lt;ref name="USvHudson"&gt;[[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']], {{ussc|11|32|1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common law crimes, and that there must always be a (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.

Still, many states retain selected common law crimes. For example, in Virginia, the definition of the conduct that constitutes the crime of robbery exists only in the common law, and the robbery statute only sets the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson v. Commonwealth'', 209 Va. 291, 293, 163 S.E.2d 570, ___ (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Code of Virginia|Virginia Code]] section 1-200 establishes the continued existence and vitality of common law principles and provides that "The common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly."

By contrast to statutory codification of common law, some statutes displace common law, for example to create a new [[cause of action]] that did not exist in the common law, or to legislatively overrule the common law. An example is the [[tort]] of [[wrongful death]], which allows certain persons, usually a spouse, child or [[estate (law)|estate]], to sue for damages on behalf of the deceased. There is no such tort in English common law; thus, any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one. Where a wrongful death statute exists, the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute (typically, an upper limit on the amount of damages). Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowly—that is, limited to their precise terms—because the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of judge-made law unless such statute should violate some "second order" constitutional law provision (''cf''. [[judicial activism]]).

Where a tort is rooted in common law, all traditionally recognized damages for that tort may be sued for, whether or not there is mention of those [[damages]] in the current statutory law. For instance, a person who sustains bodily injury through the [[negligence]] of another may sue for medical costs, pain, suffering, loss of earnings or earning capacity, mental and/or emotional distress, loss of [[quality of life]], disfigurement and more. These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist in the tradition of common law. However, without a wrongful death statute, most of them are extinguished upon death.

In the United States, the power of the federal judiciary to review and invalidate unconstitutional acts of the federal executive branch is stated in the constitution, Article III sections 1 and 2: "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. ... The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority..." The first [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark decision]] on "the judicial power" was ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}. Later cases interpreted the "judicial power" of Article III to establish the power of federal courts to consider or overturn any action of Congress or of any state that conflicts with the Constitution.

The interactions between decisions of different courts is discussed further in the article on [[precedent]].

=== Overruling precedent—the limits of ''stare decisis'' ===
The [[Common law#United States federal system (1789 and 1938)|United States federal courts]] are divided into twelve regional circuits, each with a [[United States courts of appeals|circuit court of appeals]] (plus a thirteenth, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals in patent cases and cases against the federal government, without geographic limitation). Decisions of one circuit court are binding on the district courts within the circuit and on the circuit court itself, but are only persuasive authority on sister circuits. District court decisions are not binding precedent at all, only persuasive.

Most of the U.S. federal courts of appeal have adopted a rule under which, in the event of any conflict in decisions of panels (most of the courts of appeal almost always sit in panels of three), the earlier panel decision is controlling, and a panel decision may only be overruled by the court of appeals sitting ''en banc'' (that is, all active judges of the court) or by a higher court.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''South Corp. v. United States'', 690 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (''en banc'' in relevant part) (explaining order of precedent binding on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit); ''Bonner v. City of Prichard, Alabama'', 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (''en banc'') (after the Eleventh Circuit was split off from the Fifth Circuit, adopting precedent of Fifth Circuit as binding until overruled by the Eleventh Circuit ''en banc'': "The [pre-split] Fifth followed the absolute rule that a prior decision of the circuit (panel or ''en banc'') could not be overruled by a panel but only by the court sitting ''en banc''. The Eleventh Circuit decides in this case that it chooses, and will follow, this rule."); ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office).&lt;/ref&gt; In these courts, the older decision remains controlling when an issue comes up the third time.

Other courts, for example, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court, always sit ''en banc'', and thus the ''later'' decision controls. These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case, and older cases survive only to the extent they do not conflict with newer cases. The interpretations of these courts—for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes—are stable only so long as the older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. Older decisions persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right, and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.

In the jurisdictions of [[England and Wales]] and of [[Northern Ireland]], since 2009, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] has the authority to overrule and unify criminal law decisions of lower courts; it is the final court of appeal for civil law cases in all three of the UK jurisdictions but not for criminal law cases in Scotland. From 1966 to 2009, this [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|power]] lay with the [[House of Lords]], granted by the Practice Statement of 1966.&lt;ref&gt;83 Cr App R 191, 73 Cr App R 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's federal system, described [[Common law#CL Canada federal|below]], avoids regional variability of federal law by giving national jurisdiction to both layers of appellate courts.

=== Common law as a foundation for commercial economies ===

The reliance on judicial opinion is a strength of common law systems, and is a significant contributor to the robust commercial systems in the United Kingdom and United States. Because there is reasonably precise guidance on almost every issue, parties (especially commercial parties) can predict whether a proposed course of action is likely to be lawful or unlawful, and have some assurance of consistency. As [[Justice Brandeis]] famously expressed it, "in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right."&lt;ref&gt;''Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', 285 U.S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to predict gives more freedom to come close to the boundaries of the law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Yeo Tiong Min, "[http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html A Note on Some Differences in English Law, New York Law, and Singapore Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502093747/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html |date=2007-05-02 }}" (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many commercial contracts are more economically efficient, and create greater wealth, because the parties know ahead of time that the proposed arrangement, though perhaps close to the line, is almost certainly legal. Newspapers, taxpayer-funded entities with some religious affiliation, and political parties can obtain fairly clear guidance on the boundaries within which their [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] rights apply.

In contrast, in jurisdictions with very weak respect for precedent,&lt;ref&gt;for example, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] issues very few of its decisions in precedential form, Kate Gaudry &amp; Thomas Franklin, Only 1 in 20,631 ex parte appeals designated precedential by PTAB, IPWatchdog (Sep. 27, 2015), and various lower tribunals in the Patent Office give very weak respect to earlier superior decisions.&lt;/ref&gt; fine [[Question of law|questions of law]] are redetermined anew each time they arise, making consistency and prediction more difficult, and procedures far more protracted than necessary because parties cannot rely on written statements of law as reliable guides. In jurisdictions that do not have a strong allegiance to a large body of precedent, parties have less ''a priori'' guidance (unless the written law is very clear and kept updated) and must often leave a bigger "safety margin" of unexploited opportunities, and final determinations are reached only after far larger expenditures on legal fees by the parties.

This is the reason&lt;ref name="EisenbergMillerNewYork" /&gt; for the frequent choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts, even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York—and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States.&lt;ref name="EisenbergMillerNewYork"&gt;Theodore Eisenberg &amp; Geoffrey P. Miller, The Flight to New York: An Empirical Study of Choice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses in {{Sic|hide=y|Publicly|-}}Held Companies’ Contracts (2008). New York University Law and Economics Working Papers. Paper 124, http://lsr.nellco.org/nyu_lewp/124 (based on a survey of 2882 contracts, "New York law plays a role for major corporate contracts similar to the role Delaware law plays in the limited setting of corporate governance disputes. ... New York's dominance is striking. It is the choice of law in approximately 46 percent of contracts," and if merger contracts excluded, over half)&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial contracts almost always include a "choice of law clause" to reduce uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, contracts throughout the world (for example, contracts involving parties in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) often choose the law of New York, even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the United States' commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States. Similarly, American corporations are often formed under Delaware [[Corporations law|corporate law]], and American contracts relating to corporate law issues ([[Mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisitions]] of companies, rights of shareholders, and so on.) include a Delaware [[choice of law]] clause, because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller at 19–20 (Delaware is chosen in about 15% of contracts, "Delaware dominates for one type of contract—[merger] trust agreements. ... The dominance of Delaware for this specialized type of contract is apparently due to the advantages and flexibility which Delaware's business trust statute.")&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (for example, England and Wales, and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller at 19, only about 5% of commercial contracts designate California choice of law, where nearly 50% designate New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the United States, parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales, particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth. The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations, and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law to achieve that result.

Likewise, for litigation of commercial disputes arising out of unpredictable torts (as opposed to the prospective choice of law clauses in contracts discussed in the previous paragraph), certain jurisdictions attract an unusually high fraction of cases, because of the predictability afforded by the depth of decided cases. For example, [[London]] is considered the pre-eminent centre for litigation of [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-becomes-litigation-capital-of-the-world-1031231.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Richard | last=Osley | title=London becomes litigation capital of the world | date=2008-11-23}}. London is also forum for many defamation cases, because UK law is more plaintiff-friendly—in the United States, the First Amendment protection for freedom of the press allows for statements concerning public figures of questionable veracity, where in the UK, those same statements support a judgment for libel.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say that common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the legislature has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures—but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Taxpayer Advocate Service, 2008 Report to Congress, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/08_tas_arc_msp_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
The common law{{mdash}}so named because it was "common" to all the king's courts across England{{mdash}}originated in the practices of the courts of the English kings in the centuries following the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Prior to the Norman Conquest, much of England's legal business took place in the local folk courts of its various [[shires]] and [[Hundred (county division)|hundreds]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  A variety of other individual courts also existed across the land: urban boroughs and merchant fairs held their own courts, as did the [[University of Oxford|universities of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and large landholders also held their own manorial and seigniorial courts as needed.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Additionally, the [[Catholic Church]] operated its own court system that adjudicated issues of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}

The main sources for the history of the common law in the Middle Ages are the [[plea rolls]] and the [[Year Books]]. The plea rolls, which were the official court records for the Courts of Common Pleas and King's Bench, were written in Latin. The rolls were made up in bundles by law term: Hilary, Easter, Trinity, and Michaelmas, or winter, spring, summer, and autumn. They are currently deposited in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|the UK National Archives]], by whose permission images of the rolls for the Courts of Common Pleas, King's Bench, and Exchequer of Pleas, from the 13th century to the 17th, can be viewed online at the Anglo-American Legal Tradition site (The O'Quinn Law Library of the University of Houston Law Center).&lt;ref&gt;Documents from Medieval and Early Modern England from the National Archives in London.[http://aalt.law.uh.edu/]  Publications of the [[Selden Society]] include a Year Books series and other volumes transcribing and translating the original manuscripts of early common law cases and law reports, each volume having its editor's scholarly introduction.

The form of reasoning used in common law is known as [[casuistry]] or [[case-based reasoning]]. The common law, as applied in [[civil case]]s (as distinct from [[criminal case]]s), was devised as a means of [[damages|compensating]] someone for wrongful acts known as [[tort]]s, including both [[intentional tort]]s and torts caused by [[negligence]], and as developing the body of law recognizing and regulating [[contract]]s. The type of [[legal procedure|procedure]] practiced in common law courts is known as the [[adversarial system]]; this is also a development of the common law.

=== Medieval English common law ===

The early development of case-law in the thirteenth century has been traced to [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] ''On the Laws and Customs of England'' and led to the yearly compilations of court cases known as [[Year Books]], of which the first extant was published in 1268, the same year that Bracton died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Plucknett|T. F. T. Plucknett]], ''A Concise History of the Common Law, 5th edition, 1956, London and Boston, pp.260-261&lt;/ref&gt; The Year Books are known as the law reports of medieval England, and are a principal source for knowledge of the developing legal doctrines, concepts, and methods in the period from the 13th to the 16th centuries, when the common law developed into recognizable form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/law/faculty-scholarship/legal-history-the-year-books/ BUSL, ''Legal History: The Year Books'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of English and American Literature ''The Year Books and their Value''[http://www.bartleby.com/218/1309.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Westminster Hall edited.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Westminster Hall]] in the [[Palace of Westminster]], [[London]], early 19th century.]]

In 1154, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] became the first [[Plantagenet]] king. Among many achievements, Henry institutionalized common law by creating a unified system of law "common" to the country through incorporating and elevating local custom to the national, ending local control and peculiarities, eliminating arbitrary remedies and reinstating a [[jury]] system—citizens sworn on oath to investigate reliable criminal accusations and civil claims. The jury reached its [[verdict]] through evaluating common [[Traditional knowledge|local knowledge]], not necessarily through the presentation of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], a distinguishing factor from today's civil and criminal court systems.

Henry II developed the practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear the various disputes throughout the country. His judges would resolve disputes on an [[ad hoc]] basis according to what they interpreted the customs to be. The king's judges would then return to London and often discuss their cases and the decisions they made with the other judges. These decisions would be recorded and filed. In time, a rule, known as ''stare decisis'' (also commonly known as precedent) developed, whereby a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge; he was required to adopt the earlier judge's interpretation of the law and apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another. Once judges began to regard each other's decisions to be binding precedent, the pre-Norman system of local customs and law varying in each locality was replaced by a system that was (at least in theory, though not always in practice) common throughout the whole country, hence the name "common law".

Henry II's creation of a powerful and unified court system, which curbed somewhat the power of [[canon law|canonical]] (church) courts, brought him (and England) into conflict with the church, most famously with [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The murder of the Archbishop gave rise to a wave of popular outrage against the King. Henry was forced to repeal the disputed laws and to abandon his efforts to hold church members accountable for secular crimes (see also [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]).

The English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] was established after [[Magna Carta]] to try lawsuits between commoners in which the monarch had no interest. Its judges sat in open court in the Great Hall of the king's [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Palace of Westminster]], permanently except in the vacations between the four terms of the [[Legal year]].

Judge-made common law operated as the primary source of law for several hundred years, before [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] acquired legislative powers to create [[statutory law]]. It is important to understand that common law is the older and more traditional source of law, and legislative power is simply a layer applied on top of the older common law foundation. Since the 12th century, courts have had parallel and co-equal authority to make law&lt;ref name="William Burnham 2006"&gt;William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul, Thomson West, 2006), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;—"legislating from the bench" is a traditional and essential function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute" /&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, "judges do and must legislate."&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate"&gt;''Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen'', 244 U.S. 205, 221 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; There are legitimate debates on how the powers of courts and legislatures should be balanced. However, the view that courts lack law-making power is historically inaccurate and constitutionally unsupportable.

In England, judges have devised a number of rules as to [[Mechanisms of the English common law|how to deal with precedent decisions]].

=== Influence of Roman law ===
The term "common law" is often used as a contrast to Roman-derived "civil law", and the fundamental processes and forms of reasoning in the two are quite different. Nonetheless, there has been considerable cross-fertilization of ideas, while the two traditions and sets of foundational principles remain distinct.

By the time of the rediscovery of the [[Roman law]] in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already developed far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., R. C. van Caenegem, ''The Birth of the English Common Law'' 89–92 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first common law scholars, most notably [[Ranulf de Glanvill|Glanvill]] and [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]], as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Peter Birks]], Grant McLeod, ''Justinian's Institutes'' 7 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first and throughout its history one of the most significant treatises of the common law, Bracton's ''De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae'' (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Institutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., George E. Woodbine (ed.), Samuel E. Thorne (transl.), ''Bracton on the Laws and Customs of England'', Vol. I (Introduction) 46 (1968); Carl Güterbock, ''Bracton and his Relation to the Roman Law'' 35–38 (1866).&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into ''[[in rem]]'' (typically, actions against a ''thing'' or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and ''[[in personam]]'' (typically, actions directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone's ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'',&lt;ref&gt;Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stein, ''Continental Influences on English Legal thought, 1600–1900'', ''in'' Peter Stein, ''The Character and Influence of the Roman Civil Law'' 223 ''et seq''. (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent [[unjust enrichment]]) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coke and Blackstone ===

The first attempt at a comprehensive compilation of centuries of common law was by Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], in his treatise, ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'' in the 17th century.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765–1769.

=== Propagation of the common law to the colonies and Commonwealth by reception statutes ===

{{anchor|CL_Reception_Statutes}}A [[reception statute]] is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent, by which the new nation adopts (i.e. receives) pre-independence common law, to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, and the precedent originating from it, as the default law, because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state. All U.S. states, with the partial exception of [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]], have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the common law by judicial opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of reception statutes in the United States, the states of the U.S., Canada and its provinces, and Hong Kong, are discussed in the [[reception statute]] article.

Yet, adoption of the common law in the newly-independent nation was not a foregone conclusion, and was controversial. Immediately after the American Revolution, there was widespread distrust and hostility to anything British, and the common law was no exception.&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt; Jeffersonians decried lawyers and their common law tradition as threats to the new republic. The Jeffersonians preferred a legislatively-enacted civil law under the control of the political process, rather than the common law developed by judges that—by design—were insulated from the political process. The Federalists believed that the common law was the birthright of Independence: after all, the natural rights to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" were the rights protected by common law. Even advocates for the common law approach noted that it was not an ideal fit for the newly-independent colonies: judges and lawyers alike were severely hindered by a lack of printed legal materials. Before Independence, the most comprehensive law libraries had been maintained by Tory lawyers, and those libraries vanished with the loyalist expatriation, and the ability to print books was limited. Lawyer (later president) John Adams complained that he "suffered very much for the want of books". To bootstrap this most basic need of a common law system—knowable, written law—in 1803, lawyers in Massachusetts donated their books to found a law library.&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt;  A Jeffersonian newspaper criticized the library, as it would carry forward "all the old authorities practiced in England for centuries back ... whereby a new system of jurisprudence [will be founded] on the high monarchical system [to] become the Common Law of this Commonwealth... [The library] may hereafter have a very unsocial purpose."&lt;ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /&gt;

=== Decline of Latin maxims and "blind imitation of the past", and adding flexibility to ''stare decisis'' {{Anchor|History_and_Holmes}} ===
Well into the 19th century, ancient maxims played a large role in common law adjudication. Many of these maxims had originated in Roman Law, migrated to England before the introduction of Christianity to the British Isles, and were typically stated in Latin even in English decisions. Many examples are familiar in everyday speech even today, "[[Nemo iudex in causa sua|One cannot be a judge in one's own cause]]" (see [[Dr. Bonham's Case]]), rights are reciprocal to obligations, and the like. Judicial decisions and treatises of the 17th and 18th centuries, such at those of Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], presented the common law as a collection of such maxims.

Reliance on old maxims and rigid adherence to precedent, no matter how old or ill-considered, came under critical discussion in the late 19th century, starting in the United States. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] in his famous article, "The Path of the Law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=10 |journal=Harvard Law Review |pages=457, 469 |year=1897|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2373|title=The Path of the Law|first=Oliver Wendell |last=Holmes, Jr.|doi=10.2307/1322028|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented, "It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past." Justice Holmes noted that study of maxims might be sufficient for "the man of the present", but "the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics". In an 1880 lecture at Harvard, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]] [https://archive.org/details/commonlaw00holmuoft O. W. Holmes, Jr., ''The Common Law'']&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow men, have had a good deal more to do than the [[:w:syllogism|syllogism]] in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the [[:w:axiom|axioms]] and corollaries of a book of mathematics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Louis Brandeis]], later appointed to the United States Supreme Court, became noted for his use of policy-driving facts and economics in [[Brandeis Brief|his briefs]], and extensive appendices presenting facts that lead a judge to the advocate's conclusion. By this time, briefs relied more on facts than on Latin maxims.

Reliance on old maxims is now deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;''Acree v. Republic of Iraq'', 370 F.3d 41 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Common law decisions today reflect both precedent and policy judgment drawn from economics, the social sciences, business, decisions of foreign courts, and the like. The degree to which these external factors ''should'' influence adjudication is the subject of active debate, but it is indisputable that judges ''do'' draw on experience and learning from everyday life, from other fields, and from other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roper v. Simmons]], 543 U.S. 551 (2005) (holding unconstitutional to impose capital punishment for crimes committed while under the age of 18, based on "evolving standards of decency", largely based on other nations' law)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity ===
&lt;!-- "Fusion of law and equity" redirects here. Please edit redirect if changing the name of this section header --&gt;
As early as the 15th century, it became the practice that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common law system would petition the King in person. For example, they might argue that an award of damages (at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land, and instead request that the trespasser be evicted. From this developed the system of [[Equity (law)|equity]], administered by the [[Lord Chancellor]], in the courts of [[Court of equity|chancery]]. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was established by the 17th century that equity should prevail.

In England, courts of law ([[Common law#Disambiguate equity|as opposed to equity]]) were combined with [[Court of equity|courts of equity]] by the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1873 and 1875, with equity prevailing in case of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Lobban, Michael "Preparing for Fusion: Reforming the Nineteenth-Century Court of Chancery, Part II | year=2004 | work=Law and History Review, 2004 (University of Illinois Press) . {{ISSN|0738-2480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, parallel systems of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] (providing money [[damages]], with cases heard by a jury upon either party's request) and equity (fashioning a remedy to fit the situation, including injunctive relief, heard by a judge) survived well into the 20th century. The [[United States federal courts]] procedurally separated law and equity: the same judges could hear either kind of case, but a given case could only pursue causes in law or in equity, and the two kinds of cases proceeded under different procedural rules. This became problematic when a given case required both money damages and injunctive relief. In 1937, the new [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] combined [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity into one form of action, the "civil action". Fed.R.Civ.P. {{frcp|2}}. The distinction survives to the extent that issues that were "[[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]" as of 1791 (the date of adoption of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]) are still subject to the right of either party to request a jury, and "equity" issues are decided by a judge.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.'', 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) ("[W]e [the U.S. Supreme Court] have understood that the right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right which existed under the English [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]] when the Amendment was adopted. In keeping with our longstanding adherence to this 'historical test,', we ask, first, whether we are dealing with a cause of action that either was tried at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law (as opposed to equity)]] at the time of the founding or is at least analogous to one that was. If the action in question belongs in the law category, we then ask whether the particular trial decision must fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance of the common-law right as it existed in 1791." citations and quotations omitted, holding that interpretation of the scope of a patent had no analogy in 1790, and is thus a question to be decided by a judge, not a jury)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Delaware]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Tennessee]] still have separate courts of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity, for example, the [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]]. In many [[U.S. state|states]] there are separate divisions for law and equity within one court.

=== Common law pleading and its abolition in the early 20th century ===

For centuries, through the 19th century, the common law recognized only specific [[Form of action|forms of action]], and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading (called a [[writ]]) to slot into exactly one of them: Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Special Assumpsit, General Assumpsit, Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case (or Trespass on the Case), and Ejectment.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Maitland, ''The Forms of Action at Common Law'', 1909, Lecture I, online [https://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/basis/maitland-formsofaction.asp] or John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common Law Pleading (1894) or [[James Barr Ames|Ames]], [[Joseph Chitty|Chitty]], [[Henry John Stephen|Stephen]], [[James Bradley Thayer|Thayer]] and other writers named in the preface of Perry's ''Common-law Pleading: its history and principles'' (Boston, 1897)[http://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/commonlawpleadin00perr.pdf] or [https://kateofgaia.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/handbook-of-common-law-pleadings1.pdf ''Handbook of Common Law Pleading, Koffler and Reppy, 1969, online'']&lt;/ref&gt; To initiate a lawsuit, a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements: correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole (pleading in the alternative was not permitted), and using specific "magic words" encrusted over the centuries. Under the old common law pleading standards, a suit by a ''pro se'' ("for oneself," without a lawyer) party was all but impossible, and there was often considerable procedural jousting at the outset of a case over minor wording issues.

One of the major reforms of the late 19th century and early 20th century was the abolition of common law pleading requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the remainder of the "common law" discussed in the rest of the article remained intact; all that was abolished were the highly technical requirements for language of the paper provided by the plaintiff to the defendant to initiate a case.&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff can initiate a case by giving the defendant "a short and plain statement" of facts that constitute an alleged wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 4, a complaint must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."&lt;/ref&gt; This reform moved the attention of courts from technical scrutiny of words to a more rational consideration of the facts, and opened access to justice far more broadly.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 1, civil procedure rules "should be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to common law systems ==

=== Civil law systems--comparisons and contrasts to common law{{anchor|Contrasts between common law and civil law systems}} ===
[[File:Corpus Iuris Civilis 02.jpg|thumb|A 16th century edition of ''Corpus Juris Civilis Romani'' (1583)]]

The main alternative to the common law system is the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, which is used in [[Continental Europe]], and most of the rest of the world.

==== Judicial decisions play only a minor role in shaping civil law ====
The primary contrast between the two systems is the role of written decisions and precedent.

In common law jurisdictions, nearly every case that presents a ''bona fide'' disagreement on the law is resolved in a written opinion. The legal reasoning for the decision, known as ''[[ratio decidendi]]'', not only determines the court's judgment between the parties, but also stands as precedent for resolving future disputes. In contrast, civil law decisions typically do not include explanatory opinions, and thus no precedent flows from one decision to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, H. Law, Liberty and the Constitution: A Brief History of the common Law (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;
In common law systems, a single decided case is binding [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]] to the same extent as statute or regulation, under the principle of ''stare decisis''. In contrast, in civil law systems, individual decisions have only advisory, not binding effect. In civil law systems, case law only acquires weight when a long series of cases use consistent reasoning, called ''[[jurisprudence constante]]''. Civil law lawyers consult case law to obtain their best prediction of how a court will rule, but comparatively, civil law judges are less bound to follow it.

For that reason, statutes in civil law systems are more comprehensive, detailed, and continuously updated, covering all matters capable of being brought before a court.&lt;ref&gt;''The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions'', Robbins Collection, University of California at Berkeley.[https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adversarial system vs. inquisitorial system ====
[[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|Common law systems]] tend to give more weight to separation of powers between the judicial branch and the executive branch. In contrast, civil law systems are typically more tolerant of allowing individual officials to exercise both powers.  One example of this contrast is the difference between the two systems in allocation of responsibility between prosecutor and adjudicator.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/constitutional-law/inquisitorial-and-adversarial-system-of-law-constitutional-law-essay.php|title=Inquisitorial And Adversarial System Of Law|website=lawteacher.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compass.port.ac.uk/UoP/file/c7ffec37-0632-475f-84ba-ae018a2f0f38/1/Types_of_law_IMSLRN.zip/page_10.htm|title=Types of Legal System: Adversarial v. Investigatory Trial Systems|first=|last=LangstoT|website=compass.port.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law courts usually use an [[adversarial system]], in which two sides present their cases to a neutral judge.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory" /&gt; In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, criminal proceedings proceed under an [[inquisitorial system]] in which an examining magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one side and then the other during the investigation phase.&lt;ref name="LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory" /&gt;

The examining magistrate then presents the dossier detailing his or her findings to the president of the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted. Therefore, the president of the bench's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.

The proceeding in the inquisitorial system is essentially by writing. Most of the witnesses would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but he or she will be free to change her or his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads guilty or not, a trial will be conducted. Unlike the adversarial system, the conviction and sentence to be served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together with the president of the trial bench, following their common deliberation.

There are many exceptions in both directions. For example, most proceedings before U.S. federal and state agencies are inquisitorial in nature, at least the initial stages (''e.g.'', a patent examiner, a social security hearing officer, and so on), even though the law to be applied is developed through common law processes.

==== Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems{{anchor|CL academic writings}} ====
The role of the legal academy presents a significant "cultural" difference between common law ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|connotation 2]]) and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions.  In both systems, treatises compile decisions and state overarching principles that (in the author's opinion) explain the results of the cases.  In neither system are treatises considered "law," but the weight given them is nonetheless quite different.

In common law jurisdictions, lawyers and judges tend to use these treatises as only "finding aids" to locate the relevant cases. In common law jurisdictions, scholarly work is seldom cited as authority for what the law is.&lt;ref&gt;At least in the U.S., practicing lawyers tend to use "law professor" or "law review article" as a pejorative to describe a person or work that is insufficiently grounded in reality or practicality—every young lawyer is admonished repeatedly by senior lawyers not to write "law review articles," but instead to focus on the facts of the case and the practical effects of a given outcome.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Justice Roberts noted the "great disconnect between the academy and the profession."&lt;ref&gt;A Conversation with Chief Justice Roberts, June 11, 2011 [https://www.c-span.org/video/?300203-1/conversation-chief-justice-roberts] at 30:30.&lt;/ref&gt; When common law courts rely on scholarly work, it is almost always only for factual findings, policy justification, or the [[Legal history|history and evolution of the law]], but the court's legal conclusion is reached through analysis of relevant statutes and common law, seldom scholarly commentary.

In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, courts give the writings of [[law school|law professors]] significant weight, partly because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief, sometimes no more than a paragraph stating who wins and who loses. The rationale had to come from somewhere else: the academy often filled that role.

==== Narrowing of differences between common law and civil law ====
The contrast between civil law and common law legal systems has become increasingly blurred, with the growing importance of [[jurisprudence]] (similar to [[case law]] but not binding) in civil law countries, and the growing importance of statute law and codes in common law countries.

Examples of common law being replaced by statute or codified rule in the United States include [[Common law offence#United States|criminal law]] (since 1812,&lt;ref name="USvHudson" /&gt; U.S. federal courts and most but not all of the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), [[commercial law]] (the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in the early 1960s) and procedure (the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in the 1930s and the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] in the 1970s). But note that in each case, the statute sets the general principles, but the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]] process determines the scope and application of the statute.

An example of convergence from the other direction is shown in the 1982 decision ''Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v Ministry of Health'' ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1982:335}}), in which the [[European Court of Justice]] held that questions it has already answered need not be resubmitted. This showed how a historically distinctly common law principle is used by a court composed of judges (at that time) of essentially civil law jurisdiction.

=== Other alternatives ===

The former [[Soviet Bloc]] and other Socialist countries used a [[Socialist law]] system.

Much of the [[Muslim world]] uses [[Sharia]] (also called [[Sharia|Islamic law]]).

== Common law legal systems in the present day ==
=== In jurisdictions around the world ===
The common law constitutes the basis of the legal systems of:
* [[Law of Australia|Australia]] (both federal and individual states),
* [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]],
* [[Belize]],
* Brunei,
* Canada (both [[Common law#CL Canada federal|federal]] and the [[Common law#CL Canada provinces|individual provinces]] (except Quebec)),
* the Caribbean jurisdictions of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahamas, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago,

* United States (both the [[Common law#CL United States federal|federal]] system and the individual [[Common law#CL United States|states]] (with the partial exception of [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]])),

and many other generally [[English-speaking countries]] or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (except the UK's [[Common law#CL Scotland|Scotland]], which is [[bijuridicial law|bijuridicial]], and [[Malta]]). Essentially, every country that was colonised at some time by England, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom uses common law except those that were formerly colonised by other nations, such as [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]] (which follows the [[bijuridicial law|law]] of France in part), South Africa and Sri Lanka (which follow [[Common law#CL Roman Dutch|Roman Dutch law]]), where the prior civil law system was retained to respect the [[civil rights]] of the local colonists. Guyana and Saint Lucia have mixed Common Law and Civil Law systems.

The remainder of this section discusses jurisdiction-specific variants, arranged chronologically.

=== Scotland{{anchor|CL Scotland}} ===
[[Scotland]] is often said to use the civil law system, but it has [[Scots law|a unique system]] that combines elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] with an element of its own common law long predating the [[Act of Union (1707)|Treaty of Union]] with England in 1707 (see [[Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages]]), founded on the customary laws of the tribes residing there. Historically, [[Scots Law|Scottish common law]] differed in that the use of ''precedent'' was subject to the courts' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a ''precedent'',&lt;ref&gt;Stair Memorial Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; and principles of [[natural justice]] and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law. From the 19th century, the Scottish approach to precedent developed into a ''stare decisis'' akin to that already established in England thereby reflecting a narrower, more modern approach to the application of case law in subsequent instances. This is not to say that the substantive rules of the common laws of both countries are the same although in many matters (particularly those of UK-wide interest) they are similar.

Scotland shares the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], with England, Wales and Northern Ireland for civil cases; the court's decisions are binding on the jurisdiction from which a case arises but only influential on similar cases arising in Scotland. This has had the effect of converging the law in certain areas. For instance, the modern UK [[negligence|law of negligence]] is based on ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', a case originating in Paisley, Scotland.

Scotland maintains a separate criminal law system from the rest of the UK, with the [[High Court of Justiciary]] being the final court for criminal appeals. The highest court of appeal in civil cases brought in Scotland is now the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (before October 2009, final appellate jurisdiction lay with the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/about/role-of-the-supreme-court.html|title=Role of The Supreme Court – The Supreme Court|first=The Supreme|last=Court|website=www.supremecourt.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
==== States of the United States (17th century on){{anchor|CL United States}} ====
The centuries-old authority of the common law courts in England to develop law case by case and to apply statute law&lt;ref name="William Burnham 2006" /&gt;—"legislating from the bench"— is a traditional function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution.&lt;ref name="GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute" /&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, "judges do and must legislate” (in the federal courts, only interstitially, in state courts, to the full limits of common law adjudicatory authority).&lt;ref name="HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate" /&gt;

===== New York (17th century) =====
The state of [[New York (state)|New York]], which also has a civil law history from its [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonial]] days, began a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete is known as the [[Field Code]] applying to [[civil procedure]]. The original colony of [[New Netherland]] was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the English captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|recaptured]] by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique in the history of the British Empire, the English imposed common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the [[patroon]] system of land holding, based on the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century. The influence of [[Roman-Dutch law]] continued in the colony well into the late 19th century. The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in New York continued on from the Dutch days.

===== Louisiana (1700s){{anchor|Louisiana (1700s)}} =====

Under [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana's codified system]], the [[Louisiana Civil Code]], private law—that is, [[substantive law]] between private sector parties—is based on principles of law from continental Europe, with some common law influences. These principles derive ultimately from [[Roman law]], transmitted through [[Law of France|French law]] and [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]], as the state's current territory intersects the area of North America colonized by Spain and by France. Contrary to popular belief, the Louisiana code does not directly derive from the [[Napoleonic Code]], as the latter was enacted in 1804, one year after the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. However, the two codes are similar in many respects due to common roots.

Louisiana's [[criminal law]] largely rests on English common law. Louisiana's [[administrative law]] is generally similar to the [[administrative Procedure Act (United States)|administrative law of the U.S. federal government]] and other U.S. states. Louisiana's [[procedural law]] is generally in line with that of other U.S. states, which in turn is generally based on the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

Historically notable among the Louisiana code's differences from common law is the role of property rights among women, particularly in inheritance gained by widows.

===== California (1850s) =====
The [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] has a system based on common law, but it has [[Codification (law)|codified]] the law in the manner of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. The reason for the enactment of the [[California Codes]] in the 19th century was to replace a pre-existing system based on Spanish civil law with a system based on common law, similar to that in most other states. California and a number of other [[Western United States|Western states]], however, have retained the concept of [[community property]] derived from civil law. The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common-law tradition, subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge-made common law. (Most notably, in the case ''[[Li v. Yellow Cab Co.]]'', 13 Cal.3d 804 (1975), the [[California Supreme Court]] adopted the principle of [[comparative negligence]] in the face of a [[California Civil Code]] provision codifying the traditional common-law doctrine of [[contributory negligence]].)

==== United States federal courts (1789 and 1938){{anchor|CL United States federal}} ====
[[File:Uscatitle11.jpg|thumb|USCA: some annotated volumes of the [[United States Code|official compilation]] and codification of federal statutes.]]

The United States federal government (as opposed to the states) has a variant on a common law system. [[United States federal courts]] only act as interpreters of statutes and the constitution by elaborating and precisely defining broad statutory language ([[Common law#Disambiguate statute|connotation 1(b)]] above), but, unlike state courts, do not act as an independent source of common law.

Before 1938, the federal courts, like almost all other common law courts, decided the law on any issue where the relevant legislature (either the U.S. Congress or state legislature, depending on the issue), had not acted, by looking to courts in the same system, that is, other federal courts, even on issues of state law, and even where there was no express grant of authority from Congress or the Constitution.

In 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64, 78] (1938), overruled earlier precedent,&lt;ref&gt;''Swift v. Tyson'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=41&amp;page=1 41 U.S. 1] (1842). In ''Swift'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] had held that federal courts hearing cases brought under their [[diversity jurisdiction]] (allowing them to hear cases between parties from different states) had to apply the statutory law of the states, but not the common law developed by state courts. Instead, the Supreme Court permitted the federal courts to make their own common law based on general principles of law. ''Erie v. Tompkins'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64] (1938). ''Erie'' overruled ''Swift v. Tyson'', and instead held that federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction had to use all of the same [[substantive law]] as the courts of the states in which they were located. As the ''Erie'' Court put it, there is no "general federal common law", the key word here being '''''general'''''. This history is elaborated in
[[federal common law]].&lt;/ref&gt; and held "There is no federal general common law," thus confining the federal courts to act only as interpreters of law originating elsewhere. ''E.g.'', ''Texas Industries v. Radcliff'', {{ussc|451|630|1981}} (without an express grant of statutory authority, federal courts cannot create rules of intuitive justice, for example, a right to contribution from co-conspirators). Post-1938, federal courts deciding issues that arise under state law are required to defer to state court interpretations of state statutes, or reason what a state's highest court would rule if presented with the issue, or to certify the question to the state's highest court for resolution.

Later courts have limited ''Erie'' slightly, to create a few situations where [[United States federal courts]] are permitted to create [[federal common law]] rules without express statutory authority, for example, where a federal rule of decision is necessary to protect uniquely federal interests, such as foreign affairs, or financial instruments issued by the federal government. ''See, e.g.'', ''[[Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|318|363|1943}} (giving federal courts the authority to fashion common law rules with respect to issues of federal power, in this case [[negotiable instrument]]s backed by the federal government); ''see also'' ''[[International News Service v. Associated Press]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=248&amp;page=215 248 U.S. 215] (1918) (creating a cause of action for misappropriation of "hot news" that lacks any statutory grounding); ''but see National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc.'', 105 F.3d 841, 843–44, 853 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting continued vitality of ''INS'' "hot news" tort under New York state law, but leaving open the question of whether it survives under federal law). Except on Constitutional issues, Congress is free to legislatively overrule federal courts' common law.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Boerne v. Flores'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=521&amp;invol=507 521 U.S. 507] (1997) (invalidating the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]], in which Congress had attempted to redefine the court's jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=451&amp;invol=304 451 U.S. 304] (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States executive branch agencies (1946) ====
Most executive branch agencies in the United States federal government have some adjudicatory authority. To greater or lesser extent, agencies honor their own precedent to ensure consistent results. Agency decision making is governed by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] of 1946.

For example, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] issues relatively few [[regulations]], but instead promulgates most of its substantive rules through [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]].

=== India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh (19th century and 1948){{anchor|CL India and Pakistan}} ===
The law of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are largely based on [[English law|English]] common law because of the long period of [[British Empire|British colonial influence]] during the period of the [[British India|British Raj]].

[[History of India|Ancient India]] represented a distinct tradition of law, and had an historically independent school of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', dating from 400 BCE and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', from 100 CE, were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'s central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in this period, which finally culminated in the creation of the [[Gupta Empire]], relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent. The appearance of similar fundamental institutions of international law in various parts of the world show that they are inherent in international society, irrespective of culture and tradition.{{sfn|Alexander|1952|pp=289–300}} Inter-State relations in the pre-Islamic period resulted in clear-cut rules of warfare of a high humanitarian standard, in rules of neutrality, of treaty law, of customary law embodied in religious charters, in exchange of embassies of a temporary or semi-permanent character.&lt;ref&gt;Viswanatha, S.T., ''International Law in Ancient India'', 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

When India became part of the [[British Empire]], there was a break in tradition, and Hindu and Islamic law were supplanted by the common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the failed [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion]] against the British in 1857, the [[British Parliament]] took over control of India from the [[British East India Company]], and [[British India]] came under the direct rule of [[the Crown]]. The British Parliament passed the [[Government of India Act 1858|Government of India Act of 1858]] to this effect, which set up the structure of British government in India.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |work = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1923 |accessdate = 2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It established in Britain the office of the [[Secretary of State for India]] through whom the Parliament would exercise its rule, along with a [[Council of India]] to aid him. It also established the office of the [[Governor-General of India]] along with an Executive Council in India, which consisted of high officials of the British Government. As a result, the present judicial system of the country derives largely from the British system and has little correlation to the institutions of the pre-British era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jain|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify-inline|date=August 2015}}

==== Post-partition India (1948){{anchor|CL India}} ====

Legislation first introduced by the British is still in effect in modified form today. During the drafting of the [[Indian Constitution]], laws from Ireland, the United States, Britain, and France were all synthesized to produce a refined set of Indian laws. Indian laws also adhere to the [[United Nations]] guidelines on [[human rights law]] and [[environmental law]]. Certain [[international trade law]]s, such as those on [[intellectual property]], are also enforced in India.

The exception to this rule is in the state of [[Goa]], annexed in stages in the 1960s through 1980s. In Goa, a Portuguese [[uniform civil code]] is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces and adoption.

=== Canada (1867){{anchor|CL Canada}} ===

[[Canadian law|Canada]] has separate federal and provincial legal systems. The division of [[jurisdiction]] between the federal and provincial Parliaments is specified in the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-5.html#anchorbo-ga:s_91-gb:s_91 Constitution Act, 1867], s. 91(10), (18)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canadian provincial law{{anchor|CL Canada provinces}} ====

Each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]] is considered a separate jurisdiction with respect to common law matters. As such, only the provincial legislature may enact legislation to amend private law. Each has its own procedural law, statutorily created provincial courts and superior trial courts with inherent jurisdiction culminating in the Court of Appeal of the province. This is the highest court in provincial jurisdiction, only subject to the Supreme Court of Canada in terms of appeal of their decisions. All but one of the provinces of [[Law of Canada|Canada]] use a common law system (the exception being [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]], which uses a French-heritage civil law system for issues arising within provincial jurisdiction, such as property ownership and contracts).

==== Canadian federal law{{anchor|CL Canada federal}} ====

Canadian Federal Courts operate under a separate system throughout Canada and deal with narrower subject matter than superior courts in provincial jurisdiction. They hear cases reserved for federal jurisdiction by the Canadian constitution, such as immigration, intellectual property, judicial review of federal government decisions, and admiralty. The [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] is the appellate level court in federal jurisdiction and hears cases in multiple cities, and unlike the United States, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal is not divided into appellate circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fca-caf.gc.ca/index_e.shtml |title=Federal Court of Appeal – Home |publisher=Fca-caf.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law is uniform throughout Canada. It is based on the constitution and federal statutory Criminal Code, as interpreted by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The administration of justice and enforcement of the criminal code are the responsibilities of the provinces.

Canadian federal statutes must use the terminology of both the common law and civil law for those matters; this is referred to as legislative bijuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/harmonization/bijurilex/aboutb-aproposb.html|title=Department of Justice – About Bijuralism|first=Government of Canada, Department of Justice, Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=canada.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nicaragua ===
[[Nicaragua]]'s legal system is also a mixture of the English Common Law and Civil Law.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} This situation was brought through the influence of British administration of the Eastern half of the [[Mosquito Coast]] from the mid-17th century until about 1894, the [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] period from about 1855 through 1857, USA interventions/occupations during the period from 1909 to 1933, the influence of USA institutions during the [[Somoza family]] administrations (1933 through 1979) and the considerable importation between 1979 and the present of USA culture and institutions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Israel (1948){{anchor|CL Israel}} ===
[[Israeli law|Israel]] has a common law legal system. Its basic principles are inherited from the law of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] and thus resemble those of British and American law, namely: the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|supreme court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lawofisrael.com/israeli-supreme-court-decisions | title=Supreme court decisions database}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reviewing and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions, as well as employing the adversarial system. One of the primary reasons that the [[Constitution of Israel|Israeli constitution]] remains [[unwritten constitution|unwritten]] is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the [[Knesset]] (which, following the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], holds near-unlimited power).{{sfn|Mahler|2004|p=126}}

=== Roman Dutch Common law{{anchor|CL Roman Dutch}} ===
[[Roman Dutch law|Roman Dutch Common law]] is a bijuridical or mixed system of law similar to the common law system in [[Scotland]] and [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]]. Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions include [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[Namibia]], [[Swaziland]], [[Sri-Lanka]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Many of these jurisdictions recognise customary law, and in some, such as South Africa the Constitution requires that the common law be developed in accordance with the Bill of Rights. Roman Dutch common law is a development of [[Roman Dutch law]] by courts in the Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions. During the Napoleonic wars the Kingdom of the Netherlands adopted the French ''code civil'' in 1809, however the Dutch colonies in the Cape of Good Hope and Sri Lanka, at the time called Ceylon, were seized by the British to prevent them being used as bases by the French Navy. The system was developed by the courts and spread with the expansion of British colonies in Southern Africa. Roman Dutch common law relies on legal principles set out in Roman law sources such as Justinian's Institutes and Digest, and also on the writing of Dutch jurists of the 17th century such as [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]] and [[Johannes Voet|Voet]]. In practice, the majority of decisions rely on recent precedent.

=== Ghana ===
Ghana follows the English common-law&lt;ref&gt;The common law as used in this paper designates the English common-law as a legal tradition which is made up of law (generally referred to as the common law), and the doctrine of equity.&lt;/ref&gt; tradition which was inherited from the British during her colonisation. Consequently, the laws of Ghana are, for the most part, a modified version of imported law that is continuously adapting to changing socio-economic and political realities of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Obiri-Korang P "Private international law of contract in Ghana: the need for a paradigm shift" (2017) P 8; Quansah ''The Ghana Legal System'' (2011) P 51&lt;/ref&gt; The Bond of 184&lt;ref&gt;The Bond was a pact between the British and some chiefs from the southern states of the Gold Coast under which British protection was extended to the signatories in exchange for judicial authority over them.&lt;/ref&gt; 4 was the first most important event in the history of Ghana (then Gold Coast) that marked the critical period when the people ceded their independence to the British&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Benion ''The Constitutional Law of Ghana'' (1962). Boahen, however, submits that the Bond of 1844 is not as important as held by some Ghanaian historians. He further posits that it cannot be the Mgna Carta of Ghana or the basis for British rule or law – see Boahen ''Ghana: Evolution and Change in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century'' (1975) 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave the British judicial authority. Later, the Supreme Court Ordinance of 1876 “formally” introduced British law, be it the common law or statutory law, in the Gold Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Asante “Over a hundred years of a national legal system in Ghana: a review and critique” 1988 ''Journal of African Law'' 31 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14&lt;ref&gt;This states that “the common law, the doctrines of equity, and Statutes of general application which were in force in England at the date when the colony obtained a local legislature, that is to say, on the 24th of July 1874, shall be in force within the jurisdiction of the court”.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ordinance formalised the application of the common-law tradition in the country.

Ghana, after independence, did not do away with the common law system inherited from the British, and today it has been enshrined in the 1992 Constitution of the country. Chapter four of Ghana's Constitution, entitled “The Laws of Ghana”, has in Article 11(1) the list of laws applicable in the state. This comprises (a) the Constitution; (b) enactments made by or under the authority of the Parliament established by the Constitution; (c) any Orders, Rules and Regulations made by any person or authority under a power conferred by the Constitution; (d) the existing law; and (e) the common law.&lt;ref&gt;According to Article 11(2) of Ghana’s Constitution, the common law of Ghana shall comprise the rule of law generally known as the common law, the rules generally known as the doctrine of equity and the rules of customary law, including those determined by the Superior Court of Judicature.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the modern-day Constitution of Ghana, like those before it, embraced the English common law by entrenching it in its provisions. The doctrine of judicial precedence which is based on the principle of ''stare decisis'' as applied in England and other pure common law countries also applies in Ghana.

[[File:WilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir William Blackstone]] as illustrated in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.]]
[[Edward Coke]], a 17th-century Lord Chief Justice of the English Court of Common Pleas and a [[Member of Parliament]], wrote several legal texts that collected and integrated centuries of case law. Lawyers in both England and America learned the law from his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Institutes]]'' and ''Reports'' until the end of the 18th century. His works are still cited by common law courts around the world.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765–1769. Since 1979, a facsimile edition of that first edition has been available in four paper-bound volumes. Today it has been superseded in the English part of the United Kingdom by [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] that covers both common and statutory English law.

While he was still on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], and before being named to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] published a short volume called ''[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]]'', which remains a classic in the field. Unlike Blackstone and the Restatements, Holmes' book only briefly discusses what the law ''is''; rather, Holmes describes the common law ''process''. Law professor [[John Chipman Gray]]'s ''The Nature and Sources of the Law'', an examination and survey of the common law, is also still commonly read in [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]].

In the United States, [[Restatement of the Law|Restatements]] of various subject matter areas (Contracts, Torts, Judgments, and so on.), edited by the [[American Law Institute]], collect the common law for the area. The ALI Restatements are often cited by American courts and lawyers for propositions of uncodified common law, and are considered highly persuasive authority, just below binding precedential decisions. The [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] is an encyclopedia whose main content is a compendium of the common law and its variations throughout the various state jurisdictions.

Scots ''common law'' covers matters including murder and theft, and has sources in custom, in legal writings and previous court decisions. The legal writings used are called ''Institutional Texts'' and come mostly from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Examples include Craig, ''Jus Feudale'' (1655) and Stair, ''The Institutions of the Law of Scotland'' (1681).

For example, the [[Maine]] Criminal Code holds that "Conduct that the person believes to be necessary to avoid imminent physical harm to that person or another is justifiable if the desirability and urgency of avoiding such harm outweigh, according to ordinary standards of reasonableness, the harm sought to be prevented by the statute defining the crime charged. The desirability and urgency of such conduct may not rest upon considerations pertaining to the morality and advisability of such statute."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/17-a/title17-Asec103.html|title=§103.

The '''Constitutional Court''' ({{lang-th|ศาลรัฐธรรมนูญ}}, {{RTGS|''San Ratthathammanun''}}, {{IPA-th|sǎːn rát.tʰā.tʰām.mā.nūːn|pron}}) is an independent [[Thailand|Thai]] [[constitutional court|court]] founded under the [[Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] with jurisdiction over the [[constitutionality]] of parliamentary acts, royal decrees, draft legislation, as well as the appointment and removal of public officials and issues regarding political parties. The current court was established by the [[2007 Constitution of Thailand|2007 Constitution]] and is part of the [[Judiciary of Thailand|judicial branch]] of the Thai national government.

The court, along with the 1997 Constitution, was dissolved and replaced by a Constitutional Tribunal in 2006 following the [[2006 Thai coup d'état|coup d'État]]. While the Constitutional Court had [[#1997 Constitution|15 members]], 7 from the judiciary and 8 selected by a special panel, the Constitution Tribunal had [[#2006 Constitution|9 members]], all from the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015571 Nine Constitution Tribunal members] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231520/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015571 |date=26 September 2007 }}, 7 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A similar institution, consisting of [[#2007 Constitution|9 members]], was again established by the [[2007 Constitution of Thailand|2007 Constitution]].

The Constitutional Court has provoked much public debate, both regarding the court's jurisdiction and composition as well as the initial selection of justices. A long-standing issue has been the degree of control exerted by the judiciary over the court{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}.

The decisions of the court are final and inappealable. The decisions also bind every state organ, including the National Assembly, the Council of Ministers and other courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | script-title=th:ข้อกำหนดศาลรัฐธรรมนูญว่าด้วยวิธีพิจารณาและการทำคำวินิจฉัย พ.ศ. 2550 - ข้อ 55 วรรค 1 |trans-title=Constitutional Court Regulations on Procedure and Decision Making, BE 2550 (2007) - regulation 55, paragraph 1 | url = http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2550/A/096/14.PDF | language = Thai | publisher = Cabinet Secretariat | location = Bangkok | date = 2007-12-21 | accessdate = 2014-05-13 | page = 28 | issue = Volume 124, Part 96 A | journal = Government Gazette }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various versions of the court have made several significant decisions. These included the 1999 decision that deputy minister of agriculture [[Newin Chidchop]] could retain his cabinet seat after being sentenced to imprisonment for defamation, the 2001 acquittal of Thaksin Shinawatra for filing an incomplete statement regarding his wealth, with the [[National Anti-Corruption Commission]], the 2003 invalidation of [[Jaruvan Maintaka]] appointment as auditor-general, the 2007 dissolution of the [[Thai Rak Thai]] political party, and the 2014 removal of [[Prime minister of Thailand|prime minister]] [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] from office.

== Origins and controversy ==

[[File:Constitutional Court Thailand.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Former seat of the court at Lord Rattanathibet's Mansion on Chak Phet Road, [[Phra Nakhon District]], Bangkok.]]

=== Drafting of the 1997 Constitution ===

The creation of the Constitutional Court was the subject of much debate during the 1996-1997 drafting of the current [[Constitution of Thailand]].&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;James R. Klein, "The Battle for Rule of Law in Thailand: The Constitutional Court of Thailand", [http://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/ThaiUpdate_Klien_ConCourt%20Apr03.pdf PDF] and {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320070648/http://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/ThaiUpdate_Klien_ConCourt%20Apr03.pdf |date=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior judges rigorously opposed the concept on the grounds that constitutional and judicial review should remain the prerogative of the Supreme Court and that a constitutional court would create a fourth branch of government more powerful than the judiciary, legislature, or executive. Judges stated their fear over political interference in the selection and impeachment of judges. The Constitution Drafting Assembly eventually made several concessions regarding the composition and powers of the Court.

==== Jurisdiction ====

The Constitution did not give the Constitutional Court the authority to overrule a final judgment of the Supreme Court. An affected party, or a court, could request the opinion from the Constitutional Court if they believed a case involved a constitutional issue. The court where the initial action was pending would stay its proceedings until the Constitutional Court issued its decision. Constitutional Court decisions would have no retroactive effect on previous decisions of the regular courts.

The Constitution also did not give the Constitutional Court the authority to rule on any case in which the Constitution did not specifically delegate an agency the power to adjudicate.

==== Impeachment ====
The Constitution allowed individual justices to be the subject of impeachment proceedings with the vote of one fourth of the members of the House or with 50,000 approval of petitioners. A vote of three fifths of the Senate is required for impeachment. Earlier drafts had required votes of only 10% of the combined House and Senate to call for a vote of impeachment, and votes of three fifths of the combined Parliament to dismiss a justice.

==== Appointment ====
The Constitution gave the judiciary a strong influence over the composition of the Constitutional Court. Originally, the Court was to have 9 justices comprising six legal experts and three political science experts. A panel of 17 persons would propose 18 names from which Parliament would elect the 9 justices. The panel president would be the president of the Supreme Court, the panel itself would have included 4 political party representatives. The CDA finally compromised and allowed 7 of the justices to be selected by the judiciary, while the remaining 8 justices would be selected by the Senate from a list of Supreme Court nominees.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The appointment of the first Constitutional Court following the promulgation of the constitution in 1997 was 4-month controversy pitting the Senate against the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt; A key issue was the Senate's authority to review the backgrounds of judicial nominees and reject nominees deemed inappropriate or unqualified.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==== Appointment of Amphorn Thongprayoon ====

After receiving the Supreme Court's list of nominees, the Senate created a committee to review the nominees' credentials
and backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt; On 24 November 1997, the Senate voted to remove the name of Supreme
Court vice-president [[Amphorn Thongprayoon]], on the grounds that his credentials were dubious and on allegations that he had defaulted on 3 million [[baht|THB]] in debt. The Supreme Court was furious, arguing the Constitution did not empower the Senate to do background checks or to reject Supreme Court nominees. The Supreme Court requested a ruling from the Constitutional Tribunal chaired by the House speaker. On 8 January 1998, in a 6:3 vote, the Tribunal ruled the Senate did ''not'' have the authority to do background checks or reject the Supreme Court's nominees. The Tribunal ruled that the Senate's review powers were limited to examining the records of the nominees and electing half of those nominees for appointment.

Immediately after the Supreme Court had filed its request to the Tribunal, Justice Amphorn withdrew his name. After the Tribunal's ruling, the Supreme Court elected justice [[Jumpol na Songkhla]] on 9 January 1998 to replace Amphorn. The Senate ignored the Tribunal's ruling and proceeded to review Jumphol’s background and delayed a vote to accept his nomination for 7 days so that the Senate evaluate Jumphol. Finding no problems, the Senate proceeded to acknowledge his appointment to the Court on 23 January 1998.

==== Appointment of Ukrit Mongkolnavin ====

The appointment of former Senate and Parliament president [[Ukrit Mongkolnavin]] was especially problematic.&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt; The Senate had initially elected Ukrit from the list of ten legal specialists nominated by the selection panel, despite claims from democracy activists that Ukrit was unqualified to guard the constitution because he had served dictators while president of Parliament under the 1991-1992 military government of the [[National Peace Keeping Council|National Peacekeeping Council]].

Stung by the Senate rejection of Amphorn Thongprayoon, the two Bangkok Civil Court judges, [[Sriampron Salikhup]] and [[Pajjapol Sanehasangkhom]], petitioned the Constitutional Tribunal to disqualify Ukrit on a legal technicality. They argued that Ukrit only had an honorary [[professorship]] at [[Chulalongkorn University]], while the 1997 Constitution specifically specifies that a nominee, if not meeting other criteria, must be at least a [[professor]]. Echoing the Senate's rejection of Amphorn, the judges also alleged that Ukrit was involved in a multi-million baht lawsuit over a [[golf course]]. On 10 January 1998 the Tribunal ruled that the judges were not affected parties and therefore they had no right to request a ruling. Nevertheless, the Parliament president invoked his power as chairman of the Tribunal to ask the Senate to reconsider Ukrit's nomination.

On 19 January 1998, the Senate reaffirmed Ukrit's qualifications, noting that his professorship was special only because he was not a government official. Under [[Chulalongkorn University|Chulalongkorn]]'s regulations, he had the academic status of a full professor.

This position inflamed activists and the judiciary, and prompted the Parliament president on 21 January to invoke his authority under Article 266 of the 1997 Constitution to order the Constitutional Tribunal to consider the issue. On 8 February, in a 4:3 vote, the Tribunal ruled that Ukrit's special professorship did ''not'' qualify him for a seat in the Constitutional Court. The Tribunal noted that Chulalongkorn criteria for honorary professor were different from their criteria for academic professors, as intended by the Constitution. The Senate ended up electing [[Komain Patarapirom]] to replace Ukrit.

{{main|Rulings of the Constitutional Court of Thailand}}

=== Chuan-government emergency decrees during the 1997 economic crisis ===

==== Unconstitutionality of emergency economic decrees ====

In its very first decision, the Court ruled on the constitutionality of four emergency executive decrees issued by the [[Chuan Leekpai|Chuan]] government to deal with the [[Asian financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt; The government had issued the decrees in early May 1998 to expand the role of the [[Financial Restructuring Authority, Thailand|Financial Restructuring Authority]] and the [[Assets Management Corporation, Thailand|Assets Management Corporation]], to settle the debts of the [[Financial Institutions Development Fund]] through the issue of 500 billion THB in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and to authorize the [[Ministry of Finance (Thailand)|ministry of finance]] to seek 200 billion THB in overseas loans. The opposition [[New Aspiration Party]] (NAP) did not have the votes to defeat the bills, and therefore, on the last day of debate, invoked Article 219 of the Constitution to question the constitutionality of an emergency decree.

The NAP argued that since there was no emergency nor necessary urgency (under Article 218(2)), the government could not issue any emergency decrees. Article 219, however, specifically notes the constitutionality of an emergency decree can be questioned only on Article 218(1) concerning the maintenance of national or public safety, national economic security, or to avert public calamity. The government, fearing further economic damage if the decree were delayed, opposed the Court's acceptance of the complaint, as the opposition clearly had failed to cite the proper constitutional clause. The Court wished to set a precedent, however, demonstrating it would accept petitions under Article 219, even if technically inaccurate. Within a day it ruled that it was obvious to the general public that the nation was in an economic crisis, and that the decrees were designed to assist with national economic security in accordance with Article 218(1). The decrees were later quickly approved by Parliament.

The NAP's last minute motion damaged its credibility, and made it unlikely that Article 219 will be invoked unless there is a credible issue and the issue is raised and discussed at the beginning of parliamentary debate, rather than at the last-minute before a vote.

On the other hand, a precedent was established by the Court that it would accept all petitions under Article 219 to preserve Parliament's right to question the constitutionality of emergency executive decrees.

==== Treaty status of IMF letters of intent ====

The NAP later filed impeachment proceedings with the [[National Anti-Corruption Commission (Thailand)|National Anti-Corruption Commission]] (NACC) against prime minister Chuan Leekpai and the minister of finance [[Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda]] for violation of the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt; The NAP argued that the [[letter of intent]] that the government signed with the [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund (IMF)]] to secure emergency financial support was a [[treaty]], and that Article 224 of the Constitution stipulated that the government must receive prior consent from Parliament to enter a treaty.

The NACC determined the issue concerned a constitutional interpretation and petitioned the Constitutional Court for an opinion. The Court ruled the IMF letters were not treaties, as internationally defined, because they were unilateral documents from the Thai government with no rules for enforcement or provisions for penalty. Moreover, the IMF itself had worded the letters in a way that stated that the letters were not [[contractual agreement]]s.

=== Appointment of Jaruvan Maintaka as auditor-general ===

On 24 June 2003, a petition was filed with the Constitutional Court seeking its decision on the constitutionality of Jaruvan Maintaka’s appointment by the Senate as auditor-general. Jaruvan was one of three nominees for the position of auditor-general in 2001, along with Prathan Dabpet and Nontaphon Nimsomboon. Prathan received 5 votes from the 8-person State Audit Commission (SAC) chairman while Jaruvan received 3 votes. According to the constitution, State Audit Commission chairman Panya Tantiyavarong should have submitted Prathan's nomination to the Senate, as he received the majority of votes. However, on 3 July 2001, the SAC chairman submitted a list of all three candidates for the post of auditor-general to the Senate, which later voted to select Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka.

The Constitutional Court ruled on 6 July 2004 that the selection process that led to the appointment of Jaruvan as auditor-general was unconstitutional. The Court noted that the Constitution empowers the SAC to nominate only one person with the highest number of votes from a simple majority, not three as had been the case. The court stopped short of saying if she had to leave her post.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070824163056/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p3.php Chronology of events in the auditor-general’s deadlock, The Nation 30 August 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the Constitutional Court had ruled on 4 July 2002 that the then [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]] chairman [[Sirin Thoopklam]]’s election to the body was unconstitutional, the president of the Court noted "when the court rules that the selection [process] was unconstitutional and has to be redone, the court requires the incumbent to leave the post".&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/02/politics/politics_30005477.php "Jaruvan again in eye of the storm"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312004821/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/02/politics/politics_30005477.php |date=12 March 2007 }}, 2 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Jaruwan refused to resign without a royal dismissal from king Bhumibol Adulyadej. She noted "I came to take the position as commanded by a royal decision, so I will leave the post only when directed by such a decision."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070824163322/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p26.php Jaruvan waits for royal word, Nation 9 September 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The State Audit Commission later nominated Wisut Montriwat, former deputy permanent secretary of the ministry of finance, for the post of auditor-general. The Senate approved the nomination on 10 May 2005. However, king Bhumibol Adulyadej, in an unprecedented move, withheld his royal assent. The National Assembly did not hold a vote to overthrow the royal veto. In October 2005 the Senate rejected a motion to reaffirm her appointment, and instead deferred the decision to the SAC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p53.php Senate steers clear of motion on Jaruvan, The Nation, 11 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 2006 the State Audit Commission (SAC) decided to reinstate auditor-general Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka. Its unanimous decision came after it received a memo from the office of king [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]’s principal private secretary, advising that the situation be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150627145651/http://bangkokpost.net/News/05May2006_news01.php Poll booths 'the decider', Bangkok Post Friday 5 May 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy led many to [[Bhumibol Adulyadej#Royal powers|reinterpret the political and judicial role of the king in Thailand's constitutional monarchy]].

=== Thaksin Shinawatra's alleged conflicts of interest ===
In February 2006, 28 Senators submitted a petition to the Constitutional Court calling for the prime minister's impeachment for conflicts of interest and improprieties in the sell-off of Shin Corporation under Articles 96, 216 and 209 of the Thai constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua, [http://english.people.com.cn/200607/29/eng20060729_287811.html Students submit voters petition to impeach Thai PM], 29 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Senators said the prime minister violated the Constitution and was no longer qualified for office under Article 209. However, the Court rejected the petition on 16 February, with the majority judges saying the petition failed to present sufficient grounds to support the prime minister's alleged misconduct.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9015">On March 15, 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]] presented a speech to the United States Congress in which he extolled four basic consumer rights, later called the '''Consumer Bill of Rights'''. The United Nations through the [[United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection]] expanded these into eight rights, and thereafter [[Consumers International]] adopted these rights as a charter and started recognizing March 15 as World Consumer Rights Day.

==Background==
Before the mid-twentieth century, consumers had limited rights with regard to their interaction with products and commercial producers. Consumers had limited ground on which to defend themselves against faulty or defective products, or against misleading or deceptive advertising methods.

The [[consumer movement]] began to gather a following, pushing for increased rights and legal protection against malicious business practices. By the end of the 1950s, legal [[product liability]] had been established in which an aggrieved party need only prove injury by use of a product, rather than bearing the burden of proof of corporate negligence.

[[Helen Ewing Nelson]] was a drafter of the Consumer Bill of Rights and sought an outlet for distributing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-09-04/features/1995247035_1_helen-nelson-consumer-movement-consumer-rights |title=Pioneer fights on for consumer safety - Baltimore Sun |first=Rebecca |last=Smith |work=articles.baltimoresun.com |date=4 September 1995 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelsoninterview"&gt;{{Citation |last=Shearer |first=Julie |year=1977–1979 |title=Pat Brown - Friends and Campaigners |publisher=[[Regional Oral History Office]] |publication-place=[[Berkeley, California]] |page= |url=https://archive.org/stream/patbrownfriends00rfryrich/patbrownfriends00rfryrich_djvu.txt |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.consumer-action.org/press/articles/helen_nelson_1913_2005 |title=Helen Nelson (1913-2005) will be greatly missed by the consumer movement |first= |last= |publisher=[[Consumer Action]] |work=consumer-action.org |date=23 March 2005 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Kennedy's election campaign he made a promise to support consumers.&lt;ref name="Nelsoninterview"/&gt; After his election, [[Fred Dutton]], a colleague of Nelson's and a government officer who advised the president, asked for Nelson's suggestions on how the president could support consumers, and she sent him the Consumer Bill of Rights.&lt;ref name="Nelsoninterview"/&gt; Kennedy presented those rights in a speech to Congress on March 15, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=9108 |title=John F. Kennedy: Special Message to the Congress on Protecting the Consumer Interest. |first=John F. |last=Kennedy |authorlink=John F. Kennedy |work=presidency.ucsb.edu |date=March 15, 1962 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that speech he named four basic rights of consumers.

== Some of the Rights ==

===The right to safety===
The assertion of this right is aimed at the defense of consumers against injuries caused by products other than automobile vehicles, and implies that products should cause no harm to their users if such use is executed as prescribed. The right was further formalized in 1972 by the US federal government through the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC). This organization has jurisdiction over thousands of commercial products, and powers that allow it to establish performance standards and require product testing and warning labels.

===The right to be informed===
This right states that businesses should always provide consumers with enough appropriate information to make intelligent and informed product choices. Product information provided by a business should always be complete and truthful. Aiming to achieve protection against misleading information in the areas of financing, advertising, labeling, and packaging, the right to be informed is protected by several pieces of legislation passed between 1960 and 1980.

Some of the legislation which was made because of the assertion of this right include the following:
*[[Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (US)]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of business and finance|year=2007|publisher=Thomson/Gale|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0028660615|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-1552100067.html |edition=2.|last1=Lush |first1=Mary |last2=Hinton |first2=Val |editor=Burton S. Kalisk |chapter=Consumer Bill of Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wholesome Meat Act]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"/&gt;
*[[Truth in Lending Act]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"/&gt;
*[[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"/&gt;

===The right to choose===
The right to free choice among product offerings states that consumers should have a variety of options provided by different companies from which to choose. The federal government has taken many steps to ensure the availability of a healthy environment open to competition through legislation including limits on concept ownership through [[Patent Law|patent law]], prevention of monopolistic business practices through [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust legislation]], and the outlaw of price cutting and [[Price gouging|gouging]].

===The right to be heard===
This right has the ability of consumers to voice complaints and concerns about a product in order to have the issue handled efficiently and responsively. While no federal agency is tasked with the specific duty of providing a forum for this interaction between consumer and producer, certain outlets exist to aid consumers if difficulty occurs in communication with an aggrieving party. State and federal [[Attorney General|attorneys general]] are equipped to aid their constituents in dealing with parties who have provided a product or service in a manner unsatisfactory to the consumer in violation of an applicable law. Also, the [[Better Business Bureau]] is a national [[non-governmental]] organization whose sole agenda is to provide political lobbies and action on behalf of aggrieved consumers.

==Expansion to eight rights==
In 1985, the concept of consumer rights was endorsed by the United Nations through the [[United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection]], which expands them to include eight basic rights.

===The right to satisfaction of basic needs===
This right demands that people have access to basic, essential goods and services: adequate food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, public utilities, water, and sanitation

===The right to redress===
The right to redress provides for consumers to receive a fair settlement of just claims, including compensation for misrepresentation, shoddy goods, or unsatisfactory services. For example, a consumer should be able to go to consumer court against mobile phone companies that put hidden charges on the bill that were not previously explained, or activate ringtones without the consumer's permission.

===The right to consumer education===
The right to consumer education states that consumers should be able to acquire knowledge and skills needed to make informed, confident choices about goods and services, while being aware of basic consumer rights and responsibilities and how to act on them.

===The right to a healthy environment===
This is the right to live and work in a work space or home that is non-threatening to the well-being of present and future generations.

==World Consumer Rights Day==
The [[NGO]] [[Consumers International]] adopted the eight rights and restated them as a charter.&lt;ref name="consumersinternational"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumersinternational.org/who-we-are/consumer-rights|title=Consumers International - Who we are - consumer rights|publisher=consumersinternational.org|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the organization began recognizing the date of Kennedy's speech, March 15, as World Consumer Rights Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-guest/jfk-consumer-rights_b_1347471.html |title=Jim Guest: Fighting for Consumer Rights, Fifty Years After Kennedy's Call |first=Jim |last=Guest |authorlink=James A. Guest |work=huffingtonpost.com |date=15 March 2012 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom provisions==
As of May 2014, the UK Government has introduced proposed legislation before Parliament. The bill is the "Consumer Rights Bill", and it will consolidate and develop Unfair Contract Terms provisions and Consumer Protection provisions.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/areas/consumer_rights.htm|title=Consumer Rights - Law Commission|publisher=lawcommission.justice.gov.uk|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Criminal Justice Act 1953''' ({{lang-ms|Akta Keadilan Jenayah 1953}}) is a [[Malaysia]]n law which enacted relating to penal servitude, methods of imprisonment and whipping; and for purposes connected therewith.

Section 3 provides that a sentence of [[life imprisonment|imprisonment for life]] is deemed as 30 years imprisonment. Previously, a life sentence was deemed to be 20 years until the Act was amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2007. However, there are some Acts (e.g. [[Firearms (Increased Penalties) Act 1971]]) that provides for the imprisonment for the duration of the natural life of the person sentenced, notwithstanding Section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 1953.

==Structure==
The Criminal Justice Act 1953, in its current form (1 June 2013), consists of 6 sections and no schedule (including 3 amendments), without separate Part.
* Section 1: Short title and application
* Section 2: Abolition of penal servitude, rigorous and simple imprisonment
* Section 3: Life sentences
* Section 4: Abolition of whipping with cat-o’-nine tails, etc.
* Section 5: (Omitted)
* Section 6: (Omitted)

'''Cultural property''' are physical items that are part of the [[cultural heritage]] of a group or society.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; They include such items as historic buildings, works of art, archaeological sites, libraries and museums.

==Definition==
Article 1 of the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] of 1954 defines cultural property as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention 1954] at the UNESCO website&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The term 'cultural property' shall cover, irrespective of origin or ownership:
:(a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people, such as monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular; archaeological sites; groups of buildings which, as a whole, are of historical or artistic interest; works of art; manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest; as well as scientific collections and important collections of books or archives or of reproductions of the property defined above;
:(b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a) such as museums, large libraries and depositories of archives, and refuges intended to shelter, in the event of armed conflict, the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a); 
:(c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), to be known as 'centers containing monuments'."

==Emblem==
[[File:Denkmal.png|thumb|upright=0.4|The cultural property emblem]]
Article 16 of the Convention describes the internationally recognized mark for cultural property as follows:
:(1) The distinctive emblem of the Convention shall take the form of a shield, pointed below, persaltire blue and white (a shield consisting of a royal-blue square, one of the angles of which forms the point of the shield, and of a royal-blue triangle above the square, the space on either side being taken up by a white triangle).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3164">A '''deficiency judgment''' is an unsecured money judgment against a [[borrower]] whose [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] [[foreclosure]] sale did not produce sufficient funds to pay the underlying [[promissory note]], or loan, in full. &lt;ref&gt;See also Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  The availability of a deficiency judgment depends on whether the lender has a [[Recourse loan|recourse]] or [[nonrecourse loan]], which is largely a matter of state law. In some jurisdictions, the original loan(s) obtained to purchase property is/are non-recourse, but subsequent refinancing of a first mortgage and/or acquisition of a 2nd (3rd, etc.) are recourse loans.

In short, many jurisdictions hold that the loans obtained at the acquisition of a property ("purchase-money") are non-recourse, and most, if not all, subsequent loans are recourse.

States that follow the title (trust-deed) theory of mortgages typically allow non-judicial foreclosure procedures, which are fast, but do not allow deficiency judgments. States that follow the lien theory of mortgages require judiciary foreclosure procedures, but allow deficiency judgments against the debtor, although some states have narrowed the time periods to seek a deficiency judgment. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tampaflforeclosure.com/foreclosure-defense/motion-for-deficiency-representation|title = Post Judgment Deficiency Motions in Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that there is a difference between a deficiency and a deficiency judgment. A "deficiency" is the difference between the amount owed on a loan and the total amount received/collected at the closing of a loan. A deficiency judgment is a court judgment that is a public record of the amount owed and by whom. In many states, items included in calculating the amount of a deficiency judgment include: the loan principal, accrued interest and attorney fees, less the amount the lender bid at the foreclosure sale.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Supreme Court of Missouri Upholds Lenders' Rights to Obtain Full Deficiency Judgment  |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/supreme-court-missouri-upholds-lenders-rights-to-obtain-full-deficiency-judgment |publisher= Armstrong Teasdale
|work=The National Law Review|date=2012-04-23|accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Geoff Walsh, a staff attorney with the U.S. [[National Consumer Law Center]], said on [[National Public Radio|NPR]] that the United States is "seeing an uptick" in the pursuit of deficiency claims, because technological developments have enabled large debt-buying institutions and mortgage insurers to more easily pursue former borrowers, who often don't know their legal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.wnyc.org/radio/#/ondemand/406253|title = Bound by Debt: The Relentless Grip of the Foreclosure Crisis Continues|last = |first = |date = 15 October 2014|work = The Takeaway, NPR|accessdate = 15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3808">'''Dhammasattha''' "treatise on the law" is the [[Pali]] name of a genre of literature found in the [[Greater India#Indianized kingdoms|Indianized kingdoms]] of Western [[mainland Southeast Asia]] (modern [[Laos]], [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], and [[Yunnan]]) principally written in Pali, [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Mon language|Mon]] or the [[Tai languages]] or in a bilingual ''nissaya'' or literal Pali translation ({{lang-my| နိဿယ}}). "Sattha" is the Pali cognate of the [[Sanskrit]] term for instruction, learning, or treatise, [[Shastra|śāstra]]. Burmese {{lang|my|ဓမ္မသတ်}} is often transliterated "dhammathat" and the Tai and Mon terms are typically romanized as "thammasāt" or "dhammasāt" ({{lang-th|ธรรมศาสตร์}}) Dhammasattha texts are historically related to Hindu [[dharmaśāstra]] literature, although they are very significantly influenced by the [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]] traditions and literature of Southeast Asia.

==History==
The word ''dhammathat'' is first mentioned in a Burmese inscription from 13th-century [[Bagan]], although it is likely that dhammasattha texts were transmitted there earlier. Certain dhammasatthas claim to have been compiled during the first millennium. There are nine primary Burmese dhammathats, namely the Manu and Dhammavisala Dhammathats of the [[Pagan Kingdom]], the [[Wareru]] Dhammathat&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210}} (1270), Pasedha (1468), Dhammathat Kyaw (1581), and Pyanchi Dhammathats (1614)  of the [[Taungoo Dynasty]], and the Myingun Dhammathat (1650) of the [[Konbaung Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myint |first1=Htun |title=Challenges Facing "State" Building in Burma: Law and Legal Dimension |journal= |publisher=Indiana University |pages= |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~voconf/papers/myint_voconf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an extensive tradition of dhammasattha exegesis, particularly in [[Myanmar]]. Hundreds of dhammasatth, commentaries, and related legal texts are extant in [[parabaik]] ([[palm-leaf manuscript]]) form.

==Legal history==
Dhammasatths influenced a number of Southeast Asian societies prior to the colonial era in matters concerning marriage, theft, assault, slavery, debt, kingship, property, inheritance as well as other issues. In contemporary [[Burma]], although colonial and post-colonial laws predominate, it remains acceptable practice to use dhammathat in law courts in certain areas of family and inheritance law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1736">The '''East African Court of Appeal''' ('''EACA''') was a court which served as the appellate court for the British colonies in eastern Africa and west Asia.

The court was established in 1902 as the '''Eastern African Court of Appeal''' and was the appellate court for [[British Kenya]], [[Uganda Protectorate]], and [[Nyasaland]]. Later, the court's name was changed to the East African Court of Appeal, and in the 1950s to the '''Court of Appeal for East Africa''' or the '''Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa'''. The court was based in Kenya.

Over time, the jurisdiction of the court grew to become the appellate court for the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]], [[British Somaliland]], [[Aden Protectorate]], [[Colony of Aden]], [[British Seychelles]], and [[Saint Helena]].

Decisions of the court could be appealed with leave to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].

The court was retained by independent [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Uganda]] as the appellate court for the [[East African Community]]. When the Community was abolished in 1977, so too was the court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">'''Empirical legal studies''' ('''ELS''') is an approach to the study of [[law]], [[legal procedure]], and [[legal theory]] through the use of [[empirical]] research. Empirical legal researchers use research techniques that are typical of [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]]; however, ELS research tends to be more focused on purely legal questions than the related fields of [[law and economics]], [[legal psychology]], and [[sociology of law]].  ELS also tends to be more narrowly quantitative than fields such as [[Law and Society Association|law-and-society]] or [[new legal realism]] (NLR), which embrace [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] [[Social science|social science methods]], as well as [[Multimethodology|mixed method]] approaches.

In 2004, the ''[[Journal of Empirical Legal Studies]]'' was launched by the [[Society for Empirical Legal Studies]] and [[Cornell Law School]], and within three years rose to be ranked 28th of the over 800 US law journals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx Law Journals: Submission and Ranking] Ranking of US Law journals by impact factor, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63481">An '''extrajudicial killing''' (also known as '''extrajudicial execution''') is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any [[Judiciary|judicial proceeding]] or legal process. [[Extrajudicial punishment]]s are mostly seen by humanity to be unethical, since they bypass the [[due process]] of the legal jurisdiction in which they occur.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Extrajudicial killings often target leading political, trade union, dissident, religious, and social figures and are only those carried out by the [[State (polity)|state]] government or other state authorities like the armed forces or police, as extra-legal fulfillment of their prescribed role.

Section 3(a) of the [[United States]] [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] contains a definition of extrajudicial killing:

{{quote|a deliberate killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regular constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term, however, does not include any such killing that, under international law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Congressional Record, V. 147, Pt. 6, May 9, 2001 to May 21 2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCYK7X_SqHIC&amp;pg=PA7897|date=October 2005|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|page=7897|id=GGKEY:2126SDPKSFJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The legal exclusion in the sentence that starts "Such term, however ..." covers the killing of [[enemy combatant]]s and others who are not protected under international law from extrajudicial killing.}} }}

[[Argentina]]'s dictatorial government during the 1976–1983 period used extrajudicial killings systematically as way of crushing the opposition in the so-called "[[Dirty War]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-131783-2009-09-15.html Veinticinco años del informe de la Conadep] {{sp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or what is known in Spanish as ''La Guerra Sucia''.

In 1999 [[Belarus]]ian opposition leaders [[Yury Zacharanka]] and [[Viktar Hanchar]] together with his business associate [[Anatol Krasouski]] disappeared. Hanchar and Krasouski disappeared the same day of a broadcast on state television in which President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] ordered the chiefs of his security services to crack down on “opposition scum”. Although the [[State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus]] (KGB) had them under constant surveillance, the official investigation announced that the case could not be solved. The disappearance of journalist [[Dzmitry Zavadski]] in 2000 has also yielded no results. Copies of a report by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=16 Years of Silence: Enforced Disappearances in Belarus Must Be Investigated |url=http://blog.amnestyusa.org/europe/16-years-of-silence-enforced-disappearances-in-belarus-must-be-investigated/  | newspaper=[[Amnesty International]]|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] claims that Zacharanka, Hanchar, Krasouski and Zavadski likely became victims of extrajudicial executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Report: Belarus:

These included Manuel Contreras, the former head of Chile's [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|National Intelligence Directorate]] (DINA), which served as Pinochet's [[Secret police|secret police.]] He was behind numerous assassinations and human rights abuses such as the 1974 abduction and [[forced disappearance]] of Socialist Party leader [[Victor Olea Alegria]]. Some of the killings were also coordinated with other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone in the so-called [[Operation Condor]]. There were reports of United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement, particularly within its activities in Central and South America that promoted anti-Communist coups.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Ops: The Rise of Special Forces in the CIA, the SAS, and Mossad|last=Geraghty|first=Tony|publisher=Pegasus Books|year=2012|isbn=9781605987613|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While CIA's complicity was not proven, American dollars supported the regimes that carried out extrajudicial killings such as the Pinochet administration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; CIA, for instance, helped create DINA and the agency admitted that Contreras was one of its assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America|last=McSherry|first=Patrice|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=9780742536876|location=Lanham, MD|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== El Salvador ==
During the [[El Salvador Civil War|Salvadoran civil war]], death squads achieved notoriety when far-right vigilantes assassinated Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] for his social activism in March 1980. In December 1980, [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|four Americans—three nuns and a lay worker—were raped and murdered]] by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of peasants and activists, including such notable priests as [[Rutilio Grande]]. Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and training from American advisors during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, these events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} although death squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981–1989) as well.

== Honduras ==
Honduras also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was [[Battalion 316]].  Hundreds of people, including teachers, politicians and union bosses, were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-negroponte1a-story.html|title=When a wave of torture and murder staggered a small U.S. ally, truth was a casualty.|first=Gary Cohn and Ginger|last=Thompson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iran ==
{{See also|Chain Murders of Iran}}

In 1953 a regime was installed through the efforts of the American [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the British [[MI6]] in which the Shah (hereditary monarch) [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] used [[SAVAK]] death squads (also trained by the CIA) to imprison, torture and/or kill hundreds of dissidents.  After the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] death squads were used to an even greater extent by the new Islamic government. In 1983, the CIA gave the Supreme Leader of Iran—[[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]—information on [[KGB]] agents in Iran. This information was probably used. The Iranian government later used death squads occasionally throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; however by the 2000s it seems to have almost entirely, if not completely, ceased using them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/the-chain-murders-1988-1998.html|title=The Chain Murders|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=October 29, 2018|website=Tehran Bureau|publisher=PBS|last=Sahim|first=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iraq ==
[[Iraq]] was formed by the partition and domination of various tribal lands by the British in the early 20th century. Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. [[King Ghazi]] of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), for fear that the government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the [[Axis powers]]. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947. Iraq was left with a national government led from [[Baghdad]] made up of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ethnicity in key positions of power, ruling over an ad-hoc nation splintered by tribal affiliations. This leadership used death squads and committed massacres in Iraq throughout the 20th century, culminating in the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/9/13/14133/1410/|title=History of Iraq: 1933 - 1939|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has since become increasingly partitioned following the [[Iraq War]] into three zones: a [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish ethnic zone]] to the north, a Sunni center and the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] ethnic zone to the south. The [[Secularism|secular]] [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] [[Ba'ath Party|Baathist]] leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia (Prime Minister) and Kurdish (President of the Republic) peoples of the nation. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish ([[Peshmerga]]).

There were [[death squad]]s formed by members of every ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=U.S. cracks down on Iraq death squads |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/24/iraq.main/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the national capital of Baghdad some members of the now-Shia police department and army (and militia members posing as members of police or armed forces) formed unofficial, unsanctioned, but long-tolerated death squads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1869439,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=US patrols to weed out militias posing as Iraqi police |first=Peter |last=Beaumont |date=September 11, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They possibly had links to the Interior Ministry and were popularly known as the 'black crows'.

The victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni [[insurgency]]. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. These killings are not limited to men; women and children have also been arrested and/or killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='25,000 civilians' killed in Iraq |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4692589.stm |publisher=BBC |date=2005-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these killings have also been part of simple robberies or other criminal activities.

A feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of the ''New York Times'' claimed that the U.S. military had modelled the "Wolf Brigade", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads used in the 1980s to crush the left-wing insurgency in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name=Nytimes050501&gt;{{cite news |title=The Way of the Commandos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01ARMY.html?ei=5088&amp;en=f0604488a64924cd&amp;ex=1272686400&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-05-01 |first=Peter |last=Maass |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western news organizations such as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and [[People (magazine)|''People'']] disassembled this by focusing on aspects such as probable [[militia]] membership, religious ethnicity, as well as uniforms worn by these squads rather than stating the [[United States]]-backed Iraqi government had death squads active in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4719252.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Iraq 'death squad caught in act' |date=February 16, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soviet Union and Russia ==
In [[Bolshevist Russia|Soviet Russia]] since 1918 [[Cheka]] was authorized to execute "counterevolutionaries" without trial. Hostages were also executed by Cheka during the [[Red Terror]] in 1918–1920.

The [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|successors of Cheka]] also had the authority for extrajudicial executions. In 1937–38 hundreds of thousands where executed extrajudicially during the [[Great Purge]] under the lists approved by [[NKVD troika]]s. In some cases the Soviet special services did not arrest and then execute their victims but just secretly killed them without any arrest. For example, [[Solomon Mikhoels]] was murdered in 1948 and his body was run over to create the impression of a traffic accident. The Soviet special services also conducted extrajudicial killings abroad, most notably of [[Leon Trotskiy]] in 1940 in [[Mexico]], [[Stepan Bandera]] in 1959 in Germany, [[Georgi Markov]] in 1978 in London.

In the [[Russian Federation]], a number of journalist murders were attributed to public administration figures, usually where the publications would reveal their involvement in large corruption scandals.

It has been regarded that the [[Alexander Litvinenko assassination theories|Alexander Litvinenko]] murder was linked to Russian special forces.

USA and UK intelligence agents reportedly claim that Russian assassins, some possibly at orders of the government, are behind at least fourteen [[targeted killing]]s on British soil that police called non-suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-police-evidence-russian-assassins-behind-14-suspicious-deaths-british-soil-boris-berezovsky-scot-a7793151.html|title=UK authorities 'overlooked' evidence linking Russia to deaths on British soil|date=16 June 2017|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report, [[Amnesty International]] documented incidents that "appear to have been extrajudicial executions" against Palestinian civilians.&lt;ref name=Amnesty&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/israeli-forces-must-end-pattern-of-unlawful-killings-in-west-bank/|title=Israeli forces in Occupied Palestinian Territories must end pattern of unlawful killings|website=www.amnesty.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those incidents occurred after Palestinians attempted to attack, and murder, Israelis, but even though the attackers did not pose a serious threat due to soldiers' armor, they were shot without ensuring that the threat was real and without attempt to arrest suspects before resorting to the use of lethal force.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt;

Reportedly thousands of [[Human rights in Thailand#Deaths relating to the 2003 war on drugs|extrajudicial killings occurred during the 2003 anti-drug effort]] of [[Thailand]]'s prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].

'''Fashion law''' is a legal field encompassing issues that arise throughout the life of an article of [[clothing]] or a [[fashion accessory]]. Fundamental issues in fashion law include [[intellectual property]]; business and finance, with subcategories ranging from employment and labor law to real estate; international trade and government regulation, including questions of safety and [[sustainability]]; dress codes and religious apparel; consumer culture; privacy and wearable tech; and [[civil rights]]. Fashion law also includes related areas such as textile production, modelling, media, and the [[cosmetics]] and [[perfume]] industries.&lt;ref name=Scafidi2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Scafidi |first=Susan |chapter=Introduction: Fashion Law Triumphant - Designing Success in a New Legal Field |title=Navigating Fashion Law: Leading Lawyers on Developing Client Brands in a Changing Market and Monitoring Key Legal Developments |edition=2015 |publisher=Thomson Reuters |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-314-29318-3}}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Furi-Perry |first=Ursula |title=The Little Book of Fashion Law |publisher=American Bar Association  |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-62722-111-5}}, pp. iii-xii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The American Bar Association’s Legal Guide to Fashion Design |publisher=American Bar Association |editor-last=Faux |editor-first=David |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-62722-319-5}}, pp. 2-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fashion Law: A Guide for Designers, Fashion Executives and Attorneys |editor-last1=Jimenez |editor-first1=Guillermo |editor-last2=Kolson |editor-first2=Barbara |publisher=Fairchild Publications  |edition=2nd |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-60901-895-5}}, pp. iii-xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Fashion has been subject to legal regulation throughout history, from sumptuary laws that limit who can wear certain garments to trade restrictions and varying degrees of [[intellectual property protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huan |first=Alan |title=Governance of the Consuming Passions: A History of Sumptuary Law |publisher=St. Martins Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-31212-922-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beebe |first=Barton |title=Intellectual Property Law and the Sumptuary Code |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=123 |pages=809–889 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the conceptualization of fashion law as a distinct legal field is relatively recent.

A University of Geneva thesis was published on ‘’Le Droit International de la Mode’’ in 2000, which did not receive wide distribution.&lt;ref name=Scafidi2015 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Belhumeur |first=Jeanne |title=Le Droit International de la Mode |publisher=Canova Società Libraria Ed. |language=French |year=2000 |isbn=978-8-88409-021-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, a group of French lawyers led by Annabelle Gauberti published a [http://crefovi.com/Droit%20du%20luxe.pdf supplement entitled "Droit du luxe"](which translates into either "law of luxury goods" or 'luxury law") in the prestigious French legal magazine Revue Lamy Droit des Affaires. [http://crefovi.com/Droit%20du%20luxe.pdf This supplement] explored various specific legal and tax issues at stake, in the fashion and luxury goods sectors, and was the second conceptualization ever of the interactions between the legal field and the fashion and luxury goods industries. Indeed, while Europeans prefer to refer to this sub-legal field as the law of luxury goods, Americans prefer to use the more 'democratic' term of "fashion law".{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 2006, Professor [[Susan Scafidi]] offered the first course in Fashion Law at [[Fordham Law School]]. Fashion Law courses were also developed and offered to designers at the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] (by Guillermo Jimenez) and [[Parsons School of Design]] (by Deborah McNamara) at this time as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyls.edu/innovation-center-for-law-and-technology/faculty/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008 [[Susan Scafidi]] wrote that fashion law was only then starting to be recognized as a distinct area of law.&lt;ref name=Scafidi2015 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704476104575439642156460572 |title=Couture in the Classroom |date=20 August 2010 |accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scafidi |first=Susan |url=http://www.counterfeitchic.com/2008/09/fashion_law_1.php |title=Fashion Law |publisher=Counterfeit Chic |date=29 September 2008 |accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tschorn |first=Adam |title=Fordham University launches Fashion Law Institute, a first for the Industry |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2010/09/fordham-university-launches-fashion-law-institute.html |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=10 September 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the world's first academic center dedicated fashion law, the [[Fashion Law Institute]], launched with the support of [[Diane von Furstenberg]] and the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]].

In the same year, The Global Fashion Project in Miami launched their Fashion Law Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;http://tgfp.org&lt;/ref&gt;

While double-digit turnover growth is being generated by many companies involved in the fashion and luxury goods sectors, an increasing number of law suits is filed in this industry and, as a result, more and more legal practitioners focus their practice on this particular industry and sector. An international association of lawyers involved in fashion law, ialci, was founded in 2013, in order to federate practitioners around the world on common know-how and event projects pertaining to fashion law and the law of luxury goods.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Intellectual Property===
{{main article|Intellectual property protection}}

[[Intellectual property protection]] has been a substantial legal concern in fashion since the emergence of fashion brands in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stewart |first=Mary Lynn |title=Copying and Copyrighting Haute Couture |journal=French Historical Studies |volume=28 |pages=103–130 |year=2005 |doi=10.1215/00161071-28-1-103}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the subject of congressional debate,&lt;ref name=IDPPAhearing&gt;{{cite web |title=A Bill to Provide Protection for Fashion Design: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property of the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, One Hundred Ninth Congress, Second Session on H.R. 5055 |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-109hhrg28908/html/CHRG-109hhrg28908.htm |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |date=27 July 2006 |accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; multiple academic articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scafidi |first=Susan |title=F.I.T.: Fashion as Information Technology |journal=Syracuse Law Review |volume=59 |page=69 |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raustiala |first1=Kal |last2=Sprigman |first2=Christopher |title=The Piracy Paradox: Innovation and Intellectual Property in Fashion Design |journal=Virginia Law Review |volume=92 |page=1687 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first fashion law blog,&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mitchell |first=Dan |title=Fashion's Cutthroat Edge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/12/business/12online.html |publisher=New York Times |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ladies of Fashion Law! |url=http://www.thebaffledblog.com/2012/09/baffled-fashion-law_17.html |publisher=B.A.F.F.L.E.D.: Business Advice - Fashion Facts - Law and Entertainment Domain |date=17 September 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a major exhibit at the Museum at the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosenfeld |first=Austin |title=From Collaborations to Counterfeits: "Faking It" Opens at the FIT Museum |url=http://www.style.com/trends/fashion/2014/fashion-exhibit-faking-it |publisher=Style.com |date=2 December 2014 |accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Knockoffs and Fashion Design Protection |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z347SXVJAAE |publisher=The Museum at [[Fashion Institute of Technology|FIT]] |date=9 December 2014 |accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Insider's Perspective on the Counterfeit Industry |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is9Hxn7Wr5w |publisher=The Museum at [[Fashion Institute of Technology|FIT]] |date=9 December 2014 |accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key issues include

The '''''Gazette officielle du Québec''''' is an official publication of the [[Government of Quebec|Quebec government]]. It is used to promulgate new [[law]]s and [[regulation]]s, which thereby become official. It was founded on January 16, 1869.

An earlier ''Gazette de Québec'' was an unofficial publication created in 1764, and was replaced by ''Gazette officielle du Québec'' in 1823. Archived versions of the ''Gazette'' from 1869 to 1995 are available. An annual subscription to the Gazette costs $1185 ($500 and $685, for part 1 and 2, respectively) per year, for both parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/gazetteofficielle/abonnement.fr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; One copy costs $10.71.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/gazetteofficielle/abonnement.fr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Gender empowerment''' is the [[empowerment]] of people of any [[gender]]. While conventionally being reduced to its aspect of [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], the concept stresses [[Sex and gender distinction|the distinction]] between biological [[sex]] and [[Gender role|gender as a role]], also referring to other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context.

Gender empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in regard to development and economics. Entire nations, businesses, communities, and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;Deneulin, Séverine, with Lila Shahani.  2009.  An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency.  Sterling, VA: Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring ==
Gender empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]], or the GEM. The GEM shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. Gem is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence."&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt;

Haushofer opened the topic in his essay "Geopolitik und Geojurisprudenz" which appeared in ''Zeitschrift für Völkerrecht'' in 1928. Here he lamented the lack of geographical understanding in [[Germany|German]] legal studies. 

He said this contributed towards the general failure of the German populace to understand the nature of the [[First World War]]. He heralded Langhans-Ratzeburg as the chief representative of this new discipline, which he suggested would overcome the "thin, sterile air of legal scientific concepts and the fraudulent, political scientific, treaty-waving political posture of the so-called central powers". 

With a return to putatively "German" concepts of legal relations between states, invigorated by incorporating a geographical perspective, then borders as durable legal structures rooted in geography would emerge.

With this introduction, ''Langhans-Ratzeburg'' in turn praised not only Haushofer, but also [[Alfred Hettner]], [[Walther Vogel]] and [[Albert von Hoffmann]] for their attempts to link geography, history, politics and culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2554">The '''Hart–Fuller debate''' is an exchange between [[Lon Fuller]] and [[H. L. A. Hart]] published in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' in 1958 on morality and law, which demonstrated the divide between the [[Legal positivism|positivist]] and [[natural law]] philosophy. Hart took the positivist view in arguing that morality and law were separate. Fuller's reply argued for morality as the source of law's binding power.

==Philosophy==
Positivists believe in a separation between the law as it is and the law as it should be.  Legal rights and moral rights are not related, beyond mere coincidence. Hart believes the method of deciding cases through logic or deduction is not necessarily wrong, just as it is not necessarily right to decide cases according to social or moral aims.  Hart uses the problem of "the core and the penumbra" to illustrate the idea that laws must be related to the meaning of the words, not any natural or moral belief.  A "core" case would be one that the statute is intended to cover.  In the classic example, a statute that bans vehicles from a park is obviously intended to cover cars. A "penumbra" case would be one not considered by the creators of the law, such as a skateboard in the example above.  A judge interpreting such a law from a positivist viewpoint would look to a definition of the words in the statute. The natural law view believes that the creation of law should be based on natural laws or common morals

'''Independence constitution''' is the name commonly given by [[Africa]]n political scientists to originating [[constitution]]s (many of which are extant) of former British colonies, primarily in Africa, which gained their [[independence]] approximately 1960-1990. 

Due to these colonies' low economic output and the [[United Kingdom]]'s fading imperial prowess, independence was usually granted after little instigation, with the UK presiding over creation of the new state. Generally local leaders were hand-picked by the UK to be the new governing body and were given a political education in [[London]], during which they often served as the sole representative of their country in the negotiation of their country's new constitution. In short, independence constitutions were written in London, by a primarily British body, in line with British systems of governance. Supporters applaud the UK's responsible transfer of power; critics cite low popular perceptions of legitimacy and claim that the independence constitutions maintained essentially colonial states.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28451">'''Jury sentencing''' is the practice, in some U.S. states, of having [[jury|juries]] decide what penalties to give those who have been convicted of criminal offenses. The practice of jury sentencing began in [[Virginia]] in the 18th century and spread westward to other states that were influenced by Virginia-trained lawyers.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; As of 2018, [[Arkansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.173.1272&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=59 ARK.CODE ANN. § 5-4-103|date=2010|quote=If a defendant is charged with a felony and is found guilty of an offense by a jury, the jury shall fix punishment . . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kentucky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2010|url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=39605|title=60 KY.REV.STAT.ANN. § 532.055|quote=Upon return of a verdict of guilty . . . the court shall conduct a sentencing hearing before the jury, if such case was tried before a jury.

Proponents of jury sentencing argue that since sentencing involves fact-finding (a task traditionally within the purview of juries), and since the [[original intent]] of the founders was to have juries check judges' power, it is the proper role of juries to participate in sentencing.&lt;ref name=booker/&gt; Opponents argue that judges' training and experience with the use of [[presentence report]]s and [[sentencing guidelines]], as well as the fact that [[jury control procedures]] typically deprive juries of the opportunity to hear information about the defendant's background during the trial, make it more practical to have judges sentence defendants.&lt;ref name=statutory/&gt;

==History==
===Rise of jury sentencing===
The impetus for introducing jury sentencing was that in the late 18th century, punishment options expanded beyond [[Public humiliation|shaming]] sanctions and the mandatory [[death penalty]] and came to include various ranges and modes of imprisonment, creating more room for case-by-case decisionmaking to which juries were thought to be well-suited.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Virginia was the first state to adopt jury sentencing. [[Constitution_of_Virginia#1776|The state's first constitution]] was enacted in 1776, and shortly thereafter, in 1779, [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] a revised criminal code that would have eliminated [[pardon]]s and [[benefit of clergy]], abolished capital punishment for most offenses, and allowed juries to decide punishments when the penalty was discretionary. This bill failed, however, both in 1779 and 1786, after [[James Madison]] had reintroduced it while [[Thomas_Jefferson#Minister_to_France|Jefferson was in France]].&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

Sentencing by jury was, however, successfully enacted in Virginia's 1796 penal code, which like the 1779 bill replaced capital punishment with terms of imprisonment for most felony offenses. Kentucky adopted a penal reform bill introduced by [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckenridge]] that implemented sentencing by jury in 1798. While in Virginia, magistrates continued to have misdemeanor sentencing power (possibly because of the political influence of magistrates who served in the General Assembly), in Kentucky, this power was given to juries. Kentucky juries tried and sentenced slaves and free blacks, and even decided cases involving [[prison discipline]], imposing punishments such as [[flagellation]] or [[solitary confinement]] for infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Any convict commencing a quarrel with another should "suffer such punishment (within the prison) as should be awarded by an impartial jury, but not over four lashes, or 10 hours of solitary confinement.|title=The development of American prisons and prison customs, 1776-1845|author=Lewis, O.F.|date=1922|publisher=Prison Association of New York|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentofame00lewirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia and Tennessee adopted sentencing by jury in 1816 and 1829, respectively.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In contrast, northern states such as [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] allowed judges to determine penalties, with Pennsylvania also allowing judges to pardon prisoners who, in their view, had evidenced sincere reformation. One hypothesis is that Virginia opted for jury sentencing because [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]s like [[George Keith Taylor]] distrusted the Republican district court judges; while in Pennsylvania, the Constitutionalists sought (over the objections of Republicans) to put sentencing power in the hands of the judges because the bench was populated by Constitutionalists. [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]], which did not establish penitentiaries until after the [[American Civil War]], also left sentencing to judges' discretion.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

The adoption of jury sentencing happened at the same time that the movement for an elective judiciary gathered speed, with at least four states, Alabama, Mississippi, Montana, and North Dakota switching to [[judicial election]]s around the same time that they adopted jury sentencing. Both reforms may have been due to a mistrust of unelected judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

During the ten years of the [[Republic of Texas]], judges determined sentences. The 
change to jury determination of the penalty was brought about by one of the first laws passed by the first legislature of the State of Texas in 1846, which empowered the jury to sentence the defendant in all criminal cases except capital cases and cases for which punishment was fixed by law.&lt;ref name=grab/&gt;

Indiana, Illinois, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and West Virginia adopted jury sentencing later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

===Decline of jury sentencing===
The 1895 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'' reflected growing concern that letting juries decide whether or how the law should be applied in particular cases could be detrimental to the [[rule of law]]. By 1910, the role of juries in determining penalties was being eroded by the professionalization of sentencing, as many states passed laws that created [[parole]] and [[probation]] systems.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

These systems were based on a [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] philosophy that it would be more useful for society to focus on finding ways to prevent future crime than on fixing blame for crime that had occurred in the past. Criminal behavior was viewed as the result of such factors as [[heredity]], social circumstances, random breeding, and [[Darwinian struggle]], rather than an abuse of divinely-granted [[free will]]. [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]] would determine the causes of crime and what social reforms and treatment programs would correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Probation officer]]s gathered and analyzed information about the defendant's character and prepared a presentence report that served as the basis for the ultimate sentence. Probation provided opportunities for treatment in the community for juveniles and adults. In the prison system, [[parole commission]]ers, trained in penology and insulated from political pressures, determined when prisoners had been rehabilitated and could be reintegrated into society.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

The process of preparing a presentence report, which takes weeks, only begins after the defendant is convicted, since if he/she were to be acquitted, the effort that went into preparing the report would be wasted. It would, therefore, not be possible for juries to sentence the defendant at the time of conviction, if the jury needed to rely on a presentence report in making its sentencing decision; rather, the jury would need to be broken up and reassembled later, which could be unworkable if the delay between verdict and sentencing is substantial.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

Furthermore, jury control procedures typically provide that during the trial, information about the defendant's background that is not relevant to the issue of guilt is not to be presented in the presence of the jury, lest it prejudice him. The assumptions that presentence reports would be more informative than presentence hearings, and that training and experience were required to intelligently consider the data and assess sanctions, militated in favor of having a judge rather than a jury do the sentencing.&lt;ref name=statutory&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statutory Structures for Sentencing Felons to Prison|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=1 December 1960|volume=60|number=8|pages=1134-1172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''[[McKeiver v Pennsylvania]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that alleged juvenile delinquents have no right to a jury trial, with [[Harry Blackmun]] and three other Justices opining that an adversarial system would put an end to the prospect of a intimate, informal protective proceeding focused on rehabilitation.

Georgia and Tennessee both had periods (from 1937-1939, and from 1913-1923, respectively) in which they briefly abandoned jury sentencing while experimenting with [[indeterminate sentencing]]. By 1919, fourteen states gave juries sentencing powers in non-capital cases, although by 1960, that number had dropped to thirteen.&lt;ref name=democratic&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing as Democratic Practice|author=Iontcheva, Jenia|journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=89|number=2|date=April 2003|pages=311-383|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3202435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s and 1980s, [[determinate sentencing]], a new intellectual current that repudiated the [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitative]] model with its focus on using mathematical models and grids to determine sentences, had made inroads, making jury sentencing seem like more of an anachronism.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Georgia permanently abandoned jury sentencing in 1974 and Tennessee did the same in 1982.&lt;ref name=origins&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, Nancy J.|title=The Origins of Felony Jury Sentencing in the United States|volume=78|journal=Chi.-Kent L. Rev.|number=937|date=2003|url=https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cklawreview/vol78/iss3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, and North Dakota had also abandoned jury sentencing, and Mississippi was using jury sentencing only in rape and statutory rape cases. Oklahoma abolished jury sentencing but reinstated it in 1999.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

===Possible revival of jury sentencing===
According to some commentators, the time is ripe for a revival of jury sentencing, because flaws in the determinate sentencing systems are becoming increasingly apparent. Lawmakers drafting legislation such as the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] have had difficulty mustering the political will to make clear choices among opposing moral and ideological viewpoints, instead delegating these decisions to agencies that lack the representativeness and democratic origin of legislatures. Prosecutors have routinely circumvented the sentencing guidelines through their charging and plea bargaining decisions, creating a new set of disparities, despite the intent of the guidelines to curtail disparities.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Determinate sentencing has also failed to reduce racial disparity in sentencing.&lt;ref name=idea&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing in Noncapital Cases: An Idea Whose Time Has Come (Again)?|author=Lanni, Adriaan|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1 May 1999|volume=108|number=7|pages=1775-1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, some juries have been acquitting guilty defendants to save them from what they regard as overly harsh [[mandatory minimum sentence]]s, such as those imposed by the [[Rockefeller Drug Laws]] and California's [[three-strikes law]]. There have been movements to abolish sentencing commissions and guideline systems and inform jurors of their right to nullify. Decisions like ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find any facts that would increase a defendant's maximum sentence) and ''[[Ring v. Arizona]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find whether there are aggravating factors justifying capital punishment) have also signaled a willingness by the judiciary to expand the role of the jury in the legal process.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Jury sentencing has been seen as a way to in many cases render moot the questions raised by ''Apprendi'' and related cases such as ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'' and ''[[United States v. Booker]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bibas, Stephanos and Klein, Susan R.|title=The Sixth Amendment and Criminal Sentencing|date=2008|journal=Faculty Scholarship|number=921|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/921}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the differences between [[Element (criminal law)|elements of an offense]] and sentencing factors by letting the jury decide all the facts.&lt;ref name=applying&gt;{{cite journal|title=Applying Apprendi to jury sentencing: why state felony jury sentencing threatens the right to a jury trial|author=Carrington, Melissa|journal=University of Illinois Law Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=2011|number=4|pages=1359-1385|url=http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/4/Carrington.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases such as ''[[Miller v. Alabama]]'' and ''[[Graham v. Florida]]'' (banning mandatory life imprisonment without parole, and life imprisonment without parole in non-homicide cases, respectively, for juveniles, as contrary to the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]'s prohibition of [[cruel and unusual punishment]]) also raise a question of whether the Supreme Court logically should allow only a jury, rather than a judge, to determine a juvenile should receive such a sentence, given the parallels between adult capital punishment case law and juvenile life imprisonment with parole case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Russell, Sarah F.|title=Jury Sentencing and Juveniles: Eighth Amendment Limits and Sixth Amendment Rights|volume=56|journal=B.C.L. Rev.|number=553|date=2015|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol56/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plea bargains, judicial override, and juror access to information==
In Virginia, under the 1796 act, capital punishment remained mandatory for [[first-degree murder]], but the penalty for [[second-degree murder]] was any term between five and eighteen years in the penitentiary. The 1796 act gave the court in murder cases the authority to "determine the degree of the crime, and to give sentence accordingly" when a defendant was "convicted by confession." The judge's discretion to set sentences in cases of confession did not exist in Kentucky.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In Missouri, informing juries of sentences of defendants in similar cases or the sentences of co-participants in the crime on trial is strictly prohibited under the rules of evidence." Similarly, the Kentucky [[truth in sentencing]] statute, which generally increases the information available to sentencing juries, does not provide for sentencing guidelines and statistics. Kentucky courts have also held parole eligibility statistics inadmissible. The military at one time provided [[United States military jury|jurors]] with sentencing statistics and guidelines was the military, but this practice ended in the late 1950s as the military's judicial philosophy shifted its emphasis away from sentencing uniformity and towards individualized judgments. The [[United States Court of Military Appeals]] held that jurors were not to consider sentences in similar cases or to consult the sentencing manual.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Under Virginia's current system, jurors are controversially not allowed access to the Commonwealth's [[sentencing guidelines]] or to information about whether sentences will run consecutively or concurrently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20120401-2012-04-01-dp-nws-crime-notebook-0401-20120331-story.html|date=1 April 2012|title=Virginia judges rarely question juries' sentencing recommendations|publisher=Daily Press|author=Kelly, Ashley and Dujardin, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 2000 were also not informed that parole had been abolished in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/va_md_dc/virginia-eyes-new-sentences-after-juries-didn-t-get-key/article_1008cc74-de6f-5b77-bdd0-61c099dd9400.html|title=Virginia eyes new sentences after juries didn't get key fact|author=Durkin, Alana|publisher=Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge must justify any departure from the jury's recommendation in writing to the [[Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission]]. Less than one-quarter of jury-recommended sentences are modified by judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Caleb R.|title=Sentencing Roulette: How Virginia’s Criminal Sentencing System is Imposing an Unconstitutional Trial Penalty That Suppresses the Rights of Criminal Defendants to a Jury Trial|volume=23|journal=Wm.&amp; Mary Bill Rts. J.|number=559|date=2014|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmborj/vol23/iss2/10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to concerns about juries' imposing higher sentences than what the sentencing guidelines would suggest, many defendants opt either for [[bench trial]]s or [[plea bargain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Number of juried trials slumps both in Va., nationwide |url=https://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/number-of-juried-trials-slumps-both-in-va-nationwide/article_d2dbfd5c-34cc-5d9c-b999-a9c6641783f9.html|author=Green, Frank|publisher=Daily Progress|date=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States with jury sentencing have often allowed judges to intervene in the sentencing process, e.g. by reducing the sentence imposed by the jury, imposing hard labor or solitary confinement in addition to the jury's assessment of fines, or determining the place of confinement imposed by the jury.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In Alabama, judges were allowed to override juries' recommendations of life imprisonment and impose capital punishment instead, until a 2017 law took that power away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2017/07/death_penalty_judicial_overrid.html|title=Did judicial override end in Alabama? Some say judges can still overrule jury over death penalty|date=21 July 2017|publisher=AL.com|author=Remkus, Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; All jury sentencing states except Texas allow the judge to fix the punishment in case the jury fails to agree on a sentence,&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; making it impossible for there to be a mistrial due to a [[hung jury]] at sentencing.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

==Arguments for and against jury sentencing==
Arguments that have been raised for sentencing by jury are that judges can be arbitrary (depending, e.g., on their mood at the time of sentencing) and partisan, and that putting the same person in charge of both deciding sentences and extending leniency (e.g. through pardons) centralizes too much power in one person. Also, different judges may be inconsistent in the judgments they render. Another argument in favor of jury sentencing is that the punishment equitably due is best determined by the particular circumstances of the case, rather than by legal technicalities; and that a jury is well-equipped for this purpose.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; Also, if juries have power to give a lenient sentence, they may be less likely to engage in [[jury nullification]] by acquitting a guilty defendant whom they believe is undeserving of severe punishment.&lt;ref name=idea/&gt;

An argument based on the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendments to the United States Constitution]] is that criminal and civil juries have similar societal functions, including checking the abuse of governmental power, injecting community values into legal decisions, and aiding public acceptance of legal determinations; and therefore the criminal system should have juries decide sentences much as the civil system has juries decide judgments.&lt;ref name=booker&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kirgis, Paul F.|title=The Right to a Jury Decision on Sentencing Facts after Booker: What the Seventh Amendment Can Teach the Sixth|volume=39|journal=Ga. L. Rev.|number=897|date=2005|url=http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/faculty_lawreviews/131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments that have been raised against sentencing by jury are that juries are not as accountable as judges; that putting them in charge of determining both guilt and the sentence concentrates too much power in one body; and that different juries may differ widely in the sentences they impose. Counterarguments are that the lack of accountability of jurors to a higher authority preserves their [[judicial independence]], and that judges are also capable of differing from other judges in the sentences they impose. Judges may even deviate from their own usual sentencing practices if the case is high-profile or a judicial election is coming up. Also, disparities are not always a sign of arbitrariness; sometimes they may reflect geographical differences in public attitudes toward a given crime, or a jury's taking proper account of the individual circumstances of each offender.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

It is sometimes argued that an unreasonable juror may force the rest of the jury into an undesirable compromise to find the defendant guilty but impose an overly light sentence. A counter-argument is that whether this is bad or good is a matter of perception since "one juror's principled holdout is another juror's irrational nullification. One jury's 'compromise' is another jury's perfectly appropriate give-and-take deliberations."&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1185&amp;context=dlj|title=The Case for Jury Sentencing|author=Hoffman, Morris B.|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=52|number=951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to University of Chicago Law School lecturer Jenia Iontcheva, sentencing decisions are well-suited to being made through a process of [[deliberative democracy]] rather than by experts such as judges, since they involve deeply contested moral and political issues rather than scientific or technical issues. She argues that since sentencing requires individualized, case-by-case assessments, sentences should be decided through small-scale deliberation by juries, as opposed to having lawmakers codify general policies for mechanical application by judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

An advantage Iontcheva cites of having juries come together to deliberate on sentences is that the jurors may alter their preferences in the light of new perspectives. She argues that the hearing and consideration of diverse opinions will give the sentencing decisions greater legitimacy, and that engaging ordinary citizens in government through this process of deliberative democracy will give these citizens confidence about their ability to influence political decisions and thus increase their willingness to participate in politics even after the end of their jury service. Racial and other minorities may also benefit from having greater representation among jurors than among judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

In jurisdictions that do not have any statutory provisions formally allowing jury sentencing, judges have sometimes consulted with the jury on sentencing anyway. At the federal level, the practice of polling the jury and using their input in sentencing was upheld on appeal by the [[6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/06/federal_appeals_court_upholds.html|title=Federal appeals court upholds judge's lowest possible sentence in child-porn case|author=Heisig, Eric|publisher=Cleveland.com|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentencing is said to be more time-consuming for jurors than the relatively easy task of ascertaining guilt or innocence,&lt;ref name=grab&gt;{{cite journal|author=Webster, Charles W.|title=Jury Sentencing - Grab-Bag Justice|volume=14|journal=Sw L.J.|number=221|date=1960|url=https://scholar.smu.edu/smulr/vol14/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means an increase in jury fees and in the amount of productivity lost to jury duty.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In [[New South Wales]], a 2007 proposal by Chief Justice [[Jim Spigelman]] to involve juries in sentencing was rejected after District Court Chief Judge [[Reg Blanch]] cited "an expected wide difference of views between jurors about questions relating to sentence". Concerns about [[jury tampering]] through intimidation by defendants were also raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/keep-juries-away-from-sentencing-say-judges-20070427-gdq067.html|title=Keep juries away from sentencing, say judges|author=Pearlman, Jonathan|date=27 April 2007|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] and many other [[continental Europe]]an countries have a system in which professional judges and [[Judiciary_of_Germany#Lay_judges|lay judges]] deliberate together at both the trial and sentencing stages; such systems have been praised as a superior alternative because the mixed court dispenses with most of the time‐consuming practices of jury control that characterize Anglo‐American trial procedure, yet serves the purposes of a jury trial better than plea bargaining and bench trials, which have displaced the jury from routine American practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mixed Court and Jury Court: Could the Continental Alternative Fill the American Need?|author=Langbein, John H.|date=January 1981|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-4469.1981.tb00426.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable jury sentences==
Civil rights leader [[James Bevel]] was sentenced to 15 years in prison pursuant to the recommendation of a Virginia jury that found him guilty of having sex with his teenage daughter in the 1990s when they lived in Leesburg. The sentencing range had been 5 to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=43768|title=Civil Rights Leader Convicted of Incest|author=Barakat, Matthew|publisher=Associated Press|date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9010">'''Law and religion''' is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between [[law]], especially [[public law]], and [[religion]]. Voge Magazine reports that during the late 1900, a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the [[Journal of Law and Religion]], was first published that year. The ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' began publication in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ecclesiastical-law-journal/all-issues]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.lawandreligion.com/ its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in England in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;It also sponsors OJLR Summer Academy in Law and Religion 2014, at St Hugh's College, Oxford. see [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created  "The International Center for Law and Religion Studies." It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.iclrs.org/index.php?contentId=433&amp;linkId=156&amp;pageId=1  its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included  500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor [[John Witte, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' seeks to cover:
:social, legal and political issues involving the relationship between law and religion in society; comparative law perspectives on the relationship between religion and state institutions; developments regarding human and constitutional rights to freedom of religion or belief; considerations of the relationship between religious and secular legal systems; empirical work on the place of religion in society; and other salient areas where law and religion interact (e.g., theology, legal and political theory, legal history, philosophy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics of interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997) &lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008) &lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer, "Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East," ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' (1987) 35#1 pp. 127-184 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840165 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war.  

Important studies have appeared regarding [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Ferrari, "Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp 355-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palomino, "Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems," ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' (2012) vol 2 pp 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Bennoune, "Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law," ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,'' 45 (2006): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National studies==
===Thailand===
In Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique [[civic religion]] based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Reynolds, "Dhamma in Dispute: The Interactions of Religion and Law in Thailand," ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (1994) 28#3 pp 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on the legal industry==

In the 2016 report, [[Deloitte]] estimated that more than 110,000 law jobs in just the United Kingdom alone could be gone within the next twenty years because of automation. That could result in the creation of more highly skilled jobs and reduction of paralegal and temp positions. Deloitte's report asserts that "there is significant potential for high-skilled roles that involve repetitive processes to be automated by smart and self-learning algorithms".&lt;ref&gt;"Developing legal talent: Stepping into the future law firm." Deloitte. N.p., Feb. 2016. Web. 17 June 2017. &lt;https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/audit/articles/developing-legal-talent.html#&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to law and justice==

It has been widely estimated for at least the last generation that all the programs and resources devoted to ensuring access to justice address only 20% of the civil legal needs of low-income people in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Services Corporation, Documenting the Justice Gap in America: The Current Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low Income Americans, 2009, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on this experience, in late 2011, the U.S. government-funded [[Legal Services Corporation]] decided to convene a summit of leaders to explore how best to use technology in the access-to-justice community. The group adopted a mission for The Summit on the Use of Technology to Expand Access to Justice (Summit) consistent with the magnitude of the challenge: "to explore the potential of technology to move the United States toward providing some form of effective assistance to 100% of persons otherwise unable to afford an attorney for dealing with essential civil legal needs".&lt;ref&gt;Legal Services Corporation, Report of The Summit on the Use of Technology to Expand Access to Justice, p. 1; December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, joined by [[Microsoft]] and [[Pro Bono Net]], the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) announced a pilot program to develop online, statewide legal portals to direct individuals with civil legal needs to the most appropriate forms of assistance. These portals will use cutting-edge, user-centered technology to help ensure that all people with civil legal needs can navigate their options and more easily access solutions and services available from legal aid, the courts, the private bar, and community partners.&lt;ref&gt;"Press Release: The Legal Services Corporation Announces Pilot States for Innovative Program to Increase Access to Justice." Lsc.gov. Legal Service Corporation (LSC), 24 Apr. 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10119">{{About|the legal term|other uses|Case management (disambiguation){{!}}Case management}}
{{multiple issues|{{Tone|date=July 2008}}
{{primary sources|date=August 2008}}}}

The terms '''legal case management''' ('''LCM''') or '''matter management''' refer to a subset of [[law]] practice management and cover a range of approaches and technologies used by law firms and courts to leverage [[knowledge]] and methodologies for managing the life cycle of a case or matter more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;In the U.S., the term 'case' is customarily applied to a matter in which there are opposing parties or which involves a conflict between parties ''Capturing More Time ... And Keeping Your Clients Happy While Doing It'', Law Practice Today, March 2007.[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/articles/bot03071.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the terms refer to the sophisticated information management and workflow practices that are tailored to meet the legal field's specific needs and requirements.

As attorneys and law firms compete for clients they are routinely challenged to deliver services at lower costs with greater efficiency, thus firms develop practice-specific processes and utilize contemporary technologies to assist in meeting such challenges. Law practice management processes and technologies include case and matter management, time and billing, litigation support, research, communication and collaboration, [[data mining]] and modeling, and [[data security]], storage, and archive accessibility.

==Case management software==
Legal case or matter management software has two primary functions: it helps to better use, manage, consolidate, share, and protect information, and it tracks and shapes the business process. Because the most useful forms of such software can integrate data from multiple systems, departments, users, and business entities, its use can increase a firm's business advantage.

Case or matter management systems having the capacity to push and pull data over the Internet, whether within the software itself or within an integrated software framework or environment became an industry standard with the advent of the [[LexisNexis|Lexis]] and [[Westlaw]] legal research platforms.

Case management software is marketed to specific segments of the legal marketplace, with some products designed for small firms and others for large multinational firms, and a few claim to be scalable to all. Cost-containment and competition concerns facing small-to-mid-size firms that cannot afford a full-time IT staff often drive custom solutions incorporating muliple integrated products.

==In-house legal departments==
In-house legal teams (in the public and private sectors) have their own needs: generally these require less emphasis on billing and accounts (since clients tend to be internal), and even more on traceability, real-time integration and configurability. The need to improve productivity of the team and reduce costs to taxpayers, or the business, is often a key driver.  Some in-house teams have reduced their external legal bills by using case management software to increase their capacity and bring case work in-house.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Teh, Telegraph Media Group on [http://www.iken.biz www.iken.biz] January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case management in the U.S. federal courts==
As electronic court systems continue to increase their online presence, many now require case filings to be accomplished electronically.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., News Release, ''Electronic Case Filing in Federal Courts Reaches Milestone'', November 21, 2005.{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/cmecfat10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515005302/http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/cmecfat10.html |archivedate=2009-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Courts, ''About Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF)'', July 2009.{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/cmecf/cmecf_about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602021153/http://www.uscourts.gov/cmecf/cmecf_about.html |archivedate=2009-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many legal software vendors' products include the ability to take advantage of such electronic filing by pulling data from the case management product and pushing it into court filing systems.

==e-Discovery systems==
In litigation, the discovery process often results in enormous amounts of information that must be managed, and with the revision of the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in 2006 to include electronic means of discovery&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/#chapter_v FRCP]&lt;/ref&gt; came a new subset of case management systems that incorporated those changes, often dubbed 'electronic evidence' or 'e-discovery' management systems.&lt;ref&gt;See Kaplan, ''Industry Research Report, A Conversation with Corporate Counsel: e-Discovery Trends and Perspectives'', Fios, Inc. and Ari Kaplan Advisors, 2008.[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/docs/LPT608AriKaplan-ResearchStudy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/articles/tch04081.shtml Blake, ''Are You Litigation-Ready?'', Law Practice Today, April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the new rules took effect, e-Discovery firms as outside service vendors have flourished.

== Case management and the regulation of mediation in Australia ==
The term '''case management''' is also used to refer to systems in which court or tribunal officials assume closer administrative control over the litigation process than is traditionally associated with [[common law]] [[litigation]].&lt;ref name="Boulle"&gt;Boulle, L. (2005). Mediation: Principles Process Practice. 2nd Edition. Queensland, Australia. LexisNexis Butterworths.&lt;/ref&gt; The Assisted Dispute Resolution program was introduced into the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] in 1990 after a number of cases failed to reach resolutions having several directional hearings. In those cases the parties were not able to isolate the issues requiring determination. With the new program, judges can refer the parties to a court registrar for mediation. This is stated in the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Section 53A(1):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s53a.html|title=Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) s 53A|last=|first=|date=|website=www.austlii.edu.au|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504050856/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s53a.html|archive-date=2007-05-04|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|(1)  Subject to the Rules of Court, the Court may by order refer the proceedings in the Court, or any part of them or any matter arising out of them, to a mediator or an arbitrator for mediation or arbitration, as the case may be, in accordance with the Rules of Court. 

(1A)  Referrals under subsection (1) to a mediator may be made with or without the consent of the parties to the proceedings. However, referrals to an arbitrator may be made only with the consent of the parties.}} 

Case management in the State of New South Wales includes governing civil court proceedings by court management rules, which are the ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' (NSW)[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2005/28/full] and ''Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005'' (NSW)[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2005/418/full]. The overriding purpose of case management in the ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' is 'to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution' to the matter at dispute in the civil court proceedings (s56(1), ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' (NSW) [http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2005/28/part6/div1/sec56]).

In Australia, mediation as an [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) method is designed to avoid resorting to formal court-based adjudication and is now also being applied to criminal matters. Traditional theories of criminal justice view the matter as one between the offender and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Sarre, R. and Earle, K. (2004). Restorative Justice in Key Issues in Criminal Justice Sarre R, and Tomaino, J. (eds) Key Issues in Criminal Justice, Adelaide: Australian Humanities Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary to have the parties consent to the mediation process and a judge can direct the mediation. In this sense, case management is designed to identify and define issues in dispute and to reduce delays, costs and unnecessary pre-trial activities. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hat was born of resistance and opposition to the formal justice system has been extensively integrated and co-opted into the system.&lt;ref&gt;Astor, H &amp; Chinkin, C. M. (2nd Edition, 2002). Dispute Resolution in Australia. Sydney Australia.. LexisNexis Butterworths&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Legal writing''' involves the analysis of [[Fact pattern|fact patterns]] and presentation of arguments in documents such as legal memoranda and [[Brief (law)|briefs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/opia/what-is-public-interest-law/public-interest-work-types/legal-writing/|title=Legal Research and Writing {{!}} Harvard Law School|last=School|first=Harvard Law|work=Harvard Law School|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One form of legal writing involves drafting a balanced analysis of a legal problem or issue. Another form of legal writing is persuasive, and advocates in favor of a legal position. Another form legal writing involves drafting [[legal instrument]]s, such as [[contract]]s and [[Will and testament|wills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_writing|title=Legal writing|last=Staff|first=LII|date=2007-08-06|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing features==

=== Authority ===
Legal writing places heavy reliance on authority. In most legal writing, the writer must back up assertions and statements with [[Legal citation|citations]] to authority.  This is accomplished by a unique and complicated citation system, unlike that used in any other genre of writing.  The standard methods for American legal citation are defined by two competing rule books: the ''[[ALWD Citation Manual]]: A Professional System of Citation'' and ''The [[Bluebook]]: A Uniform System of Citation''. Different methods may be used within the United States and in other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Citation Guides/Authorities (U.S. Based)|url=https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=309930&amp;p=2070190|website=Harvard Law School Library|accessdate=25 February 2018|date=24 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226152027/https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=309930&amp;p=2070190|archive-date=2018-02-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citation Guides from Foreign Jurisdictions|url=https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=309930&amp;p=2070191|website=Harvard Law School Library|accessdate=25 February 2018|date=24 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226151940/https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=309930&amp;p=2070191|archive-date=2018-02-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Precedent ===
Legal writing values precedent, as distinct from authority. Precedent means the way things have been done before. For example, a lawyer who must prepare a [[contract]] and who has prepared a similar contract before will often re-use, with limited changes, the old contract for the new occasion. Or a lawyer who has filed a successful [[Motion (legal)|motion]] to dismiss a lawsuit may use the same or a very similar form of motion again in another case, and so on. Many lawyers use and re-use written documents in this way and call these re-usable documents ''templates'' or, less commonly, ''forms.''

=== Vocabulary ===
Legal writing extensively uses [[technical terminology]] that can be categorised in four ways:

# Specialized words and phrases unique to law, e.g., ''[[tort]]'', ''[[fee simple]]'', and ''[[novation]]''.
# Ordinary words having different meanings in law, e.g., ''action'' (lawsuit), ''[[consideration]]'' (support for a promise), ''execute'' (to sign to effect), and ''[[Party (law)|party]]'' (a principal in a lawsuit).
# Archaic vocabulary: legal writing employs many old words and phrases that were formerly quotidian language, but today exist mostly or only in law, dating from the 16th century; English examples are ''herein'', ''hereto'', ''hereby'', ''heretofore'', ''herewith'', ''whereby'', and ''wherefore'' ([[pronominal adverbs]]); ''said'' and ''such'' (as adjectives).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
# Loan words and phrases from other languages: In English, this includes terms derived from [[French language|French]] (''[[estoppel]]'', ''[[Laches (equity)|laches]]'', and ''[[voir dire]]'') and [[Latin]] (''[[certiorari]]'', ''[[habeas corpus]]'', ''[[prima facie]]'', ''[[inter alia]]'', ''[[mens rea]]'', ''[[sub judice]]'') and are not italicised as English legal language, as would be foreign words in mainstream English writing.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Formality ===
These features tend to make legal writing formal. This formality can take the form of long sentences, complex constructions, archaic and hyper-formal vocabulary, and a focus on content to the exclusion of reader needs. Some of this formality in legal writing is necessary and desirable, given the importance of some legal documents and the seriousness of the circumstances in which some legal documents are used. Yet not all formality in legal writing is justified. To the extent that formality produces opacity and imprecision, it is undesirable. To the extent that formality hinders reader comprehension, it is less desirable. In particular, when legal content must be conveyed to nonlawyers, formality should give way to clear communication.

What is crucial in setting the level of formality in any legal document is assessing the needs and expectations of the audience. For example, an appellate brief to the highest court in a jurisdiction calls for a formal style—this shows proper respect for the court and for the legal matter at issue. An interoffice legal memorandum to a supervisor can probably be less formal—though not colloquial—because it is an in-house decision-making tool, not a court document. And an email message to a friend and client, updating the status of a legal matter, is appropriately informal.

Transaction documents—legal drafting—fall on a similar continuum. A 150-page merger agreement between two large corporations, in which both sides are represented by counsel, will be highly formal—and should also be accurate, precise, and airtight (features not always compatible with high formality). A commercial lease for a small company using a small office space will likely be much shorter and will require less complexity, but may still be somewhat formal. But a proxy statement allowing the members of a neighborhood association to designate their voting preferences for the next board meeting ought to be as plain as can be. If informality aids that goal, it is justified.

Many U.S. law schools teach legal writing in a way that acknowledges the technical complexity inherent in law and the justified formality that complexity often requires, but with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and directness. Yet many practicing lawyers, busy as they are with deadlines and heavy workloads, often resort to a template-based, outdated, hyperformal writing style in both analytical and transactional documents. This is understandable, but it sometimes unfortunately perpetuates an unnecessarily formal legal writing style.

Recently a variety of tools have been produced to allow writers to automate core parts of legal writing. For example, automated tools may be used by transactional lawyers to check certain formalities while writing, and tools exist to help litigators verify citations and quotations to legal authority for motions and briefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citations and References: Let the computer do it|url=https://libguides.southernct.edu/c.php?g=179069&amp;p=1176746|website=Hilton C. Buley Library|publisher=Southern Connecticut State University|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories of legal writing==

Legal writing is of two, broad categories: (i) legal analysis and (ii) legal drafting. Legal analysis is two-fold: (1) predictive analysis, and (2) persuasive analysis. In the [[United States]], in most [[law school]]s students must learn legal writing; the courses focus on: (1) predictive analysis, i.e., an outcome-predicting memorandum (positive or negative) of a given action for the attorney's client; and (2) persuasive analysis, e.g., motions and [[Brief (law)|briefs]]. Although not as widely taught in law schools, legal drafting courses exist; other types of legal writing concentrate upon writing appeals or on interdisciplinary aspects of persuasion.

===Predictive legal analysis===

The legal memorandum is the most common type of predictive legal analysis; it may include the client letter or legal opinion. The legal memorandum predicts the outcome of a legal question by analyzing the authorities governing the question and the relevant facts that gave rise to the legal question. It explains and applies the authorities in predicting an outcome, and ends with advice and recommendations. The legal memorandum also serves as record of the research done for a given legal question. Traditionally, and to meet the legal reader's expectations, it is formally organized and written.

===Persuasive legal analysis===

The persuasive document, a motion or a brief, attempts to persuade a deciding authority to favorably decide the dispute for the author's client. Motions and briefs are usually submitted to judges, but also to mediators, arbitrators, and others. In addition a persuasive letter may attempt to persuade the dispute's opposing party.

[[Persuasive writing]] is the most rhetorically stylized. So although a brief states the legal issues, describes authorities, and applies authorities to the question—as does a memorandum—the brief's application portion is framed as an argument. The author argues for one approach to resolving the legal matter and does not present a neutral analysis.

===Legal drafting===
Legal drafting creates binding legal text. It includes enacted law like statutes, rule and regulations; contracts (private and public); personal legal documents like wills and trusts; and public legal documents like notices and instructions. Legal drafting requires no legal authority citation and generally is written without a stylised voice.

==Plagiarism==
In writing an objective analysis or a persuasive document, including a memorandum or brief, lawyers write under the same [[plagiarism]] rules applicable to most other writers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Lawyers: Don't Plagiarize Content For Your Websites|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/law-practice-management/lawyers-dont-plagiarize-content-your-websites|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=9 April 2018|date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with additional ethical implications for presenting copied materials as original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strickland|first1=Cooper J.|title=The Dark Side of Unattributed Copying and the Ethical Implications of Plagiarism in the Legal Profession|journal=North Carolina Law Review|date=1 March 2012|volume=90|issue=3|page=920|url=https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?httpsredir=1&amp;article=1464&amp;context=facpubs|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal memoranda and briefs must properly attribute quotations and source authorities; yet, within a law office, a lawyer might borrow from other lawyers' texts without attribution, in using a well-phrased, successful argument made in a previous brief.

Plagiarism is strictly prohibited in academic work, especially in [[law review]] articles, seminar papers, and similar writings intended to reflect the author's original thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunnewold|first1=Mary|title=Plagiarism: Proceed with Caution|url=https://abaforlawstudents.com/2011/09/01/plagiarism-proceed-caution/|website=ABA For Law Students|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=9 April 2018|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drafting of legal documents such as contracts is different as, unlike in most other legal writing categories, it is common to use language and clauses that are derived from [[form book]]s, legal opinions and other documents without attribution. Lawyers use forms documents when drafting documents such as contracts, wills, and judgments. The key difference between using phrases or paragraphs from other legal documents, and copying in other contexts or copying the entire document, arises from the fact that lawyers are effectively drawing upon a common pool of clauses that they adjust and modify for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Kenneth A.|title=Copyright and the Contract Drafter|journal=New York Law Journal|date=23 August 2006|url=http://www.adamsdrafting.com/downloads/Copyright-NYLJ-8.23.06.pdf|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plain language movement ==
The [[Plain Language Movement]] in legal writing involves an effort to avoid complex language and terminology in legal documents, to make legal writing more understandable and accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bryan Garner on Plain English|url=https://www.plainlanguage.gov/about/definitions/bryan-garner-on-plain-english/|website=plainlanguage.gov|publisher=Plain Language Action and Information Network|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of the movement is to reduce reliance on [[Jargon|terms of art]], words that have a specific meaning within the context of the law, but that may carry a different meaning in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butt|first1=Peter|title=What is plain language law and why use it?|url=http://www.lawfoundation.net.au/ljf/app/&amp;id=/2FD34F71BE2A0155CA25714C001739DA|website=Law and Justice Foundation|accessdate=25 February 2018|date=12 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalese===
{{Original research section|date=August 2013}}
''[[Legal English|Legalese]]'' is an English term first used in 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=legalese|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/legalese|website=Online Etymological Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for legal writing that is very difficult for laymen to read and understand, the implication being that this [[wikt:abstruse|abstruseness]] is deliberate for excluding the legally untrained and to justify high fees. ''Legalese'', as a term, has been adopted in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legalese|url=http://www.babylon-software.com/definition/legalese/French|website=Babylon (French)|publisher=Babylon Software Ltd.|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=estimación para el posterior deslinde en trámite de ejecución de sentencia|url=https://www.proz.com/kudoz/spanish_to_english/law_contracts/1551838-estimaci%C3%B3n_para_el_posterior_deslinde_en_tr%C3%A1mite_de_ejecuci%C3%B3n_de_sentencia.html|website=ProZ.com|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legalese is characterized by long sentences, many modifying clauses, complex vocabulary, high abstraction, and insensitivity to the layman's need to understand the document's gist. Legalese arises most commonly in legal drafting, yet appears in both types of legal analysis.

Some important points in the debate of "legalese" v. "plain language" as the continued standard for legal writing include:
* Public comprehensibility: Perhaps most obviously, legalese suffers from being less comprehensible to the general public than plain English, which can be particularly important in both private (e.g., contracts) and public matters (e.g., laws, especially in democracies where the populace is seen as both responsible for and subject to the laws).&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;{{cite web | last=Lundin | first=Leigh | url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=10866 | title=Buzzwords—Bang * Splat! | work=Criminal Brief | date=2009-12-31 | accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Resistance to ambiguity: Legalese may be particularly resistant to misinterpretation, be it incidental or deliberate, for two reasons:{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
#Its long history of use provides a similarly extensive background of precedent tied to the language.  This precedent, as discussed above, will be a strong determinant of how documents written in legalese will be interpreted.
#The legalese language itself may be more precise when compared to plain English, having arisen from a need for such precision, among other things.

Joseph Kimble, a modern plain-English expert and advocate, rejects the claim that legalese is less ambiguous in ''The Great Myth that Plain Language is not Precise''.&lt;ref&gt;7 Scribes J. Leg. Writing 109 (1998–2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Kimble says legalese often contains so many convoluted constructions and circumlocutions that it is more ambiguous than plain English.
* Coverage of contingencies: Legal writing faces a trade off in attempting to cover all possible contingencies while remaining reasonably brief.  Legalese is characterized by a shift in priority towards the former of these concerns.  For example, legalese commonly uses [[Legal doublet|doublets and triplets of words]] (e.g., "null and void" and "dispute, controversy, or claim") which may appear redundant or unnecessary to laymen, but to a lawyer might reflect an important reference to distinct legal concepts.

Plain-English advocates suggest that no document can possibly cover every contingency, and that lawyers should not attempt to encompass every contingency they can foresee. Rather, lawyers should only draft for the known, possible, reasonably expected contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darmstadter |first=Howard |title=Hereof, Thereof, and Everywhereof: A Contrarian Guide to Legal Drafting |edition=2 |year=2008 |publisher=American Bar Association |location=Chicago, Illinois 60610 |isbn=978-1-59031-9772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal status of [[bitcoin]] (and related crypto instruments) varies substantially from state to state and is still undefined or changing in many of them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3042248 Assessing the Differences in Bitcoin &amp; Other Cryptocurrency Legality Across National Jurisdictions] ''Information Systems &amp; Economics eJournal.'' Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed 25 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the majority of countries do not make the usage of bitcoin itself illegal, its status as money (or a commodity) varies, with differing regulatory implications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/coinmonks/cryptos-big-legal-problems-63b760385fea Crypto's Biggest Legal Problems] ''Crypto Law Review.''

While some states have ''explicitly'' allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently. While this article provides the legal status of bitcoin, regulations and bans that apply to this [[cryptocurrency]] likely extend to similar systems as well.

The European Union has passed no specific legislation relative to the status of bitcoin as a currency, but has stated that VAT/GST is not applicable to the conversion between traditional (fiat) currency and bitcoin.

VAT/GST and other taxes (such as income tax) still apply to transactions made using bitcoins for goods and services. {{r|"regulation"|page=European Union}}

In October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that "The exchange of traditional currencies for units of the 'bitcoin' virtual currency is exempt from VAT" and that "Member States must exempt, inter alia, transactions relating to 'currency, bank notes and coins used as legal tender{{'"}}, making bitcoin a currency as opposed to being a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The exchange of traditional currencies for units of the ‘bitcoin’ virtual currency is exempt from VAT|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-10/cp150128en.pdf|publisher=Court of Justice of the European Union|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bitcoin currency exchange not liable for VAT taxes: top EU court|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/22/us-bitcoin-tax-eu-idUSKCN0SG0X920151022|accessdate=23 October 2015|work=Reuters|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to judges, the tax should not be charged because bitcoins should be treated as a means of payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bodoni|first1=Stephanie|last2=Thomson|first2=Amy|title=EU's Top Court Rules That Bitcoin Exchange Is Tax-Free|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-22/bitcoin-virtual-currency-exchange-is-tax-free-eu-court-says-ig21wzcd|accessdate=23 October 2015|work=BloombergBusiness|agency=Bloomberg|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[European Central Bank]], traditional financial sector regulation is not applicable to bitcoin because it does not involve traditional financial actors.&lt;ref name=ECB&gt;{{cite book|title=Virtual Currency Schemes|date=October 2012|publisher=European Central Bank|location=Frankfurt am Main|isbn=978-92-899-0862-7|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf|format=PDF|author=European Central Bank|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} Others in the EU have stated, however, that existing rules can be extended to include bitcoin and bitcoin companies.{{r|"EUPARANNEX"}}

The European Central Bank classifies bitcoin as a convertible decentralized virtual currency.&lt;ref name="ECB" /&gt;{{rp|6}} In July 2014 the [[European Banking Authority]] advised European banks not to deal in virtual currencies such as bitcoin until a regulatory regime was in place.&lt;ref name=EBA&gt;{{cite web|title=EBA Opinion on 'virtual currencies'|url=http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/657547/EBA-Op-2014-08+Opinion+on+Virtual+Currencies.pdf|publisher=European Banking Authority|accessdate=8 July 2014|pages=46|format=pdf|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the European Parliament's proposal to set up a taskforce to monitor virtual currencies to combat money laundering and terrorism, passed by 542 votes to 51, with 11 abstentions, has been sent to the European Commission for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160524IPR28821/meps-call-for-virtual-currency-watchdog-to-combat-money-laundering-and-terrorism&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission also notably presented a "parallel" proposal aimed at preventing tax evasion techniques as revealed in the [[Panama Papers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coindesk.com/european-union-proposes-tighter-bitcoin-controls-panama-papers-response/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 it was revealed that the proposal will require cryptocurrency exchanges and [[cryptocurrency wallet]]s to identify suspicious activity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/the-european-union-wants-to-identify-bitcoin-users/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[G7]]'s [[Financial Action Task Force]] issued the following statement in guidelines which may be applicable to companies involved in transmitting bitcoin and other currencies, "Internet-based payment services that allow third party funding from anonymous sources may face an increased risk of [money laundering/terrorist financing]." They concluded that this may "pose challenges to countries in [anti-money laundering/counter terrorist financing] regulation and supervision".&lt;ref name=fatf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Guidance-RBA-NPPS.pdf|title=Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach: Prepaid Cards, Mobile Payments and Internet-based Payment Services|work=Guidance for a risk-based approach|publisher=Financial Action Task Force (FATF)|accessdate=6 March 2014|location=Paris|page=47|format=PDF|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the "Journal Officiel" (28 December 2017):

Art. 117. — The purchase, sale, use, and holding of so-called virtual currency is prohibited. Virtual currency is that used by internet users via the web. It is characterized by the absence of physical support such as coins, notes, payments by cheque or credit card. Any breach of this provision is punishable in accordance with the laws and regulations in force.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.joradp.dz/FTP/jo-francais/2017/F2017076.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, the monetary authorities also reacted in a statement issued jointly by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Bank Al-Maghrib and the Moroccan Capital Market Authority (AMMC), warning against risks associated with bitcoin, which may be used "for illicit or criminal purposes, including money laundering and terrorist financing".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ammc.ma/sites/default/files/communique%20monnaies%20virtuelles%20FR_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2017, Abdellatif Jouahri, governor of Bank Al-Maghrib, said at a press conference held in Rabat during the last quarterly meeting of the Bank Al-Maghrib's Board of 2017 that bitcoin is not a currency but a "financial asset", He also warned of its dangers and called for a framework to be put in place for consumer protection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.menara.ma/fr/actualit%C3%A9s/economie/2017/12/20/2333841-le-digital-champ-de-bataille-de-bank-al-maghrib-en-2018.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 17 January 2017, The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has passed a circular to inform all Nigerian banks that bank transactions in bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been banned in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.naij.com/1083244-central-bank-nigeria-bans-transaction-bitcoins-onecoin-others.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, during the year, the CBN (through its Deputy Director on Banking and Payments System, Musa Itopa-Jimoh) clarified the circular and its stance on bitcoin, citing that a lot of people misinterpret the central bank’s recent warning. It noted that  "Central bank cannot control or regulate bitcoin. Central bank cannot control or regulate blockchain. Just the same way no one is going to control or regulate the Internet. We don’t own it".&lt;ref&gt;https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-nigeria-says-we-cant-stop-bitcoin/&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, a committee was set up by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) to look into the possibility of the country adopting the technology driving bitcoin and other digital currencies – blockchain. The committee has submitted its report but "several sub-committees are still working on the issue" according to the Director, Banking &amp; Payments System Department at CBN, Mr. ‘Dipo Fatokun.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.today.ng/technology/internet/2575/nigeria-adopted-bitcoin-technology-cbn&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies dealing in virtual currencies must register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (Fintrac), implement compliance programs, keep the required records, report suspicious or terrorist-related transactions, and determine if any of their customers are "politically exposed persons."

The law applies to non-Canadian virtual currency exchanges if they have Canadian customers. Banks may not open or maintain accounts or have a correspondent banking relationship with companies dealing in virtual currencies if that company is not registered with Fintrac.

Dealers in digital currency are regulated as money services businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca/msb-esm/intro-eng.asp|title=Money services businesses (MSBs)|last=Canada|first=Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of|website=www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Assembly of Ecuador banned bitcoins including other decentralized digital/crypto currencies, due to the establishment of a new state-run electronic money system. Ecuador's new project would be controlled by the government and tied directly to the local currency—the dollar. Users will be able to pay for select services and send money between individuals.

As of February 2018 the Thai central bank has prohibited financial institutions in the country from five key cryptocurrency activities.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-thailand-bans-banks-from-cryptocurrency-activities/&lt;/ref&gt; These include 1) Investing or trading in cryptocurrency 2) Exchanging cryptocurrencies 3) Creating platforms for cryptocurrency trading 4) Allowing clients to use credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies 5) Advising customers on cryptocurrency investing and trading. Banks complying with these new rules include [[Bangkok Bank]], [[SIAM Commercial Bank]] and [[Krungsri]].

On 29-6-2018 The SEC and Revenue Department of Thailand announced that Bitcoin trading would be subject to 15% Capital Gains Tax and 7% VAT. Exchanges would be required collect 15% Withholding and 7% VAT on all trades. This will require all customers of Bitcoin Exchanges to provide purchase price information to the Exchange, who will be required to track and report all trades. This announcement has the potential to a) Make regulated exchanges unprofitable b) Move trading in Thailand to exchanges that have not registered and are prepared to run the risks associated this not registering c) Move Bitcoin buy/sell business to LocalBitcoins.com, unregulated and unregistered individual traders that do not follow KYC rules. Because the approach of the SEC and Revenue Department is to invite companies to register, but are still unclear on the logistics of collecting taxes, anyone registering takes on significant risk if the Revenue Department decides to change the rules and backdate the changes. Note: The Revenue Department will not allow trade losses to be offset against profits.

They added that trading virtual currencies in Poland does not violate national or EU law, however, having virtual "currencies", involves many risks: (1) risk related to the possibility of loss of funds due to theft, (2) risk related to lack of guarantee, (3) risk of lack of universal acceptability, (4) risk related to the possibility of fraud, (5) risk of high price change. Because of these risks, the NBP and KNF warn against buying virtual currencies and investing in them. The NBP and KNF recognize that the purchase, possession and sale of virtual currencies by entities supervised by the KNF (e.g. banks) would be burdened with high risk and would not ensure a stable and prudent management of the financial institution. Financial institutions should be cautious about engaging and cooperating with virtual currency "trading" entities.

The [[Swedish Tax Agency]] has given a preliminary ruling on Value Added Tax (VAT) on bitcoins, stating that trade in bitcoins is not subject to Swedish VAT, but is instead subject to the Finansinspektionen (Financial Supervisory Authority) regulations and treated as a currency. The decision has been appealed by the Swedish Tax Authority.{{r|"regulation"|page=Sweden}}

The Swedish jurisdiction is in general quite favorable for bitcoin businesses and users as compared to other countries within the EU and the rest of the world. The governmental regulatory and supervisory body [[Financial Supervisory Authority (Sweden)|Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority]] (Finansinspektionen) have legitimized the fast growing industry by publicly proclaiming bitcoin and other digital currencies as a means of payment. For certain businesses interacting with [[fiat money|fiat]] (mainly exchanges) the current regulation dictates that an application for approval/license must be filed and all the AML/CTF and KYC regulations applicable to more traditional financial service providers must be followed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3662">'''Letters rogatory''' or '''letters of request''' are a formal request from a [[court]] to a foreign court for some type of judicial assistance. The most common remedies sought by letters rogatory are [[service of process]] and taking of evidence.

==Taking of evidence==

Another reason why a court may require assistance from a foreign court is to obtain evidence from a witness. This evidence may be to answer questions relevant to the determination of an issue of fact, or for [[discovery (law)|disclosure]] of documents.

Courts usually have the power to [[subpoena]] witnesses only from within the jurisdiction of their own legislature unless they are aided by foreign legislative authority. For example, Alice in the [[United States]], could not summon Jean from [[France]] to the US courthouse. Instead, the US court would issue a letter rogatory to a French court, which would then examine Jean in France, and send a [[deposition (law)|deposition]] back to the requesting court.

Insofar as requests ''to'' US courts are concerned, the use of letters rogatory for requesting the taking of evidence has been replaced in large part by applications under 28 USC 1782, or [[Section 1782 Discovery]].

In many cases, the witness is willing to provide the testimony. However, the target court may compel the testimony of a witness who is unwilling to appear.

==Conventions==
In the past, letters rogatory could not usually be transmitted directly between the applicable courts, and they had to be transmitted via [[consular]] or [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] channels, which could make the whole process very slow. There have been various international conventions in regard to service of process and taking of evidence.

One of the earliest conventions to simplify the procedure of letters rogatory was the [[1905 Civil Procedure Convention]], signed at [[The Hague]]. Drafted only in [[French language|French]], it was ratified by only 22 countries. Later conventions, created after the institution of the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]], which was drafted in both [[English language|English]] and French, commanded more support.

The [[Hague Service Convention]], ratified in 1965, enabled designated authorities in each of the signatory states to transmit documents for service to each other, bypassing the diplomatic route. This convention has been ratified by 60 states, including the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], neither of which had ratified the 1905 convention. The [[Hague Evidence Convention]], ratified in 1970, formalised procedures for taking of evidence. It has been ratified by 43 states. For situations exclusively among [[Member States of the European Union]], two regulations ([[Council Regulation (EC) No. 1348/2000|1348/2000]] and [[Council Regulation (EC) No. 1206/2001|1206/2001]]) superseded the two Hague Conventions. The two regulations apply to each of the member states of the European Union with the exception of [[Denmark]],  which has [[opt-outs in the European Union|opted out]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2944">{{short description|Term in German constitutional law}}
The '''liberal democratic basic order''' ({{lang-de|freiheitliche demokratische Grundordnung}} (FDGO)) is a fundamental term in German constitutional law. It determines the unalienable, invariable core structure of the German commonwealth. As such, it is the core substance of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]].

The FDGO touches on the political order and the societal and political values on which German democracy rests. According to the [[Bundesverfassungsgericht|German constitutional court]], the free democratic order is defined thus:

:The free&lt;ref&gt;The German original says "freiheitlich", not "frei". See also [[liberalism]] and https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/freiheitlich&lt;/ref&gt; democratic basic order can be defined as an order which excludes any form of [[tyranny]] or [[arbitrariness]] and represents a governmental system under a rule of law, based upon self-determination of the people as expressed by the will of the existing majority and upon freedom and equality. The fundamental principles of this order include at least: respect for the [[human rights]] given concrete form in the Basic Law, in particular for the right of a person to life and free development; popular sovereignty; [[separation of powers]]; responsibility of government; lawfulness of administration; independence of the judiciary; the multi-party principle; and equality of opportunities for all political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Kommers (1980), p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the liberal democratic basic order has been and is being rejected by parts of the left spectrum, the [[Antifaschistische Aktion|Antifa]] as well as [[Right extremism|people on the extreme right]].

Parties as well as groups can be banned if they strive to abolish the FDGO, which has been done so successfully in regard to the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (1956) and the [[Socialist Reich Party]] (1952). In 2003 as well as in 2017, attempts to ban the [[National Democratic Party of Germany|National Democratic Party]] (NPD) failed. The willingness of a democracy to ban parties that endanger democracy itself has been termed "militant democracy", or "wehrhafte Demokratie" in German.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2680">'''List of criminal competencies''' is a listing of the various types of competencies relevant to the defendant in [[criminal law]] in the  [[United States]]. In the U.S. the  law is permeated with competency issues since a state may not subject an individual who is "incompetent" to trial on criminal charges. In insisting on this requirement the law is acting on the premise that society recognizes only the actions of an autonomous individual. This is a list of the most relevant competencies that must be evaluated (if a question of incompetency is raised) in order to proceed.&lt;ref name="melton1997"&gt;{{cite book

'''Old Russian Law''' or '''Russian Law''' is a legal system in [[Kievan Rus']] (since the 9th century), in later [[Rus' (region)|Old Rus' states]] (knyazhestva, or [[Principality|princedoms]] in the period of [[feudal fragmentation]]), in [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and in Moscow Rus' (see: [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and [[Tsardom of Russia]]). Main source was [[Early Slavs|Old Slavic]] [[Custom (law)|customary law]]: Zakon Russkiy (Law of [[Rus' people|Rus']]) (it was partly written in [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (disambiguation)|Rus'–Byzantine Treaties]]). Another sources were [[Viking Age|Old Scandinavian]] customary law (see: [[Varangians]]) and [[Byzantine law]] (since the 10th century).&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, Daniel H.

==History==

===Ryad===

According to Old Russian chronicles, in 862, [[East Slavs|Slavs]] and [[Baltic Finns|Finns]] invited Varangians under the leadership of prince [[Rurik]] to rule in their land:

{{quote|They said to themselves, "Let us seek a prince ''who may rule over us and judge us according to the Law''." They accordingly went overseas to the [[Rus' people|Varangian Russes]]: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called Swedes, and others Normans, English, and Gotlanders, for they were thus named. The [[Chud]]s, the Slavs, the [[Krivichs|Krivichians]], and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', "Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. ''Come to rule and reign over us''."|''The Laurentian Text of [[Primary Chronicle]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF|author=Samuel Hazzard Cross|editor1=Samuel Hazzard Cross|editor2=Olgerd P. Sherbowitz-Wetzor|title=The Russian Primary chronicle: Laurentian text|url=http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/dokumente/a/a011458.pdf|year=1953|publisher=[[Medieval Academy of America]]|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early Russian state settled on the oral treaty, or "'''ryad'''" (Old Russian: рядъ) between the prince ([[knyaz]]) with his armed force ([[druzhina]]) on the one hand, and tribal "nobility" and formally all people on the other hand. The prince and his druzhina defended people, decide lawsuits, provided trade and built towns. And people paid [[tribute]] and took part in [[irregular military]]. During the ensuing centuries the ''ryad'' was playing an important role in Old Russian princedoms: the prince and his administration (druzhina) found their relationship with people ("all land", "all townsmen" in Old Russian chronicles) on the treaty. A breach of the treaty could result in exile of the prince ([[Iziaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslav Yaroslavich]] and [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod Yaroslavich]]) or even in murder of the prince ([[Igor of Kiev|Igor Rurikovich]] and [[Igor II of Kiev|Igor Olgovich]]).&lt;ref&gt;Melnikova, Elena.

One of the result of [[Rus'–Byzantine War (disambiguation)|Rus'–Byzantine War]]s was conclusion of [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (disambiguation)|Treaties with Byzantine]] in the 10th century, where, apart from Byzantine legal rules, also Zakon Russkiy (Law of Rus') - rules of Old Russian oral [[Custom (law)|customary law]] reflected.

[[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]'s Pravda of the beginning of the 11th century was the first written law in Rus'. This short [[Code (law)|code]] regulated the relationship between the princely druzhina ("rusins") and the people ("slovenins") concerning [[criminal law]]. After Yaroslav's death, his sons [[Iziaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslav]], [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod]], [[Sviatoslav II of Kiev|Svyatoslav]] and their druzhina got together and promulgated a code concerning the violation of property rights in princely lands (Pravda of Yaroslav's sons) in the middle of the 11th century. Yaroslav's Pravda and Pravda of Yaroslav's sons became a basis for the Short edition of Russkaya Pravda.

In the period of [[Vladimir II Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh]]'s reign at the beginning of the 12th century, the Vast edition of Russkaya Pravda was given, which contained rules of criminal, [[Procedural law|procedural]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] law, including trade, [[Family law|family]] law and rules of the bond of obligation.

Later written secular law also included statutory charters, trade treaties, statutes of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], big codes of Moscow Rus' - Sudebniks (see below), and other texts.

===[[Byzantine law]] and church law===
Translations of Byzantine legal codes, including [[Nomocanon]], were widely spread in Old Rus' (see: [[Kormchaia]], [[Merilo Pravednoye]]),&lt;ref&gt;Schapov, Yaroslav. ''Byzantine and [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] Legal Heritage in Rus' at 11-13th centuries'' / ed. by Lev Cherepnin. - Moscow: [[Nauka (publisher)|Nauka]], 1978. – 290 p. ({{lang-ru|Щапов Я.Н. Византийское и южнославянское правовое наследие на Руси в XI–XIII вв. / отв. ред. Л.В. Черепнин. – М.: Наука, 1978. – 290 с.}}).&lt;/ref&gt; but it wasn't widely applied in secular or church legal practice, restricted mainly in [[canon law]]. The Church in Old Rus' did not have wide influence and depended on the power of the state. Thus, church law mainly dealt with family law and sanctions against moral violation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Zhivov|Zhivov, Viktor]]. ''The History of Russian Law as a Linguistic and [[Semiotics|Semiotic]] Problem'' // Zhivov, Viktor. Investigations in the Field of History and Prehistory of Russian Culture. - Moscow: Yazyki Slavyanskoy Kultury ("Languages of Slavic culture"), 2002. – P. 187–305. ({{lang-ru|Живов В.М. История русского права как лингвосемиотическая проблема // Живов В.М. Разыскания в области истории и предыстории русской культуры. – М.: Языки славянской культуры, 2002. – С. 187–305}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philip Morris v. Uruguay case'''  ({{lang-es|'''Caso Philip Morris contra Uruguay'''}}) started on 19 February 2010, when the multinational [[tobacco company]] [[Philip Morris International]] filed a complaint against [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |title = Philip Morris versus Uruguay |author = El Espectador |date = 9 March 2010 |accessdate = 15 November 2010 |language = Spanish |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100314160056/http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |archivedate = 14 March 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cigarette_packet_foil.JPG|150px|right|thumb|Cigarette box of the company Philip Morris.]]
[[File:Flag of Uruguay.svg|150px|right]]

On 19 June 2003, when the Uruguayan President was [[Jorge Batlle]], the [[General Assembly of Uruguay]] approved the [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], an agreement whereby Policies recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] were implemented.

In 2006, Uruguay under President [[Tabaré Vázquez]], an [[oncologist]] by profession, began to enact comprehensive [[smoking ban|anti-smoking legislation]].
On 1 March 2006, Uruguay became the first country in [[Latin America]] to prohibit smoking in enclosed public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/461696-uruguay-cree-que-philip-morris-incumplio-pasos-previos-a-la-demanda| title = Uruguay cree que Philip Morris incumplió pasos previos a la demanda |author =LR21| date =9 July 2011|accessdate =4 August 2011|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 the legislature approved Law 18.256 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|title = Ley Nº 18.256 Control del Tabaquismo|author = Uruguay Legislature|date = 6 March 2008|accessdate = 10 March 2009|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140416104642/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|archivedate = 16 April 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes six strategies of anti-smoking policy.

Some of the measures by the government were the ban on selling different types of presentations of the same brand of cigarettes, the dissemination of images warning about the risks of smoking and covering at least 80% of the cigarette pack, raising of taxes, banning cigarette advertising in the media, and banning sponsorship of sports events. In addition, smoking was banned in public places such as offices, student centers, bars, restaurants, dances and public places, among others.

The smokefree campaign "Libre de Humo de Tabaco" was gradually implemented by the "Ministerio de Salud Pública del Uruguay" ([[List of Ministers for Public Health (Uruguay)|Ministry of Public Health of Uruguay]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|title = Campaña "Libre de Humo de Tabaco"|author = MSP|accessdate = 15 November 2010|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615005816/http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|archivedate = 15 June 2010|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complaint ==

[[Philip Morris International]] is a multinational company, a leading producer of cigarettes, of which it owns seven out of twenty global brands.

The tobacco company initiated a claim in the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID), a part of the [[World Bank]] seeking $25 million in compensation from Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Alfred-Maurice de Zayas]]|title=How can Philip Morris sue Uruguay over its tobacco laws?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/16/philip-morris-uruguay-tobacco-isds-human-rights|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that forum, an arbitration tribunal was formed with one arbitrator appointed by each party and a third arbitrator elected by the arbitrators appointed by the parties. The plaintiffs are FTR Holding SA (Switzerland), Philip Morris Products SA (Switzerland) and Abal Hermanos SA (PMI representative in Uruguay) against Uruguay (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet|title = ICSID - Case Details|author = [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]]|date = 26 March 2010|accessdate =17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Morris has filed similar cases against [[Norway]] and [[Australia]].

== Decision == 
On 2 July 2013, the tribunal decided it had jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw1531.pdf |title =Decision on Jurisdiction |date=4 July 2013|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution of the case, which affected international&amp;nbsp;[[jurisprudence]], took 6 years; the case ended on 8 July 2016. The [[World Bank]] [ICSID] ruled in favor of Uruguay, forcing the demandant to pay the costs of the defendants and the court.
The final report established that [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] had to pay 7 million [[dollars]] to the country for judicial expenses, in addition to paying different amounts for the fees and administrative expenses of the three arbitrators and the CADI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/fallo-favorable-uruguay-juicio-philip-morris.html|title = Philip Morris deberá pagar a Uruguay US$ 7 millones por gastos judiciales|author = [[El País (Uruguay)|El País]]|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Born]] emitted a discordant decision in two of the points of the judicial failure.

== Effects ==

According to Enrico Bonadio, Senior Lecturer in Law at [[City University London]], the ruling in the case "may make it more difficult for tobacco companies to use lawsuits to produce a “[[chilling effect]]” and so discourage countries from introducing tobacco control policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/uruguays-victory-against-big-tobacco-is-more-than-just-a-local-triumph-62319|title=Uruguay's victory against Big Tobacco is more than just a local triumph|author= theconversation|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10179">The '''political climate''' is the aggregate mood and opinions of a political society at a particular time. It is generally used to describe when the state of mood and opinion is changing or unstable rather than in a state of equilibrium. The phrase has origins from both [[ancient Greece]] and medieval-era [[France]].

While the concept of a political [[climate]] has been used historically to describe both [[politics]] and public reactions to political actions in various forms, the naming of the concept by the addition of the modifier “political” to the base “climate” has been fairly recent. [[Public opinion]] is also widely used incorrectly as a synonym for political climate.

As for judging what the climate is at any given time, there is no way to know an entire country's views on certain subjects. So, [[Opinion poll|polls]] are used to estimate what the political climate "feels" like on a regular basis. However, this only works to some degree as polls cannot involve the entire population at once.

==Etymology==

===Climate===
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the base climate comes from the Middle French ''climat'', which was first used to describe a region's prevailing weather conditions around 1314.&lt;ref&gt;"climate." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50041503?query_type=word&amp;queryword=climate&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-tXioM1-15462&amp;hilite=50041503&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded uses of climate as a description of prevailing political attitudes was in The Vanity of Dogmatizing by [[Joseph Glanvill]] in 1661 where he mentions “divers Climates of Opinions”.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, Joseph. The Vanity of Dogmatizing. London: H. Eversden, 1661. 227. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
The modifier (''politic'' with the ''–al'' suffix) comes originally from the ancient Greek noun ''polis'' which referred to both a Greek city state, and the ideal state or government.&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary"&gt;"politic." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182868?query_type=word&amp;queryword=politic&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-Cqhody-15489&amp;hilite=50182868&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this evolved through the Latin noun ''politicus'' which is defined as the civil government,&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary" /&gt; to the Middle French adjective ''politique'' which is the state of government, or relating to government.&lt;ref&gt;"polis." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182842?query_type=word&amp;queryword=polis&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;search_id=T1SE-DsbNxa-15502&amp;result_place=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

===Historical example===
{{Main article|Trial of Socrates}}
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787).]]

From 431 B.C.E to 404 B.C.E., ancient Greece was torn apart by the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War. Gutenburg: Project Gutenburg, 2009. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; The war concluded with an Athenian defeat and several years of oppression by pro-Spartan rulers. By 399 B.C.E, Athens had returned to self-rule through revolution. At this time, Athens was undergoing social turmoil due to the apparent failure of democracy as an effective form of government, which created a public backlash against anything anti-democratic. 

Socrates—the self-described "gadfly" of Athens because of his practice of ''elenchos'' (critical interrogation)—was seen by many as anti-democratic and thus a traitor to Athens due to his associations with Critias and Alcibiades (the former a Spartan supported tyrant, the latter a deserter to Sparta) and his frequent praises of the Spartan and Creten governments because of their similarity to many of his philosophical opinions on government.&lt;ref&gt;Bagby, Laurie. Political Thought: A Guide to The Classics. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Group, 2002. 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing political climate of distrusting anything remotely anti-Athens or anti-democracy coupled with attacks from Socrates's personal enemies led to the philosopher's execution by poison in 399 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, C.D.C. ''The Trials of Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
{{Main article|Public opinion}}
The phrase originates from the French term ''opinion publique'', which was first attributed to [[Montaigne]], the father of modern [[Skepticism]] and a major figure of the [[French Renaissance]], around 1588 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, Wolfgang. ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue. The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts. [[Public opinion]] is the aggregate logical thoughts that the public thinks and expresses about an issue (which does not have to be political in nature), while political climate is what the public's emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are.

Depending on the nature of the thoughts (if they are considered controversial or extreme), the emotional reaction can range from nothing to a highly violent state. Accordingly, controversial issues in the public eye are usually accompanied by or can even produce a polarizing political climate. For example, the introduction, passing, and court fight over [[Proposition 8]] in [[California]] brought a controversial issue into the public sphere, which resulted in such a drastic change in the political climate of the [[United States]] as to produce many protests throughout the nation, some of them violent.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Maura. "Prop. 8: Protesters on both sides of gay-marriage issue make their views known outside courthouse." Los Angeles Times 6 December 2010: Web. 8 December 2010. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/demonstrators-proposition-8.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion polls===
An [[opinion poll]] is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample. For determining the political climate, this usually would be a [[cross-sectional data|cross-section]] of the population in question. Opinion polls conduct series of questions and then extrapolate the average opinion of the sample according to their answers. However, opinion polls generally have appreciative margins of error because of the inability to survey the entire population and the improbability of surveying a perfectly random cross-section of the population. For example, the [[Wall Street Journal]] estimated in 2006 that the average margin of error is about 3-5% in opinion polls because of a wide variety of potential inaccuracies such as [[response bias]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref&gt;Bialik, Carl. "Grading the Pollsters." Wall Street Journal 16 November 2006: Web. 22 September 2010.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116360961928023945%23mod=2_1125_1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls are also known to be entirely incorrect when predicting the outcome of certain events. The best-known example of this is the [[1948 US presidential election]], in which the prediction was that [[Thomas Dewey]] would easily defeat [[Harry Truman]]. Major polling organizations, including [[George Gallup|Gallup]] and [[Elmo Roper|Roper]], indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when, in fact, Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree, Steve. "Strom Thurmond and the 1948 Election." Gallup Brain: A Publication of Gallup, Inc. (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://www.gallup.com/poll/7444/gallup-brain-strom-thurmond-1948-election.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 saw the validity of opinion polls enter the debate once more, as polls in both the UK "[[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit]]" referendum and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|US presidential election]] were ultimately shown to be largely incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/09/how-the-pollsters-got-the-us-election-wrong---just-like-brexit/|title=How the pollsters got the US election wrong - just like Brexit|newspaper=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls widely predicted a win for [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton]], while instead [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican candidate Donald J. Trump]] won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] and, therefore, the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/|title=Why 2016 election polls missed their mark|date=2016-11-09|newspaper=Pew Research Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Politics of the International Space Station'''  begins with the 1972 milestone in co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union in space, the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. This cooperative venture resulted in the July 1975 docking of [[Soyuz 19]] with an [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo]] spacecraft. From 1978 to 1987, the USSR's [[Interkosmos]] programme included allied Warsaw Pact countries, and countries which were not Soviet allies, such as India, Syria and France, in manned and unmanned missions to Space stations Salyut 6 and 7. In 1986 the USSR extended this co-operation to a dozen countries in the [[Mir]] programme. From 1994 to 1998, NASA Space Shuttles and crew visited MIR in the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]]me. In 1998, assembly of the [[International Space Station]] began.&lt;ref name="OnOrbit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |title=On-Orbit Elements |publisher=NASA |author=NASA |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029013438/http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, a meeting in Quebec City between the leaders of the Canadian Space Agency and those from Japan, Russia, the United States and involved European nations resulted in a renewed pledge to maintain the International Space Station until at least 2020. NASA reports to be still committed to the principles of the mission but also to use the station in new ways, which were not elaborated. CSA President Steve MacLean stated his belief that the station's Canadarm will continue to function properly until 2028, alluding to Canada's likely extension of its involvement beyond 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Canada+renews+pledge+International+Space+Station+until+2020/6235789/story.html Canada renews pledge to International Space Station until 2020.] The Vancouver Sun. 1 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of modules, station usage by participant nations, and responsibilities for station resupply are established by the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). This international treaty was signed on 28 January 1998 by the United States of America, Russia, Japan, Canada and eleven member states of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom).&lt;ref name="PartStates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html|title=Human Spaceflight and Exploration—European Participating States|accessdate=17 January 2009|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|title=ISS Intergovernmental Agreement|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=19 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610083738/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|archivedate=10 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the United Kingdom, all of the signatories went on to contribute to the Space Station project. A second layer of agreements was then achieved, called Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), between NASA and ESA, CSA, RKA and JAXA. These agreements are then further split, such as for the contractual obligations between nations, and trading of partners' rights and obligations.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; Use of the Russian Orbital Segment is also negotiated at this level.&lt;ref name="RSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_rsa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Russian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heads of both the South Korean and Indian space agency [[ISRO]] announced at the first plenary session of the 2009 [[International Astronautical Congress]] that their nations wished to join the ISS programme, with talks due to begin in 2010.

The Russian part of the station is operated and controlled by the Russian Federation's space agency and provides Russia with the right to nearly one-half of the crew time for the ISS. The allocation of remaining crew time (three to four crew members of the total permanent crew of six) and hardware within the other sections of the station is as follows: ''[[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]]'': 51% for the ESA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; ''[[Japanese Experiment Module|Kibō]]'': 51% for the JAXA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_japan.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Government of Japan Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=24 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Destiny (ISS module)|Destiny]]'': 97.7% for NASA and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_csa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Canadian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crew time, electrical power and rights to purchase supporting services (such as data upload and download and communications) are divided 76.6% for NASA, 12.8% for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manifest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/iss_manifest.html|title=Consolidated Launch Manifest|accessdate=8 July 2008|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSSM"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Harland|title=The Story of Space Station Mir|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York Inc|date=30 November 2004|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-23011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more footnotes|date=April 2014}}'''Public law'''  is that part of [[law]] which governs relationships between individuals and the [[government]], and those relationships between individuals which are of direct concern to [[society]].&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt; Public law comprises [[constitutional law]], [[administrative law]], [[tax law]] and [[criminal law]],&lt;ref name="oxdic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Law|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198607563|author=Elizabeth A. Martin|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as all [[procedural law]]. In public law, [[Default rule|mandatory rules]] prevail. Laws concerning relationships between individuals belong to [[private law]].

The relationships public law governs are asymmetric and unequal – government bodies (central or local) can make decisions about the rights of individuals. However, as a consequence of the [[rule of law]] doctrine, authorities may only act within the law (''secundum et intra legem''). The government must obey the law. For example, a citizen unhappy with a decision of an administrative authority can ask a court for [[judicial review]].

[[Rights]], too, can be divided into ''private rights'' and ''public rights''. A paragon of a public right is the right to [[welfare|welfare benefits]] – only a [[natural person]] can claim such payments, and they are awarded through an administrative decision out of the [[government budget]].

The distinction between public law and private law dates back to [[Roman law]]. It has been picked up in the countries of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law tradition]] at the beginning of the nineteenth century, but since then spread to [[Common law (legal system)|common law countries]], too.

The borderline between public law and private law is not always clear in particular cases, giving rise to attempts of [[Jurisprudence|theoretical]] understanding of its basis.

==Public law in civil law and common law jurisdictions==
{{See also|Magna Carta}}

[[Rule of law]], the idea that the administration of the state should be controlled by a set of laws, originated in [[Greek Antiquity]] and was revitalized by modern philosophers in France ([[Rousseau, Jean Jacques|Rousseau]]), Germany ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]) and Austria in the 18th century. It is related to the strong position of the central government in the era of [[enlightened absolutism]], and was inspired by the [[French Revolution]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]]. It developed hand in hand with the creation of [[civil code]]s and [[criminal code]]s.

==Areas of public law==

=== Constitutional law ===
In modern states, [[constitutional law]] lays out the foundations of the state. Above all, it postulates the supremacy of law in the functioning of the state – the [[rule of law]].

Secondly, it sets out the form of government – how its different branches work, how they are elected or appointed, and the division of powers and responsibilities between them. Traditionally, the basic elements of government are [[Executive (government)|the executive]], [[Legislature|the legislature]] and [[Judiciary|the judiciary]].

And thirdly, in describing what are the basic [[human rights]], which must be protected for every person, and what further [[civil and political rights]] citizens have, it sets the fundamental borders to what ''any'' government must and must not do.

In most jurisdictions, constitutional law is enshrined in a written document, the [[Constitution]], sometimes together with amendments or other constitutional laws. In some countries, however, such a supreme entrenched written document does not exist for historical and political reasons – the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]] is an unwritten one.

=== Administrative law ===
'''[[Administrative law]]''' refers to the body of law which regulates bureaucratic managerial procedures and defines the powers of administrative agencies. These laws are enforced by the [[executive (government)|executive branch]] of a [[government]] rather than the [[judiciary|judicial]] or [[legislature|legislative]] branches (if they are different in that particular jurisdiction). This body of law regulates [[international trade]], [[manufacturing]], [[pollution]], [[tax]]ation, and the like. This is sometimes seen as a subcategory of [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] and sometimes seen as public law as it deals with regulation and public institutions

=== Criminal law ===
'''[[Criminal law]]''' involves the state imposing sanctions for defined crimes committed by individuals or businesses, so that society can achieve its brand of [[justice]] and a peaceable [[social order]].

==Theoretical distinction between private and public law==
In German-language legal literature, there is an extensive discussion on the precise nature of the distinction between public law and private law. Several theories have evolved, which are neither exhaustive, nor are they mutually exclusive or separate from each other.

The '''interest theory''' has been developed by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] jurist [[Ulpian]]: "''Publicum ius est, quod ad statum rei Romanae spectat, privatum quod ad singulorum utilitatem.'' (Public law is that, which concerns Roman state, private law is concerned with the interests of citizens.) The weak point of this theory is that many issues of private law also affect the public interest. Also, what exactly is this public interest?

The '''subjection theory''' focuses on explaining the distinction by emphasizing the subordination of private persons to the state. Public law is supposed to govern this relationship, whereas private law is considered to govern relationships where the parties involved meet on a level playing field. This theory fails in areas commonly considered private law which also imply subordination, such as [[labour law|employment law]]. Also, the modern state knows relationships in which it appears as equal to a person.

The '''subject theory''' is concerned with the position of the subject of law in the legal relationship in question. If it finds itself in a particular situation as a public person (due to membership in some public body, such as a state or a municipality), public law applies, otherwise it is private law.

A '''combination of the subjection theory and the subject theory''' arguably provides a workable distinction. Under this approach, a field of law is considered public law where one actor is a public authority endowed with the power to act unilaterally (''imperium'') and this actor uses that ''imperium'' in the particular relationship. In other words, all depends whether the public authority is acting as a public or a private entity, say when ordering office supplies. This latest theory considers public law to be a special instance.

There are areas of law, which do not seem to fit into either public or private law, such as [[labour law|employment law]] – parts of it look like private law (the employment contract), other parts like public law (the activities of an employment inspectorate when investigating workplace safety).

The distinction between public and private law might seem to be a purely academic debate, but it also affects legal practice. It has bearing on the delineation between competences of different courts and administrative bodies. Under the [[Austrian constitution]], for example, private law is among the exclusive competences of federal legislation, whereas public law is partly a matter of [[States of Austria|state]] legislation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2436">In the [[United States]], a '''slip law''' is an individual [[Act of Congress]] which is either a [[public law]] (Pub.L.) or a [[Private bill|private law]] (Pvt.L.). They are part of a three-part model for [[publication]] of [[Federal statute]]s consisting of slip laws, [[session law]]s, and [[Codification (law)|codification]].

'''Tanistry''' is a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] system for passing on titles and lands.  In this system the '''Tanist''' ({{lang-ga|[[Tánaiste]]}}; {{lang-gd|Tànaiste}}; {{lang-gv|Tanishtey}}) is the office of heir-apparent, or second-in-command, among the (royal) [[Gaels|Gaelic]] [[patrilineal]] dynasties of [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Isle of Man|Mann]], to succeed to the [[Chiefs of the Name|chieftainship]] or to the [[kingship]].

==Origins==
Historically the Tanist was chosen from among the heads of the ''roydammna'' or "righdamhna" (literally, those of ''kingly material'') or, alternatively, among all males of the ''[[Sept (social)|sept]]'', and elected by them in full assembly.  The eligibility was based on patrilineal relationship, which meant the electing body and the eligibles were [[agnate]]s with each other.  The composition and the governance of the clan were built upon male-line descent from a similar ancestor. The office was noted from the beginning of recorded history in Ireland, and probably pre-dates it.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Early Irish laws and institution'' (1934) Eoin MacNeill stated that, according to the annal evidence, tanistry originated only about century after the Anglo-Norman invasion, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; A story about [[Cormac mac Airt]] refers to his eldest son as his Tanist.  Following his murder by a member of the [[Deisi]], another ''roydammna'', [[Eochaid Gonnat]], succeeded as king.

In Ireland, the tanistry continued among the dominant dynasties, as well as lesser lords and chieftains, until the mid-16th/early 17th century when it was replaced by English common law.&lt;ref&gt;''Case of Tanisrry'' (1608), Davis 28 180 E.R 516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGinty,M. 2017 Tanistry, primogeniture and divided clans https://soundcloud.com/history-hub/matthew-mcginty-tanistry-primogeniture-and-divided-clans?in=history-hub/sets/2017-tudor-and-stuart-ireland&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1943 Ireland appointed its first new [[Chief Herald of Ireland|Chief Herald]], it did not reintroduce tanistry. The state granted courtesy recognition to Irish chiefs based on [[primogeniture]] from the last known chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/chiefs/register.htm |title=Irish Chiefs: Historical Background and a Register |work=Irish Chiefs |publisher=Centre for Irish Genealogical and Historical Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gaels exported tanistry and other customs to those parts of Scotland which they controlled after 400 [[Common Era|CE]].  The [[Picts]] (the other indigenous people of today's [[Scotland]]), did not share the succession principles of their neighbours of Ireland and Scottish Gaels.  No female succession, or male succession via female lines, is allowed in the Irish and Gaelic succession model.  By contrast, Pictish succession often used links through females (maternal grandson was apparently preferred heir to grandfather; and/or maternal nephew to uncle in Pictish custom).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The royal succession in Celtic Scotland was limited to the elective [[Patrilineality#Agnatic succession|agnatic]] or male line of the ''Siol Alpein'' ([[House of Alpin]]) until the accession of [[Malcolm II of Scotland|King Malcolm II]] in 1005. This monarch was the first to introduce the concept of hereditary monarchy in Scotland.  He did so to try to eliminate the strife caused by the [[elective monarchy|elective law]], which encouraged rival claimants to fight for the Throne.  Since Malcolm had only daughters, he also introduced the right of female-line succession in Scotland.  This gave rise to conflict by competitors for generations thereafter. The Irish monarchies never at any stage allowed for female line succession, a position which is maintained to the present day.

==Candidates and functions==
{{Essay-like|section|date=June 2018}}
The Tanist held office for life and was required by custom to be of full age, in possession of all his faculties and without any remarkable blemish of mind or body. At the same time, and subject to the same conditions, a tanist or next heir to the Monarchy was elected, who if the king died or became disqualified, at once became king. Most usually a former king's son became tanist (sometimes the son of the king simultaneously elected, however perhaps more often a son of a rival branch of the dynasty), but not because the system of [[primogeniture]] was in any way recognised; indeed, the only principle adopted was that the dignity of chieftainship should descend to the eldest and most worthy of the same male-line blood of the clan.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Image:Flag of Ulster.svg|thumb|The [[flag of Ulster]] with the [[Red Hand of Ulster|Red Hand]].]]
The usual rules for qualification as a ''roydammna'' was that a candidate had to be a member of the ''[[Derbfine|"Derbfhine"]]'', a kindred all descended in the male line from a common ancestor (usually a great-grandfather). This is recalled in the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of representatives of the many clans and septs descended from the [[Uí Néill]] royal dynasty, many of which feature the Red Hand. The joints in the fingers, the fingernails, and the hand, represented the four/five generations that qualified for inclusion within the ''Derbfhine''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This meant that the group became highly exclusive, keeping the kingship within the dynasty. Many in the wider clan might be reduced to gentry or peasant status (though they might share the surname). These features make tanistry an [[Patrilineality#Agnatic succession|agnatic succession]] mode, and a succession by appointment, as it was an [[elective monarchy]]. Tanistry evades the basic requirement of the [[hereditary monarchy]], i.e. that the outcome of the succession is predictable, up to the identity of successor and next heirs, by [[genealogy]].

The downside of the large group of eligibles was that increases in ''roydammna'' in each generation might lead to internecine dynastic civil war.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Such was the case among the descendants of King and High King [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] (1088–1156). His dynasty, the ''Sil Muirdeag'' (who took the surname hUa Conchobhair/O'Connor), had successfully ruled as [[List of kings of Connacht|Kings of Connacht]] since at least the mid-5th century. Their increasing consolidation via the annexation of the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Meath|Mide]] and [[Kingdom of Dublin|Dublin]], plus suborning neighboring states and lordships to vassalage, led to Tairrdelbach becoming the first of his dynasty to become High King.

Competition between Tairrdelbach's many sons caused corrosive warfare among at least four competing main lines, in addition to allied lordships' and kingdoms' striving for the main chance. Coupled with the incursions of the [[Normans]] from 1169 onwards, this fragmented Ó Conchobhar rule. By the early 16th century, they were reduced to ruling a fraction of their former patrimony.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Another example of ''Derbfhine'' or ''Roydammna'' proliferation comes from the ''[[Annals of Connacht]]''. It states that at the [[Second Battle of Athenry]] in August 1316, in addition to King Tadc Ó Cellaig of [[Uí Maine]], "there fell with him ... twenty-eight men who were entitled to succeed to the kingship of Uí Maine."{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Further points==
This system often led to rotation among the most prominent branches of the clan or the reigning house, particularly in the [[Middle Ages]]. Tanistry, though not necessarily intended to be so, was perceived to create balance between branches of family. A quite usual pattern was that the chief (king, lord) was succeeded by his Tanist, elected earlier and from another branch than that which the incumbent chief belonged to. Perhaps simultaneously upon that succession, a Tanist was elected from another branch, to fill the position vacated by the one now risen to chieftainship. He may have come from the branch to which the deceased belonged. The next vacancy would be handled in a similar way. If a chieftain attempted to have his own son (or brother) chosen over a representative of another branch, the electors were outraged, as they feared subjugation to one branch.

In 1296, the Bruce candidate to inherit the crown of Scotland pleaded the traditional tanistry in his favor. In terms of [[primogeniture]], he was from a cadet branch of the old royal descent, and thus would not have succeeded. The idea of rotation and balance (and his seniority in physical age and experience) made him a credible competitor. A Pictish aspect was that both the [[House of Balliol]] and Bruce descended through female lines from the royal house, and were allowed to present candidacy. Bruce also claimed tanistry through a female line. (This may be an indication that in Scotland, Pictish and Gaelic succession rules were intermingled. The judicial resolution of the succession quarrel, directed by the English king, favoured the Balliols on the basis of primogeniture. Subsequent political events reverted that result to a more "clannish-tradition" direction. [[Robert the Bruce]], grandson of the candidate who argued for tanistry, ascended the throne despite descending from a rather junior [[cadet branch|cadet line]] of the original Royal House. All future monarchs of Scotland after that succeeded by the rights of the Bruce.)

Tanistry as the system of succession left the headship open to the ambitious. It was a frequent source of strife both in families and between the clans, but it was conversely quasi-democratic. Tanistry was abolished by a legal decision during the reign of [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]], who later was named James I of England and Ireland. The [[English land law]] was substituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AILR/2001/37.html#Heading3 |title=The Case of Tanistry (Le Case de Tanistry) |journal=Australian Indigenous Law Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of succession of the [[House of Alpin]] of [[list of Scottish monarchs|Scottish monarchs]] (a dynasty legendarily of mixed Pictish and Gaelic origin) and their successors, abided by tanistry rules until at least 1034. They also used them in certain successions in the 1090s, and tanistry was used as an argument in succession litigation as late as the 1290s. A similar system operated in [[Wales]], where under [[Welsh law]] any of the sons or brothers of the king could be chosen as the ''[[edling]]'' or heir to the kingdom.

==Current political uses==
The word is preserved in the government of the [[Republic of Ireland]], where the prime minister is the ''[[Taoiseach]]'' while the deputy prime minister is the ''[[Tánaiste]]''.

==Uses in literature and popular culture==
* The concept of the tanist or substitute for the [[sacred king]] was incorporated as a central element in Sir [[James Frazer]]'s study of European mythologies, ''[[The Golden Bough]]''.
* The figure of the tanist has appeared in modernist poetry, such as [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]''.
* The tanist influenced [[Robert Graves]]' interpretation of ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' (1955) and ''[[The White Goddess]]''.
* In the "Proteus" episode of  ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', [[James Joyce]] used the term in an [[irony|ironic]] context.
* In the [[Deryni novels|Deryni novel]] ''[[The Bishop's Heir]]'' by [[Katherine Kurtz]], the character [[Dhugal MacArdry]] is Tanist of Clan MacArdry. After his actual parentage becomes more widely known (he is the only child of the secret marriage between then-Lord [[Duncan McLain]] and Lady Maryse MacArdry) late in ''[[The King's Justice]]'', Dhugal's gillie Ciard O Ruane tells [[Kelson Haldane|Kelson]] and Cardiel: "I canna' speak for the clan, Sair, but young Dhugal is ''my'' chief, an' will be sae long as he lives, whether he's Caulay's son or only his grandson. Th' borders inherit by tanistry. Dhugal was ''chosen'' as th' next chief, an' could hae been, even if he'd been nae blood relative to Caulay at all. I dinna' think yon Duke of Cassan [Duncan] can pass his title in th' same manner, however."
* In the "[[Sister Fidelma]]" series by [[Peter Tremayne]].
* In the [[Paradox Interactive]] Grand Strategy Game ''[[Crusader Kings II]]'' Tanistry is available as an optional succession law when playing as a ruler of the Celtic culture (Irish, Scottish, Breton or Welsh).

==Blood tanistry==
Blood tanistry is the principle that "the most talented male member of the royal dynasty should inherit the throne, commonly by murder and war".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Fletcher|Fletcher, Joseph]].  1979.  "Turco-Mongolian Monarchic Traditions in the [[Ottoman Empire]]”, ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'' 3: 236–251&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to describe the practical ramifications of the Turco-Mongol, as well as other [[Central Asian]] steppe [[nomad]], principles of inheritance and succession.  Because all male members of the royal clan are considered to have equally legitimate claims on power, the ruler is the individual who eliminates competitors and re-subjugates the rest of the state formation.  The structure may be determined by bonds of personal loyalty to the ruler, which are considered to be dissolved on the ruler's death.

A '''term of office''' is the length of time a person serves in a particular [[elected office]]. In many jurisdictions there is a defined limit on how long terms of office may be before the officeholder must be subject to [[re-election]]. Some jurisdictions exercise [[term limits]], setting a maximum number of terms an individual may hold in a particular office.

==United Kingdom==
Being the origin of the [[Westminster system]], aspects of the [[United Kingdom]]'s system of government are replicated in many other countries.
===Monarch===
The [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|monarch]] serves as head of state until his or her death or [[abdication]].

===House of Commons===
{{seealso|House of Commons of the United Kingdom}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] Members of Parliament (MPs) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] are elected for the duration of the parliament. Following [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolution]] of the Parliament, a [[General elections (UK)|general election]] is held which consists of simultaneous elections for all seats. For most MPs this means that their terms of office are identical to the duration of the Parliament, though an individual's term may be cut short by death or [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation]]. An MP elected in a [[UK Parliamentary by-elections|by-election]] mid-way through a Parliament, regardless of how long they have occupied the seat, is not exempt from facing [[re-election]] at the next general election.

The [[Septennial Act 1715]] provided that a Parliament expired seven years after it had been summoned; this maximum period was reduced to five years by the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. Prior to the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] parliaments had no minimum duration. Parliaments could be dissolved early by the monarch at the [[Prime Minister]]'s request. Early dissolutions occurred when the make-up of Parliament made forming government impossible (as occurred in [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|1974]]), or, more commonly, when the incumbent government reasoned an early general election would improve their re-election chances (e.g. [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]]). The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 mandated that Parliaments should last their full five years. Early dissolution is still possible, but under much more limited circumstances.

Because the [[government of the United Kingdom|government]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] are effectively [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] through the Commons, the terms of Parliaments and MPs do not directly apply to offices of government, though in practice these are affected by changes in Parliament. While, strictly speaking, a Prime Minister whose incumbency spans multiple Parliaments only serves one, unbroken, term of office, some writers may refer to the different Parliaments as separate terms.&lt;ref name="Thatcher 3terms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Margaret Thatcher|url=http://www.biography.com/people/margaret-thatcher-9504796|website=Biography.com|accessdate=5 February 2016|quote="During her three terms…"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Lords===
[[Hereditary peer]]s and [[life peers]] retain membership of the [[House of Lords]] for life, though members can resign or be expelled. [[Lords Spiritual]] hold membership of the House of Lords until the end of their time as bishops, though a senior bishop may be made a life peer upon the end of their bishopric (e.g. [[George Carey]], made ''Baron Carey of Clifton'' the day after he ceased being [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]).
===Devolved administrations===
The [[devolution|devolved administrations]] in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are variations on the system of government used at [[Westminster]].

The office of the leader of the devolved administrations has no numeric term limit imposed upon it. However, in the case of the [[Scottish Government]] and the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] there are fixed terms for which the [[legislatures]] can sit. This is imposed at four years. Elections may be held before this time but only if no administration can be formed, which has not happened yet.
===Other elected offices===
Offices of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] other regional elected officials follow similar rules to the national offices discussed above, with persons elected to fixed terms of a few years.

==United States==

===Federal===
{{main|Federal government of the United States}}
In the [[United States]], the [[president of the United States]] is elected indirectly through the [[United States Electoral College]] to a four-year term, with a [[term limit]] of two terms (totaling eight years) or a maximum of ten years if the president acted as president for two years or less in a term where another was elected as president, imposed by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1951.

The [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] serves four-year terms. [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] serve two-year terms. [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] serve six-year terms. 

[[Federal judges]] have different terms in office. [[Article I and Article III tribunals|Article I judges]]; such as those that sit on the [[United States bankruptcy court]]s, [[United States Tax Court]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]], and certain other [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] and other forms of [[United States administrative law|adjudicative bodies]] serve limited terms: The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for 15 years, bankruptcy courts for 14. However, the majority of the federal judiciary; Article III judges, such as those of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], [[United States court of appeals|courts of appeal]], and [[United States district court|federal district courts]]; serve for life.

===State and territories===
{{main|State governments of the United States}}
The terms of office for officials in state governments varies according to the provisions of [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] and [[state law]].

The term for [[state governor]]s is four years in all states but [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]]; the [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont]] and [[Governor of New Hampshire|New Hampshire governors]] serve for two years.

The [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] reported in January 2007 that among [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429232858/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/legismgt/about/numoflegis.htm]:
*44 states had terms of office for the [[lower house]] of the state legislature (often termed the state House of Representatives) at two years. Five ([[Alabama House of Representatives|Alabama]], [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana]], [[Maryland House of Delegates|Maryland]], [[Mississippi House of Representatives|Mississippi]], and [[North Dakota House of Representatives|North Dakota]]) had terms of office at four years. (The [[Nebraska Legislature]] is an exception and has a [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] with members elected for four years.)
*37 states had terms of office for the [[upper house]] of the state legislature (often termed the state Senate) at four years. Twelve ([[Arizona Senate|Arizona]], [[Connecticut Senate|Connecticut]], [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia]], [[Idaho Senate|Idaho]], [[Maine Senate|Maine]], [[Massachusetts Senate|Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire Senate|New Hampshire]], [[New York State Senate|New York]], [[North Carolina Senate|North Carolina]], [[Rhode Island Senate|Rhode Island]], [[South Dakota Senate|South Dakota]], [[Vermont Senate|Vermont]]) had terms of office at two years.

Among [[territories of the United States]]:
*In the [[American Samoa Fono]], members of the [[American Samoa House of Representatives|House]] serve two-year terms while members of the [[American Samoa Senate|Senate]] serve six-year terms.
*Members of both chambers of the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico]] have four-year terms.
*Members of both chambers of the [[Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature]] have two-year terms.
*The [[Legislature of Guam]] and [[Legislature of the Virgin Islands]] are unicameral and Senators have two-year terms.

Members of [[Council of the District of Columbia]] serve a four-year term.

==Canada==
As a former British territory following the [[Westminster System]], there are many similarities with the United Kingdom, although with some variations based on local customs, the federal system of government and the absentee monarch.
===Monarch===
Being a [[Commonwealth realm]], Canada shares a [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]] with the United Kingdom and 14 other countries, who serves as head of state of all 16 realms until their death or abdication.

===Viceroys===
The [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] is appointed by the monarch as his/her personal representative on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], and serves [[At Her Majesty's Pleasure|for an indefinite term]], though the normal convention is 5 years. Similarly, the [[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governors]], who represent the monarch at the provincial level, are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister (usually also with consultation of the relevant provincial [[Premier (Canada)|premier]]), and generally also serve 5 year terms by convention. The territories have [[Commissioner#Canadian territories|Commissioners]], who are not representatives of the monarch, but are instead appointed by and represent the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]] (i.e. the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]]), and conventionally serve for about 5 years.

===House of Commons===
{{seealso|House of Commons of Canada}}

Similar to the United Kingdom, MPs serve for the duration of the Parliament. They may resign before the end of a Parliament or be elected in [[By-election|by-elections]] during the middle of a Parliament.

Under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], a Parliament may last for a maximum of 5 years from the most recent election before expiring, although all Parliaments to date have been dissolved before they could expire. Bill C-16, introduced in the [[39th Canadian Parliament|39th Parliament]], provided for fixed election dates every 4 years on the third Monday in October, beginning in 2009. However, the Prime Minister may still advise the Governor General to dissolve Parliament at any time. 

As in the United Kingdom, the cabinet and head of government are indirectly elected based on the composition of the House of Commons, they are not technically affected by the terms of legislators or Parliaments. In practice however, the terms of government office holders are affected by changes in the House of Commons, and those who serve for multiple consecutive Parliaments are generally considered to have served a single term. The term of a government generally ends when it is defeated on a confidence matter or the governing party fails to gain enough seats in a general election.

===Senate===

Senators are appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] to represent a province by the Governor General of Canada on the advice of the Prime Minister, and serve until the mandatory retirement age of 75. Senators appointed before the passage of the [[British North America Act, 1965]] served for life. Senators may also resign from office or be expelled from the Senate.

===Provincial and Territorial Legislatures===
{{seealso|Legislative assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories}}

Provincial legislatures and the legislature of the Yukon function very similarly to the federal House of Commons. MLAs (called MPPs in [[Ontario]], MNAs in [[Quebec]], and MHAs in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]) serve for the duration of the legislature, though they may resign before the legislature is dissolved or be elected in by-elections between general elections. The legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] operate using a [[Consensus government in Canada|consensus]] model, but are similar otherwise. The premiers and their cabinets are selected in the same way as in the House of Commons, and like at the federal level, the term of a provincial government can be ended by defeat in a general election or the loss of the legislature's confidence.

All provincial legislatures except that of [[Nova Scotia]] have fixed-term election legislation in place, as does the legislature of the Northwest Territories. Premiers may also advise Lieutenant Governors to dissolve legislatures at any time before the prescribed election date.

Numbers in years unless stated otherwise. Note that some countries where [[fixed-term election]]s are uncommon, the legislature is almost always dissolved earlier than its expiry date. "[[Life tenure|Until removed from office]]" refers to offices that don't have fixed terms; in these cases, the officeholder(s) may serve indefinitely until death, abdication, resignation, retirement, or forcible removal from office (such as [[impeachment]]).

In cases where the [[head of government]] is a different person from the head of state, its term of office is identical to the chamber that elected it (the legislature if it is unicameral, or most usually the [[lower house]] if it is bicameral), unless it doesn't survive a [[vote of no confidence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18959">The '''Uniform Task-Based Management System''' ('''UTBMS''') is a set of codes designed to standardize categorization and facilitate analysis of legal work and expenses. UTBMS was produced through a collaborative effort among the [[American Bar Association]] Section of Litigation, the [[American Corporate Counsel Association]], and a group of major [[corporation|corporate]] clients and [[law firm]]s coordinated and supported by Price Waterhouse LLP (now [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]).  UTBMS codes are now maintained and developed by the [[Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard]] (LEDES) Oversight Committee.

==Background==
UTBMS coding is reflected in legal bills sent from a [[law firm]] to its [[corporation|corporate]] clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Uniform Task-Based Management System |publisher=American Bar Association |url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/resources/uniform_task_based_management_system.html |accessdate=27 Feb 2016 | quote=The Uniform Task-Based Management System enables lawyers to budget and bill by litigation task, aiding client and counsel in understanding, managing and conducting litigations. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Law firms will usually use coding on time and expenses only for those clients who explicitly request it. Most clients who use UTBMS also require electronic billing, usually with an invoice in a LEDES e-billing format.

Fees, which are charges for [[Lawyer|attorney]] and [[paralegal|legal assistant]] time, are coded with task and activity codes. There are four sets of task codes: [[Litigation]], Counseling, Project and [[Bankruptcy]]. The set used for a given matter (i.e., case or transaction) depends upon the nature of that matter. Tasks may be summarized into phases. Tasks are often reported without reporting the phase, as this can be deduced from the task. The phase/task hierarchy is uniform in the Litigation and Bankruptcy task code sets. In the Project set, only the second phase contains multiple tasks. The Counseling set has only a single level. (In such situations, a code may be considered both a phase and a task, and it may be necessary to program the time and billing software this way.) There is a single set of activity codes, which is used in conjunction with each of the four task code sets. There is also a single set of expense codes, which are independent of phase, task and activity codes.

The codes themselves are composed of a letter (the first letter of the task code set), followed by a three-digit number. Tasks sharing the same letter and first digit belong to the same phase.

From time-to-time, the LEDES Oversight Committee, the administrative body which oversees these codes, adds and changes codes. In 2011, a set of "eDiscovery" codes were ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Roach |first=Michael |date=20 Sep 2012 |title=LEDES Adds Activity, Expense to E-Discovery Billing Codes | work=EDD Update |publisher=ALM | url= http://www.eddupdate.com/2012/09/ledes-adds-activity-expense-to-e-discovery-billing-codes-.html | accessdate=27 Feb 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=UTBMS eDiscovery Code Set |publisher=EDRM |publication-place= |page= |url=http://www.edrm.net/projects/metrics/utbms |accessdate=27 Feb 2016 | quote=The LEDES Oversight Committee (LOC) Uniform Task Based Management System (UTBMS) eDiscovery Code Set, ratified in 2011, is based on the EDRM Metrics Code set. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, the LOC ratified a set of Governance, Risk and Compliance codes based on the Open Compliance &amp; Ethics Group (OCEG) GRC Capability Model.
