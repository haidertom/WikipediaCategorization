'''Agonism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀγών ''agon'', "struggle") is a political theory that emphasizes the potentially positive aspects of certain (but not all) forms of political conflict. It accepts a permanent place for such conflict, but seeks to show how people might accept and channel this positively. For this reason, agonists are especially concerned with debates about [[democracy]]. The tradition is also referred to as '''agonistic pluralism'''.

==Agonism and other traditions in political thought==

Agonism is opposed to a strand in the [[Marxist]] conception of politics known as "[[materialism]]". [[Karl Marx|Marx]] would have agreed with the agonists that society had always been full of conflict, when he wrote: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref&gt;Marx &amp; Engels, ''Manifesto of the Communist Party'', 1848, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm Chapter 1].&lt;/ref&gt; He also thought that the causes of conflict were inescapable features of present—i.e., [[capitalist]]—society. But, in his view, history would develop in such a way as to eventually destroy capitalism, and replace it with a harmonious society—which was his conception of communism. Especially during the 1960s and 1970s, many people, academics included, subscribed to a roughly Marxist analysis. Since then, some of those people have come to the view that the "[[historical materialism|materialist conception of history]]" does not give sufficient reason for hope about a harmonious society to come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chantal Mouffe]] and [[Ernesto Laclau]] are amongst those who have come to agonism from a background in Marxism and the social movements of the middle part of the last century.&lt;ref name="redpepper.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.redpepper.org.uk/natarch/XRADDEM.HTML]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chantal Mouffe says, "I use the concept of agonistic pluralism to present a new way to think about democracy that is different from the traditional liberal conception of democracy as a negotiation among interests and is also different from the model that is currently being developed by people like [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[John Rawls]]. While they have many differences, Rawls and Habermas have in common the idea that the aim of the democratic society is the creation of a consensus, and that consensus is possible if people are only able to leave aside their particular interests and think as rational beings. However, while we desire an end to conflict, if we want people to be free we must always allow for the possibility that conflict may appear and to provide an arena where differences can be confronted. The democratic process should supply that arena."&lt;ref&gt; MOUFFE, C. (2000) The Democratic Paradox. London, New York. Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agonism, not antagonism==
Agonism is not simply the undifferentiated celebration of [[wikt:Special:Search/antagonism|antagonism]]:
{{quote|Agonism implies a deep respect and concern for the other; indeed, the Greek ''agon'' refers most directly to an athletic contest oriented not merely toward victory or defeat, but emphasizing the importance of the struggle itself—a struggle that cannot exist without the opponent. Victory through forfeit or default, or over an unworthy opponent, comes up short compared to a defeat at the hands of a worthy opponent—a defeat that still brings honor. An agonistic discourse will therefore be one marked not merely by conflict but just as importantly, by mutual admiration...|Political theorist [[Samuel Chambers]]&lt;ref name="ctheory.net"&gt;[http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=317]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Bonnie Honig]], an advocate of agonism, writes: "to affirm the perpetuity of the contest is not to celebrate a world without points of stabilisation; it is to affirm the reality of perpetual contest, even within an ordered setting, and to identify the affirmative dimension of contestation".&lt;ref name="ctheory.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
''Political Theory and the Displacement of Politics'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical conceptions==
The work of [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Michel Foucault]] have also invoked conceptions of agonism and the agon in a more critical sense beyond that of political counter-hegemony. Although this usage of Agonism has been largely ignored it has been explored at some length by Claudio Colaguori in ''Agon Culture: Competition, Conflict and the Problem of Domination''. For Colaguori, "the agon is literally the arena of competition, the scene of contest, and the locus of adversarial conflict. The philosophy of agonism affirms the idea that transcendence, truth, and growth are generated from the outcome of the contest...the concept of agonism is often understood in an affirmative sense as the generative principle of economy, society and even natural ecology and personal growth... The ambivalent character of agonism is that it is often seen as a mode of transcendence, while its instrumental relation to the mode of destruction is rarely acknowledged".&lt;ref&gt;"C Colaguori" Agon Culture: Competition, Conflict and the Problem of Domination. de Sitter Publications, Whitby, Ontario, {{ISBN|978-1-897160-63-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agonism forms part of the instituted social order where society "produces and reproduces itself precisely from the interconnection of the antagonistic interests of its members" (Adorno, 1974).&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Adorno, 1974, "Minima Moralia". London: Verso Editions&lt;/ref&gt;

For Adorno, agonism is also about the "[[theodicy]] of conflict" where opponents "want to annihilate one another... to enter the agon, each the mortal enemy of each" (Minima Moralia). Adorno also sees agonism as the underlying principle in [[Hegel]]'s [[dialectic of history]] where "dialectics (growth through conflict) is the [[ontology]] of the wrong state of things. The right state of things would be free of it: neither a system nor a contradiction" (Negative Dialectics). Colaguori reconstructs the concept of the agon to invoke this critical, destructive aspect as a way of extending Adorno's critique of modern domination and identify how the normalization and naturalization of conflict is used as an ideology to justify various forms of domination and subjugation. The agonistic ideology that has been appropriated by popular culture for example makes use of agonistic themes to celebrate competition as the wellspring of life in such a way as to normalize "a military definition of reality" (C. W. Mills).

The critical conception of agonism developed by Adorno and Foucault emphasizes how aspects of competition can be utilized to reinforce the project of domination that is evident in the geopolitics of modernity. Colaguori suggests that a critical conception of agonism can be applied to the study of "numerous forms of social conflict in gender, class and race relations where the competitive mode of interaction prevails in the formation of social hierarchies based on competition as a form of exclusion". Colaguori further states that, "after 100 years of technological progress, human societies are trapped in a perpetual dynamic of conflict and crisis, with modernization at a standstill. While this dialectic of development and destruction has been analysed from political and economic perspectives, Agon Culture offers an analysis of the human condition through an examination of the way in which the cultural ideology of competition operates as a mode of rationality that underpins the order of domination."

==Agonism in fiction==
The [[science fiction]] novel ''Lady of Mazes'' by [[Karl Schroeder]] depicts a post-human future where "agonistics" is the ruling principle of the solar system. The story explains agonistics as "You can compete, and you can win, but you can never win once-and-for-all". A character gives two examples of agonism: a presidency with [[term limit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and laws aimed at preventing corporate monopolies.&lt;ref name= "KSchroeder"&gt;Karl Schroeder ''Lady of Mazes'', Tor, {{ISBN|0-7653-1219-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anatomically correct doll''' or '''anatomically precise doll''' is a [[doll]] with some of the [[Sex organ|primary]] and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s of a human. In colloquial vernacular it usually refers to the genitals being depicted. This can be for realism or educational purposes, as well as to satisfy inanimate [[fetishism]]. A very detailed type of anatomically correct doll may be used in questioning children who may have been [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]]. The use of dolls as interview aids has been criticized, and the validity of information obtained this way has been contested.&lt;ref name="ceci" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Segal" /&gt;

== Overview ==
Some children's baby dolls and [[Toilet training|potty training]] dolls are anatomically correct for educational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://babyproducts.about.com/od/bathsdiaperspotties/a/bestpottytrain.htm |title=Great Toddler Potty Training Products |accessdate=28 November 2008 |author=Heather Corley |work=About.com  |publisher=About.com |quote=Examples are a great way to reinforce potty training concepts for toddlers. What better example than a doll that drinks water and then uses the potty, just like your toddler? The Emma (girl) and Paul (boy) potty training dolls from Corolle are anatomically correct and come with a refillable water bottle and a doll-sized potty chair.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also dolls that are used as medical models, particularly in explaining [[medical procedure]]s to child patients. These have a more detailed depiction of the [[human anatomy]] and may include features like removable internal organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=If a Doll Wears an Eye Patch, I Can Too  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/21/garden/if-a-doll-wears-an-eye-patch-i-can-too.html?sec=health |quote=With her son's experience in mind, Ms. Zayka, a former research chemist, designed an anatomically correct, life-size boy doll.

Other dolls which are customized and enjoyed by adults are sometimes anatomically correct, like [[reborn doll|reborn baby dolls]] and Asian [[ball-jointed doll]]s.

The dolls are also sometimes used by parents or teachers as [[sex education]].

[[Sex doll]]s are sometimes also referred to as anatomically correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Only For The Very Lonely |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/14/magazine/sunday-september-14-1997-only-for-the-very-lonely.html |quote=McMullen claims that his original intent was simply to create art -- a movable sculpture -- and share pictures of it on line, and that he went into business only after being flooded with E-mails asking if the dolls were ''anatomically correct'' and for sale.

==Forensic use==
A particular type of anatomically correct dolls are used in law enforcement and therapy. These dolls have detailed depictions of all the primary and secondary sexual characteristics of a human: "oral and anal openings, ears, tongues, [[nipples]], and hands with individual fingers" for all and a "[[vagina]], [[clitoris]] and [[breasts]]" for each of the women and a "[[human penis|penis]] and [[testicles]]" for each of the men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.migima.com/ Migima] manufacturer of anatomically correct dolls&lt;/ref&gt;

These dolls are used during interviews with children who may have been [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]].&lt;ref name="larsson_cite_cohn"&gt;Cohn, D. S. (1991). "Anatomic doll play of preschoolers referred for sexual abuse and those not referred". ''Child Abuse &amp; Neglect'' 15:455 – 466.; Everson &amp; Boat, 1991; Jampole, L. &amp; Weber, M. K. (1987). "An assessment of the behavior of sexually abused and nonabused children with anatomically correct dolls". ''Child Abuse &amp; Neglect'': 11 187 – 192.; Sivan, A., Schor, D., Koeppl, G., Noble, L. (1988). "Interaction of normal children with anatomic dolls". ''Child Abuse &amp; Neglect'', 12:295 – 304. Cited in Larsson, 2000, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The dolls wear removable clothing, and the anatomically correct and similarly scaled body parts ensure that sexual activity can be simulated realistically.

While there are supporters of the use of anatomically correct dolls in questioning victims of sexual abuse, there are also critics of this practice.&lt;ref name=ceci&gt;{{cite book |last=Ceci  |first=Stephen J. |authorlink= |author2=Maggie Bruck |title=Jeopardy in the Courtroom: A Scientific Analysis of Children’s Testimony |year=1995 |publisher= |page=162 |isbn=1-55798-632-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that because of the novelty of the dolls, children will act out sexually explicit maneuvers with the dolls even if the child has not been sexually abused.&lt;ref name="ceci" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Segal"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Daniel L. Segal, Michel Hersen|title=Diagnostic Interviewing|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|isbn=1441913203|year=2009|page=455|accessdate=November 23, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfDRjsei03kC&amp;pg=PA455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism is that because the studies that compare the differences between how abused and non-abused children play with these dolls are conflicting (some studies suggest that sexually abused children play with anatomically correct dolls in a more sexually explicit manner than non-abused children, while other studies suggest that there is no correlation), it is impossible to interpret what is meant by how a child plays with these dolls.&lt;ref name="ceci" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7809">Lady '''Barbara Montague''' (ca. 1722 – August 1765) was a philanthropist and charity worker, who sponsored programs to assist primarily poor women. As an unmarried woman, and due to illness unable to live with family, she created an alternate family situation that allowed her independence. Joining a community of women in Bath, the group pooled their resources to provide support for each other and others in their community. Upon her death, she left bequests to continue providing for those who had been important in caring for her in her lifetime.

==Early life==
Lady Barbara Montague, known as "Lady Bab" was born around 1722 to the [[George Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax]]&lt;ref name="ODNB-Kelly"&gt;{{cite ODNB|last1=Kelly|first1=Gary|title=Scott [née Robinson], Sarah (1720–1795; Also including Lady Barbara Montagu (c.1722–1765)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/68975|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=23 July 2017|location=Oxford, England|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/68975|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lady Mary Lumley, the daughter of [[Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough]].{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=299}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lundy|first1=Darryl|title=George Montague, 1st Earl of Halifax|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p2934.htm#i29332|website=The Peerage.com|accessdate=23 July 2017|location=Wellington, New Zealand|date=16 May 2015|postscript=. Self-published but with cited sources.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents had six daughters, and one son, who would become [[George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax]], after changing his surname when he married the heiress Anne Richards, a legatee of Sir Thomas Dunk.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|pp=32, 299}} Upon their father's death, each of his daughters was apportioned £5,000. Lady Bab's income was placed in an annuity giving her an annual income of around £100.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=32}}

==Later life==
Though unacceptable for unmarried women to live alone in the period, Lady Bab, who suffered from a serious heart condition, was unsuited for marriage, or taking residence with any of her sisters, as she could not bear the hectic pace of court life.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=299}}
In 1748 Montigue met [[Sarah Scott]], an English novelist and translator, who was the daughter of Elizabeth (née Drake) and Matthew Robinson, both from distinguished Yorkshire families. One of twelve children, Sarah was close to her sister [[Elizabeth Montagu]], a leader of the [[Blue Stockings Society]], when they were growing up.&lt;ref name="ODNB-Kelly" /&gt; But, after Sarah's severe bout with [[smallpox]] in 1741, she was deemed no longer a suitable catch for marriage and instead sought solace in writing.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=296}} The two women, unable to find a place in the patriarchal society, forged a household together in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] among a community of women who found themselves in similar circumstances.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|pp=295, 310–311}} 

Lady Bab was involved in charitable works, such as creating educational cards to sell with the proceeds dedicated to assist a poor neighbor. The cards contained geographical, historical, and mathematical facts and were used as flash cards. She was also involved in a scheme, which she encouraged Sarah to join, to have poor women knit mittens, that they then sold to their circle of friends. Montagu inspired her companion's dedication to charity and Sarah began holding Sunday school classes for children.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=310}} When Scott married in 1751, it was understood that Lady Bab was to be part of the household. In less than a year, Sarah's father and brother removed her from her marital home&lt;ref name="ODNB-Kelly" /&gt; and the two women rejoined the community in Bath. The separation agreement left Sarah with only a small allowance, as her husband returned only a portion of her [[dowry]], making the pooling of the women's resources a necessity.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=305}}{{sfn|Elliott|2002|p=35}}

Among the women in their community, which included Elizabeth Cutts, [[Sarah Fielding]] and possibly [[Jane Collier]], was an agreement that they would support each other psychologically and financially, so that they did not become dependent on others. They encouraged each other to publish, to raise funds to complete charitable works.{{sfn|Rizzo|2008|p=307}} For example, Lady Bab paid for the publishing of a book, ''The Histories of Some of the Penitents in the Magdalen House, as Supposed to Be Related by Themselves'' which was printed anonymously in 1759 so that its royalties might support the author.{{sfn|Ogborn|1998|p=53}} The book deals with penitent prostitutes and the preface, written by Lady Bab, defends the benefits of charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiebe|first1=Heather|title=Spectacles of Sin and Suffering: ''La Traviata'' in Victorian London|journal=repercussions|date=Fall 2001|volume=9|issue=2|page=41|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~repercus/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/repercussions-Vol.-9-No.-2-Wiebe-Heather-Spectacles-of-Sin-and-Suffering.pdf|accessdate=23 July 2017|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|location=Berkeley, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; They organized a small [[industrial school]] to teach basic skills to poor girls, as well as a few boys.

'''Bike rage''' refers to acts of verbal or gestural anger or physical aggression between [[cyclists]] and other users of bike paths or roadways, including pedestrians, other cyclists, motorcyclists, or drivers. Bike rage can consist of shouting at other road users, making obscene gestures or threats, hitting or punching, or in rare cases, even more violent acts. The term can refer either to acts committed by cyclists&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008&gt;{{cite web|first=Charles |last=Montogomery |date=July 1, 2008 |title=Bike Rage |work=Momentum |url=http://momentummag.com/features/bike-rage/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220214828/http://momentummag.com/features/bike-rage/ |archivedate=2013-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by drivers.&lt;ref name=Creagh2008&gt;{{cite news |first=Sunanda |last=Creagh |date=August 2, 2008 |title=Sydney's drivers 'worst' for bike rage |work=The Sydney Morning Herald

==Causes==
[[File:Traffic jam Rio de Janeiro 03 2008 28.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Some transportation experts argue that traffic congestion may be a contributing factor to driver frustration and bike rage.]]
A bike rage incident can start because a cyclist, driver, or pedestrian believes that another road user was being discourteous, breaking traffic rules, or in many cases because someone felt that their safety was being compromised by the actions of another road user. According to University of Hawaii professor of psychology Leon James, "bike rage is a common occurrence, and quite predictable", because urban commuting causes "tension, anxiety, and anger – in drivers as well as cyclists".&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008/&gt; Montogomery claims some cyclists hit cars using a "classic U-lock bash-and-run" tactic. He argues that "some cyclists consider such attacks acts of driver education". Montogomery claims the "...problem is that city planners have mixed bikes and cars together in ways that offer little certainty about how each should operate, and lots of chances for conflict". As such, "cyclists feel threatened in traffic" and "...hard done by and under attack."&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008/&gt;
 
An article in ''Toronto Life'' magazine argues that the "...source of the problem [bike and road rage] is neither the arrogance of drivers nor the militancy of cyclists, but the environment in which they interact." The article claims that the "...urban grid, already congested with cars, is being flooded with cyclists...intensifying competition for road space." One issue is that "[d]rivers are not sufficiently alert to the presence and the quickness of cyclists". A possible explanation for all of the aggression that occurs between cyclists and drivers is the anonymity of the big city: "...they know they will never run into that person again."&lt;ref name="torontolife.com"&gt;All the Rage
The tension between drivers and cyclists has escalated to swearing, punching, bird-flipping hysteria. City hall thinks additional bike lanes will calm everybody down. What if they’re wrong? By Philip Preville. In ''Toronto Life'' magazine. Available at: http://www.torontolife.com/features/all-rage/?pageno=1&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the S.F. Bicycle Coalition argues that "Road rage is a symptom of a contradiction between the image and promise of cars and the reality," because "You never see a car ad showing someone stuck in traffic." After an altercation between cyclists and police, an observer noted that "The sheep -- like the man who was just riding to the gym and decided to join and have a little fun -- were bewildered, angry, defiant. Turned into wolves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/july97/news/news2970730.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307074318/http://www.salon.com/july97/news/news2970730.html |date=March 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 ''New York Times'' article stated that "...overwhelmingly, on blogs and Web sites nationwide, drivers and cyclists routinely describe shouted epithets, flung water bottles, sprays of spit and harrowing near-misses of the intentional kind." The article noted that there is "a whiff of class warfare in the simmering hostility, too. During morning rush, the teeth-gritting of drivers is almost audible, as superbly fit cyclists, wearing Sharpie-toned spandex and riding $3,000 bikes, cockily dart through the swampy, stolid traffic to offices with bike racks and showers."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/fashion/10bikewars.html|title=Moving Targets|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 8, 2008|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bike rage may also be caused by confusion about how the rules of the road apply to cyclists. In some jurisdictions, cyclists are allowed to ride on the sidewalk, whereas in other places, this is against the law. In all fifty U.S. states, bicycles are classified as vehicles and cyclists have many of the same rights and responsibilities as other drivers&lt;ref&gt;https://bikeleague.org/content/traffic-laws&lt;/ref&gt;; however, other jurisdictions may place restrictions on where citizens may operate bicycles. These differences in rules may lead drivers to believe that a cyclist is violating the law by cycling on a roadway, even if local laws require cyclists to be on the road. Many citizens are also ignorant of their localities' laws concerning bicycles.  {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Examples==

===Drivers attacking cyclists===
In Toronto in January 2006, a driver tossed his lunch out the window of his car in a traffic jam. A 26-year-old bike courier threw the food back into the car. The driver tossed two cups of hot coffee at the courier, and then, after they exchanged insults, the driver attacked the woman and her bike.&lt;ref name="torontolife.com" /&gt;
[[Image:SaoPaulo PrestesMaia.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Urban land use is often dominated by automobiles. Pictured: [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].]]
In 2009 in Los Angeles, a 59-year-old man was "charged with two felony counts each of reckless driving causing injury, battery with serious bodily injury and the special allegation of causing great bodily injury". After the man had an argument with two cyclists, he "allegedly stopped short and caused one [bike] rider to go through the rear window of Dr. Thompson's Infiniti and other rider to crash onto the pavement. The driver, who admitted slamming on his brakes, was later sentenced to 10 years in prison."&lt;ref&gt;Brentwood driver charged in bike rage
Kevin Roderick • July 11, 2008. Available at: http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2008/07/brentwood_driver_charged.php&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''New York Times'' story stated a 41-year-old cyclist, Dan Cooley was injured by a driver who became angry at him after an exchange of swear words. The incident began when the driver came out of a driveway in front of Mr. Cooley. Angered, Mr. Cooley cursed at the driver, who responded in kind. As Mr. Cooley moved off the road, the car drove into him, and knocked him to the ground with the vehicle, and then the driver got out of the car and attacked him, leaving him with a concussion and a torn ligament. Mr. Cooley thinks that the anger between cyclists and drivers might be due to the relatively new arrival of bikes on city streets: “We’ve had a [[car culture]] for so long and suddenly the roads become saturated with bicyclists trying to save gas"; however, he added,“No one knows how to share the road.”&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

According to the ''UK Guardian'', a cyclist named Jefferey Guffey from Indiana told a driver to slow down. The driver attacked Guffey and bit part of his ear off. After the incident, police charged the attacker with battery. In Oxford, "police investigated a spate of attacks on cyclists motivated, apparently, by hatred of bicycles and their riders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/5171552.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Oxfordshire &amp;#124; Drivers accused of cycle rage |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Wolmar]], an international expert on transportation, stated that Sydney "drivers are more hostile towards cyclists than motorists of any other country".&lt;ref name=Creagh2008/&gt;

===Cyclists attacking drivers===
In Toronto in 2007, "... after being cut off by a driver just after morning rush hour in Toronto, a cyclist caught up to the car, reached inside the window, and stabbed the driver in the face and neck with a screwdriver."&lt;ref name=Montogomery2008/&gt;

A 2004 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' article states that a Pennsylvania bicyclist shot a truck driver in the arm after an altercation. The truck driver, William Nicoletti, 51, drove past the cyclist, who made an obscene gesture. Mr. Nicoletti stated that when he turned his truck around and drove toward the cyclist, man on the bike drew a pistol and shot Mr. Nicoletti. The man on the bicycle, Robert Urick, 41, was "charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and weapons offenses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |date=February 10, 2004 |title=Bike rage: Cyclist allegedly insults, shoots driver |work=Chicago Sun-Times |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1517999.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 ''Newsweek'' article entitled "Pedal vs. Metal: A surge in bike ridership spurs a new kind of road rage" described an altercation which began after a driver named Patrick Schrepping told cyclist Adam Leckie to wear a helmet. Following this conversation, Leckie "allegedly responded by keying Schrepping's car", and then Schrepping struck Leckie with a metal object. Both men were arrested and charged with assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/149224 |title=Road Rage in Portland: Bikes, Cars Clash |publisher=Newsweek |date=July 27, 2008 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael J. Bryant]] (born April 13, 1966) is a former public administrator and former [[politician]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] who was involved in an incident with a cyclist. After an altercation with a cyclist on August 31, 2009, in which Bryant's car struck a bike courier, Bryant was charged with criminal negligence causing death and [[Causing death by dangerous driving|dangerous driving causing death]]. On May 25, 2010, all charges against Bryant were withdrawn, with prosecutors describing the cyclist as the aggressor in the incident.&lt;ref name="Withdrawn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/charges-against-bryant-in-fatal-crash-withdrawn-1.898818|title=Charges against Bryant in fatal crash withdrawn |last=|first=|accessdate=2014-05-26|newspaper=CBC News | date=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclists attacking cyclists===

Bike rage does not only involve altercations between drivers and cyclists. In some cases, there have been fights between cyclists. In an incident in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], a 51-year-old cyclist suggested to a 28-year-old cyclist that he should get a bike light so that others could see him. After hearing this comment, the younger cyclist felt "extremely insulted" and allegedly tried to force the older man off the road. The 51-year-old was followed to his home, at which point the 28-year-old "clamped his hands around O'Brien's head" and then "... twisted O'Brien to the ground and kicked him in the ribs." Police indicated that they planned to charge the younger man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christians |first=Lindsay |url=http://www.madison.com/tct/news/stories/317158 |title=Cap Times : Ct |publisher=Madison.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conflict management''' is the process of limiting the negative aspects of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] while increasing the positive aspects of conflict. The aim of conflict management is to enhance [[learning]] and group outcomes, including effectiveness or performance in an organizational setting.&lt;ref name="rahim 208"&gt;Rahim, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; Properly managed conflict can improve group outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Alpert, Tjosvaldo, &amp; Law, 2000; Bodtker &amp; Jameson, 2001; Rahim &amp; Bonoma, 1979; Kuhn &amp; Poole, 2000; DeChurch &amp; Marks, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict resolution==
[[Conflict resolution]] involves the reduction, elimination, or termination of all forms and types of conflict. Five styles for conflict management, as identified by Thomas and Kilmann, are: competing, compromising, collaborating, avoiding, and accommodating.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Brief for the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode, CPP Research Department, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses can benefit from appropriate types and levels of conflict. That is the aim of conflict management, and not the aim of conflict resolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Conflict management does not imply conflict resolution.

Conflict management minimizes the negative outcomes of conflict and promotes the positive outcomes of conflict with the goal of improving learning in an organization.&lt;ref name="rahim 208"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muddaser.com/conflict-management-resolution-strategies-process-steps/|title=Conflict management|last=Altaf|first=Muddaser|date=|website=muddaser.com/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly managed conflict increases [[organizational learning]] by increasing the number of questions asked and encourages people to challenge the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Luthans, Rubach, &amp; Marsnik, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organizational conflict]] at the interpersonal level includes disputes between peers as well as supervisor-subordinate conflict. [[Party-directed mediation]] (PDM) is a mediation approach particularly suited for disputes between co-workers, colleagues or peers, especially deep-seated interpersonal conflict, multicultural or multiethnic disputes. The mediator listens to each party separately in a pre-caucus or pre-mediation before ever bringing them into a joint session. Part of the pre-caucus also includes coaching and role plays. The idea is that the parties learn how to converse directly with their adversary in the joint session. Some unique challenges arise when organizational disputes involve supervisors and subordinates. The Negotiated Performance Appraisal (NPA) is a tool for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and is particularly useful as an alternate mediation model because it preserves the hierarchical power of supervisors while encouraging dialogue and dealing with differences in opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7conflict/ Party-Directed Mediation: Facilitating Dialogue Between Individuals''] (on-line 3rd Edition, 2014) by [[Gregorio Billikopf]], University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orientations to conflict==
There are three orientations to conflict: lose-lose, win-lose, and [[win-win]]. The lose-lose orientation is a type of conflict that tends to end negatively for all parties involved. A win-lose orientation results in one victorious party, usually at the expense of the other. The win-win orientation is one of the most essential concepts to conflict resolution. A win-win solution arrived at by integrative bargaining may be close to optimal for both parties. This approach engages in a [[Cooperation|cooperative]] approach rather than a competitive one.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Wood 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the win-win concept is the ideal orientation, the notion that there can only be one winner is constantly being reinforced in American culture:

"The win-lose orientation is manufactured in our society in athletic competition, admission to academic programs, industrial promotion systems, and so on. Individuals tend to generalize from their objective win-lose situations and apply these experiences to situations that are not objectively [[Lump of labour fallacy|fixed-pies]]".&lt;ref&gt;Spangle and Isenhart 14&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of mentality can be destructive when communicating with different cultural groups by creating barriers in negotiation, resolution and compromise; it can also lead the "loser" to feel mediocre. When the win-win orientation is absent in negotiation, different responses to conflict may be observed.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Early conflict management models===
Blake and Mouton (1964) were among the first to present a conceptual scheme for classifying the modes (styles) for handling interpersonal conflicts in five types: forcing, withdrawing, smoothing, compromising, and problem solving.

In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began using the intentions of the parties involved to classify the styles of conflict management that they included in their models. Both Thomas (1976) and Pruitt (1983) put forth a model based on the concerns of the parties involved in the conflict. The combination of the parties' concern for their own interests (i.e. [[assertiveness]]) and their concern for the interests of those across the table (i.e. cooperativeness) yielded a particular conflict management style. Pruitt called these styles yielding (low assertiveness/high cooperativeness), problem solving (high assertiveness/high cooperativeness), inaction (low assertiveness/low cooperativeness), and contending (high assertiveness/low cooperativeness). Pruitt argues that problem-solving is the preferred method when seeking mutually beneficial options (win-win).

===Khun and Poole's model===
Khun and Poole (2000) established a similar system of group conflict management. In their system, they split Kozan's confrontational model into two sub models: distributive and integrative.
* Distributive – Here conflict is approached as a distribution of a fixed amount of positive outcomes or resources, where one side will end up winning and the other losing, even if they do win some concessions.
* Integrative – Groups utilizing the integrative model see conflict as a chance to integrate the needs and concerns of both groups and make the best outcome possible. This model has a heavier emphasis on compromise than the distributive model. Khun and Poole found that the integrative model resulted in consistently better task related outcomes than those using the distributive model.

===DeChurch and Marks's meta-taxonomy===
DeChurch and Marks (2001) examined the literature available on conflict management at the time and Ni established what they claimed was a "meta-taxonomy" that encompasses all other models.

They argued that all other styles have inherent in them into two dimensions:
* activeness ("the extent to which conflict behaviors make a responsive and direct rather than inert and indirect impression"). High activeness is characterized by openly discussing differences of opinion while fully going after their own interest. 
* [[agreeableness]] ("the extent to which conflict behaviors make a pleasant and relaxed rather than unpleasant and strainful impression"). High agreeableness is characterized by attempting to satisfy all parties involved.

In the study DeChurch and Marks conducted to validate this division, activeness did not have a significant effect on the effectiveness of conflict resolution, but the agreeableness of the conflict management style, whatever it was, did have a positive impact on how groups felt about the way the conflict was managed, regardless of the outcome.

===Rahim's meta-model===

Rahim (2002) noted that there is agreement among management scholars that there is no one best approach to how to make decisions, lead or manage conflict.

In a similar vein, rather than creating a very specific model of conflict management, Rahim created a meta-model (in much the same way that DeChurch and Marks, 2001, created a meta-taxonomy) for conflict styles based on two dimensions, concern for self and concern for others.

Within this framework are five management approaches: integrating, obliging, dominating, avoiding, and compromising.
* Integration involves openness, exchanging information, looking for alternatives, and examining differences so solve the problem in a manner that is acceptable to both parties.
* Obliging is associated with attempting to minimize the differences and highlight the commonalities to satisfy the concern of the other party.
* Dominating in this style one party goes all out to win his or her objective and, as a result, often ignores the needs and expectations of the other party.
* Avoiding here a party fails to satisfy his or her own concern as well as the concern of the other party.
* Compromising involves give-and-take whereby both parties give up something to make a mutually acceptable decision.&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==International conflict management==

Special consideration should be paid to conflict management between two parties from distinct cultures. In addition to the everyday sources of conflict, "misunderstandings, and from this counterproductive, pseudo conflicts, arise when members of one culture are unable to understand culturally determined differences in communication practices, traditions, and thought processing".&lt;ref&gt;Borisoff &amp; Victor, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, this has already been observed in the business research literature.

Renner (2007) recounted several episodes where managers from developed countries moved to less developed countries to resolve conflicts within the company and met with little success due to their failure to adapt to the conflict management styles of the local culture.

As an example, in Kozan's study noted above, he noted that Asian cultures are far more likely to use a harmony model of conflict management. If a party operating from a harmony model comes in conflict with a party using a more confrontational model, misunderstandings above and beyond those generated by the conflict itself will arise.

International conflict management, and the cultural issues associated with it, is one of the primary areas of research in the field at the time, as existing research is insufficient to deal with the ever-increasing contact occurring between international entities.

==Application==

===Higher education===
With only 14% of researched universities reporting mandatory courses in this subject, and with up to 25% of the manager day being spent on dealing with conflict, education needs to reconsider the importance of this subject. The subject warrants emphasis on enabling students to deal with conflict management.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p.&amp;nbsp;240&lt;/ref&gt;

"Providing more conflict management training in undergraduate business programs could help raise the emotional intelligence of future managers." The improvement of emotional intelligence found that employees were more likely to use problem-solving skills, instead of trying to bargain.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p.&amp;nbsp;241&lt;/ref&gt;

Students need to have a good set of social skills. Good communication skills allow the manager to accomplish interpersonal situations and conflict. Instead of focusing on conflict as a behavior issue, focus on the communication of it.&lt;ref&gt;Myers &amp; Larson, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;307&lt;/ref&gt;

With an understanding of the communications required, the student will gain the aptitude needed to differentiate between the nature and types of conflicts. These skills also teach that relational and procedural conflict needs a high degree of immediacy to resolution. If these two conflicts are not dealt with quickly, an employee will become dissatisfied or perform poorly.&lt;ref&gt;Myers &amp; Larson, p.&amp;nbsp;313&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the responsibility of companies to react. One option is to identify the skills needed in-house, but if the skills for creating workplace fairness are already lacking, it may be best to seek assistance from an outside organization, such as a developmental assessment center.

According to Rupp, Baldwin, and Bashur, these organizations "have become a popular means for providing coaching, feedback, and experiential learning opportunities".&lt;ref&gt;Rupp, Baldwin &amp; Bashshur, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;145&lt;/ref&gt; Their main focus is fairness and how it impacts employees' attitudes and performance.

These organizations teach competencies and what they mean.&lt;ref name="rupp 146"&gt;Rupp et al., p.&amp;nbsp;146&lt;/ref&gt; The students then participate in simulations. Multiple observers assess and record what skills are being used and then return this feedback to the participant. After this assessment, participants are then given another set of simulations to utilize the skills learned. Once again they receive additional feedback from observers, in hopes that the learning can be used in their workplace.

The feedback the participant receives is detailed, behaviorally specific, and high quality. This is needed for the participant to learn how to change their behavior.&lt;ref name="rupp 146"/&gt; In this regard, it is also important that the participant take time to self-reflect so that learning may occur.

Once an assessment program is utilized, action plans may be developed based on quantitative and qualitative data.&lt;ref&gt;Rupp et al., p.&amp;nbsp;159&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counseling===
When personal conflict leads to [[frustration]] and loss of [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]], [[counseling]] may prove to be a helpful antidote. Although few [[organization]]s can afford the luxury of having professional counselors on the staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or "listening with understanding", is little more than being a good listener —
something every manager should be.&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry P Knowles; Börje O Saxberg|title= Personality and leadership behavior |publisher= Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|location=Reading, Mass.|year=1971|isbn=|oclc=118832|doi= |nopp=true |page=Chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the simple process of being able to vent one's feelings—that is; to express them to a concerned and understanding listener–is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for the frustrated individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind, better able to cope with a personal difficulty that is affecting his work adversely. The nondirective approach is one effective way for [[Management|managers]] to deal with frustrated subordinates and co-workers.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=148–142|isbn=978-0-87620-540-2|oclc=2299496|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other more direct and more diagnostic ways that might be used in appropriate circumstances. The great strength of the nondirective approach (nondirective counseling is based on the [[client-centered therapy]] of [[Carl Rogers]]), however, lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and the fact that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor's diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. No one has ever been harmed by being listened to sympathetically and understandingly. On the contrary, this approach has helped many people to cope with problems that were interfering with their effectiveness on the job.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2831">[[File:Dadoba_Pandurang.jpg|thumb|Engraving from the ''Illustrated London News'', 2 December 1882]]
'''Dadoba Pandurang''' (9 May 1814 – 17 October 1882) (Pune, Maharashtra,British India) was a social reformer and linguist from Bombay. He was born with the surname '''Tarkhadkar''' but he never used it in later life. He wrote extensively on religion and social reform as an opponent of rituals and caste, while supporting widow-remarriage and education for women. He was a brother of [[Atmaram Pandurang]].

Pandurang studied at a local school for four years before going to private high school followed by studies at the Bombay Native School and Book Society. He was a recipient of a West Scholarship and studied at what became the Elphinstone and he learnt several languages including Portuguese, Persian and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=rao /&gt;

In 1830 he became a school teacher and in 1840 he moved to Surat. The headmaster at this school in Surat was Henry Green, a noted agnostic and free thinker who influenced Pandurang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Caste, Conflict and Ideology: Mahatma Jotirao Phule and Low Caste Protest in Nineteenth-Century Western India| first=Rosalind |last=O'Hanlon| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year= 2002|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1846 he served as acting superintendent of vernacular schools and in 1852 he was selected for the post of Deputy Collector and Magistrate at Ahmednagar. He moved to Thana in 1858 and retired in 1861 due to troubles with superiors. Pandurang's major contribution was a grammar of Marathi. ''Maharastra Bhasheche Vyakaran'' published in 1836 that went into seven editions during his lifetime. He also published a supplement in 1881. Other publications included ''Yashoda Pandurangi'' (1865), ''Dharam Vivechan'' (1868), ''Paramhamsik Bramhadharma'' (1880), ''[[iarchive:ahindugentleman00pandgoog|A Hindu Gentleman's Reflections respecting the works of Swedenborg]]'' (1878), ''The absurdity of the Holi Festival as it is now practised by the Hindus'' (1829), ''Shishubodh'' (posthumously published in 1884) and ''Vidhavasrumarjan'' (1857). He wrote ''Dharam Vivechan'' under the pen-name of ''Ek Jagadwasi Arya''.&lt;ref name=rao&gt;{{cite journal|title=A maker of modern Maharashtra: Dadoba Pandurang (1814-1882)| first=Vasant D. |last=Rao| journal= Proceedings of the Indian History Congress| volume=28| year=1966| pages=442–448| jstor=44140475 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pandurang taught Sanskrit briefly at the Sir Jamshedjee Jeejeebhoy Zarthosti Madresa in 1871. In 1848, he founded and presided over the ''Upayukta Jnanprasarak Sabha'', a students' literary and scientific society which met to discuss various topics every alternate Thursday.&lt;ref name=rao /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">'''Democratic rationalization''' is term used by [[Andrew Feenberg]] in his article "Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power and Democracy with technology."  Feenberg argues against the idea of ''[[technological determinism]]'' citing flaws in its two fundamental theses.

The first is the ''thesis of unilinear progress''.  This is the belief that technological progress follows a direct and predictable path from lower to higher levels of complexity and that each stage along this path is necessary for progress to occur ([[Feenberg]] 211).

The second is the ''thesis of determination by the base''.  This is the concept that  in a society where a technology had been introduced, that society must organize itself or adapt to the technology ([[Feenberg]] 211).

In his argument against the former thesis [[Feenberg]] says that [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] studies of technology will lead us to realize that there is not a set path by which development of technologies occur but rather an emerging of similar technologies at the same time leading to a multiplicity of choices.  These choices are made based upon certain social factors and upon examining them we will see that they are not deterministic in nature ([[Feenberg]] 212).

Arguing against the latter thesis, [[Feenberg]] calls to our attention social reforms that have been mandated by governments mainly in regards to the protection of its citizens and laborers.  Most of the time these mandates are widely accepted after being passed through the governing body. At which point technology and industry will reform and re-evolve to meet the new standards in a way that has greater efficiency than it did so previously ([[Feenberg]] 214)

'''Digital detox''' refers to a period of time during which a person refrains from using electronic connecting devices such as smartphones and computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/digital_detox|title=digital detox {{!}} Definition of digital detox in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as an opportunity to reduce stress, focus more on social interaction and connection with nature in the physical world. Claimed benefits include increased [[mindfulness]], lowered anxiety, and an overall better appreciation of one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/digital-detox_n_5589474|title=Here's One Big Sign It's Time To Reevaluate Your Relationship With Your Phone|date=2014-07-16|work=HuffPost|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francesbooth/2014/06/13/how-to-do-a-digital-detox/#67da105b65a4|title=How To Do A Digital Detox|last=Booth|first=Frances|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;There have been many stories where a digital detox has lead to a more refreshed feeling along the people involved. They described there digital detox as a "getaway" in some aspect. When people get caught up in how much they need to do, the overuse of technology becomes prevalent. This even becomes the case in a social context; people want to make sure they're up to date on the latest news stories, Instagram posts, political tweets etc. and to do this, they need to stay plugged in. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Brown, Sally (Feb 2014). "Switch off: feel chained to your smartphone? Perhaps you're in need of a digital detox" (PDF). ''sallybrowntherapy.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smartphones, laptops, and tablets, combined with the increasing wireless Internet accessibility, enable technology users to constantly be connected to the digital world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Morrison, S., &amp; Gomez, R. (2014). "Pushback: The Growth of Expressions of Resistance to Constant Online Connectivity" (PDF). In iConference 2014 Proceedings (p. 1-15).&lt;/ref&gt;Constant online connectivity may have a negative impact on the users’ experience with electronic connecting devices and result in a wish to temporarily refrain from communication technology usage.

In one study in Mind, 95% of those interviewed said their mood improved after putting down their phones to spend time outside, changing from depressed, stressed, and anxious to more calm and balanced. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/enhance-your-wellbeing/environment/nature-and-us/how-does-nature-impact-our-wellbeing|title=How Does Nature Impact Our Wellbeing? {{!}} Taking Charge of Your Health &amp; Wellbeing|website=Taking Charge of Your Health &amp; Wellbeing|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivations behind digital detoxing vary. In some cases, the motivation is negative emotional responses to the technology usage, such as dissatisfaction or disappointment of the technology device and its functions. In other cases, users see the technology as a distracting factor that consumes time and energy and wants to take back control over their everyday lives. Some people have moral, ethical or political reasons to refrain from technology usage. Furthermore, a concern of developing addictive behavior in terms of tech addiction or [[Internet addiction disorder]] is one of the motivations for disconnecting for a period of time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;This excessive technology usage can be considered an addiction. It's said that around 50% of smartphone users check their account 5 minutes prior to going to bed and within 5 minutes post waking up. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adgully.com/smartphone-owners-increasingly-obsessed-with-their-devices-deloitte-study-63842.html|title=Smartphone owners in India are increasingly obsessed with their devices: Deloitte Mobile Consumer Survey 2015|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant engagement with digital connecting devices at the workplace is claimed to lead to increased stress levels and reduce productivity. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ayyagari|first=Ramakrishna|last2=Grover|first2=Varun|last3=Purvis|first3=Russell|date=2011|title=Technostress: Technological Antecedents and Implications|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41409963|journal=MIS Quarterly|volume=35|issue=4|pages=831–858|doi=10.2307/41409963}}&lt;/ref&gt;Certain characteristics of the technology make it more difficult to distinguish work from leisure. Moreover, being continually connected increases the number of interruptions at work. Allowing employees to disconnect for a part of the day in order to truly focus on their work without disturbance from colleagues is claimed to be beneficial to the productivity and work environment. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''To combat the effects of constant digital exposure, there are digital detox retreats held for select numbers of people. It's an average of 12 people per week getting detoxed for a little less than $600 dollars including flights.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In certain cultures, constant work is encouraged and taking breaks are sometimes even discouraged. This is due to the idea that a break equals a lack of productivity. In the Indian culture, this is extremely prevalent; there have even been studies to back these ideas up. It's said that more than half of Indians check their work and social emails constantly. Even while vacationing, about 30% admitted that they had an irresistible urge to check and post on social media. There is also a significant estimated 30% difference between people being willing to leave their laptops at home compared to people being willing to leave their smartphones at home. It's admitted that if work wasn't a factor a lot of Indians wouldn't constantly be on their devices and stay unplugged. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcquest.com/time-digital-detox/|title=Time for Digital Detox - PCQuest|date=2018-01-10|work=PCQuest|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connecting devices’ multitasking character has a serious impact on the learning ability. Multitasking implies operating on a surface level, which only involves the short-time memory. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10540261/screen-time-ipad-tablet-digital-detox-difital-addiction.html|title=Switch off – it’s time for your digital detox|last=Smith|first=Julia Llewellyn|date=2013-12-28|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;Using multiple connecting devices as learning platforms is therefore not beneficial. A reduction of information choices enables the brain to focus more on the quality of the information rather than the hastiness of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/9_1/brabazon9_1.html|title=Time for a digital detox? - Tara Brabazon - Fast Capitalism 9.1|website=www.uta.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|Sir Edwin Chadwick]]
'''Sir Edwin Chadwick''' [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] (24 January 1800 – 6 July 1890) was an English social reformer who is noted for his leadership in reforming the [[Poor Law]]s in England and instituting major reforms in urban [[sanitation]] and [[public health]].  A disciple of Utilitarian philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]], he was most active between 1832 and 1854; after that he held minor positions, and his views were largely ignored. Chadwick pioneered the use of scientific surveys to identify all phases of a complex social problem, and pioneered the use of systematic long-term inspection programmes to make sure the reforms operated as planned.

==Early life==
Edwin Chadwick was born on 24 January 1800 at [[Longsight]], [[Manchester]], to James Chadwick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Finer|first=Samuel Edward|title=The Life and Times of Sir Edwin Chadwick|year=1952|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-416-17350-5 |p=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JycOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA6|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died when he was still a young child, yet to be named. His father, James Chadwick, tutored the scientist [[John Dalton]] in music and botany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schiff |first=Andrew |year=2008 |title="The Father of Baseball": A Biography of Henry Chadwick |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3216-5 |p=25 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered an advanced liberal politician, thus exposing young Edwin to political and social ideas. His grandfather, Andrew Chadwick, had been a close friend of the Methodist theologian [[John Wesley]].{{sfn |Schiff |2008 |p=24}}

He began his education at a small school in [[Lancashire]] and moved to a boarding school in [[Stockport]], where he studied until he was 10. When his family moved to London in 1810, Chadwick continued his education with the help of private tutors, his father and a great deal of self-teaching.

His father remarried in the early 1820s and Edwin's younger half-brother was baseball icon [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]], born in 1824.&lt;ref name="Birkett"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-33239318 | title=The Englishman dubbed 'the father of baseball' | work=[[BBC News]] | date=6 July 2015 | accessdate=6 July 2015 | author=Birkett, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 18, he decided to pursue a career in law and undertook an apprenticeship at an attorney's office. In 1823, he enrolled in law school at [[Inns of Court|The Temple in London]]. On 26 November 1830 he was [[call to the bar|called to the bar]], becoming a [[barrister]], also known as a court lawyer.

Called to the bar without independent means, he sought to support himself by literary work such as his work on ''Applied Science and its Place in Democracy'', and his essays in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', mainly on different methods of applying scientific knowledge to the practice of government. He became friends with two of the leading philosophers of the day, [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]]. Bentham engaged him as a literary assistant and left him a large legacy.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}} He also became acquaintances with [[Thomas Southwood Smith]], [[Neil Arnott]], and [[James Kay-Shuttleworth]], all doctors.

From his exposure to social reform and under the influence of his friends, he began to devote his efforts to sanitary reform. In 1832, Chadwick began on his path to make improvements with sanitary and health conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dunkley, Peter. |title=England's "Prussian Minister": Edwin Chadwick and the Politics of Government Growth, 1832–1854|doi=10.1086/ahr/95.4.1194 |journal=American Historical Review|volume= 95|issue=4|year=1990|pages=1194–1195|jstor=2163556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformer==
[[File:Chadwick's Bethnal Green Parish map. Wellcome L0009782.jpg|thumb|Chadwick's 1838 [[Bethnal Green]] parish map showing mortality from four diseases]]
In 1832, he was employed by the [[Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832|Royal Commission]] appointed to inquire into the operation of the [[Poor Law]], and in 1833, he was made a full member of that commission. Chadwick and [[Nassau William Senior]] drafted the famous report of 1834, recommending the reform of the old law. Under the 1834 system, individual parishes were formed into [[Poor Law Unions]], and each Poor Law Union was to have a union [[workhouse]]. Chadwick favoured a more centralised system of administration than the one adopted, and he felt the [[Reform movement|Poor Law reform]] of 1834 should have provided for the management of poor law relief by salaried officers controlled from a central board, with the boards of guardians acting merely as inspectors.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}}

In 1834, he was appointed secretary to the Poor Law commissioners. Unwilling to administer an act of which he was largely the author in any way other than as he thought best, he found it hard to get along with his superiors. The disagreement, among others, contributed to the dissolution of the [[Poor Law Commission]] in 1847. His chief contribution to political controversy was his belief in entrusting certain departments of local affairs to trained and selected experts instead of to representatives, elected on the principle of local self-government.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}}

===Sanitation===
Following a serious outbreak of [[typhus]] in 1838, Chadwick convinced the Poor Law Board that an enquiry was required, and this was initially carried out by his doctor friends Arnot and Southwood Smith, assisted by another doctor from Manchester, James Kay Shuttleworth. This was the first time in British history that doctors were employed to look at the conditions which might contribute to ill health in the population. Chadwick sent questionaires to every Poor Law Union, and talked to surveyors, builders, prison governors, police officers and factory inspectors to obtain additional data about the lives of the poor. He edited the information himself, and prepared it for publication.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=4-5}} His ''Report on The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'',&lt;ref&gt;S.E. Finer, ''The life and times of Sir Edwin Chadwick'' (1952) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nOQcDQAAQBAJ  excerpt] 209-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EdwinChadwick1842"&gt;{{cite book | title=excerpt from ''Report... from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'' (pp.369–372) (online source)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html| last=Chadwick| first=Edwin | chapter=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions | year=1842| publisher=to The Victorian Web  | location=added by Laura Del Col| pages=|accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; begun in 1839 and published in 1842,&lt;ref name=rh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Richard W.|title=The Aesthetic Interior as Incubator of Health and Well-Being|journal=Architectural History|volume=60|year=2017|pages=277–301|issn=0066-622X|doi=10.1017/arh.2017.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; was researched and published at his own expense, and became the best-selling publication produced by [[Office of Public Sector Information|the Stationery Office]] to date.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=5}} A supplementary report was also published in 1843.&lt;ref name="EdwinChadwick1843"&gt;{{cite book | title=Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain.

He employed John Roe, the surveyor for the district of Holborn and Finsbury who had invented the egg-shaped sewer, to conduct experiments on the most efficient ways to construct drains, the results of which were incorporated into the report, and the summary included eight points, including the absolute necessity of better water supplies and of a drainage system to remove waste, as ways to diminish premature mortality.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=7-8}} Evidence given by Dr Dyce Guthrie convinced Chadwick that every house should have a permanent water supply, rather than the intermittent supplies from standpipes that were often provided.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=9}} The report caught the public imagination, and the government had to set up a Health of Towns Commission to consider the issues and recommend legislation. Its chairman was the Duke of Baccleuch, and there were thirteen members, including then engineers [[Robert Stephenson]] and [[William Cubitt]]. Chadwick acted as secretary in an unofficial capacity, and seems to have dominated the proceedings.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=8}}

The Commission took evidence from [[Robert Thom (engineer)|Robert Thom]], who had designed a water supply system for [[Greenock]], [[Thomas Wicksteed]], who was the engineer for the [[East London Waterworks Company]], and [[Thomas Hawksley]] from the Trent Waterworks, [[Nottingham]].{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=10-11}} These confirmed his ideas about constant water supplies, and he developed a model which he called the "venous and arterial system." Each house would have a constant water supply, and [[water-closet]]s would ensure that soil was discharged into egg-shaped sewers, to be carried away and spread on the land as manure, preventing rivers from becoming polluted.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=12}} Followed the publication of the Commission's report, the [[Health of Towns Association]] was formed and various city-based branches were created.&lt;ref name="Ashton-Ubido"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chadwick later helped to ensure that the Waterworks Clauses Act 1847 became law, to limit the profits that water supply companies could make to 10 percent, and requiring them to comply with reasonable demands for water. This included a constant supply of wholesome water for houses, and a supply for cleansing sewers and watering streets.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=11}}

Chadwick wanted to see his ideas implemented over a wide area, and set about forming a company to supply water to towns, to ensure their drainage and cleansing, and to use the refuse for agricultural production. It was to have the grandiose title "The British, Colonial and Foreign Drainage, Water Supply and Towns Improvement Company", with an initial capital of £1 million, but it was the time of the [[Railway Mania]], and he struggled to raise the finance against such competition. The company when it was eventually registered became the more modest Towns Improvement Company.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=17-19, 27}} Railways continued to dominate the money market, and the company was wound up after just three years.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=30}} Chadwick understood that both water supply and drainage were important, since replacing [[earth-closet]]s with water closets resulted in cesspools overflowing and making sanitary conditions worse, unless there were sewers to carry the waste away. This let to a rift forming between him and Hawksley, who had initially worked closely with him but who later took on water supply projects which did not include any requirement for drainage.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=22-23}}

===Public Health Act===
Chadwick's report led to the [[Public Health Act 1848]], which was the first instance of the British government taking responsibility for the health of its citizens.&lt;ref name=rh/&gt; It had been introduced by Lord Morpeth in 1847, with the aim or requiring every town to supply water to every house, which they could do by building their own waterworks or by liaising with water companies, and to undertake drainage, sewerage and street paving projects. Most of its grand aims were considerably watered down by the time it became law, but it established a Central Board of Health, whose members were [[Lord Morpeth]], [[Lord Shaftesbury]], and Chadwick. They were later joined by Southwood Smith, who acted as a medical advisor. Districts could pay for a survey from an inspector employed by the Board, and could then proceed without the need to obtain a costly local Act to authorise the work. Chadwick chose all of the inspectors himself, ensuring that they shared his views on glazed sewer pipes, constant water supply and arterial drainage. They worked enthusiastically, ensuring that districts considered comprehensive schemes for water supply, drainage and sewerage.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=31}}

Ratepayers in a district could request an inspector to attend if ten percent of them signed a petition. The Board could also hold an enquiry if the death rate of a district exceeded 23 per 1000, but gauged the level of local support, and formed a local Board if there was support, and withdrew tactfully if there was opposition. By 1853, they had received requests for inspections from 284 towns, and 13 combined water supply, sewerage and drainage schemes had been completed under the legislation.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=31-32}} Relationships with engineers were not always easy, with [[James Meadows Rendel (engineer)|J M Rendel]] calling Chadwick's ideas "sanitary humbug" and Robert Stephenson stating that he hated the ideas of pipes, rather than brick-built sewers. Even [[Joseph Bazalgette]], who went on to design London's trunk sewer network, spoke out against glazed sewer pipes.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=36}} As time went by, there was growing opposition to what was seen as central control by the Board. The rift between Chadwick and Hawksley had become open hostility, and Hawksley made serious complaints against Chadwick and one of the Board's inspectors to a Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1853.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=37-38}} Opposition from engineers increased, and a "Private Enterprise Society" was formed by Hawksley and [[James Simpson (engineer)|James Simpson]], with the intent of bringing down the Board. Shaftsbury, Chadwick and Southwood Smith all had to resign in 1854, and the Board did not last for long afterwards. Chadwick lived to see his position vindicated, when the Local Government Board was established in 1871, which led to the formation of the Ministry of Health. Since then, it has been widely acknowledged that public health is a matter of government responsibility, working through local authorities.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=41-42}}

In 1851, Chadwick made a recommendation that a single authority should take over the nine separate water supply companies that operated in London. Although this idea was rejected by the Government, the Metropolitan Water Supply Act 1852 forced the companies to move the intakes for their water to locations above [[Teddington Lock|Teddington weir]], to filter water before it was used for domestic supply, to cover filtered water reservoirs, and to ensure that there was a constant water supply to all users by 1857. This was not achieved until 1899, and Chadwick's recommendation for a single authority was eventually implemented in 1902, with the formation of the Metropolitan Water Board.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=12-13}}
   
In 1852, Chadwick conversed with [[Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn]] in relation to the construction of a sewerage system in Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Burton Archives, Swansea University, LAC/26/D/61&lt;/ref&gt;

Chadwick's efforts were acknowledged by at least one health reformer of the day: [[William James Erasmus Wilson]] dedicated his 1854 book ''Healthy Skin'' to Chadwick "In admiration of his strenuous and indefatigable labors in the cause of Sanitary Reform".&lt;ref name="ErasmusWilson1854"&gt;{{cite book | title=Healthy Skin: A Popular Teatise on the Skin and Hair, their Preservation and Management |url=https://archive.org/details/healthyskinapop04wilsgoog| last= Wilson| first= Erasmus| edition=2nd American, from the 4th Revised London | year=1854| publisher=Blanchard &amp; Lea | location= Philadelphia| page=|accessdate=8 November 2009}} Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

He  corresponded with [[Florence Nightingale]] on methodology. He encouraged her to write up her research into the book ''Notes on Nursing.'' He promoted it among well placed intellectuals, making her more visible.&lt;ref&gt;Joann G. Widerquist,  "Sanitary Reform And Nursing: Edwin Chadwick and Florence Nightingale." ''Nursing History Review.'' (1997), Vol. 5, p149-160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Chadwick was a commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] in London from 1848 to 1849. He was also a commissioner of the [[Local board of health#General Board of Health|General Board of Health]] from its establishment in 1848 to its abolition in 1854, when he retired on a pension. He occupied the remainder of his life in voluntary contributions to sanitary, health and economic questions.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=42}}

In January 1884, he was appointed as the first president of the Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors, now the [[Chartered Institute of Environmental Health]]. Its head office, in [[Waterloo, London]], is named Chadwick Court, in his honour.

While he is well known for his work with the Poor Law and with sanitation, he also contributed to other areas of public policy. These included tropical hygiene, criminal justice institutions, policy regarding funerals and burials in urban areas, school architecture, utilisation of sewage, military sanitation and the education of paupers. He was involved in investigations into child labour in factories, the organisation of the police force, drunkenness, the treatment of labourers on the railways, the building and maintenance of roads, organisation of the civil service, and various aspects of education. Most of these benefitted from his use of statistical methods to collect and organise data, and of the use of anecdotal evidence to support his conclusions. He was involved in a number of organisations, including the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[Institute of Civil Engineers]], the [[National Association for the Promotion of Social Science]], the [[Royal Society of Arts]], the [[Royal Statistical Society]], the [[London Debating Societies|London Debating Society]] and the [[Political Economy Club]].{{sfn |Ekelund |Price |2012 |pp=4-5}}

In recognition of his public service, he was [[knight]]ed in 1889. He served in his post until his death, at 90, in 1890,{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=42}} at [[East Sheen]], [[Surrey]].

Chadwick is remembered at the [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine]] where his name appears among the names of 23 pioneers of public health and tropical medicine  chosen to be honoured when the School was built in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/library/archives/history/frieze/chadwick.html|title=Behind the Frieze - Sir Edwin Chadwick (1800-1890) {{!}} London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine {{!}} LSHTM.|website=www.lshtm.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-01-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032848/http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/library/archives/history/frieze/chadwick.html|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He is also commemorated at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland for the engineering building.

According to Priti Joshi in 2004 the evaluation of his career has drastically changed since the 1950s:
:The Chadwick that emerges in recent accounts could not be more different from the mid-century Chadwick. The post-war critics saw him as a visionary, an often-embattled crusader for public health whose enemies were formidable but whose vision, extending the liberal and radical tradition, ultimately prevailed. Cultural critics, on the other hand, present a Chadwick who misrepresented (if not outright oppressed) the poor and who was instrumental in developing a massive bureaucracy to police their lives. Thus, while earlier accounts highlighted Chadwick’s accomplishments, the progress of public health reforms, and the details of legislative politics, more recent ones draw attention to his representations of the poor, the erasures in his text, and the growing nineteenth-century institutionalization of the poor that the Sanitary Report promotes. Chadwick, in other words, is portrayed as either a pioneer of reform or an avatar of bureaucratic oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Priti |last=Joshi |title=Edwin Chadwick's Self-Fashioning: Professionalism, Masculinity, and the Victorian Poor |work=Victorian Literature and Culture |volume=32 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pp=353–370 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/victorian-literature-and-culture/article/edwin-chadwicks-selffashioning-professionalism-masculinity-and-the-victorian-poor/896F815307412B1ACD57604A503CC6F9}}, quoting p 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such views are not universally held. Thus Eckland and Price in their assessment of Chadwick's economic policies in 2012 can write:
:It is no exageration to note that Chadwick is an almost singular progenitor of public health in the UK and elsewhere. The one hundredth anniversary of his death (1990) and the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the first Public Health Act (1848) was an occasion of serious and deserved plaudits for him in the United States and abroad. His prowess in sanitation engineering has also been duly noted. These excellent works appropriately feature Chadwick's role as one of the two or three most important policy makers of nineteenth century England.{{sfn |Eckland |Price |2012 |p=viii}}

The '''Esperanto movement''', less commonly referred to as '''Esperantism''' ({{lang-eo|Esperantismo}}), is a [[Social movement|movement]] to disseminate the use of the [[Constructed language|planned]] [[International auxiliary language|international language]] [[Esperanto]].&lt;ref&gt;See the definition in the "[https://eo.wikisource.org/wiki/Bulonja_deklaracio Deklaracio pri la Esenco de la Esperantismo]" ("Bulonja Deklaracio", 1905)&lt;/ref&gt; The movement does not aim to supplant national languages but merely to supplement them.&lt;ref name="Janton1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Janton|title=Esperanto: Language, Literature, and Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTZhbJq8pJ0C&amp;pg=PA33|year=1993|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1253-4|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is sometimes used even for all people speaking Esperanto including their [[Esperanto culture|culture]], which is not a correct use of the sociological term ''movement''.

== Politics ==
Esperanto has been placed in a few proposed political situations. The most popular of these is the former minor party  ''Europe—Democracy—Esperanto'', which aims to establish Esperanto as the [[official language]] of the [[European Union]]. Grin's Report, published in 2005 by [[François Grin]] found that the use of [[English language]] as the lingua franca within the European Union costs billions annually and significantly benefits [[English-speaking countries]] financially. The report considered a scenario where Esperanto would be the lingua franca and found that it would have many advantages, particularly economically speaking, as well as [[ideologically]].

'''Frederick Nicholas Charrington''' (4 February 1850 – 2 January 1936) was an English social reformer who renounced succession to a fortune of over £1 million in order to devote his life to temperance work.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Thorne, pseud. Cyril Arthur Edward Ranger Gull. ''The Great Acceptance: The Life Story of F. N. Charrington''. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1912 https://archive.org/details/greatacceptancel00gull&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Charrington was born in the [[Bow Road]], in the [[East End of London]]. His father was a partner in the [[Charrington Brewery]], one of London’s biggest  brewing companies. Charrington was heir to a fortune of a million and a quarter pounds. He was educated at [[Marlborough College]], but left because of illness and  finished his school career at [[Brighton College]]. He subsequently joined the family business.

At the age of 19, Charrington had a conversion experience and became an [[Evangelical Christian]]. About a year later, while walking through [[Whitechapel]], he saw a poorly dressed woman with her children begging her husband to leave a [[public house]] and give her money for food. The furious husband came out and knocked her into the gutter. Charrington went to help and was also knocked to the ground. Looking up, he saw his name on the sign above the pub.

“When I saw that sign,” he later wrote, “I was stricken just as surely as Paul on the Damascus Road. Here was the source of my family wealth, and it was producing untold human misery before my own eyes. Then and there I pledged to God that not another penny of that money should come to me.”&lt;ref&gt;Ron Lee Davis, ''Courage to Begin Again'', Harvest House, Eugene, OR, 1978, pp. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;

Charrington abandoned the family business to devote his life to helping the poor in the East End. He opened a school, led a fight to clean up the [[music halls]] and became an ardent worker for the [[Temperance Movement]]. In 1870 he founded the [[Tower Hamlets Mission]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.towerhamletsmission.org&lt;/ref&gt; and made the Great Assembly Hall in the [[Mile End Road]] a centre of Christian work in the East End of London.

In 1903 Charrington purchased [[Osea Island]] off the coast of [[Maldon District|Maldon]] in Essex and established a treatment centre for people with alcohol and opiate addictions. In return for free treatment, clients would remain on the island and work the land.

He was one of the original members of the [[London County Council]] (1889–95).

He died in the [[London Hospital]] in January 1936.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4792">[[File:GMS Logo Green EN.png|thumb|[http://www.GreenMap.org Green Map System, Inc.]]]

'''Green Maps''' are locally created environmentally themed maps with a universal [[symbol]] set and map-making resources provided by the non-profit Green Map System. Based on the principles of [[cartography]] a Green Map plots the locations of a community's natural, cultural and sustainable resources such as recycling centers, heritage sites, community gardens, toxic waste sites and socially [[conscious business]]es.

== History ==
Green Maps are an educational and environmental communication tool for advocacy and public awareness first created for New York City by eco-designer Wendy Brawer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecocultural.info|title=Wendy E. Brawer|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Modern World Design in 1992 as seen at the [http://www.GreenAppleMap.org Green Apple Map] website. The global Green Map System was formed as a result of the response to this first Green Map. Since 1995, Green Mapmaking has grown steadily around the world.

[[File:About us staff.jpg|thumb|Green Map System's staff]]
Green Map’s office in New York City is the resource development, outreach and support center. Due to the growth in the number of projects a decentralized or "hub" based management system has been adopted. Green Map System has encouraged various regions to form local support networks. Green Map System and its network of regional hubs and community-led Green Map projects share their outcomes.

The website GreenMap.org is the gathering point for both the makers and the users of Green Maps. GreenMap.org went online in 1995 and it was re-launched in May 2007, with a resource center for Mapmakers all over the world to communicate and exchange their Green Map making experience. This content management system is named as [[Greenhouse]], symbolizing its ability to cultivate and present a “garden of Green Maps”.

Although Green Map System authorizes local mapmakers to use its  [http://www.greenmap.org/greenhouse/participate Green Mapmaking] icons and tools, every project is independent and locally led. Grassroots and established non-profits, universities and schools, governmental and tourism agencies use the icons and adaptable methodologies to develop and publish their own community's Green Map in a way that meets the needs of residents and visitors.

== Branding and spelling ==
While Green Map System prefers and promotes the spelling "Green Map" to preserve trademark claims,&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Brawer, e-mail message to Jerrad Pierce, November 21, 2004 regarding word choice in [http://cambridgema.greenmap.org/misc/Thesis.pdf "Improving the Cartographic Quality of Green Maps"]&lt;/ref&gt;
"green map" and "greenmap" are often used by local Green Map projects. Green Map System is concerned with maintaining control of copyright and trademark in order to preserve the perceived integrity of the system; they wish to prevent the use of Green Maps in [[greenwash]]ing&lt;ref&gt;Brawer, Wendy. "Copyright &amp; Icon updating".  11 December 2004. [http://www.greenmap.com/gm/forum/viewtopic.php?p=90 http://www.greenmap.com/gm/forum/viewtopic.php?p=90] (31 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and do not allow public use of their assets.&lt;ref&gt;Green Map System, "Mapmaker Checklist". 22 September 2003. [http://www.greenmap.org/report/checklist03.txt http://www.greenmap.org/report/checklist03.txt](31 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Map tagline is “Think Global, Map Local!”. It’s a play on the familiar think global - act local, and implies the same depth of local involvement for positive change.

All Green Maps use a set of globally designed [http://www.greenmap.org/greenhouse/about/iconintro Green Icons], developed collaboratively by the network of local project leaders. Allegedly this is the world’s only universal symbol set for maps. The globally designed icons ensure that all Green Maps engage and guide a diversity of users. Because concepts of sustainability are continually evolving, Green Mapmakers have developed the third version of the symbols, released in March 2008. Provided as a font for ease of use or as stickers for youth/computer-less Green Mapmakers.

'''Harriet Abbott Lincoln Coolidge''' (1849 - 1902) was an American philanthropist, author and reformer.{{sfn|New England Historic Genealogical Society|1900|p=97}}&lt;ref name="geni.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harriett Abbott Coolidge|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Harriett-Coolidge/6000000015665844145|website=geni.com|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did much in the way of instructing young mothers in the care and clothing of infants, and furthered the cause to improve the condition of infants in [[foundling hospital]]s.{{sfn|Low|1889|p=480}} She contributed a variety of articles on kindergarten matters to the daily press, and while living in [[Washington D.C.]], she gave a series of "nursery talks" for mothers at her home, where she fitted up a model nursery.{{sfn|Kindergarten Review|1895|p=262}} 

Coolidge was the editor of ''Trained Motherhood''; and author of ''In the Story Land'', ''Kindergarten Stories'', ''Talks to Mothers'', ''The Model Nursery'', and ''What a Young Girl Ought to Know''.{{sfn|Wood-Allen|1905|p=13}} She was one of the original signers of the Society of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], and was an active member of four of the leading charity organizations in Washington.

==Early years and education==
Harriet Abbot Lincoln, born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], was the daughter of [[Frederic W. Lincoln Jr. (politician)|Frederic W. Lincoln]] and Emmeline Hall Lincoln.{{sfn|Daughters of the American Revolution|1908|p=66}} Her parents married in May 1848, and she was born before her mother died in July 1849.{{sfn|Lincoln|1899|p=39}} Frederic was called the War Mayor of [[Boston]], as he held that office all through the [[American Civil War]] and was reelected and served seven years.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=205}} 

Her great-grandfather, Amos Lincoln, was a captain of artillery and one of the intrepid band who, in 1773, [[Boston Tea Party|consigned the tea to the water in Boston harbor]]. He was in the [[battle of Bunker Hill]], attached to [[John Stark|Stark's brigade]], in action at [[Battle of Bennington]], [[Battle of Brandywine]], and [[Battle of Monmouth]], and aided in the suppression of [[Shays's Rebellion]], and was also one of Governor [[John Hancock]]'s aids. On June 14, 1781, he was married to Deborah, a daughter of [[Paul Revere]], which made Coolidge a great-great-granddaughter of his. Amos Lincoln's first ancestor in the US was Samuel Lincoln, of [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], one of whose sons was Mordecai Lincoln, the ancestor of President [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=205}}  

Coolidge was delicate in childhood, and her philanthropic spirit was early shown in flower-mission and hospital work in Boston. Her childhood was passed as a neighbor of [[Louisa May Alcott]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]], [[Edwin Percy Whipple]], and [[James Thomas Fields]].{{sfn|Boston University, School of Education|1896|p=407}} For several years, she was instructed at home, and she was sent to [[Dr. Dio Lewis's School for Young Ladies]], of [[Lexington, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=206}} 

==Career==
In November, 1872, she married George Austin Coolidge, a publishing agent of Boston. After having children, Coolidge devoted herself to motherhood, studying the best methods of infant hygiene. She soon began a series of illustrated articles for the instruction of mothers in a [[New York City]] magazine, and while residing in that city, studied for three years and visited the hospitals for children.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=206}}

Ill health obliged her to return to [[Washington, D.C.]], where, before going to New York, she was interested in charities and hospitals for children. Meeting the mothers of both the rich and the poor, and seeing the great need of intelligent care in bringing up little children, she began a large correspondence with others. Her devotion to the children of the Foundling Hospital in Washington, and the great hygienic reformation she brought about, gave that institutional record of no deaths among its residents during the six months she acted as a member of its executive board of officers. Frequent inquiries from mothers desiring information on hygienic subjects relating to children suggested the idea of a series of nursery talks to mothers and the fitting up of a model nursery in tier residence, where every accessory of babyhood could be practically presented. "Nursery Talks" were inaugurated by a "Nursery Tea," and 500 women from official and leading circles were present. Classes were formed, and a paid course and a free one made those lectures available for all desiring information. Even into midsummer, at the urgent request of mothers, Coolidge continued to give her mornings to answering questions. She remained in Washington during the summer, guiding those who did not know how to feed their infants proper food, and, as a consequence, her health was impaired, and she was obliged to give up her nursery lectures until her health was restored. She then commenced a scientific course of hygienic study, and was made president of the Woman's Clinic, where women and children were treated by women physicians.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=206}} 

Coolidge was an active member of four of the leading charity organizations in Washington, a member of the Woman's National Press Association and devoted to every movement in which women's higher education was considered.
{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=206}} On October 11, 1890, at the Strathmore Arms, she was one of the original signers of the Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution.{{sfn|Daughters of the American Revolution|1898|p=307}} She also served as chairman of the School Suffrage Committee.{{sfn|Anthony||Harper|2017|p=886}}

Coolidge's book, ''In the story land'', contained stories for the kindergarten, the school, and the home. It was made up from three smaller volumes, which sold separately in boards at 25 cents each. Some of the stories included: "Little Black Fairy" (Coal), "Mother Willow and Her Friends," "The Discontented Raindrop," "Little Bed Cap" (Squirrel), "The Violet and Nutshell," "The Rose Club," "How the Fairies Came" (Rainbow colors), "Dear Little Brownie" (Chestnut), "Little Yellow and His Brothers and Sisters" (Maple leaf).{{sfn|Boston University, School of Education|1896|p=407}}

==Personal life==
She married George Austin Coolidge in 1872. A daughter, Emelyn Lincoln Coolidge (b. Boston, August 9, 1873), was a pediatrician.{{sfn|Leonard|1914|p=203}} Coolidge died on either 17 or 18 May, 1902 at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], after having been rushed there from Washington, D. C. suffering from acute bronchitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=(untitled)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12424412/untitled_the_brooklyn_daily_eagle/|accessdate=17 July 2017|publisher=''[[The Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]''|date=30 May 1902|location=Brooklyn, New York|page=4|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Hariett Coolidge|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12425068/mrs_hariett_coolidge_the_baltimore/|accessdate=17 July 2017|publisher=''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''|date=18 May 1902|location=Baltimore, Maryland|page=14|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research''' ('''HIIK''') is an independent and interdisciplinary registered association located at the Department of Political Science at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Since 1991, the HIIK has been committed to the distribution of knowledge about the emergence, course and settlement of interstate and intrastate political conflicts. The Conflict Barometer is published annually and contains the current research results.

== Conflict Barometer ==
The HIIK's annual publication '''Conflict Barometer''' describes the recent trends in global conflict developments, escalations, de-escalations, and settlements. [[Coup d'état]], attempted coups d'états, as well as implemented measures of conflict resolution are also reported. It is subdivided into five world regions and presents all present conflicts in detailed charts and short descriptions. The methodological approach consists of the conflict definition and the measuring of the conflict intensity.

== Methodology after 2011 ==
Following a methodological revision in 2011, changes in the Heidelberg methodology included allocating intensities not only based on state units and calendar years, but also on the level of subnational units and calendar months. Furthermore, the establishment of intensities now follows an analysis of clearly conceived proxy indicators, used for the assessment of means and consequences of a conflict measure. This analysis continues to be based on the actions of conflict actors, as well as the communication between them. Through the conceptual refinement and standardization of data collection and documentation, the HIIK data achieves a higher degree of precision, reliability, and comprehensibility regarding information on political conflicts.

== Conflict definition ==
A political conflict is a positional difference between at least two assertive and directly involved actors regarding values relevant to a society (the conflict items including (territory, [[secession]], [[decolonization]], [[autonomy]], [[Ideology|system/ideology]], [[national power]], [[regional predominance]], [[international power]], [[Resource (economics)|resources]], other)) which is carried out using observable and interrelated conflict measures that lie outside established regulatory procedures and threaten core state functions, the international order, or hold the prospect of doing so.
	According to the Heidelberg (1998) methodology and ideology, the essence of a political conflict lies in a contradiction, adequately represented by the concept of a “positional difference”: a positional difference is a perceived incompatibility of ideas and beliefs. It presupposes the presence of the following elements:
(1) There must be at least two entities possessing intellectual capacity and vision, and who are capable of communicating. Such an entity is called an actor.
(2) In order for the actors to sense incompatibility between their ideas and beliefs, there must be reciprocal actions and acts of communication between said actors. These actions and acts of communication are called measures.
(3) A communicating act always refers to a specific issue, an action always refers to a certain object. The subject behind a measure is called item.
For the purpose of defining the term political conflict more precisely, the three elements aforementioned shall be further defined. These elements are necessary requirements for the existence of a political conflict.

| A political conflict is classified as a non-violent crisis if physical violence is being implicitly or explicitly threatened to persons or property by at least one of the actors, or if one actor uses physical violence against property, without regarding the injury of people as acceptable. A threat of force is understood as a verbally or non-verbally communicated prospect of violent measures that is based on the conflict item. An acceptance of the injury of persons is present when the use of force against property includes the possibility of the injury of people but the violator is indifferent to this possibility.

'''Dame Henrietta Octavia Weston Barnett''', [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (''née'' '''Rowland'''; 4 May 1851 – 10 June 1936) was a notable English [[social reformer]], educationist, and author. She and her husband, [[Samuel Augustus Barnett]], founded the first "University Settlement" at [[Toynbee Hall]] (in the [[East End of London]]) in 1884. They also worked to establish the model [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]] in the early 20th century.

==Early life==
Born in [[Clapham]], London, Henrietta Octavia Weston Rowland lost her mother (Henrietta Monica Margaretta Ditges)&lt;ref name="SpartacusHB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simkin|first1=John|title=Henrietta Barnett|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Henrietta_Barnett.htm|website=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at an early age. Her father, Alexander William Rowland, a wealthy businessman associated with the [[Macassar oil|Macassar Oil Company]],&lt;ref name="SpartacusHB" /&gt; raised her and seven siblings at their London home and a country house in [[Kent]], where she developed a lifelong appreciation of country pursuits. One of her sisters was the philanthropist [[Alice Hart]].&lt;ref name="hgs.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hgs.org.uk/reference/hbbiography/ckreview.html |title=Henrietta Barnett in Whitechapel a review by Chris Kellerman |website=Hgs.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="infed1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infed.org/mobi/henrietta-barnett-social-reform-and-community-building |title=Henrietta Barnett, social reform and community building |website=Infed.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 16, Henrietta was sent to a boarding school in Devon run by the Haddon sisters, who, influenced by [[James Hinton]],&lt;ref name="SpartacusHB" /&gt; were committed to social altruism. When her father died in 1869, Henrietta moved with two sisters to Bayswater, where she met and helped social activist and housing reformer [[Octavia Hill]].&lt;ref name="infed1" /&gt; Hill introduced Henrietta to the writings of [[John Ruskin]], as well as many influential people similarly interested in improving the condition of London's poor.

==Marriage and activism==
Through Hill, Henrietta met [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] Samuel Barnett, then the curate of [[St Mary's, Bryanston Square]]. They married in 1873. The newlyweds soon moved to the impoverished [[Whitechapel]] parish of St Jude's, intent on improving social conditions. Henrietta continued her parish visiting activities, with a focus on women and children, including the more than 2,000 prostitutes then active in Whitechapel alone.&lt;ref name="hgs.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hgs.org.uk/reference/hbbiography/ckreview.html |title=Henrietta Barnett in Whitechapel a review by Chris Kellerman |website=Hgs.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, Henrietta became a woman guardian for the parish, and the following year was named a school manager for the [[Poor law union|Poor Law district]] schools in [[Forest Gate]]. Another social initiative which the Barnetts helped set up was the [[Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants]] (1876), with [[Jane Senior]]; the organisation aimed to prevent girls from becoming prostitutes, criminals or alcoholics, and provided domestic servants.&lt;ref name="SpartacusHB" /&gt;  The Barnetts' experiment in sending slum children for country holidays grew into the Children's Fresh Air Mission (Off to the Country), established in 1877,&lt;ref name="SpartacusHB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://infed.org/mobi/henrietta-barnett-social-reform-and-community-building Children's Country Holiday Fund], Retrieved 14 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the Children's Country Holidays Fund in 1884.&lt;ref name="CCHF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.cchf-allaboutkids.org.uk/ourhistory.htm|website=CCHF - All About Kids|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henrietta Barnett promoted Homes for Workhouse Girls starting in 1880, and founded the London Pupil Teachers Association in 1891. She also served as vice-president of the National Association for the Welfare of the Feeble-Minded (1895) and [[National Council of Women of Great Britain|National Union of Women Workers]] (1895–96).
[[File:Toynbee Hall 1902.jpg|thumb|Toynbee Hall 1902]]
In 1884, the Barnetts established (and began living at) [[Toynbee Hall]], a pioneering university [[settlement house|settlement]] named after the recently deceased distinguished historian [[Arnold Toynbee]],&lt;ref&gt;
Seth Koven, ‘Barnett , Dame Henrietta Octavia Weston (1851–1936)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2013 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30610, accessed 14 Jan 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; who had advocated education of the working classes and reduction of the division between social classes. In 1897 annual loan exhibitions of fine art began at the nearby [[Whitechapel Gallery]] through the Barnetts' efforts. In 1903 [[Richard Tawney]] began working with them, the Children's Country Holiday Fund, and the [[Workers' Educational Association]]. [[William Beveridge]] and [[Clement Attlee]] also worked with the Barnetts as they started their own careers. A visit to Toynbee Hall inspired [[Jane Addams]] to found Hull House in Chicago.

In 1889 the activist couple acquired a weekend home at Spaniard's End in the [[Hampstead]] area of north-west London. The Barnetts became inspired by [[Ebenezer Howard]] and the model housing development movement (then exemplified by [[Letchworth]] garden city), as well as protecting part of nearby [[Hampstead Heath]] from development by [[Eton College]]. In 1904, they established trusts which bought 243 acres of land along the newly opened Northern line extension to [[Golders Green]]. This became the [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]], a model garden city developed through their efforts and those of architects [[Raymond Unwin]] and Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] and which ultimately grew to encompass over 800 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hgstrust.org/history/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206232730/http://hgstrust.org/history/index.html |archivedate=6 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, an adult education institute opened in the middle of the new Hampstead Garden Suburb, with cultural programmes and discussion groups. Soon a school for girls was established and named the [[Henrietta Barnett School]].&lt;ref name="infed1"/&gt;

Although the suburb was never completely developed according to Lutyens's plan (and soon became a middle class enclave rather than a mixture of classes), it did include Grade I listed [[St Jude's Church, Hampstead Garden Suburb|St Jude's Church]], as well as a clubhouse and a tea house (for non-alcoholic social focus), a Quaker meeting house, children's homes, a nursery school, and housing for old people. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The Barnetts never had children of their own. They adopted Dorothy Woods, and Henrietta also served as legal guardian for her brain-damaged elder sister, Fanny. After Samuel died in 1913, Henrietta founded Barnett House at Oxford (1914) in his memory. She helped it become the university's centre for social work and social policy education.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Writing==
Barnett wrote several books, alone and with her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=BARNETT, Mrs. (Henrietta Octavia)|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[Christian Socialist]] beliefs are set out in ''Practicable Socialism'' (1889) and ''Toward Social Reform'' (1909).

Her early books concerned domestic issues: ''The Making of the Home'' (1885), ''How to Mind the Baby,'' (1887) and, written with her husband and [[Ernest Abraham Hart]] (her brother-in-law), ''The Making of the Body'' (1894). With Kathleen Mallam, Henrietta Barnett also edited a collection of essays entitled ''Destitute, Neglected, and Delinquent Children'' (Pan-Anglican papers, 1908). After her husband's death, Henrietta Barnett finished their ''Illustrated British Ballads Old and New'' (1915), wrote his multi-volume biography, ''Canon Barnett: his life, work and friends'' (1918) as well as published collections of essays, most notably ''Matters that Matter'' (1930). {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Honours==
For her work as a social reformer, Barnett was named a [[CBE|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1917, and elevated to [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (DBE) in 1924. In 1920, she was named honorary president of the 480 member American Federation of Settlements.

==Death and legacy==
For the final dozen years of her life, Henrietta Barnett took up painting and often lived at 45 Wish Road, Hove (today marked by a [[blue plaque]]).

She died at Hampstead in 1936 (aged 85) and is buried (with Samuel) in the churchyard of [[St Helen's Church, Hangleton]], East Sussex.&lt;ref name="Dale227"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dale|first=Antony|title=Brighton Churches|year=1989|location=London EC4|isbn=0-415-00863-8|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barnetts are jointly remembered on 17 June on the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|liturgical calendar]] of the [[Church of England]].

== History ==
The first online community to use the term "incel" was started in 1993 when a Canadian college student known only by her first name, Alana, created a website in order to discuss her sexual inactivity with others.&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/24/incel-sexual-frustration-rebellion-at-center-toronto-attack.html|title='Incel' sexual frustration 'rebellion' at center of Toronto attack|last=Schallhorn|first=Kaitlyn|date=April 24, 2018|work=[[Fox News]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/08/intel-involuntary-celibate-movement-218324|title=How 'Incel' Got Hijacked|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|date=May 8, 2018|work=[[Politico]]|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/news/a34512/woman-who-started-incel-movement/|title=The Woman Who Accidentally Started the Incel Movement|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=March 1, 2016|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website, titled "Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project",&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt; was used by people of all genders to share their thoughts and experiences.  In 1997, she started a mailing list on the topic that used the abbreviation INVCEL, which was later shortened to "incel", where it was defined as "anybody of any gender who was lonely, had never had sex or who hadn't had a relationship in a long time".&lt;ref name="bbcaug302018"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45284455|title=The woman who founded the 'incel' movement|last=Taylor|first=Jim|date=August 30, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=August 30, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her college career and after, she realized she was [[queer]], and became more comfortable with her identity. She later gave the site to a stranger.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; When speaking about the website in 2018, Alana said, "It definitely wasn't a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems. That's a pretty sad version of this phenomenon that's happening today. Things have changed in the last 20 years."&lt;ref name="bbcaug302018" /&gt;

The message board love-shy.com was founded in 2003 as a place for people who were perpetually rejected or extremely shy of potential partners to discuss their situations.&lt;ref name="Dewey2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[/r/incels]] [[subreddit]], a forum on the website [[Reddit]], became a particularly active incel community. The subreddit was known as a place where men blamed women for their involuntary celibacy, sometimes advocated for rape or other violence, and were misogynistic and often racist.&lt;ref name="Solon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/reddit-violence-policy.html|title=Reddit Bans Nazi Groups and Others in Crackdown on Violent Content|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=October 26, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; One post titled "general question about how rapists get caught" was asked by a member pretending to be a woman, saying they wanted to know how a woman who was drugged and raped would begin finding her rapist.&lt;ref name="Solon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-41926687|title=Reddit bans 'involuntarily celibate' community|last=Bell|first=Chris|date=November 9, 2017|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Alana read about the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]], and the way parts of the incel subculture glorified the perpetrator, Elliot Rodger,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; she wrote, "Like a scientist who invented something that ended up being a weapon of war, I can't uninvent this word, nor restrict it to the nicer people who need it."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Alana expressed regret at the change in usage from her original intent of creating an "inclusive community" for men and women who were sexually deprived due to social awkwardness, marginalization, or mental illness.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/woman-who-invented-incel-movement-interview-toronto-attack|title=Woman behind 'incel' says angry men hijacked her word 'as a weapon of war'|last1=Kassam|first1=Ashifa|date=April 26, 2018|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since started a new project, "Love Not Anger", which she describes as "a project to research how lonely people might find respectful love, instead of being stuck in anger".&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

On October 25, 2017, Reddit announced a new policy that would ban "content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  and banned the /r/incels subreddit on November 7, 2017, under its purview. At the time of the ban, the community had around 40,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/technology/incels-reddit-banned.html|title=Reddit Bans 'Incel' Group for Inciting Violence Against Women|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=November 9, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Incels came to wider public notice with the banning of the subreddit and when a series of mass murders were committed by men who either self-identified as involuntarily celibate or shared similar ideologies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/life-love/sex-relationships/a33782/involuntary-celibacy/|title=What Happens to Men Who Can't Have Sex|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=February 29, 2016|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However the incel community continued to inhabit Reddit.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; Increased interest in incel communities has been attributed to the feeling of "aggrieved entitlement" by some men, who feel they are being denied rights they deserve and blame women instead of society's expectation of [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

The black pill is a set of beliefs that are commonly held amongst members of incel communities, such as biological determinism, [[fatalism]] and [[defeatism]] for unattractive people.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/raw-hatred-why-incel-movement-targets-terrorises-women|title='Raw hatred': why the 'incel' movement targets and terrorises women|last=Williams|first=Zoe|date=April 25, 2018|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone who believes in the black pill is "blackpilled".&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

The concept of the black pill distinguishes incels from the men's rights movement and their popular reference to the [[Red pill and blue pill|red pill]], an allusion to the dilemma in the movie ''[[The Matrix]]'' where the protagonist must choose to remain in a world of illusion (taking the blue pill) or to see the world as it really is (taking the red pill).&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/incels-alek-minassian-mra-mens-rights-terrorism-toronto-van-attack-a8323166.html|title=Don't make the mistake of thinking incels are men's rights activists – they are so much more dangerous|last=Squirrell|first=Tim|date=April 26, 2018|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of men's rights activism, "taking the red pill" means seeing a world where women hold power over men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/mens-rights-activism-the-red-pill|title=What Kind of Man Joins the Men's Rights Movement?|last=Sharlet|first=Bruce|date=February 3, 2014|work=[[GQ]]|access-date=April 27, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black pill, on the other hand, refers to hopelessness.&lt;ref name="elconfi" /&gt; It also holds that one's personality is not very important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yourtango.com/2018312914/what-does-chad-mean-incel-slang-definitions-history-terms-on-forums-reddit-4chan|title=What Does 'Chad' Mean?

The incel subculture includes people who are in [[sexless marriage]]s (or other sexless relationships) but who wish to be sexually active. It is considered to be distinct from [[asexuality]] and from voluntary [[Abstinence|sexual abstinence]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnelly|first=Denise|last2=Burgess|first2=Elisabeth|last3=Anderson|first3=Sally|last4=Davis|first4=Regina|last5=Dillard|first5=Joy|date=2001|title=Involuntary Celibacy: A life course analysis|url=http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~meeklesr/celibacy.html|journal=[[The Journal of Sex Research]]|volume=38|issue=2|pages=159–169|doi=10.1080/00224490109552083|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
"Involuntary celibacy" is not a medical or psychological condition.

== Mass murders and violence ==
Some mass murders and other violent attacks in North America have been committed or are suspected to have been committed by men who have self-identified as involuntarily celibate, or whose statements align with incel ideologies.

On May 23, 2014, Elliot Rodger [[2014 Isla Vista killings|killed six people and injured fourteen others]] before killing himself in [[Isla Vista, California|Isla Vista]], [[California]], near the campus of [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. These killings drew media attention to the concept of involuntary celibacy, and particularly the misogyny and glorification of violence that are a mainstay of many incel communities. Rodger self-identified as an incel and left behind a 137-page manifesto and [[YouTube]] videos detailing his involuntary celibacy and discussing how he wanted revenge for being rejected by women.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/05/24/the-disturbing-internet-footprint-of-santa-barbara-shooter-elliot-rodger/ |title=The Disturbing Internet Footprint Of Santa Barbara Shooter Elliot Rodger|last=Hill|first=Kashmir|date=May 24, 2014|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/elliot-rodger-killings-in-california-followed-years-of-withdrawal.html|title=Elliot O.

In the months leading up to the shooting, he posted numerous misogynistic, racist, violent, and homophobic songs to [[SoundCloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/tallahassee-yoga-shooter-incel-far-right-misogyny-video|title=Tallahassee Yoga Shooter Was A Far-Right Misogynist Who Railed Against Women And Minorities Online|last=Mack|first=David|date=3 November 2018|work=Buzzfeed|access-date=4 November 2018|last2=Jamieson|first2=Amber|last3=Reinstein|first3=Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2018/11/03/gunman-had-history-arrests-grabbing-women/1871941002/|title=Scott Beierle, gunman in Tallahassee yoga studio shooting, remembered as 'really creepy'|last=Burlew|first=Jeff|date=3 November 2018|work=Tallahassee Democrat|access-date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/10/31/18039294/scott-beierle-tallahassee-shooting-pittsburgh-gab|title=Scott Beierle Tallahassee shooting: why online hate is so dangerous|last=North|first=Anna|date=3 November 2018|website=Vox|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Incel communities have been widely criticized in the media and by researchers as violent, misogynist, and extremist.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":WaPo-Houston-etc" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst working for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has cautioned that exposure to violent content on incel forums "play[s] a very large role" in the radicalization of incels, and describes violent posts on the forums as "more&amp;nbsp;... than I'm used to seeing on even white supremacist sites".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Journalist [[David Futrelle]] has described incel communities as "violently misogynistic", and is among critics who attribute worsening violent rhetoric on incel forums to the growth of the alt-right and white supremacy, and the overlap between incel communities and online hate groups.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/online-extremism-radical-misogyny_us_5b491358e4b0bc69a787458f|title=Internet Giants Are Banning Extremists (Just Not The Ones Targeting Women)|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=July 27, 2018|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4167152/toronto-van-attack-incel-alek-minassian-violence/|title=Expert traces link between violent online alt-right fantasies and real-world attacks|last=Cain|first=Patrick|date=April 27, 2018|work=[[Global News]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior research fellow at the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] (ISD), [[Amarnath Amarasingam]], has criticized some incel communities where calls for violence are commonplace, saying "under the right set of psychological and personal circumstances, these kinds of forums can be dangerous and push people into violence".&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt; Another researcher at the ISD, Jacob Davey, compared the radicalization of incels in incel forums to teenagers being urged to go to extreme measures on online [[Pro-ana|forums that promote anorexia and other eating disorders]] and to online campaigns convincing people to join [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]. Speaking about incels' feelings of entitlement to sex, Davey said the attitude "can go as far as the justification of rape". [[University of Portsmouth]] lecturer Lisa Sugiura has described incel forums as a "networked misogyny", and urged the posts in such forums be taken seriously not only in the context of [[hate speech]] but also as a form of grooming that could radicalize "impressionable and vulnerable disillusioned young men".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/rise-women-haters-inside-dark-world-british-incels/|title=Rise of the women haters: Inside the dark world of the British 'incels'|last=Tait|first=Amelia|date=August 18, 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=September 1, 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism has also been directed against platforms that host or have hosted incel content, including Reddit (who banned the /r/incels community in 2017 but has declined to ban another incel subreddit) and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; [[Cloudflare]], which provides services including [[DDoS mitigation|DDoS protection]] and [[Cache (computing)|caching]] so that webpages are still accessible when a site is offline, has also been criticized for protecting incel websites against [[downtime]] even when webhosts have terminated service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/incels-cloudfare-online-content-protection_us_5b491632e4b022fdcc597327|title=From Nazis To Incels: How One Tech Company Helps Hate Groups Thrive|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=July 25, 2018|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting on incels by media outlets following the incel-related attacks during the 2010s has been criticized for its "breathless" coverage, normalizing incel communities by describing them as "sexually frustrated", and directing readers to incel communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/toronto-attack-incel-alek-minassian|title=After the Toronto attack don't explain Incel ideology, ban it|last=Kobie|first=Nicole|date=April 26, 2018|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reporting has also been criticized for [[victim blaming]] by implying that women and peers who rejected the attackers held some responsibility for provoking the attacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/05/21/no-girls-and-women-dont-provoke-mass-murderers/|title=No, girls and women don't 'provoke' mass murderers|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|date=May 21, 2018|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for giving attackers notoriety by reporting on them at length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44321469|title=The problem with mass shootings and the media|last=Cooper|first=Kelly-Leigh|date=May 31, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''institutional repository''' is an archive for collecting, preserving, and disseminating digital copies of the intellectual output of an institution, particularly a research institution.&lt;ref name="eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk"&gt;Van de Sompel, H &amp; Lagoze, C.

Discussion Paper. ''Scholarly Publication and Academic Resources Coalition'', Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

An institutional repository can be viewed as a "...a set of services that a university offers to members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and its community members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Clifford |title=Institutional Repositories: Essential Infrastructure for Scholarship in the Digital Age|url= http://www.arl.org/storage/documents/publications/arl-br-226.pdf |publisher=Association of Research Libraries |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[university]], this includes materials such as [[monographs]], [[eprint]]s of [[academic journal]] articles—both before ([[preprint]]s) and after ([[postprints]]) undergoing [[peer review]]—as well as electronic [[thesis|theses]] and dissertations. An institutional repository might also include other [[digital asset]]s generated by academics, such as datasets, administrative documents, course notes, [[learning object]]s, or [[conference proceedings]]. Deposit of material in an institutional repository is sometimes mandated by that institution.

Some of the main objectives for having an institutional repository are to provide [[open access]] to institutional research output by [[self-archiving]] in an [[open access repository]], to create global visibility for an institution's scholarly research, and to store and preserve other institutional digital assets, including unpublished or otherwise easily lost ("[[grey literature|grey]]") literature such as theses, working papers or technical reports.

==Origins==
Digital institutional repositories are document servers enabling researchers to [[archive]] their research output.&lt;ref name="Open access infrastructure"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Smith | first1 = Ina| title = Open access infrastructure| publisher = UNESCO Publishing| date = 2015| pages = 7| url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232204&amp;gp=1&amp;mode=e&amp;lin=1| isbn = 978-92-3-100075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide institutions are starting to implement digital institutional repositories for [[digital formats]] of research. Scholarly output can be [[born-digital]], in which no [[digitalisation]] is necessary before the research is included in a digital repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Smith | first1 = Ina| title = Open access infrastructure| publisher = UNESCO Publishing| date = 2015| pages = 19| url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232204&amp;gp=1&amp;mode=e&amp;lin=1| isbn = 978-92-3-100075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A digital institutional repository accessible through the Internet can improve the visibility, usage and impact of research conducted at an institution.&lt;ref name="unesdoc.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Smith | first1 = Ina| title = Open access infrastructure| publisher = UNESCO Publishing| date = 2015| pages = 20| url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232204&amp;gp=1&amp;mode=e&amp;lin=1| isbn = 978-92-3-100075-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the notion of an institutional repository are twofold:
* Institutional repositories are partly linked to the notion of digital [[interoperability]], which is in turn linked to the [[Open Archives Initiative]] (OAI) and its [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting]] (OAI-PMH). The OAI in turn had its roots in the notion of a "Universal Preprint Service",&lt;ref name="eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk"/&gt; since superseded by the [[open access]] movement.
* Institutional repositories are partly linked to the notion of a [[digital library]]—i.e., collecting, housing, classifying, cataloguing, curating, preserving, and providing access to digital content—analogous with the library's conventional function of collecting, housing classifying, curating, preserving and providing access to analog content.

In 2003 the function of an institutional repository was coined by [[Clifford Lynch]] in relation to universities. He argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... a university-based institutional repository is a set of services that a university offers to the members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and its community members. It is most essentially an organizational commitment to the stewardship of these digital materials, including long-term preservation where appropriate, as well as organization and access or distribution."&lt;ref name="Open access infrastructure"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Besides archiving research output institutional repositories can perform the functions such as [[knowledge management]], research assessment and showcasing an institution's research output.&lt;ref name="unesdoc.unesco.org"/&gt;

The content of an institutional repository depends on the focus of the institution. Higher education institutions conduct research across multiple disciplines, thus research from a variety of [[Discipline (academia)|academic subjects]]. Examples of such digital institutional repositories include the MIT Institutional Repository. A [[disciplinary repository]] is subject specific. It holds and provides access to scholarly research in a particular discipline. While there can be disciplinary repositories for one institution, disciplinary repositories are frequently not tied to a specific institution. The PsyDok digital repository for example holds German language research in psychology. SSOAR is an international social science full text-server.&lt;ref name="Open access infrastructure"/&gt;

==Open access repositories==
:''See also: [[:Category:Open access by country|Open access by country]]''
Institutional repositories that provide access to research to users outside the institutional community are one of the recommended ways to achieve the [[open access]] vision described in the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] definition of open access. This is sometimes referred to as the [[self-archiving]] or "green" route to open access.

Repository 66 is a [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]] that indicates the worldwide locations of open access digital repositories. It is based on data provided by [[Registry of Open Access Repositories|ROAR]] and the [[OpenDOAR]] service developed by [[SHERPA (organisation)|SHERPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Stuart|title=About|url=http://maps.repository66.org/about/|work=Repository 66 Map Blog|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing an institutional repository==
An institutional repository has been understood as a means to ensure that the published work of scholars is available to the academic community even after increases in subscription fees or budget cuts within libraries. The majority of research scholars do not provide free access to their research output to their colleagues in an organization. Institutional repositories provide scholars with a common platform so that everyone in the institution can contribute scholarly material to promote cross-campus interdisciplinary research. The development of an institutional repository redefines the production and dissemination of scholarly material within an academic community. The contents available on the institute’s website usually are removed after a few weeks. An institutional repository can provide a platform to manage institutional information, including web content. Institutional repositories have a number of benefits, including access to resources, visibility of research, and presentations of the contents.&lt;ref&gt;Bhardwaj, Raj Kumar. "Institutional Repository Literature: A Bibliometric Analysis." Science &amp; Technology Libraries ahead-of-print (2014): 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

If an institution has decided to invest in a repository numerous resources exist to help librarians and other repository managers frame and answer such questions, including "A Librarian's Process for Building an Institutional Repository",&lt;ref&gt;Stezano, Leo (March 2016). A Librarian’s Process for Building an Institutional Repository. Elsevier Library Connect https://libraryconnect.elsevier.com/sites/default/files/ELS-LC_IR_process.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
The major institutional repository software platforms use a common open standard called [[Protocol for Metadata Harvesting|OAI-PMH]]. This standard makes it not just possible to collect and move research output from one platform to another.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

While a majority of the institutions run institutional repository software on local servers,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opendoar.org/onechart.php?cID=&amp;ctID=&amp;rtID=&amp;clID=&amp;lID=&amp;potID=&amp;rSoftWareName=&amp;search=&amp;groupby=r.rSoftWareName&amp;orderby=Tally%2520DESC&amp;charttype=pie&amp;width=600&amp;height=300&amp;caption=Usage%2520of%2520Open%2520Access%2520Repository%2520Software%2520-%2520Worldwide |title=OpenDOAR Chart - Usage%20of%20Open%20Access%20Repository%20Software%20-%20Worldwide |website=OpenDOAR |access-date=2016-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325152831/http://opendoar.org/onechart.php?cID=&amp;ctID=&amp;rtID=&amp;clID=&amp;lID=&amp;potID=&amp;rSoftWareName=&amp;search=&amp;groupby=r.rSoftWareName&amp;orderby=Tally%20DESC&amp;charttype=pie&amp;width=600&amp;height=300&amp;caption=Usage%20of%20Open%20Access%20Repository%20Software%20-%20Worldwide |archivedate=March 25, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; among new adopters, there is a strong preference towards cloud-based services.  A survey commissioned by Duraspace found that 72% of respondents indicated that their institutional repository is a hosted service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march15/bishoff/03bishoff.html|title=Managing Digital Collections Survey Results|website=www.dlib.org|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Institutions are choosing cloud-based solutions because such providers "enable institutions to easily get started with a hosted software service, with no need to provision local hardware, software, staff, or other infrastructure nor is there any specific technical skill or expertise required".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.duraspace.org/managing-digital-collections-survey-results-summary|title=Managing Digital Collections Survey Results Summary {{!}} DuraSpace|website=www.duraspace.org|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also important to the decision to go hosted may be the understanding that a hosted institutional repository solution "frees a library from both hardware and software support, allowing staff resources to be directed to other publishing service functions such as consulting and workflow design."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/research-library-publishing-services.pdf|title=Search Publications {{!}} Association of Research Libraries® {{!}} ARL®|website=www.arl.org|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aggregators==
The [[Confederation of Open Access Repositories]] (COAR) states in its manifesto that "Each individual repository is of limited value for research: the real power of Open Access lies in the possibility of connecting and tying together repositories, which is why we need interoperability. In order to create a seamless layer of content through connected repositories from around the world, open access relies on interoperability, the ability for systems to communicate with each other and pass information back and forth in a usable format. Interoperability allows us to exploit today's computational power so that we can aggregate, data mine, create new tools and services, and generate new knowledge from repository content."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Case for Interoperability for Open Access Repositories|url=http://www.coar-repositories.org/files/A-Case-for-Interoperability-Final-Version.pdf|work=COAR|publisher=COAR|accessdate=24 September 2013|page=2|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interoperability is achieved in the world of institutional repositories using protocols to which repositories should conform, such as OAI-PMH. This allows search engines and open access aggregators, such as [[BASE (search engine)|BASE]] and [[COnnecting REpositories|CORE]], to index repository metadata and content and provide value-added services on top of this content.&lt;ref name="Knoth, P. and Zdrahal"&gt;Knoth, P. &amp; Zdrahal, Z. (2012). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1045/november2012-knoth CORE: Three Access Levels to Underpin Open Access] D-Lib Magazine, 18, 11/12, ''Corporation for National Research Initiatives''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digital Commons Network aggregates by discipline some 500 institutional repositories running on the [[Bepress]] [[Digital Commons]] platform. It includes more that two million full-text objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20790">'''International Year of Volunteers''' was designated for 2001 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. The initiative aimed at increased recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of [[volunteering]], to highlight the achievements of the millions of volunteers worldwide who devote their time to serving others, and to encourage more people globally to engage in volunteering.

== Origins and goals ==

The concept for a [[United Nations]] year to recognize volunteerism first emerged within the UN system at a 1996 policy forum in [[Japan]] by UNV and [[United Nations University]] (UNU). A February 1997 proposal of the Government of Japan was transmitted through the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary General]] be placed on the agenda of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) in July 1997. ECOSOC, in its resolution 1977/44 of 22 July 1997, recommended to the UN General Assembly that it adopt the resolution proclaiming 2001 the International Year of Volunteers. The UN General Assembly, in its 52nd session on 20 November 1997 in Resolution 52/17,&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of 2001 as International Year of Volunteers" published by [http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/resources/un-resolutions/doc/declaration-of-2001-as.html UNV] on November 20, 1997, accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; co-sponsored by 123 countries, passed the ECOSOC resolution, thereby proclaiming 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers. The [[United Nations Volunteers|United Nations Volunteers programme]] (UNV), part of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), was designated in the resolution as the international focal point.&lt;ref&gt;"What is the International Year of Volunteers 2001?" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20001021024611/http://www.iyv2001.org/iyv_eng/whatis/whatis.htm www.iyv2001.org], version October 21, 2000, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"IYV 2001: A chronology" published at [http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/archive/unv-news/unv-news-december-2001/doc/iyv-2001-a-chronology.html unv.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006175744/http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/archive/unv-news/unv-news-december-2001/doc/iyv-2001-a-chronology.html |date=2016-10-06 }}, by UN Volunteers, accessed August 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectives of IYV were:
* increased recognition of volunteers and their contributions

Solicited by UNV, musicians from around the world donated and wrote songs about volunteerism, submitting them to UNV for possible inclusion on the IYV2001 website and in a CD. Chosen songs were offered via the website to download for free. UNV also offered a CD with 27 songs in nine languages, by musicians from 18 countries, in celebration of IYV.  The CD featured Jamaican reggae star [[Tony Rebel]], who donated the song, "Not all about money", and Portugal's [[Paulo de Carvalho]], who donated the song "Vai e faz" (Go and Do). Most of the songs praised the virtues of volunteers, but the last song, by Dave Greenfield of Canada, was meant to provoke political debate and question social issues about volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;"Songs celebrating volunteerism" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20020603162258/http://www.iyv2001.org/iyv_eng/world/creativity/songs/index.htm www.iyv2001.org], version June 3, 2002, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Colors of [[Benetton Group|Benetton]]'s communication campaign for autumn 2001 was produced in collaboration with UNV and honored IYV. Instead of professional models, the campaign featured photos of volunteers, such as a tattooed former member of a street gang who volunteered in anti-violence activities, a young lawyer volunteering to promote and defend human rights, a trans-gendered person who volunteered to distribute condoms amongst prostitutes, and an elderly tap dancer who entertained residents in homes for the elderly. The campaign was promoted throughout Europe, the United States, South America and parts of Asia, in newspapers, magazines, and billboards. A special issue of Benetton's magazine ''Colors'' was published for the campaign in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"Benetton launches new campaign in collaboration with UN Volunteers for the International Year of Volunteers" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20011006000551/http://www.iyv2001.org/infobase/press/01_09_25DEU_benetton_un.htm www.iyv2001.org], version October 6, 2001, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VOLUNTEERS [http://www.colorsmagazine.com/magazine/46 Colors] Issue #46, published November 2001, accessed August 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The final event for the year by UNV, the International Symposium on Volunteering, was 18–21 November 2001 in Geneva, Switzerland.

Then [[Pope John Paul II]] issued a statement on December 5, 2001, noting, "At the end of the year, that the United Nations dedicated to Volunteer work, I wish to express my heartfelt appreciation for your constant dedication, in every part of the world, in going to meet those who live in poverty. Whether you work individually or gathered together in special associations, you represent for children, the elderly, the sick, people in difficulty, refugees and the persecuted a ray of hope that pierces the darkness of solitude and encourages them to overcome the temptations of violence and egotism."&lt;ref&gt;"MESSAGE OF JOHN PAUL II

The General Assembly marked the closing of IYV on December 5, 2001 by adopting a resolution on recommendations for volunteer action, commending the ongoing contributions of all volunteers to society, and encouraging all people to become more engaged in voluntary activities. The assembly also decided that two plenary meetings at its fifty-seventh session on 5 December 2002 should be devoted to the outcome of the IYV and its follow-up.

== European Year of Volunteering ==

The European Year of Volunteering (EYV) was in 2011, launched by the [[European Commission]] to celebrate the volunteerism efforts of Europeans and chosen to correspond with the 10th anniversary of  IYV. It was originally an initiative of the EYV 2011 Alliance, an informal gathering of volunteer networks, such as [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and [[European Youth Forum]]. The web site address was ''www.europa.eu/volunteering'', and the site is now archived on the European Commission website.&lt;ref&gt;"European Year of Volunteering" [http://www.unric.org/en/volunteering/27163-european-year-of-volunteering United Nations Regional Information Centre for Western Europe], interview with John Macdonald, Head of Task Force for the European Year of Volunteering 2011, from the European Commission Directorate-General, accessed August 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Year of Volunteering 2011 [http://ec.europa.eu/citizenship/european-year-of-volunteering/index_en.htm European Commission, EU Citizenship Portal], accessed August 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Year of Volunteers Plus 10 ==

In 2011, ten years after IYV, under [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] Resolution 63/153 (2008)&lt;ref&gt;"General Assembly Resolution 63/153" published at [http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-63-153.pdf www.undemocracy.com], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Nations]] IYV+10 was recognized and promoted by UNV to renew the goals of the original IYV and to encourage people’s contributions to peace and the [[Millennium Development Goals]] through volunteering. National and international UN Volunteers, as well as [[virtual volunteering|online volunteers]], were recruited to support work on IYV+10, strengthen links with stakeholders and partners at the national level, and monitor initiatives developed during the Year. Activities were promoted via the UNV web site www.worldvolunteerweb.org. During the first half of 2011, a series of five regional consultation meetings were organized in [[Ecuador]] (28–20 March), [[Turkey]] (18–19 April), [[the Philippines]] (3–4 May), and [[Senegal]] (30–31 May for [[Francophone Africa]] and 6–7 June for Anglophone Africa). These events brought together hundreds of stakeholders from civil society, the private sector, national authorities and academia, UNV Field Units and other United Nations entities. A global conference on ‘Volunteering for a sustainable future’ was held 15–17 September in [[Budapest]] in partnership with the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)]] and the [http://www.iave.org/ International Association for Volunteer Effort (IAVE)]. The conference brought together UN member states and volunteer-involving organizations, plus partners from academia and the private sector. The 64th Annual UN [https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/ngoconference DPI/NGO Conference] was held from 3–5 September hosted by the [[German government]] and the [[Bonn|city of Bonn]]. The event theme was ‘Sustainable Societies, Responsive Citizens’.

O’Grady served as executive secretary of the National Conference of Catholic Charities (now [[Catholic Charities USA]]) from 1920 to 1961.

== Life ==

Retrieved February 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; After ordination, O'Grady was assigned to serve in the diocese of Omaha, Nebraska.

In 1912, O'Grady was sent to Catholic University of America to pursue a graduate degree. He completed a doctorate in sociology and economics in 1915, with a dissertation called "The Legal Minimum Wage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/exhibits/show/immigration/documents/bio-o-grady "Biography: John O'Grady"] American Catholic History Classroom, Catholic University of America.

== Work ==

===Academics===
O'Grady became a professor of economics at [[Catholic University of America]] in 1915 and taught at the school for several decades in the sociology and economics departments. He also taught sociology at Trinity College in Washington, D.C. (now called [[Trinity Washington University]]).&lt;ref&gt;“Msgr. John O'Grady; Social Reform Leader.” ''Washington Daily News'', January 3, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, O’Grady helped to found Catholic University’s School of Social Work and served as its dean from 1934 to 1938.&lt;ref&gt;“Msgr. John O'Grady; Social Reform Leader.” ''Washington Daily News'', January 3, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The National Conference of Catholic Charities===
While at Catholic University, O'Grady was mentored by Monsignor [[William J. Kerby]], who was a professor and a founder of the recently formed National Conference of Catholic Charities (NCCC), later called [[Catholic Charities USA]]. Kerby encouraged O'Grady to become involved in the work of the NCCC.&lt;ref&gt;Hansan, Jack. [http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/organizations/catholic-charities-usa/ "Catholic Charities USA"], Social Welfare History Project.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, O'Grady was elected to be Kerby's successor as executive secretary of the NCCC, a position he would hold until 1961.&lt;ref&gt;"Proceedings of the Sixth Biennial Meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Charities, 1920."

O'Grady"] American Catholic History Research Center and Archives, Catholic University of America. Retrieved February 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

As secretary of the NCCC, O’Grady worked to professionalize Catholic social services and staff by developing and training diocesan organizations, improving communication across agencies, and training workers.&lt;ref&gt;Sadowski, Dennis. [http://catholiccharitiesusa.org/history-accessible/ “Msgr. O’Grady Defined Catholic Charities as Advocate of the Poor.”] Catholic News Service, September 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

O’Grady also advocated for social justice measures and lobbied for “widespread social reform based on Catholic principles,” on a wide variety of issues, including: support of New Deal relief measures, the [[Social Security Act]], housing legislation, measures for [[displaced persons]] following World War II, and immigration reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/exhibits/show/immigration/documents/bio-o-grady "Biography: John O'Grady"] American Catholic History Classroom, Catholic University of America. Retrieved February 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, O’Grady served as managing-editor and eventually editor at ''The Catholic Charities Review''. At the ''Review'', O’Grady worked alongside [[John A. Ryan]], who served as editor-in-chief and eventually contributing editor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009996818 ''The Catholic Charities Review'']&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Review'', itself the successor to the ''St. Vincent’s Quarterly'', was the “clearinghouse of material and information related to the work of Catholic Charities.” The publication ceased production in 1975 and was succeeded by Catholic Charities USA’s publication ''Charities. '' &lt;ref&gt;Hansan, Jack.

Retrieved February 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As managing editor and editor, O’Grady authored editorials in the monthly publication that took positions on everything from unemployment relief efforts in the Great Depression to social work practices.

===Advocacy===
O’Grady served as an advocate for many social reform measures, working behind the scenes with congressmen and testifying before Congress on issues such as: unemployment relief, immigration, migrant labor, and public housing measures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980DE0D9103BEF34BC4B53DFB766838D679EDE “Msgr. O’Grady, 79, Social Reformer: Catholic Charities Aide Dies—Helped 40,000 DPs”]. ''New York Times'', January 3, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, O’Grady developed strong relationships behind the scenes, becoming a resource for legislators such as Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]] (D-NY) and administrators such as [[Harry Hopkins]] and [[Aubrey Willis Williams]].

In 1919, O'Grady was appointed as secretary of the Committee of Reconstruction and After War Activities of the National Catholic War Council (later the [[National Catholic Welfare Council]]). It was in this position that O'Grady persuaded [[John A. Ryan]] to write the Bishop's Program on Social Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, Phillip. "Contending With Modernity: Catholic Higher Education in the Twentieth Century." (Oxford University Press: 1995) 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, O’Grady helped create the first National Public Housing Conference. He served as chairman of the Housing Legislative Information Service, “a group which brings together representatives of all organizations in the United States interested in housing,” from 1945 to 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Padgett. "Monsignor John O’Grady: Lover of People". Catholic University Archives: John O’Grady Collection, Box 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

O’Grady was vocally opposed to restrictive immigration reform laws that were proposed in the wake of [[World War II]]. In 1952, O’Grady was named as a member of the [[Presidential Commission (United States)|President’s Commission]] on Immigration and Naturalization by President [[Harry S. Truman]]. During that time, O’Grady was outspoken in his opposition to the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|McCaran-Walter Act]]. He was particularly critical of the bill’s inclusion of a literacy test and the continuation of the national quota system that favored immigrants from Western European nations, which O’Grady believed was prejudiced and would perpetuate “the doctrine of Nordic superiority.”&lt;ref&gt;Msgr. John O'Grady, [http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/exhibits/show/immigration/documents/nordic "The McCarran Immigration Bill: the Perpetuation of the Doctrine of Nordic Superiority is the Basic Question,"] Commonweal, June 20, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; O’Grady said that America “can't discriminate against two-thirds of the world and still presume to be the leader of the Western democracies.”&lt;ref&gt;“Msgr. O’Grady, Is Dead at 79.” ''Washington Post'', January 3, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

O’Grady befriended [[Saul Alinsky]], the pioneer of community organizing, in the 1940s. In 1952, Alinsky contracted with a publisher to write a biography of O’Grady’s life. Though the manuscript was drafted, it was never published.&lt;ref&gt;Alinsky, Saul. ''Unpublished Biography''. Catholic University Archives: John O’Grady Collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

O’Grady helped to found [[Caritas Internationalis]] in 1951 and served as its first vice president from 1958 to 1961.&lt;ref&gt;“Requiem Held for Charities Pioneer”, ''The Western Michigan Catholic'', January 6, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, O’Grady was cited in a letter by Pope John XXIII for his “wise and zealous” direction of Caritas in Ghana and for his work “to foster a spirit of neighborliness and to promote the real welfare of the people.”&lt;ref&gt;Fr. L. Burke and Fr. J. McCreanor, [babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3475031;view=1up;seq=10 ''Training Missionaries for Community Development'': A Report on Experiences in Ghana''].

==Death==
O’Grady died from a kidney ailment on January 2, 1966 at Carroll Manor, a retirement home for clergy in [[Hyattsville, Maryland]]. Archbishop [[Patrick Aloysius O'Boyle|Patrick O’Boyle]] celebrated a pontifical mass in O’Grady’s honor on January 5, 1966 at St. Mathew’s Cathedral in Washington, DC. Archbishop Boyle said in a tribute to O’Grady that “his influence on charitable work of the Church in this country and throughout the world for widespread social reform will long be remembered. He was truly a modern apostle of Christian charity.” O’Grady was buried at Mt. Olivet Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;“Msgr. John O'Grady; Social Reform Leader.” ''Washington Daily News'', January 3, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several remembrances of O’Grady following his death, including a speech by then-[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]], [[John William McCormack]], who said: “We may well mourn that such a man has left us, but the occasion of his death is truly, in the long view, the occasion for rejoicing, both in the splendor of his Christian soul, and in the lasting benefits which his career has brought to our Nation [sic] and to the world. May his soul rest in peace and may his example inspire generations yet to come.”&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Record'', January 20, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bronze Age|260}}
{{human history}}
The '''Late Bronze Age collapse''' involved a [[Greek Dark Ages |dark-age]] transition period in the [[Near East]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Aegean Sea#History|Aegean region]], [[North Africa]], [[Caucasus]], [[Balkans]] and the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] from the Late [[Bronze Age]] to the Early [[Iron Age]], a transition which historians believe was violent, sudden, and culturally disruptive. The [[palace economy]] of the Aegean region and [[Anatolia]] that characterised the Late Bronze Age disintegrated, transforming into the small isolated village cultures of the [[Greek Dark Ages]]. The half-century between {{circa |1200}} and 1150 BC saw the cultural collapse of the [[Mycenaean Greece| Mycenaean kingdoms]], of the [[Kassite dynasty]] of [[Babylonia]], of the [[Hittites |Hittite Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Levant]], and of the [[Egyptian Empire]];&lt;ref&gt;For Syria, see M. Liverani, "The collapse of the Near Eastern regional system at the end of the Bronze Age: the case of Syria" in ''Centre and Periphery in the Ancient World'', M. Rowlands, M.T. Larsen, K. Kristiansen, eds. ([[Cambridge University Press]]) 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; the destruction of [[Ugarit]] and the [[Amorite]] states in the [[Levant]],  the fragmentation of the [[Luwian]] states of western Asia Minor, and a period of chaos in [[Canaan]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Richard, "Archaeological sources for the history of Palestine: The Early Bronze Age: The rise and collapse of urbanism", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; The deterioration of these governments interrupted [[trade route]]s and severely reduced [[literacy]] in much of the [[Ecumene | known world]].&lt;ref name="Cultural"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Russ Crawford|editor1-last= Stanton|editor1-first= Andrea|editor2-last= Ramsay|editor2-first= Edward|editor3-last= Seybolt|editor3-first= Peter J|editor4-last= Elliott|editor4-first= Carolyn|title= Cultural Sociology of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa: An Encyclopedia|date= 2006|publisher= Sage|isbn= 978-1412981767|page= xxix|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GtCL2OYsH6wC&amp;pg=PR29&amp;dq=Late+Bronze+Age+collapse+literacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwvayPltjQAhXCJhoKHVmZBqIQ6AEINjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Late%20Bronze%20Age%20collapse%20literacy&amp;f=false|chapter= Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first phase of this period, almost every city between [[Pylos]] and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] was violently destroyed, and many abandoned, including [[Hattusa]], [[Mycenae]], and [[Ugarit]].&lt;ref&gt;The physical destruction of palaces and cities is the subject of [[Robert Drews]]'s ''The End of the Bronze Age: changes in warfare and the catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C.'', 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert Drews]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Within a period of forty to fifty years at the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the twelfth century almost every significant city in the eastern Mediterranean world was destroyed, many of them never to be occupied again.&lt;ref&gt;
Drews, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;4
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A very few powerful states, particularly [[Assyria]] and [[Elam]], survived the Bronze Age collapse – but by the end of the 12th century BC, Elam waned after its defeat by [[Nebuchadnezzar I]], who briefly revived Babylonian fortunes before suffering a series of defeats by the Assyrians. Upon the death of  [[Ashur-bel-kala]] in 1056 BC, Assyria went into a comparative decline for the next 100 or so years, its empire shrinking significantly.  By 1020 BC Assyria appears to have controlled only the areas in its immediate vicinity; the well-defended Assyria itself was not threatened during the collapse. Gradually, by the end of the ensuing Dark Age, remnants of the Hittites coalesced into small [[Neo-Hittite]] and [[Syro-Hittite states| Syro-Hittite]] states in [[Cilicia]] and the [[Levant]], the latter states being composed of mixed Hittite and [[Aramean]] polities.  Beginning in the mid-10th century BC, a series of small [[Aramaeans |Aramaean]] kingdoms formed in the [[Levant]] and the [[Philistines]] settled in southern [[Canaan]] where the Canaanite-speaking Semites had coalesced into a number of defined polities such as [[Israel]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]] and [[Ammon]]. From 935 BC Assyria began to reorganise and once more expand outwards, leading to the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911-605 BC), which came to control a vast area from the Caucasus to Egypt, and from Greek Cyprus to Persia. [[Phrygians]], [[Cimmerians]] and [[Lydians]] arrived in Asia Minor, and a new Hurrian polity of [[Urartu]] formed in eastern Asia Minor and the southern Caucasus, where the [[Colchians]] ([[Georgian people|Georgians]]) also emerged. [[Iranian peoples]] such as the [[Persians]], [[Medes]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and Sargatians first appeared in [[Ancient Iran]] soon after 1000 BC, displacing earlier non-Indo-European [[Kassites]], [[Hurrians]] and [[Gutians]] in the northwest of the region, although the indigenous [[language isolate]]-speaking [[Elamites]] and [[Manneans]] continued to dominate the southwest and [[Caspian Sea]] regions respectively. After the [[Orientalizing period|Orientalising period]] in the [[Aegean region|Aegean]], [[Classical Greece]] emerged.

==Regional evidence==

===Evidence of destruction===

====Anatolia====
Before the Bronze Age collapse, [[Anatolia]] (Asia Minor) was dominated by a number of peoples of varying ethno-linguistic origins: including [[Semitic people|Semitic]] [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Amorites]], [[language isolate]]-speaking [[Hurrians]], [[Kaskians]] and [[Hattians]], and later-arriving [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European]] peoples such as [[Luwians]], [[Hittites]], [[Mitanni]], and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[Greeks]]. From the 16th century BC, the Mitanni (a migratory minority speaking an [[Indo-Aryan language]]) formed a ruling class over the Hurrians, an ancient indigenous Caucasian people who spoke a [[Hurro-Urartian language]], a [[language isolate]]. Similarly, the [[Indo-Anatolian]]-speaking Hittites absorbed the [[Hattians]],&lt;ref&gt;Gurnet, Otto, (1982), ''The Hittites'' (Penguin) pp. 119–130.&lt;/ref&gt; a people speaking a language that may have been of the non–Indo-European [[North Caucasian languages|North Caucasian]] language group or a [[language isolate]].

Every Anatolian site, apart from integral [[Assyria|Assyrian]] regions in the south east, and regions in eastern, central and southern Anatolia under the control of the powerful [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1392–1050 BC) that was important during the preceding Late Bronze Age shows a [[destruction layer]], and it appears that in these regions civilization did not recover to the level of the Assyrians and Hittites for another thousand years or so. The Hittites, already weakened by a series of military defeats and annexations of their territory by the Middle Assyrian Empire (which had already destroyed the Hurrian-Mitanni Empire)  then suffered a [[coup de grâce]] when  [[Hattusa]]s, the Hittite capital, was burned, probably by the [[language isolate]]-speaking [[Kaskians]], long indigenous to the southern shores of the [[Black Sea]], and possibly aided by the incoming Indo-European–speaking [[Phrygians]]). The city was abandoned and never reoccupied.

Karaoğlan{{efn|The name Karaoglan is Turkish, the original Hittite name is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;}} (near present-day [[Ankara]]) was burned and the corpses left unburied.&lt;ref name="Drews1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Drews|title=The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe Ca. 1200 B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&amp;pg=PA8|year=1995|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=0691025916|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other sites that were not destroyed were abandoned.&lt;ref name="Robbins2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuel Robbins|title=Collapse of the Bronze Age: The Story of Greece, Troy, Israel, Egypt, and the Peoples of the Sea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fuczEUuOt6UC&amp;pg=PA170|year=2001|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0595136643|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Luwian]] city of [[Troy]] was destroyed at least twice, before being abandoned until Roman times. ([[Trojan War]])

The Phrygians had arrived (probably over the [[Bosphorus]] or [[Caucasus]]) in the 13th century BC&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Trevor. ''The Kingdom of the Hittites''. (Clarendon), p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;, before being first checked by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and then conquered by them in the Early Iron Age of the 12th century BC. Other groups of Indo-European peoples followed the Phrygians into the region, most prominently the [[Doric Greeks]] and [[Lydians]], and in the centuries ''after'' the period of Bronze Age Collapse, the [[Cimmerians]], and [[Scythians]] also appeared. The [[Semitic people|Semitic]] [[Arameans]], [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]]-speaking [[Colchians]] ([[Georgian people|Georgians]]), and revived [[Hurrian]] polities, particularly [[Urartu]], [[Nairi]] and [[Shupria]] also emerged in parts of the region and southern [[Caucasus]]. The Assyrians simply continued their already extant policies, by conquering any of these new peoples and polities they came into contact with, as they had with the preceding polities of the region. However Assyria gradually withdrew from much of the region for a time in the second half of the 11th century BC, although they continued to campaign militarily at times, in order to protect their borders and keep trade routes open, until a renewed vigorous period of expansion in the late 10th century BC.

These sites in Anatolia show evidence of the collapse:
* [[Troy]]
* [[Miletus]]
* [[Hattusas]]&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Trevor. ''The Kingdom of the Hittites'' (Clarendon), p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mersin]]
* [[Tarhuntassa]]

====Cyprus====
The catastrophe separates [[Prehistoric Cyprus|Late Cypriot II]] (LCII) from the LCIII period, with the sacking and burning of [[Enkomi]], [[Kition]], and [[Sinta, Cyprus|Sinda]], which may have occurred twice before those sites were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Manuel (2001). ''Collapse of the Bronze Age: The Story of Greece, Troy, Israel and Egypt and the Peoples of the Sea''. pp. 220–239&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of the Hittite king [[Tudhaliya IV]] (reigned c. 1237–1209 BC), the island was briefly invaded by the Hittites,&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Trevor. ''The Kingdom of the Hittites'' (Clarendon), p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; either to secure the [[copper]] resource or as a way of preventing [[piracy]].

Shortly afterwards, the island was reconquered by his son around 1200 BC. Some towns (Enkomi, Kition, Palaeokastro and Sinda) show traces of destruction at the end of LCII. Whether or not this is really an indication of a Mycenean invasion is contested.&lt;!--a reference to published doubts would do well here--&gt; Originally, two waves of destruction in c. 1230 BC by the [[Sea Peoples]] and c. 1190 BC by [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] [[refugees]] have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Aström has proposed dates of 1190 and 1179 BC (Aström).&lt;/ref&gt;{{who|date=January 2016}}{{clarify|date=January 2016}}

[[Alashiya]] was plundered by the Sea Peoples and ceased to exist in 1085.

The smaller settlements of [[Ayios Dhimitrios]] and [[Kokkinokremnos]], as well as a number of other sites, were abandoned but do not show traces of destruction. Kokkinokremos was a short-lived settlement, where various caches concealed by [[metalsmith|smith]]s have been found. That no one ever returned to reclaim the treasures suggests that they were killed or enslaved. Recovery occurred only in the Early Iron Age with Phoenician and Greek settlement. 

These sites in Cyprus show evidence of the collapse:
* Palaeokastro
* [[Kition]]
* Sinda
* [[Enkomi]]

====Syria====
[[File:Bronze-age-collapse.svg|thumb|350px|A map of the Bronze Age collapse]]

Ancient Syria had been initially dominated by a number of indigenous [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking peoples. The [[East Semitic]]-speaking [[Eblaites]], [[Akkadians]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and the [[Northwest Semitic]]-speaking [[Ugarit]]es and [[Amorites]] prominent among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=vTrT-bZyuPcC&amp;|title=The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia|last=Woodard|first=Roger D.|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1139469340|location=|page= 5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syria during this time was known as "The land of the [[Amorites|Amurru]]".

Before and during the Bronze Age Collapse, Syria became a battle ground between the empires of the [[Hittites]], [[Middle Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], [[Mitanni]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] between the 15th and late 13th centuries BC, with the Assyrians destroying the Hurri-Mitanni empire and annexing much of the Hittite empire. The Egyptian empire had withdrawn from the region after failing to overcome the Hittites and being fearful of the ever growing Assyrian might, leaving much of the region under Assyrian control until the late 11th century BC. Later the coastal regions came under attack from the [[Sea Peoples]]. During this period, from the 12th century BC, the incoming [[Northwest Semitic]]-speaking [[Arameans]] came to demographic prominence in Syria, the region outside of the Canaanite-speaking [[Phoenicia]]n coastal areas eventually came to speak [[Aramaic]] and the region came to be known as [[Aramea]] and [[Eber Nari]]. The [[Babylonians]] belatedly attempted to gain a foothold in the region during their brief revival under [[Nebuchadnezzar I]] in the 12th century BC, however they too were overcome by their Assyrian neighbours. The modern term 'Syria' is a later Indo-European corruption of 'Assyria' which only became formally applied to the Levant during the [[Seleucid Empire]] (323–150 BC) (see [[Etymology of Syria]]).

Levantine sites previously showed evidence of trade links with [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]], [[Akkad (region)|Akkad]], [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]]), [[Anatolia]] ([[Hattia]], [[Hurria]], [[Luwia]] and later the [[Hittites]]), [[Egypt]] and the [[Aegean Sea#History|Aegean]] in the Late Bronze Age. Evidence at [[Ugarit]] shows that the destruction there occurred after the reign of Merneptah (ruled 1213–1203 BC) and even the fall of [[Chancellor Bay]] (died 1192 BC). The last Bronze Age king of the [[Semitic people|Semitic]] state of Ugarit, [[Ammurapi]], was a contemporary of the [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Suppiluliuma II]]. The exact dates of his reign are unknown.

A letter by the king is preserved on one of the clay tablets found baked in the conflagration of the destruction of the city. Ammurapi stresses the seriousness of the crisis faced by many Levantine states from invasion by the advancing [[Sea Peoples]] in a dramatic response to a plea for assistance from the king of [[Alasiya]]. Ammurapi highlights the desperate situation Ugarit faced in letter RS 18.147:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My father, behold, the enemy's ships came (here); my cities(?) were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots(?) are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the [[Lukka lands|Land of Lukka]]?... Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Nougaryol et al. (1968) Ugaritica V: 87–90 no. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No help arrived and Ugarit was burned to the ground at the end of the Bronze Age. Its destruction levels contained Late Helladic IIIB ware, but no LH IIIC (see [[Mycenaean period]]). Therefore, the date of the destruction is important for the dating of the LH IIIC phase. Since an Egyptian sword bearing the name of Pharaoh [[Merneptah]] was found in the destruction levels, 1190 BC was taken as the date for the beginning of the LH IIIC.

A [[cuneiform]] tablet found in 1986 shows that Ugarit was destroyed after the death of Merneptah. It is generally agreed that Ugarit had already been destroyed by the 8th year of [[Ramesses III]], 1178 BC. These letters on clay tablets found baked in the conflagration of the destruction of the city speak of attack from the sea, and a letter from [[Alashiya]] ([[Cyprus]]) speaks of cities already being destroyed by attackers who came by sea. It also speaks of the Ugarit fleet being absent, patrolling the [[Lycia]]n coast.

The [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] [[Arameans]] eventually superseded the earlier [[Semitic people|Semitic]] [[Amorites]], [[Canaanites]] and people of [[Ugarit]]. The Arameans, together with the [[Phoenicia|Phoenician]] Canaanites and  [[Neo-Hittites]] came to dominate most of the region demographically, however these people, and the Levant in general, were also conquered and dominated politically and militarily by the Middle Assyrian Empire until Assyria's withdrawal in the late 11th century BC, although the Assyrians continued to conduct military campaigns in the region. However with the rise of [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] in the late 10th century BC,  the entire region once again fell to Assyria. 

These sites in Syria show evidence of the collapse:
* [[Ugarit]]
* [[Tell Sukas]]
* [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]
* [[Qatna]]
* [[Hamath]]
* [[Alalakh]]
* [[Aleppo]]
* [[Carchemish]]
* [[Emar]]

====Southern Levant====
Egyptian evidence shows that from the reign of [[Horemheb]] (ruled either 1319 or 1306 to 1292 BC), wandering [[Shasu]] were more problematic than the earlier [[Apiru]]. [[Ramesses II]] (ruled 1279–1213 BC) campaigned against them, pursuing them as far as [[Moab]], where he established a fortress, after a near defeat at the [[Battle of Kadesh]]. During the reign of [[Merneptah]], the [[Shasu]] threatened the "[[Via Maris|Way of Horus]]" north from Gaza. Evidence shows that Deir Alla ([[Sukkot (place)|Succoth]]) was destroyed after the reign of Queen [[Twosret]] (ruled 1191–1189 BC).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Tubbs, Johnathan (1998), "Canaanites" (British Museum Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The destroyed site of [[Lachish]] was briefly reoccupied by squatters and an Egyptian garrison, during the reign of [[Ramesses III]] (ruled 1186–1155 BC). All centres along a coastal route from [[Gaza City|Gaza]] northward were destroyed, and evidence shows Gaza, [[Ashdod]], [[Ashkelon]], [[Acre, Israel|Akko]], and [[Jaffa]] were burned and not reoccupied for up to thirty years. Inland [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Bethel]], [[Beit Shemesh]], [[Eglon, Canaan|Eglon]], [[Debir]], and other sites were destroyed. Refugees escaping the collapse of coastal centres may have fused with incoming nomadic and Anatolian elements to begin the growth of terraced hillside hamlets in the highlands region that was associated with the later development of the [[Hebrews]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During the reign of Rameses III, [[Philistines]] were allowed to resettle the coastal strip from Gaza to Joppa, [[Denyen]] (possibly the [[tribe of Dan]] in the Bible, or more likely the people of Adana, also known as Danuna, part of the Hittite Empire) settled from [[Jaffa|Joppa]] to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], and [[Tjekker]] in Acre. The sites quickly achieved independence, as the ''[[Tale of Wenamun]]'' shows. 

These sites in [[Southern Levant]] show evidence of the collapse:
* [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]]
* [[Akko]]
* [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]
* Deir 'Alla ([[Sukkot (place)|Sukkot]])
* [[Bethel]]
* Beth Shemesh
* [[Lachish]]
* [[Ashdod]]
* [[Ashkelon]]

====Greece====
{{Main article|Greek Dark Ages}}

None of the Mycenaean palaces of the Late Bronze Age survived (with the possible exception of the [[Cyclopean]] fortifications on the [[Acropolis of Athens]]), with destruction being heaviest at palaces and fortified sites. Up to 90% of small sites in the [[Peloponnese]] were abandoned, suggesting a major depopulation.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The Bronze Age collapse marked the start of what has been called the [[Greek Dark Ages]], which lasted roughly 400 years and ended with the establishment of [[Archaic Greece]]. Other cities like [[Athens]] continued to be occupied, but with a more local sphere of influence, limited evidence of trade and an impoverished culture, from which it took centuries to recover.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Areas that survived===

====Mesopotamia====
The [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1392–1056 BC) had destroyed the [[Hurrian]]-[[Mitanni]] [[Empire]], annexed much of the [[Hittite Empire]] and eclipsed the [[Egyptian Empire]], and at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age collapse controlled an empire stretching from the [[Caucasus mountains]] in the north to the [[Arabian peninsula]] in the south, and from [[Ancient Iran]] in the east to [[Cyprus]] in the west. However, in the 12th century BC, Assyrian satrapies in [[Anatolia]] came under attack from the [[Mushki]] ([[Phrygians]]), and those in the Levant from [[Arameans]], but [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (reigned 1114–1076 BC) was able to defeat and repel these attacks, conquering the incomers. The Middle Assyrian Empire survived intact throughout much of this period, with Assyria dominating and often ruling [[Babylonia]] directly, controlling south east and south western [[Anatolia]], north western [[Iran]] and much of northern and central [[Syria]] and [[Canaan]], as far as the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arameans]] and [[Phrygians]] were subjected, and Assyria and its colonies were not threatened by the [[Sea Peoples]] who had ravaged Egypt and much of the East Mediterranean, and the Assyrians often conquered as far as [[Phoenicia]] and the [[East Mediterranean]]. However, after the death of [[Ashur-bel-kala]] in 1056 BC, Assyria withdrew to areas close to its natural borders, encompassing what is today northern Iraq, north east Syria, the fringes of north west Iran, and south eastern Turkey. Assyria still retained a stable monarchy, the best army in the world, and an efficient civil administration, enabling it to survive the Bronze Age Collapse intact. Assyrian written records remained numerous and the most consistent in the world during the period, and the Assyrians were still able to mount long range military campaigns in all directions when necessary. From the late 10th century BC, it once more began to assert itself internationally, with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] growing to be the largest the world had yet seen.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The situation in [[Babylonia]] was very different. After the Assyrian withdrawal, it was still subject to periodic Assyrian (and [[Elamite]]) subjugation, and new groups of [[Semitic people|Semites]], such as the [[Aramaeans]], [[Suteans]] (and in the period after the Bronze Age Collapse, [[Chaldea]]ns also), spread unchecked into Babylonia from the Levant, and the power of its weak kings barely extended beyond the city limits of Babylon. Babylon was sacked by the [[Elam]]ites under [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]] (c. 1185–1155 BC), and lost control of the [[Diyala River]] valley to [[Assyria]].

====Egypt====
{{Main article|Third Intermediate Period of Egypt}}
After apparently surviving for a while, the Egyptian Empire collapsed in the mid-twelfth century BC (during the reign of [[Ramesses VI]], 1145 to 1137 BC). Previously, the [[Merneptah Stele]] (c. 1200 BC) spoke of attacks ([[:de:Libyerkrieg (Merenptah)|Libyan War]]) from [[Putrians]] (from modern [[Libya]]), with associated people of [[Achaeans (Homer)|Ekwesh]], [[Sea Peoples|Shekelesh]], [[Lukka lands|Lukka]], [[Sherden|Shardana]] and [[Tursha]] or [[Tyrrhenians|Teresh]] (possibly [[Troy|Troas]]), and a Canaanite revolt, in the cities of [[Ashkelon]], [[Yenoam]] and among the people of [[Israel]]. A second attack ([[Battle of the Delta]] and [[Battle of Djahy]]) during the reign of [[Ramesses III]] (1186–1155 BC) involved [[Philistines|Peleset]], [[Tjeker]], [[Sherden|Shardana]] and [[Denyen]].

===Conclusion===
[[Robert Drews]] describes the collapse as "the worst disaster in ancient history, even more calamitous than the [[collapse of the Western Roman Empire]]."&lt;ref&gt;Drews 1993:1, quotes Fernand Braudel's assessment that the Eastern Mediterranean cultures returned almost to a starting-point ("plan zéro"), "L'Aube", in Braudel, F. (ed.) (1977), ''La Mediterranee: l'espace et l'histoire'' (Paris)&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural memories of the disaster told of a "lost [[golden age]]": for example, [[Hesiod]] spoke of Ages of Gold, Silver, and Bronze, separated from the cruel modern Age of Iron by the [[Greek Heroic Age|Age of Heroes]]. [[Rodney Castledon]] suggests that memories of the Bronze Age collapse influenced [[Plato]]'s story of [[Atlantis]]&lt;ref&gt;Castledon, Rodney (1998), "Atlantis Destroyed" (Routledge)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] and the [[Critias]].

==Possible causes==
Various theories have been put forward as possible contributors to the collapse, many of them mutually compatible.

===Environmental===

====Climate change====
{{Main article|Bond event}}
Changes in climate similar to the [[Younger Dryas]] period or the [[Little Ice Age]] punctuate human history. The local effects of these changes may cause crop failures in multiple consecutive years, leading to warfare as a last-ditch effort at survival. The triggers for climate change are still debated, but ancient peoples could not have predicted substantial climate changes.{{clarify|reason=This text does not seem to have any specific relation to the topic of the Late Bronze Age collapse.|date=October 2018}}{{citation-needed|reason=Some source is needed to tie this vague statement to the topic of the Late Bronze Age collapse.|date=October 2018}}

====Volcanoes====
The [[Hekla 3 eruption]] approximately coincides with this period; and, while the exact date is under considerable dispute, one group calculated the date to be specifically 1159 BC, implicating the eruption in the collapse in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Yurco, Frank J. "End of the Late Bronze Age and Other Crisis Periods: A Volcanic Cause". in Teeter, Emily; Larson, John (eds.). ''Gold of Praise: Studies on Ancient Egypt in Honor of Edward F. Wente''. (Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilization 58.) Chicago: [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago]]. 1999:456–458. {{ISBN|1885923090}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drought====
Using the [[Palmer Drought Index]] for 35 Greek, Turkish and Middle Eastern weather stations, it was shown that a drought of the kind that persisted from January AD 1972 would have affected all of the sites associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Harvey|title=The decline of Late Bronze Age civilization as a possible response to climatic change|journal=Climatic Change|volume=4|issue=2|date=June 1982|pages=173–198|doi=10.1007/BF00140587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drought could have easily precipitated or hastened socioeconomic problems and led to wars.

More recently, it has been shown how the diversion of midwinter storms from the Atlantic to north of the [[Pyrenees]] and the Alps, bringing wetter conditions to Central Europe but drought to the Eastern Mediterranean, was associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fagan |first=Brian M. |year=2003 |title=The Long Summer: How Climate Changed Civilization |location= |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollen in [[sediment core]]s from the [[Dead Sea]] and the [[Sea of Galilee]] show that there was a period of severe drought at the start of the collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kershner |first=Isabel |date=22 October 2013 |title=Pollen Study Points to Drought as Culprit in Bronze Age Mystery |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/world/middleeast/pollen-study-points-to-culprit-in-bronze-era-mystery.html?pagewanted=all |journal=[[The New York Times]] |doi=10.1006/jasc.1999.0431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langgut, Dafna; Finkelstein, Israel ; Litt, Thomas (October 2013) "Climate and the late Bronze Collapse: New evidence from the southern Levant", ''Journal of Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University'', '''40''' (2): 149–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural===

====Ironworking====
The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of [[ironworking]] technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in the present [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] in the 13th and 12th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;See A. Stoia and the other essays in M.L. Stig Sørensen and R. Thomas, eds., ''The Bronze Age: Iron Age Transition in Europe'' (Oxford) 1989, and T.H. Wertime and J.D. Muhly, ''The Coming of the Age of Iron'' (New Haven) 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard R. Palmer suggested that [[iron (material)|iron]], superior to bronze for weapons manufacture, was in more plentiful supply and so allowed larger armies of iron users to overwhelm the smaller bronze-equipped armies of [[maryannu]] [[chariot]]ry.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Leonard R (1962). ''Mycenaeans and Minoans: Aegean Prehistory in the Light of the Linear B Tablets''. New York, Alfred A. Knopf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Changes in warfare====
Robert Drews argues&lt;ref&gt;Drews 1993:192ff&lt;/ref&gt; for the appearance of massed infantry, using newly developed weapons and armor, such as cast rather than forged spearheads and [[Bronze Age sword#Europe|long swords]], a revolutionising cut-and-thrust weapon,&lt;ref&gt;Drews 1993:194&lt;/ref&gt; and [[javelin]]s. The appearance of bronze foundries suggests "that mass production of bronze artifacts was suddenly important in the Aegean". For example, [[Homer]] uses "spears" as a [[metonymy|virtual synonym]] for "warriors".

Such new weaponry, in the hands of large numbers of "running [[skirmisher]]s", who could swarm and cut down a chariot army, would destabilize states that were based upon the use of chariots by the ruling class. That would precipitate an abrupt social collapse as raiders began to conquer, loot and burn cities.&lt;ref&gt;Drews, R. (1993). ''The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C.'' (Princeton).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcgoodwin.net/pages/otherbooks/rd_endbrozeage.html|title=Drews (Robert) End of Bronze Age Summary|first=Michael|last=McGoodwin|website=mcgoodwin.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alanlittle.org/weblog/chariots.html|title=alan little’s weblog|website=alanlittle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General systems collapse===

A general systems collapse has been put forward as an explanation for the reversals in culture that occurred between the [[Urnfield culture]] of the 12th and 13th centuries BC and the rise of the Celtic [[Hallstatt culture]] in the 9th and 10th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.ie/~edmo/linktoprehistory.html http://www.iol.ie/~edmo/linktoprehistory.html] History of Castlemagner, on the web page of the local historical society.&lt;/ref&gt; General systems collapse theory, pioneered by [[Joseph Tainter]],&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, Joseph (1976). ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'' (Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesises how social declines in response to complexity may lead to a collapse resulting in simpler forms of society.

In the specific context of the [[Middle East]], a variety of factors – including population growth, [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], drought, cast bronze weapon and iron production technologies – could have combined to push the relative price of weaponry (compared to [[arable land]]) to a level unsustainable for traditional warrior aristocracies. In complex societies that were increasingly fragile and less resilient, the combination of factors may have contributed to the collapse.

The growing complexity and specialization of the Late Bronze Age political, economic, and social organization in Carol Thomas and Craig Conant's phrase&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Carol G.;  Conant, Craig. (1999) ''Citadel to City-state: The Transformation of Greece, 1200–700 B.C.E.'', &lt;/ref&gt; together made the organization of civilization too intricate to reestablish piecewise when disrupted. That could explain why the collapse was so widespread and able to render the Bronze Age civilizations incapable of recovery. The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralisation, specialisation, complexity, and top-heavy political structure. These flaws then were exposed by sociopolitical events (revolt of peasantry and defection of mercenaries), fragility of all kingdoms (Mycenaean, Hittite, Ugaritic, and Egyptian), demographic crises (overpopulation), and wars between states. Other factors that could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include piracy by the [[Sea Peoples]] interrupting maritime trade, as well as drought, crop failure, famine, or the [[Dorian invasion|Dorian migration or invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Eric H. (2014). "[[1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed]]". Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of interstellar radio messages (IRMs)==
There are eleven realized IRM projects:

* [[The Morse Message (1962)|The Morse Message (1962)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/you-never-get-a-seventh-chance-to-make-a-first-impression-an-awkward-history-of-our-space-transmissions/ An Awkward History of Our Space Transmissions]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arecibo message]] (1974), one transmission to [[Messier 13]]
* [[Cosmic Call]] 1 (1999), four transmissions to nearby Sun-like stars
* [[Teen Age Message]] (2001), six transmissions
* [[Cosmic Call]] 2 (2003), five transmissions
* [[A Message From Earth]] (2008), one transmission to the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]]
* [[Across the Universe (message)|Across the Universe]] (2008)
* [[Hello From Earth]] (HFE, 2009) one transmission to the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]]
* Wow! Reply (2012), three transmissions to Hipparcos 34511, Hipparcos 33277 and Hipparcos 43587 in reply to the [[Wow! signal]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/08/15/158827877/will-e-t-hear-us-reply-to-wow-signal-gets-beamed-into-space-today/ Reply To 'WOW! Signal' Gets Beamed Into Space]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lone Signal]] (2013)
* [[A simple response to an elemental message|A Simple Response to an Elemental Message]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Simple Response|url=http://blogs.esa.int/rocketscience/2016/07/28/a-simple-response|website=European Space Agency official website|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2016)

The [[Across the Universe (message)|Across the Universe]] message, [[A simple response to an elemental message|A Simple Response to an Elemental Message]] and [[Hello From Earth]] are not always considered serious. The first two of them were sent to Polaris, which is 431 light years distant from us and whose planetary system, even if it exists, may not be suited for life, because it is a supergiant star, spectral type F7Ib which is only 70 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wielen, R.; Jahreiß, H.; Dettbarn, C.; Lenhardt, H.; Schwan, H.|title=Polaris: Astrometric orbit, position, and proper motion|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2000|volume=360|page=399|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0002406.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2017|arxiv=astro-ph/0002406|bibcode=2000A&amp;A...360..399W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, both transmission rates were very high, about 128 kbit/s, for such moderate transmitter power (about 18&amp;nbsp;kW). The main defect of the "Hello From Earth" is an insufficient scientific and technical justification, since no famous [[SETI]] scientist made statements with validation of HFE's design. As it follows from [https://web.archive.org/web/20100211005300/http://www.hellofromearth.net/gliese581d/links/index.htm]: ''"After the final message was collected on Monday 24 August 2009, messages were exported as a text file and sent to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where they were encoded into binary, packaged and tested before transmission"'', but nobody explained why he hopes that such encoded and packaged text will be understood and conceived by possible extraterrestrials.

Some use the term ''[[Active SETI]] Project'', but [[Alexander Zaitsev (scientist)|Alexander Zaitsev]], who was a scientific head of composing and transmissions of [[Cosmic Call]] 1999 &amp; 2003, and [[Teen Age Message]] 2001, and a scientific consultant of [[A Message From Earth]], emphasized that he considers above IRMs as the METI (''[[Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence]] Projects'').

These seven messages have targeted stars between 20 and 69 light-years from the Earth. The exception is the Arecibo message, which targeted [[globular cluster M13]], approximately 24,000 light-years away. The first message to reach its destination will be [[A Message From Earth]], which should reach the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]] in [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] in 2029.

On 13 February 2015, scientists (including [[Geoffrey Marcy]], [[Seth Shostak]], [[Frank Drake]], [[Elon Musk]] and [[David Brin]]) at a convention of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], discussed [[Active SETI]] and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] in the [[Cosmos]] was a good idea;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150213"&gt;{{cite news |author=Borenstein, Seth (of [[AP News]]) |title=Should We Call the Cosmos Seeking ET? Or Is That Risky? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/02/13/science/ap-us-sci-calling-the-cosmos.html |date=13 February 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=14 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20150212"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ghosh |first=Pallab |title=Scientist: 'Try to contact aliens' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31442952 |date=12 February 2015 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=12 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one result was a statement, (which was not signed by [[Seth Shostak]] or [[Frank Drake]]), that a "worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent".&lt;ref name="UCB-20150213"&gt;{{cite web |author=Various |title=Statement - Regarding Messaging To Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI) / Active Searches For Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Active SETI) |url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/meti_statement_0.html |date=13 February 2015 |work=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=14 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Local eGovernment''' is [[eGovernment]] as it relates to [[local government]], police, fire, national park and transport authorities.

== Local eGovernment in England ==
The [[UK government]]’s objective was that all of public services in [[England]] should be capable of being delivered electronically by 31 December 2005. The ''Modernising Government'' White Paper of March 1999 proposed "all dealings with government being deliverable electronically by 2008." Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] then announced on 30 March 2000 that the target date had been brought forward from 2008 to 2005.

Electronic delivery is defined as delivery through internet protocols and other ICT methods and includes delivery by telephone if the officer receiving the call can access electronic information and/or update records online there and then.

The average local authority achieved a reported 97% e-enablement by 31 December 2005, though it is suspected the actual figure is much lower.  The target also applied to the Civil Service, which achieved a reported 96%.

=== Objectives and performance management ===
==== Implementing Electronic Government (IEG) Statements ====
From December 2001 to April 2006 local authorities were required to publish an ''IEG Statement'' on their degree of e-enablement (electronic enablement). The measures include BVPI 157 and the Priority Outcomes.

==== Best Value Performance Indicator (BVPI) 157 ====
BVPI 157 measures the percentage of 'interactions' provided by a local authority that are e-enabled. The figure must be published annually as part of the Best Value performance management framework. The figure is calculated by considering the following ten types of interaction as they apply to the services provided by the local authority:
*providing information
*collecting revenue
*providing benefits and grants
*consultation
*regulation (such as issuing licences)
*applications for services
*booking venues, resources and courses
*paying for goods and services
*providing access to community, professional or business networks
*procurement
Local authorities may use a proprietary list of services, but are required to validate their list against the ''Local Government Services List'' (LGSL).
BVPI 157 forms part of the annual IEG statement.

==== Priority Outcomes ====
To guide local authorities in implementing eGovernment, the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (and its successor the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM)) issued a list of key targets, most commonly referred to as the Priority Outcomes or PSOs (Priority Service Outcomes). The list was issued in the snappily entitled document ''Defining E-government Outcomes for 2005 to Support the Delivery of Priority Services &amp; National Strategy Transformation Agenda for Local Authorities in England – Version 1.0''.
In September 2004, detailed guidance on the Priority Outcomes was issued in the document ''Priority Outcomes - Explanatory Notes for Practitioners'', published  by the IDeA (Improvement and Development Agency) and endorsed by the ODPM.

Priority Outcomes are rated with three levels of obligation:
*''Required'' = To be implemented (available for use) by Dec 2005
*''Good'' = To be approved for funding and being actively implemented by Dec 2005 and implemented by April 1, 2006
*''Excellent'' = Voluntary for authorities that have implemented required and good outcomes early.

The following technologies are recommended in Priority Outcomes: Explanatory Notes for Practitioners as those likely to be essential in the achievement of the Priority Outcomes:
*[[Customer relationship management]] system:
**Customer database (single view of info on each customer, citizen and business)
**Customer tracking (across access channels and from contact to resolution)
**Data warehousing (central repository for data, including legacy data)
*[[Middleware]] and [[web services]] (manages flow of data between all systems, including external)
*[[Document management system]]:
**Workflow, messaging and e-forms (gets work to the right people at the right time)
**Document and records management (e-storage of all documents and info)
*[[Content management]] (system for publishing of content to all access channels)
*Security, [[authentication]] and [[smartcard]]s (for security of information)
*e-Payments (system for receiving payments to the council)
*[[e-procurement|e-Procurement]] (system for internal/external buying processes)
*[[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) (access to geographical data through maps)
*Local land and property gazetteer (database of land and property information)
*Access channels (websites, call centres, [[internet kiosk|kiosks]], [[digital TV]], mobile phones, etc.)

==== Socitm Insight Better Connected reports ====
Local authority websites are also subject to assessments by Socitm (Society of Information Technology Management) Insight in their annual ''Better Connected'' reports.

In [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]], a '''notation''' is a [[system]] of graphics or [[symbol]]s, [[Character_(symbol)|character]]s and abbreviated [[Expression (language)|expression]]s, used (for example) in [[Artistic disciplines|artistic]] and [[scientific discipline]]s to represent technical facts and quantities by [[Convention (norm)|convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZPQVuSgDAkC&amp;lpg=PT337&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PT337 | title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Crystal, David | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/notation | title=Notation | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | work=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] | accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a notation is a collection of related symbols that are each given an [[arbitrary]] meaning, created to facilitate [[structured communication]] within a [[domain knowledge]] or [[field of study]].

Standard notations refer to general agreements in the way things are written or denoted. The term is generally used in technical and scientific areas of study like [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]], but can also be seen in areas like [[business]], [[economics]] and [[music]].

==Written communication==
* Phonographic [[writing systems]], by definition, use symbols to represent components of auditory language, i.e. [[speech]], which in turn refers to things or ideas. The two main kinds of phonographic notational system are the [[alphabet]] and the [[syllabary]]. Some written languages are more consistent in their correlation of written symbols (or [[grapheme]]s) with sound (or [[phoneme]]s), and are therefore considered to have better [[phonemic orthography]].
* Ideographic writing, by definition, refers to things or ideas independently of their pronunciation in any language. Some ideographic systems are also [[pictogram]]s that convey meaning through their pictorial resemblance to a physical object.

===Biology and medicine===
* [[Nucleic acid notation]]
* [[Systems Biology Graphical Notation|Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)]]&lt;!--[Doesn't clarify/assist?:], orthogonal notations for ''Process Descriptions'', ''Entity Relationships'', and ''Activity Flows''--&gt;
* [[Sequence motif#Pattern description notations|Sequence motif pattern-description notations]]
* [[Cytogenetic notation]]
* [[Energy Systems Language]]

===Chemistry===
* [[Chemical formula]]s are a way of expressing information about the atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, e.g. {{chem|H|2|O}} or {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}

===Computing===
* BNF (Backus normal form, or [[Backus–Naur form]]) and EBNF (extended Backus-Naur form) are the two main notation techniques for context-free grammars.
* [[Hungarian notation]] is an identifier naming convention in [[computer programming]], that represents the [[data type|type]] or intended use of a [[variable (computer science)|variable]] with a specific pattern within its name. 
* [[Mathematical markup languages]] are computer notations for representing mathematical formulae.
* Various notations have been developed to specify [[regular expression]]s.

===Logic===
A variety of symbols are used to express logical ideas; see the [[List of logic symbols]]

===Management===
* Time and motion study symbols such as [[therblig]]s

===Mathematics===
*[[Mathematical notation]] is used to represent various kinds of mathematical ideas.
** All types of [[notation in probability]]
** [[Cartesian coordinate system]], for representing position and other spatial concepts in analytic geometry
** [[Notation for differentiation]], common representations of the [[derivative]] in [[calculus]]
** [[Big O notation]], used for example in analysis to represent less significant elements of an expression, to indicate that they will be neglected
** [[Z notation]], a formal notation for specifying objects using [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and [[first-order predicate logic]]
** [[Ordinal notation]]
** [[Set-builder notation]], a formal notation for defining [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] in [[set theory]]
* Systems to represent very large numbers
** [[Conway chained arrow notation]] 
** [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] 
** [[Steinhaus–Moser notation]]
** [[Schläfli symbol]] in geometry
* [[Numeral system]]s, notation for writing numbers, including
** [[Arabic numeral]]s
** [[Roman numeral]]s
** [[Scientific notation]] for expressing large and small numbers
** [[Sign-value notation]], using signs or symbols to represent numbers
** [[Positional notation]] also known as place-value notation, in which each position is related to the next by a multiplier which is called the ''base'' of that numeral system
*** [[Binary notation]], a positional notation in base two
*** [[Octal]] notation, a positional notation in base eight, used in some computers
*** [[Decimal notation]], a positional notation in base ten
*** [[Hexadecimal]] notation, a positional notation in base sixteen, commonly used in computers
*** [[Sexagesimal]] notation, an ancient numeral system in base sixty
* See also [[Table of mathematical symbols]] - for general tokens and their definitions...

===Physics===
* [[Bra–ket notation]], or Dirac notation, is an alternative representation of probability distributions in [[quantum mechanics]].
* [[Tensor index notation]] is used when formulating physics (particularly continuum mechanics, electromagnetism, relativistic quantum mechanics and field theory, and general relativity) in the language of [[tensor]]s.

===Typographical conventions===
* [[Infix notation]], the common arithmetic and logical formula notation, such as "''a'' + ''b'' − ''c''".
* [[Polish notation]] or "prefix notation", which places the operator before the operands (arguments), such as "+ ''a'' ''b''".
* [[Reverse Polish notation]] or "postfix notation", which places the operator after the operands, such as "''a'' ''b'' +".

===Sports and games===
* [[Baseball scorekeeping]], to represent a game of baseball.
* [[Juggling notation]], to represent juggling patterns.
* [[Aresti Catalogue]], to represent aerobatic manoeuvres

==Graphical notations==
 
===Music===
* [[Musical notation]] permits a composer to express musical ideas in a musical composition, which can be read and interpreted during performance by a trained musician; there are many different ways to do this (hundreds have been proposed), although [[staff notation]] provides by far the most widely used system of [[modern musical symbols]].

* [[Aresti Catalog|Aresti aerobatic symbols]] provides a way to represent flight maneuvers in aerobatics

===Science===
* [[Feynman diagram]]s permit a graphical representation of a perturbative contribution to the transition amplitude or correlation function of a quantum mechanical or statistical field theory

* [[DRAKON|Drakon-charts]] are a graphical representation of algorithms and procedural knowledge.

===Other systems===
* [[Chess notation]], to represent moves in a game of chess
* [[Whyte notation]] for classifying steam locomotives by wheel arrangement

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7887">In [[Hong Kong]]'s [[List of higher education institutions in Hong Kong|universities and higher education institutions]], '''orientation camps''' ({{zh|迎新營}}), also known as “Ocamp”, are held by different student organizations in order to welcome new students before their first academic year. There are different types of orientation camps. “Big ocamps” (大O) are organized by the [[students' union]] or constituent colleges, while “small ocamp” (細O) are usually organized by faculty or departmental societies with a view to welcome students who study in the same faculty. The duration of ocamps is usually two to seven days.

The aim of organizing Ocamps is to enable freshmen in meeting new friends through getting along with a group of freshmen in the camp. Also, it aims to let freshmen understand and then adapt to the lifestyle and culture in university. It also boosts the sense of belongings of students to the university. Furthermore, some Ocamps like to spread messages to students, for example, standing up against injustice etc.

== History ==
There is no accurate information about the first orientation camp in Hong Kong but the earliest ocamp recorded was in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;The University of Hong Kong, ''Growing with Hong Kong: The University and Its Graduates-The First 90 Years'', 2002, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; held by [[University of Hong Kong]]. Then other universities started organizing it following Hong Kong University.

== Group Mother and Father ==
In each group, there will be two to four group leaders, mostly voluntary senior students (Year 2 or above) and also some alumni. They are known as “Group Mother” (組媽) and “Group Father” (組爸)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ant/hka/vol3/HKAS_2009_1.pdf Negotiating Rebellion: Obscene Poems of Chinese University Orientation Camp]'', Jimmy Tsz Hsien YUAN, 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; as their role in the groups is to take care of the freshmen, i.e. the “group sons” (組仔) and “group daughters” (組女). They also have to design and create some handy gifts to the freshmen such as bags, hand fans and bracelets, which represent their groups.

== Dem Beat ==
''Dem beat'' (demonstration of beat), also known as ''dem cheers'' in some universities, means shouting slogans with a certain beat or rhythm created by claps and steps. All groups (either as university houses or colleges) have their own beat. The aim of this activity is to promote team spirit and togetherness.

== Campfire ==
[[File:Campfire in Ocamp.jpg|thumb|Students forming a circle surrounding the fire.]]

“Campfire” is held at night in which house captains start a fire together with torches and then all participants form a circle surrounding the fire and dance with music. Some common songs are ''[[My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean]]'', ''[[Dschinghis Khan (song)|Dschinghis Khan]]'' (Cantonese version) and ''Pieces of Sea Wave and Spray''. Before the activity ends, captains will share their feelings towards the camp.

== Game ==

===Situation Game===

Situation Game, known as  “Sit. Game”, in which committees of the camp first gather all participants in a venue, usually a sports centre. The committees deceive the participants by creating a situation that all group leaders have to leave the camp immediately. Group leaders sometimes cry in front of the participants to make the situation more convincing.  They then ask freshmen to speak out if there is any solution towards the situation. Before the committees announce the truth, they let participant enjoy their “last moment” with their leaders. Situation Game aims to teach and encourage participants to stand out and give voice to unfairness. Besides, it consolidates the relationship in groups including participants and group leaders.

[[File:Water game in Ocamp.jpg|thumb|Students playing with each other at the beach.]]

===Hong Kong Hunt===
Students are required to complete different tasks set by the committee as they run around in the city in limited time. By completing each task, students can get a certain score. At the end of the day, the team getting the highest score will be crowned the champion.

===Water Game===
Water game (水戰) is a common game in orientation camp. It is the game playing with water such as playing in the beach or playing with water guns. Participants will absolutely get wet.

===Room Game===
As a pastime after the conclusion of all planned activities in a day, “room games" (房 Game) are often played. Room games often last overnight. Participants will follow committees' instructions and play. Usually the games involve some penalties for the losers.

Popular room activities include "First Impression".

== Controversy ==
In recent years, orientation camp has sparked controversy owing to the games played there as criticized for ethical problems.

For example, in 2004 [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]]'s Health and Social Sciences Faculty freshmen were asked to kiss strangers on the lips, some of whom might develop a bad feeling during such an activity.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.scmp.com/article/468175/complaints-over-orientation-camp-sex-games Complaints Over Orientation Camp Sex Games]'', South China Morning Post, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides, games requiring close contact between the participants have been long described as being obscene and having too much intimacy. These include the “caterpillar game” as both the girls and boys in participation are required to wrap their legs around one another's waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-sun.on.cc/cnt/news/20130922/00407_027.html|title= Chinese: 科大生胯下拖手玩「毛毛蟲」(HKUST students playing the "caterpillar game")|publisher=The Sun|year=2013|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the ‘jumbo’ held by students at [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] (HKUST) in 2013, where the females were asked to lay down above the male's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-sun.on.cc/cnt/news/20130921/00407_032.html|title= Chinese: 科大迎新營淫招盡出 (HKUST's ocamp with obscene events)|publisher=The Sun|year=2013|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities of cheers have also been condemned by some mass media for the inappropriate slogans used by students, which simply aim to verbally abuse the others. For example, in 2002, in the ocamp held by the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK), students from [[Shaw College (Hong Kong)|Shaw College]] slandered girls from [[New Asia College]] with the use of chants. Some wordings were said to be even discriminating the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.singtao.ca/vancouver/2013-09-08/headline1378635184d4687993.html|title=Chinese: 中大迎新營 涉淫口號遭抨 (CUHK's ocamp being criticized for obscene slogans)|publisher=Sing Tao Daily|year=2013|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://std.stheadline.com/archive/fullstory.asp?year1=2002&amp;month1=9&amp;day1=6&amp;month2=9&amp;day2=6&amp;id=20020906g01&amp;keyword1=&amp;keyword2=|title=Chinese: 迎新口號歧視殘疾種族 (Ocamp's slogans with discrimination against the disabled)|publisher=Sing Tao Daily|year=2002|accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a daily news article, the Chairperson of Joint Committee on New Student Orientation of CUHK, Kenneth W.Y.

'''P. Jeevanandham''' (21 August 1907 – 18 January 1963) also called ''Jeeva'', was a social reformer, political leader, litterateur and one of the pioneers of the [[Communism|Communist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] movements in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jeevanantham-remembered/article5592372.ece Jeevanantham remembered – TAMIL NADU]. The Hindu (19 January 2014). Retrieved on 12 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was not only a socio-political leader, but was also a  cultural theoretician, an excellent orator, journalist and critic; and above all,  a relentless fighter for the deprived. A down-to-earth person with a clean record in public life, Jeevanandham was held in high esteem by ordinary people.

==Early life==
P. Jeevanandham was born in the town of [[Boothapandi]], in the then princely state of [[Travancore]] (which is now in [[Kanyakumari District]] of Tamil Nadu) into an orthodox middle-class family on 21 August 1907. His original name was Sorimuthu.&lt;ref name="Cultural"/&gt; He was named this name after his clan god Sorimuthu.

The orthodox and religious background of his family exposed Jeevanandham to literature, devotional songs and the arts, early on  in his life. He  grew up in an era when caste-based rigidity was widely prevalent, and from early on in his life he resented the very idea of  untouchability and could not tolerate his [[Dalit]] friends being denied  entry into  temples and public places and being humiliated.  Even as a schoolboy he became averse to ''Varnasrama Dharma'', a Hindu religious code that stratifies society on caste lines and facilitates the practice of [[untouchability]]. The national movement and [[Mohandas Gandhi|Gandhi]]’s call to wear [[khadi]] and his stand against untouchability influenced Jeevanandham to join the movement. He began wearing only khadi from then on.

Jeevanandham took his Dalit friends into the streets and public places where, usually, entry was denied to them, which earned him the displeasure of his family and orthodox caste members in his village. His father disapproved his behaviour and asked him to stop all things which were against their caste traditions. Jeevanandham said he would rather leave his home rather than follow discriminatory practices and eventually did so.

==Political life==

===Gandhian and Congress Worker===
Jeevanandham started his political life basing himself on Gandhian ideas. In 1924, he participated in the [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] against upper-caste Hindus, where Dalits were barred from walking on the road leading to the temple at [[Vaikom]]. He participated in a similar protest, demanding entry for Dalits into the [[Suchindram temple]]. When he joined an ashram run by [[V. V. S. Aiyar]] at [[Cheranmadevi]], he found that Dalits and ‘upper-caste’ students were fed in separate halls. He supported Periyar’s protest against this practice and quit the ashram. Later, he took charge of an ashram funded by a philanthropist in ''Siruvayal'' near [[Karaikkudi]]. The ashram life gave him an opportunity to read a lot of books. In this ashram, he got opportunity to meet Gandhi. Jeeva had written a letter to Gandhi disagreeing with his methods.  When Gandhi came to Madras, he had this letter in his pocket and wanted to meet Jeeva.  Rajagopalachari asked Gandhi to name the person he wanted to meet so  that particular person can be called.  Gandhi mentioned that he did not want the person to be called and would like to go to the ashram where Jeeva resided and meet him. When Gandhi went to the Siruvayal ashram and asked for Jeeva a young man of around 25 years appeared before him.  Gandhi asked him if he was the same person who wrote the 'letter' and Jeeva replied in the affirmative. &lt;ref name="Cultural"/&gt;

When Periyar ([[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]]), on returning from a visit to the Soviet Union, spoke highly of its achievements and expressed his desire to propagate socialism, Jeevanandham, who was by then familiar with the egalitarian principle, felt elated. His hopes of getting the national movement merged with the Congress Socialist Party were dashed when Periyar began dragging his feet. He, however, remained in the Congress. He was elected as a member of the [[All India Congress Committee]], a prestigious post in those days, and was also a member of the working committee of the State Congress unit. Later, when the Madras Provincial Congress Socialist Party was formed in 1937, Jeevanandham became its first secretary. He joined the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI) two years later along with [[P. Ramamurthi]], another veteran of the movement.

===Communist years (before Indian independence)===
The last 25 years of colonial rule saw the emergence of two movements in [[Tamil Nadu]] – the [[Self-Respect Movement]] (which was a precursor to the [[Dravidian movement]] led by Periyar) and the Communist movement.  Before enrolling himself as the first member of the united CPI in Tamil Nadu, Jeevanandham was an active participant in these two earlier movements.  His patriotism took him to the national movement; his revulsion toward untouchability and caste-based discrimination led him to support the Self-Respect Movement.

After joining the CPI, Jeevanandham and Ramamurthi organized rickshaw-pullers and factory workers on Marxist lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fighter all the way|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2522/stories/20081107252208700.htm|accessdate=30 July 2013|newspaper=Frontline|date=7 November 2008|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this they were assisted by leaders such as [[M. R. Venkatraman]] and [[B. Srinivasa Rao]]. They had already organized workers and formed unions in industrial towns such as [[Madurai]] and [[Coimbatore]] when they were functioning as socialists. Jeevanandham was in the forefront of efforts to build a strong labor movement based on [[Marxism]]. His oratory and writings helped him fulfill the task. But these leaders suffered police repression and were imprisoned several times. Jeevanandham visited sensitive areas and kept the workers’ fighting spirit alive. Alongside industrial workers, agricultural laborers and small farmers were also organized in [[Thanjavur]] and other districts. Jeevanandham and Ramamurthi inspired thousands of people through powerful speeches.

Under the colonial rule, Marxist literature and propaganda were banned, and Marxist workers were frequently arrested on one pretext or the other. Jeevanandham was no exception. He even had an externment order against him and had to stay away from the then Madras province for a brief period.

==Political life (after Indian independence)==
After [[Partition of India|Indian Independence]], the ban on the CPI was lifted, and all its leaders were released.

In the [[Madras legislative assembly election, 1952|first general elections]] in post independent India, Jeevanandham won a seat for the [[Legislature of Tamil Nadu|Legislative Assembly]] from the [[Washermanpet (State Assembly Constituency)|Wasermanpet]] constituency in [[Madras]]. P. Ramamurthi, his close associate, who was in jail then, was also elected from the [[Madurai North (State Assembly Constituency)|Madurai]] constituency. After being elected to the Legislative Assembly, he put pressure on the government to initiate action on issues relating to development schemes and reform measures. He also led many struggles, one of which was against the proposal to form ''Dakshina Pradesh'' comprising the four southern states. Despite his loss in the subsequent elections, he continued his party work.&lt;ref name="Cultural"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cultural warrior|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2416/stories/20070824503711900.htm|author=S.Viswanathan|newspaper=Frontline|date=24 August 2007|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tamil nationalism and literary works==
He played a key role in making his native [[Tamil language]] an official language in the state and the judiciary, and a medium of instruction in educational institutions.&lt;ref name="Jeeva"/&gt;

He was a supporter of pure usage of Tamil, which had, to an extent, become corrupted by the influence of [[Sanskrit]] and other languages.  He declared his name to be "Uyirinban", a literal translation of the Sanskrit word ''Jeevanandham''. One of his major influences was the works of the Tamil poet [[Subramania Bharati]], and also Bharati's persona and simple lifestyle. Jeevanandham was the first to take to cultural politics and cited his long struggle for nationalising Subramania Bharati’s songs.
 
He was well-versed in Tamil literature and was a good orator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commemorative stamp on Jeeva released|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/commemorative-stamp-on-jeeva-released/article586671.ece|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=22 August 2010|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeevanandham was the founder of ''Thamara'', a Tamil literary magazine. The Communist Tamil newspaper ''JanaSakthi'' was also begun with his commitment.&lt;ref name="Jeeva"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tributes paid to Jeevanandham|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tributes-paid-to-jeevanandham/article2813011.ece|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=19 January 2012|location=Tiruchi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periyar encouraged Jeeva to translate [[Bhagat Singh]]’s classic essay "[[Why I am an Atheist]]" in 1933. He translated it into Tamil, which was probably its first-ever translation. It was published by Periyar's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2419/stories/20071005508113100.htm|title=Letters – P.Jeevanandham|author=Chaman Lal|date=5 October 2007|publisher=Frontline|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Jeeva led a busy and hectic life: teaching classes on Marxism for party workers, advising students to equip themselves to meet the nascent republic’s development needs, addressing literary fora on topics such as the greatness of the poet Bharati, explaining the flaws in the government’s language policy at meetings of intellectuals, and addressing factory gate meetings in support of workers on strike. In between, he wrote editorials for the party daily or discussed strategies for resolving industrial disputes.

In 1962, his health suffered a setback. Later in the year he visited the [[Soviet Union]]. He took treatment there and returned by the end of the year. However, his health worsened weeks later. On 18 January 1963, he died at his modest home at [[Tambaram]], near  [[Chennai]].  About two lakh (200,000) people attended his funeral and paid their last respects to one who had toiled all his life for the common man, who symbolised the simplicity of Gandhism and who had a Periyar-like zest for social equality and the Marxist spirit to fight exploitation.

==Trivia==
[[File:Jeevanandam Government Higher Secondary School, Puducherry.JPG|thumbnail|Jeevanandam Government Higher Secondary School, Puducherry]]
* The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation(TNSTC), Erode Division is named the '''Jeeva Transport Corporation''' in modern days.
* The railway station at [[Vyasarpadi]] in [[Chennai]] is named [[Vyasarpadi Jeeva]], as he lived in the area for a period.
* A commemorative stamp on him was issued on 21-August-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiapost.gov.in/Stamps2010.aspx|title=Stamps 2010|publisher=Department of Posts, Indian government|accessdate=30 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814101038/http://www.indiapost.gov.in/Stamps2010.aspx|archivedate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jeevanandam Government Higher Secondary School, Puducherry, is named for him.

==Reputation==
Even his political adversaries respected him. He led a justified and honest life. No one could criticize his personal life.

[[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] leader [[C. N. Annadurai]] saw Jeeva walking down a road, and offered him a ride in his car. Jeeva thanked Annadurai but humbly refused his help.

When Communists were proscribed and subject to arrest, Jeeva took refuge in the home of [[M. R. Radha]], a notable stage and cinema actor. [[Karunanidhi|Kalaignar Karunanidhi]] came to the house, and saw a ''[[Sannyasa|sannyasi]]'' (Hindu renunciate) with a shaved head. He was suspicious of the ''sannyasi'',  trying to remember the well known face. Radha entered the room and asked Karunanidhi whether he could recognize the ''sannyasi''. Later Karunanidhi recognized the ''sannyasi'' as Jeeva.

He and [[C. Rajagopalachari|Rajaji]] were always political rivals but still respected each other.

He and [[K. Kamaraj]] were good allies. On his deathbed, Jeeva told his attendants "Telegram Padma Vathi [his wife]. Call Kamaraj." This shows how close these two leaders were.

'''Public folklore''' is the term for the work done by [[folkloristics|folklorists]] in public settings in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] outside of universities and colleges, such as arts councils, [[museums]], [[folklife festivals]], radio stations, etc.  The term is actually short for ''"public sector folklore"'' and was first used by members of the [[American Folklore Society]] in the early 1970s.  [[Archie Green]] is generally credited as the founder of the public folklore movement, although his work builds on that of [[Ben Botkin]] and [[Alan Lomax]], going back as far as the 1930s.  (They called their work "[[applied folklore]]," a related but distinct paradigm.)

The birth of public folklore can be traced back to the creation of the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]] in 1970, by an act of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], sponsored by Sen. [[Ralph Yarborough]] (D-TX) and written by Green and then-Senate aide [[Jim Hightower]].  Other national programs were later established at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA), where prominent folklorists such as [[Ralph Rinzler]], [[Alan Jabbour]], and [[Bess Lomax Hawes]] worked.  Funding programs were also established in the 1970s and 1980s in over 40 state arts councils, and these facilitated the eventual creation or funding of major non-profit centers for [[folklife]] documentation and presentation, such as [[City Lore]] and the [[Center for Traditional Music and Dance]] in New York, [[Texas Folklife Resources]], [[Northwest Folklife]], the [[Western Folklife Center]], and the [[Philadelphia Folklore Project]].

Public folklorists are engaged with the documentation, preservation, and presentation of traditional forms of [[folk art]]s, [[craft]], [[folk music]], and other genres of traditional [[folklife]].  In later years, public folklorists have also become involved in economic and community development projects.

Each year, some 15 outstanding American folk artists and performers are awarded [[National Heritage Fellowship]]s from the NEA for their lifetime achievement.  Some more widely known awardees over the years have included [[John Lee Hooker]], [[B.B. King]], [[Clifton Chenier]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Michael Flatley]], [[Shirley Caesar]], [[Albertina Walker]], [[Carter Family|Janette Carter]], [[Koko Taylor]], [[Brownie McGhee]], [[Sonny Terry]], [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Sunnyland Slim]], [[Lydia Mendoza]], [[Boozoo Chavis]], [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]], [[Helen Cordero]], [[Margaret Tafoya]], [[Santiago Jiménez, Jr.]], [[John Cephas]], [[Bois Sec Ardoin]], [[Mick Moloney]], [[Clarence Fountain]] [[Five Blind Boys of Alabama|&amp; the Blind Boys]], [[Esther Martinez]], and the [[Dixie Hummingbirds]].

The Smithsonian Institution features the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] every June and July which attracts upwards of two million people to hear live performances and view demonstrations of traditional crafts.

Public folklorists also work in "folk arts in the schools" programs, presenting master traditional artists to primary and secondary schools in demonstrations and residencies.  They develop apprenticeship programs to foster the teaching of traditional arts by recognized masters.  They also present traditional music on radio programs such as ''[[American Routes]]'' on [[Public Radio International]].  Occasionally they produce [[documentary film]]s on aspects of traditional arts; Smithsonian folklorist [[Marjorie Hunt]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for her 1984 [[Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject|short documentary]] film ''[[The Stone Carvers (film)|The Stone Carvers]]'' about the carvers at the [[National Cathedral]] in Washington, D.C.

'''Public humanities''' is the work of engaging diverse publics in reflecting on heritage, traditions, and history, and the relevance of the [[humanities]] to the current conditions of civic and cultural life. Public humanities is often practiced within federal, state, [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] and community-based cultural organizations that engage people in conversations, facilitate and present lectures, exhibitions, performances and other programs for the general public on topics such as history, philosophy, popular culture and the arts. 

Workers within the public humanities endeavor to create physical and virtual spaces where the public can engage in conversation, learning and reflection about issues and ideas.  Public humanities projects include exhibitions and programming related to historic preservation, oral history, archives, material culture, public art, cultural heritage, and cultural policy. The [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] notes that public humanities projects it has supported in the past include "interpretation at historic sites, television and radio productions, museum exhibitions, podcasts, short videos, digital games, websites, mobile apps, and other digital media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/divisions/public|title=Division of Public Programs|website=National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many practitioners of public humanities are invested in ensuring the [[accessibility]] and relevance of the humanities to the general public or [[community group]]s.

The American Council of Learned Societies' National Task Force on Scholarship and the Public Humanities suggests that the nature of public humanities work is to teach the public the findings of academic scholarship: it sees "scholarship and the public humanities not as two distinct spheres but as parts of a single process, the process of taking private insight, testing it, and turning it into public knowledge."&lt;ref name="Quay1989" /&gt; Others suggest a more balanced understanding of the ways in which history, heritage and culture are shared between the academy and the public, drawing on the notion of [[shared historical authority]].

Subfields of the public humanities include [[public history]], [[public sociology]], [[public folklore]], [[public anthropology]], [[public philosophy]], [[historic preservation]], [[museum studies]], [[museum education]], [[cultural heritage management]], [[community archaeology]], [[public art]], and [[public science]].

== Programs in Public Humanities ==
Several universities have established programs in the public humanities (or have otherwise expressed commitments to public humanities via the creation of centers, degrees, or certificate programs with investments in various forms of "public" work), including:

*[http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx Bishop Grosseteste University], Lincoln, UK, whose newly created [http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/study/courses/Pages/sociology.aspx BA Sociology degree] has deliberately been placed within a School of Humanities, and will be delivered by members of a research cluster wherein the idea of "public sociology" (i.e. a sociology that engages audiences beyond the academy in cultural, literary and sociology debate) is activeliy cultivated and fostered. 
*[[Brown University]], whose [http://www.brown.edu/Research/JNBC/index.html John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage] supports public humanities programs and offers a master's degree in public humanities. Brown's public humanities program emphasizes practice, balanced with theory and a ground in a field of study.
*[[Michigan State University]], whose [https://web.archive.org/web/20070612220838/http://www.cal.msu.edu/phc/index.php?phc Public Humanities Collaborative] "provides a gathering place, a commons, where faculty, students, and outreach professionals can collaborate with community groups to build strong campus-community partnerships and enhance public understanding of liberal arts for democracy."
*[[New York University]], whose [http://as.nyu.edu/ceh/about.html Center for Experimental Humanities] offers an MA program in Interdisciplinary Studies that encourages "students to develop exhibitions, make films, write books, experiment with digital media and incubate collaborative projects"
*[[Portland State University]], whose [http://www.pdx.edu/public-humanities/ Portland Center for Public Humanities] provides a yearlong forum of talks, roundtables, and workshops where the public can engage with humanistic questions, knowledge and debates.
*[[Rutgers University–Newark|Rutgers University-Newark]], whose Public Humanities track in the [https://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/graduate-program-american-studies/ma-program American Studies MA program] "is designed to ground students in the history, theory and methods of the public humanities, and in a foundation in nonprofit management, and bring it all together with project-based courses, an internship and capstone, preparing students for careers in cultural and community institutions."
*[[University of Michigan|University of Michigan - Ann Arbor]], whose [https://www.rackham.umich.edu/publicscholarship/ Rackham Program in Public Scholarship] supports students by facilitating collaborative scholarly and creative endeavors that engage communities and co-create public goods while enhancing graduate students’ professional development through grants, summer workshops, and semester-long learning initiatives

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2798">'''Public reason''' refers to a common mode of deliberation that individuals may use for issues of public concern.  The concept implicitly excludes certain assumptions or motivations that are considered improper as a basis for public decision making, even as a person may apply them in personal decisions that do not have a significant impact on the public.  

==Immanuel Kant==
The phrase "public use of one's reason" (''Vernunft in allen Stükken öffentlichen Gebrauch'') was used by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his 1784 editorial piece responding to the question "[[What is Enlightenment?]]," where he distinguished it from private usage of reason, by which he meant reasoning offered from a specific civic office or post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kant's "What Is Enlightenment"|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~mgamer/Etexts/kant.html|work=An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?|accessdate=9 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125160840/http://www.english.upenn.edu/~mgamer/Etexts/kant.html|archivedate=25 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was developed by American philosopher [[John Rawls]] to refer to the common reason of all citizens in a [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] [[society]]. Public reason giving, in the Rawlsian sense, involves justifying a particular position by way of reasons that people of different moral or political backgrounds could accept. Although in his later writings he added what is known as the proviso, meaning that non-public reasons could be given assuming that public reasons would be provided in due course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawls|first=John|title=The Idea of Public Reason Revisited|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|year=1997|volume=64|pages=765–807|doi=10.2307/1600311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to accomplish this, however, one must overcome what he refers to as the burdens of judgment, which can produce disagreement among reasonable citizens. These burdens include conflicting evidence, giving differing weights to considerations, conceptual indeterminacy, differing experiences and value conflicts. Private reason, by contrast, is the exercise of an individual's reason to the constrained norms and interests of some sub-set of the public as a whole (such as a business, a political party, the military or the family).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11233">A '''public viewing area''' is a space set aside for members of the public to safely view sites of interest, such as [[airport]]s, [[railroad]]s, [[construction site]]s or other facilities.  Sometimes they are known as [[visitor center]]s or '''interpretive sites'''.

In locations that have inherent dangers and would not normally be accessible to the public, viewing areas provide a way to satiate the public curiosity without exposing inordinate risk.  Many sites contain descriptive signs, viewing pavilions, picnic facilities, toilets, radio receivers and brochures.

== Examples ==

=== Airports ===
*[[Austin-Bergstrom International Airport]] (KAUS), Family Viewing Area is located near the State Aircraft Pooling Board (fancy talk for where aircraft belonging to the State of Texas gets maintained and stored) at the end of Golf Course Road. and faces west to runway 17L/35R. The Family Viewing Area also has paved parking, grassy areas, a picnic table.&lt;ref&gt;[http://365thingsaustin.com/2016/03/16/family-viewing-area-at-abia/]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Baltimore–Washington International Airport]] (KBWI), has the Thomas A Dixon Jr Aircraft Observation Park located just to the south of Dorsey Road which is a viewing area complete with parking, picnic tables, trash cans, and a playground.

*[[Hinckley Airport]] in [[Hinckley, Illinois]] has a picnic table along the grass strip for people to watch the aircraft operations and skydivers returning. The airport is used mostly for glider operations (Windy City Soaring) and skydiving, the skydivers (usually) return to a clearing just north of runway 9/27.
*[[Rochelle Municipal Airport]] in [[Rochelle, Illinois]] hosts the Chicagoland Skydiving Center, and its ramp is open to the public for viewing. A bar and restaurant affords views of the operations. Aside from the [[skydiving]] operations (with [[airplanes]] and [[helicopters]]) other airport operations are easily viewed and photographed.
*[[Glendale Municipal Airport]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]] has a [[$100 Hamburger]] restaurant overlooking the main apron and [[runway]], this also has a patio outside where visitors can enjoy the weather, view the aircraft operations and have meals. When the restaurant is closed the patio remains open for seating.
*[[Phoenix Deer Valley Airport]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] has a patio area facing the runways adjacent to the terminal building and a restaurant with a view of the runways. Radio receivers for the Ground Control and both Control Tower channels allow one to hear the radio traffic.
*[[Manchester Airport]] in [[Manchester]], [[England]] has had public viewing areas since the airport opened in 1938. The "Runway Visitor Park" not only allows viewing of aircraft movements, but also has a café, aviation souvenir shop, and several aircraft on display, including retired [[Concorde]] G-BOAC and others.
*[[Scottsdale Municipal Airport]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] has an outside patio with benches and control tower audio accessible thru the terminal building. While glass windows separate the ramp from the patio (making pictures difficult) and excellent view of the ramp and runway is afforded. Control Tower radio traffic is also heard in the terminal itself.
*[[Raleigh Durham International Airport]] (KRDU) has Observation Park which provides sweeping views of RDU’s 10,000-foot runway and is located near the Air Traffic Control Tower. It has an elevated observation area, radios that play tower communications, and a picnic area. Free parking and restrooms are provided.
*[[Van Nuys Airport]] has a public viewing center on the east side of the airport near the intersection of Woodley Ave. and Waterman Drive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawa.org/welcome_VNY.aspx?id=1156&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Railroads ===
*[[Rochelle, Illinois]], has built a public viewing area at the crossing of the [[Union Pacific]] and [[BNSF]] railroads there, complete with an elevated shelter, parking lot, gift shop, toilet facilities and BBQ grills.  They pipe in railroad radio audio on 106.9&amp;nbsp;MHz so visitors can listen to the radio traffic on [[Receiver (radio)|FM radios]].  ''[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]'' magazine also sponsors a [[webcam]] to allow viewing of via the Internet.
*[[Folkston, Georgia]] has a small but well-appointed viewing area, overlooking the "Folkston Funnel", a stretch of track where two [[CSX]] lines have combined for a large amount of rail traffic. The shelter itself has some chairs, rail radio broadcasts, ample parking and electrical outlets for charging camera batteries. The only amenity it lacks is a restroom, but there is a [[McDonald's]] within a block that is [[railfan]] friendly. Highlights of viewing include up to 60 trains a day, including the [[auto train]] and the [[Tropicana Products|Tropicana]] juice train.
*[[Homewood, Illinois]] has built a public viewing platform at the south end of the [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] (former [[Illinois Central]]) [[Markham, Illinois|Markham]] Yard.  This location is on the east side of the tracks and is connected by a tunnel under the tracks to the Homewood [[Metra]] / [[Amtrak]] station.  Near the station is a static display of an [[Illinois Central|IC]] [[GP10]] and [[caboose]].  There is a [[Starbucks]] coffee shop on the other side of Harwood Avenue from the viewing platform and there are several restaurants within an easy walk in downtown Homewood.

=== Locks and dams ===
Many [[lock (water transport)|lock]] and [[dam]] facilities along the various rivers in the US have public viewing areas, including:

* [[Lock and Dam No. 15]] in [[Rock Island, Illinois]] on the [[Mississippi River]]
* [[Olmsted Locks and Dam]] in [[Olmsted, Illinois]] on the [[Ohio River]]
* [[Lock and Dam No. 12]]  in [[Bellevue, Iowa]] on the [[Mississippi River]]
* [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant]] near [[Lewiston, New York]], on the [[Niagara River]], has an extensive interpretive center known as the [http://niagarafallsupclose.com/american-attractions/niagara-power-vista/ Niagara Power Vista].
* [[Hoover Dam]] near [[Boulder City, Nevada]], on the [[Colorado River]], has an extremely large interpretive center and tour facility.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/service/DamTour.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Parker Dam]] near [[Parker, Arizona]], on the [[Colorado River]], has a basic viewing area with views of the dam and interpretive signs.

=== Construction sites ===
These are, by necessity, often temporary in nature.  Harkening back to the "[[knothole]]s" in fences used by passersby to view the progress of a site, some large projects provide a glimpse into the construction by intentionally placing viewing ports in fences, often geared toward selling space in the final project.

=== Sports venues ===
Some stadiums provide locations where the public can view games in progress without entering the stadium or paying for an admission. [[AT&amp;T Park]] in [[San Francisco, California]], home of the [[San Francisco Giants]] has such an area.

'''Science and technology studies''', or '''science, technology and society''' studies (both abbreviated '''STS''') is the study of how society, politics, and culture affect [[scientific research]] and technological [[innovation]], and how these, in turn, affect [[society]], [[politics]] and [[culture]].

==History==
Like most [[interdisciplinary]] programs, STS emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields, all of which had developed an interest—typically, during the 1960s or 1970s—in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Bijker, W. E., Hughes, T. P., Pinch, T. and Douglas, D. G., ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology'', [[MIT Press]], Cambridge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently, beginning in the 1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s, although [[Ludwik Fleck]]'s (1935) monograph ''Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' anticipated many of STS's key themes.  In the 1970s [[Elting E. Morison]] founded the STS program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), which served as a model. By 2011, 111 STS research centres and academic programs were counted worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stswiki.org/index.php?title=Worldwide_directory_of_STS_programs The STS Wiki].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key themes===

*[[History of technology]], that examines technology in its social and historical context. Starting in the 1960s, some historians questioned [[technological determinism]], a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific "natural" development.  At the same time, some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the [[history of medicine]].
* [[History and philosophy of science]] (1960s). After the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well-known ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual [[paradigm]]s, programs were founded at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and elsewhere that brought [[historians of science]] and philosophers together in unified programs.
*[[Technology and society|Science, technology, and society]]. In the mid- to late-1960s, student and faculty social movements in the U.S., UK, and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields (such as [[women's studies]]) that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored. One such development was the rise of "science, technology, and society" programs, which are also—confusingly—known by the STS acronym. Drawn from a variety of disciplines, including [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]], scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by [[science]] and [[technology]]. Unlike scholars in [[science studies]], history of technology, or the history and philosophy of science, they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate, "[[ivory tower]]" researchers{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. As an example of the activist impulse, feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of [[Women in science|women]] from science and engineering.
*Science, engineering, and public [[policy studies]] emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science, technology, and society movement:  A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public's best interests.{{According to whom|date=November 2013}} The science, technology, and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow's science and technology, but this discipline took a different approach: It would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy. Some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies, and most of these were eventually absorbed into [[systems engineering]]. Others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches, and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science, technology, and society departments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

During the 1970s and 1980s, leading universities in the US, UK, and Europe began drawing these various components together in new, interdisciplinary programs. For example, in the 1970s, Cornell University developed a new program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology. Each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together, as well as their location within the various universities. For example, the University of Virginia's STS program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields (with particular strength in the history of technology); however, the program's teaching responsibilities—it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students—means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in [[engineering ethics]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===The "turn to technology" (and beyond)===
{{see also|Social construction of technology}}

A decisive moment in the development of STS was the mid-1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science. During that decade, two works appeared ''en seriatim'' that signaled what [[Steve Woolgar]] was to call the "turn to technology": ''Social Shaping of Technology'' (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985) and ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems'' (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). MacKenzie and [[Judy Wajcman|Wajcman]] primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design. In a seminal article, [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Wiebe Bijker]] attached all the legitimacy of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge. This was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology.

The "turn to technology" helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging STS programs. More recently, there has been an associated turn to ecology, nature, and materiality in general, whereby the socio-technical and natural/material co-produce each other. This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine (such as [[Carl May]], [[Annemarie Mol]], Nelly Oudshoorn, and Andrew Webster) and ecological interventions (such as [[Bruno Latour]], [[Sheila Jasanoff]], [[Matthias Gross]], [[S. Lochlann Jain]], and Jens Lachmund).

==Professional associations==
The subject has several professional associations.

Founded in 1975, the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], initially provided scholarly communication facilities, including a journal (''Science, Technology, and Human Values'') and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars. The society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide. The Society for Social Studies of Science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy; scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice; and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives. Proposals have been made to add the word "technology" to the association's name, thereby reflecting its stature as the leading STS professional society, {{According to whom|but there seems to be widespread sentiment|date=November 2013}} that the name is long enough as it is.

In [[Europe]], the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easst.net/ European Association for the Study of Science and Technology].&lt;/ref&gt;  was founded in 1981 to "stimulate communication, exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology". Similarly, the [[European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology]] (ESST) researches and studies science and technology in society, in both historical and contemporary perspectives.

In Asia several STS associations exist.
In [[Japan]], the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies (JSSTS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssts.jp/content/section/14/51/ Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2001. The Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network (APSTSN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://apstsn.org/ Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network]&lt;/ref&gt; primarily has members from Australasia, Southeast and East Asia and Oceania.

In Latin America ESOCITE (Estudios Sociales de la Ciencia y la Tecnología) is the biggest association of Science and Technology studies. The study of STS (CyT in Spanish, CTS in Portuguese) here was shaped by authors like Amílcar Herrera and Jorge Sabato y Oscar Varsavsky in Argentina, José Leite Lopes in Brazil, Miguel Wionczek in Mexico, Francisco Sagasti in Peru, Máximo Halty Carrere in Uruguay and Marcel Roche in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;Kreimer, P. (2007). Estudios sociales de la ciencia y la tecnología en América Latina: ¿para qué?, ¿ para quién? Redes, 13(26), 55–64. Retrieved from http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/907/90702603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1958, the [[Society for the History of Technology]] initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology. After the "turn to technology" in the mid-1980s, the society's well-regarded journal (''Technology and Culture'') and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non-historians with technology studies interests.

Less identified with STS, but also of importance to many STS scholars, are the [[History of Science Society]], the [[Philosophy of Science Association]], and the American Association for the History of Medicine.

Additionally, within the US there are significant STS-oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations, including the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[National Women's Studies Association]], and the [[American Sociological Association]].

==Important concepts==
=== STS social construction ===
{{Main|Social construction of technology}}

Social constructions are human created ideas, objects, or events created by a series of choices and interactions.&lt;ref name="Science Technology and Society"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodhouse|first1=Edward|title=Science Technology and Society|date=2014|publisher=University Readers|location=San Diego|page=255|edition=1st|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions have consequences that change the perception that different groups of people have on these constructs. Some examples of social construction include class, race, money, and citizenship.

The following also alludes to the notion that not everything is set, a circumstance or result could potentially be one way or the other. According to the article "What is Social Construction?" by Laura Flores, "Social construction work is critical of the status quo. Social constructionists about X tend to hold that:
# X need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is. X, or X as it is at present, is not determined by the nature of things; it is not inevitable
Very often they go further, and urge that:
# X is quite as bad as it is.
# We would be much better off if X were done away with, or at least radically transformed." 
In the past, there have been viewpoints that were widely regarded as fact until being called to question due to the introduction of new knowledge. Such viewpoints include the past concept of a correlation between intelligence and the nature of a human's ethnicity or race (X may not be at all as it is).&lt;ref name="The Social Construction of What"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacking|first1=Ian|title=The Social Construction of What?|date=1999|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts &amp; London, England|isbn=978-0674004122|page=6|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the evolution and interaction of various social constructions within science and technology can be found in the development of both the high-wheel bicycle, or [[velocipede]], and then of the [[bicycle]].  The velocipede was widely used in the latter half of the 19th century. In the latter half of the 19th century, a social need was first recognized for a more efficient and rapid means of transportation.  Consequently, the velocipede was first developed, which was able to reach higher translational velocities than the smaller non-geared bicycles of the day, by replacing the front wheel with a larger radius wheel. One notable trade-off was a certain decreased stability leading to a greater risk of falling. This trade-off resulted in many riders getting into accidents by losing balance while riding the bicycle or being thrown over the handle bars.

The first "social construction" or progress of the velocipede caused the need for a newer "social construction" to be recognized and developed into a safer bicycle design.  Consequently, the velocipede was then developed into what is now commonly known as the "[[bicycle]]" to fit within society's newer "social construction," the newer standards of higher vehicle safety. Thus the popularity of the modern geared bicycle design came as a response to the first social construction, the original need for greater speed, which had caused the high-wheel bicycle to be designed in the first place.  The popularity of the modern geared bicycle design ultimately ended the widespread use of the velocipede itself, as eventually it was found to best accomplish the social-needs/ social-constructions of both greater speed and of greater safety.&lt;ref name="MIT Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bijker,|first1=Wiebe|title=The Social Construction of Technological System|date=1993|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-52137-7|pages=28–45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technoscience ===
{{Main|Technoscience}}

Technoscience is a subset of Science, Technology, and Society studies that focuses on the inseparable connection between science and technology. It states that fields are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward. Both technological development and scientific discovery drive one another towards more advancement. Technoscience excels at shaping human thought and behavior by opening up new possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lukes, Power: A Radical View (London: Macmillan, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technosocial ===
{{split section|Technosocial|date=June 2015}}

"Technological action is a social process."&lt;ref name = "Goldman, 1992"&gt;Goldman, S. (1992). No Innovation Without Representation (pp. 148-160). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt; Social factors and technology are intertwined so that they are dependent upon each other. This includes the aspect that social, political, and economic factors are inherent in technology and that social structure influences what technologies are pursued. In other words, "technoscientific phenomena combined inextricably with social/political/ economic/psychological phenomena, so 'technology' includes a spectrum of artifacts, techniques, organizations, and systems."&lt;ref name = "Woodhouse, 2013"&gt;Woodhouse, E. (2013). In The Future of Technological Civilization (Revised ed., pp. 1-258).&lt;/ref&gt; Winner expands on this idea by saying "in the late twentieth century technology and society, technology and culture, technology and politics are by no means separate."&lt;ref name = "Winner, 1993"&gt;Winner, L. (1993). Artifacts/Ideas and Political Culture (pp. 283-292). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
* Ford Pinto&lt;ref name = "Dowie, 1997"&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1977/09/pinto-madness?page=2 Dowie, M. (1977, October 1). Pinto Madness. Retrieved February 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; – Ford Motor Company sold and produced the Pinto during the 1970s. A flaw in the automobile design of the rear gas tank caused a fiery explosion upon impact. The exploding fuel tank killed and injured hundreds of people. Internal documents of test results, proved Ford CEO Lee Iacocca and engineers were aware of the flaw. The company decided to ignore improving their technology because of profit-driven motives, strict internal control, and competition from foreign competitors such as Volkswagen. Ford Motor Company conducted a cost-benefit analysis to determine if altering the Ford Pinto model was feasible. An analysis conducted by Ford employees argued against a new design because of increased cost. Employees were also under tight control by the CEO who rushed the Pinto through production lines to increase profits. Ford finally changed after public scrutiny. Safety organizations later influenced this technology by requiring stricter safety standards for motor vehicles.
* DDT/toxins&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – DDT was a common and highly effective insecticide used during the 1940s until its ban in the early 1970s. It was utilized during World War 2 to combat insect-borne human disease that plagued military members and civilian populations. People and companies soon realized other benefits of DDT for agricultural purposes. Rachel Carson became worried of wide spread use on public health and the environment. Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring'' left an imprint on the industry by claiming linkage of DDT to many serious illness such as cancer. Carson's book drew criticism from chemical companies who felt their reputation and business threatened by such claims.. DDT was eventually banned by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after a long and arduous process of research on the chemical substance. The main cause for the removal of DDT was the public deciding that any benefits outweighed the potential health risk.
* Autopilots/computer aided tasks (CATs)&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – From a security point of view the effects of making a task more computer driven is in the favor of technological advance because there is less reaction time required and computational error than a human pilot. Due to reduced error and reaction times flights on average, using autopilot, have been shown to be safer. Thus the technology has a direct impact on people by increasing their safety, and society affects the technology because people want to be safer so they are constantly trying to improve the autopilot systems.
* Cell phones&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – Cell phone technology emerged in the early 1920s after advancements were made in radio technology. Engineers at Bell Laboratories, the research and development division of AT&amp;T discovered that cell towers can transmit and receive signals to and from many directions. The discovery by Bell Labs revolutionized the capabilities and outcomes of cellular technology. Technology only improved once mobile phone users could communicate outside of a designated area. First generation mobile phones were first created and sold by Motorola. Their phone was only intended for use in cars. Second generation mobile phone capabilities continued to improve because of the switch to digital. Phones were faster which enhanced communication capabilities of customers. They were also sleeker and weighed less than bulky first generation technology. Technologically advances boosted customer satisfaction and broadened cell phone companies customer base. Third generation technology changed the way people interact with other. Now customers had access to wifi, texting and other applications. Mobile phones are now entering into the fourth generations.  Cellular and mobile phones revolutionized the way people socialize and communicate in order to establish modern social structure. People have affected the development of this technology by demanding features such as larger screens, touch capabilities, and internet accessibility.
* Internet&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; –  The internet arose because of extensive research on ARPANET between various university, corporations, and ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency), an agency of the Department of Defense. Scientist theorized a network of computers connected to each other. Computing capabilities contributed to developments and the creation of the modern day computer or laptop. The internet has become a normal part of life and business, to such a degree that the United Nations views it as a basic human right. The internet is becoming larger, one way is that more things are being moved into the digital world due to demand, for example online banking. It has drastically changed the way most people go about daily habits.

===Deliberative democracy===
[[Deliberative democracy]] is a reform of [[representative democracy|representative]] or [[direct democracy|direct]] democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society.  Deliberative Democracy is a tool for making decisions.  Deliberative democracy can be traced back all the way to [[Aristotle’s writings]]. More recently, the term was coined by Joseph Bessette in his 1980 work ''Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government'', where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the [[United States Constitution]] with emphasis on public discussion.&lt;ref name="Bohman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohman|first1=James|title=The Coming of Age of Deliberative Democracy|journal=[[The Journal of Political Philosophy]]|date=1998|volume=6|issue=4|pages=400–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberative Democracy can lead to more legitimate, credible, and trustworthy outcomes.  Deliberative Democracy allows for "a wider range of public knowledge," and it has been argued that this can lead to "more socially intelligent and robust" science. One major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction.&lt;ref name="Chilvers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilvers|first1=Jason|title=Deliberating Competence, Theoretical and Practitioners Perspectives on Effective Participatory Appraisal Practice|journal=[[Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values]]|date=March 2008|volume=33|issue=2|url=http://sth.sagepub.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ryfe, there are five mechanisms that stand out as critical to the successful design of deliberative democracy:
*Rules of equality, civility, and inclusivity may prompt deliberation even when our first impulse is to avoid it.
*Stories anchor reality by organizing experience and instilling a normative commitment to civic identities and values, and function as a medium for framing discussions.
*Leadership provides important cues to individuals in deliberative settings, and can keep groups on a deliberative track when their members slip into routine and habit.
*Individuals are more likely to sustain deliberative reasoning when they have a stake in the outcomes.
*Apprenticeship teaches citizens to deliberate well. We might do well to imagine education as a form of apprenticeship learning, in which individuals learn to deliberate by doing it in concert with others more skilled in the activity.&lt;ref name="Ryfe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryfe|first1=David M.|title=Does Deliberative Democracy Work?|journal=[[Annual Review of Political Science]]|date=March 4, 2005|volume=8|pages=63–64|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Importance of deliberative democracy in STS====
Recently,{{when|date=January 2018}} there has been a movement towards greater transparency in the fields of policy and technology. Jasanoff comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a question of if there needs to be increased public participation in making decisions about science and technology, but now there needs to be ways to make a more meaningful conversation between the public and those developing the technology.&lt;ref name="Jasanoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Sheila|title=Technologies of Humility: Citizen Participation in Governing Science|journal=Minerva|date=2003|volume=41|issue=3|pages=223–244 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1025557512320|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deliberative democracy in practice====
Ackerman and Fishkin offer an example of a reform in their paper "Deliberation Day." The deliberation is to enhance public understanding of popular, complex, and controversial issues, through devices such as Fishkin’s Deliberative Polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|last2=Fishkin|first2=James S.|title=Deliberation Day|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/media/news/2004/03/10/586/deliberation-day/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government situation such as the United States Federal Government. However, things similar to this have been implemented in small, local, governments like New England towns and villages. New England town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting.&lt;ref name="Bohman"/&gt;

An ideal Deliberative Democracy balances the voice and influence of all participants. While the main aim is to reach consensus, a deliberative democracy should encourage the voices of those with opposing viewpoints, concerns due to uncertainties, and questions about assumptions made by other participants. It should take its time and ensure that those participating understand the topics on which they debate. Independent managers of debates should also have substantial grasp of the concepts discussed, but must "[remain] independent and impartial as to the outcomes of the process."&lt;ref name="Chilvers"/&gt;

===Tragedy of the commons===
{{see also|Tragedy of the commons}}

In 1968, [[Garrett Hardin]] popularised the phrase "tragedy of the commons." It is an economic theory where rational people act against the best interest of the group by consuming a common resource. Since then, the tragedy of the commons has been used to symbolize the degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a common resource. Although Garrett Hardin was not an STS scholar, the concept of tragedy of the commons still applies to science, technology and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardin|first1=Garrett|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/misc/webfeat/sotp/pdfs/162-3859-1243.pdf|website=www.sciencemag.org|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a contemporary setting, the Internet acts as an example of the tragedy of the commons through the exploitation of digital resources and private information. Data and internet passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical documents. Virtual spying is almost free compared to the costs of physical spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidow|first1=Bill|title=The Tragedy of the Internet Commons|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-tragedy-of-the-internet-commons/257290/#disqus_thread|website=theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[net neutrality]] can be seen as an example of tragedy of the commons in an STS context. The movement for net neutrality argues that the Internet should not be a resource that is dominated by one particular group, specifically those with more money to spend on Internet access.

A counterexample to the tragedy of the commons is offered by Andrew Kahrl. Privatization can be a way to deal with the tragedy of the commons. However, Kahrl suggests that the privatization of beaches on [[Long Island]], in an attempt to combat overuse of Long Island beaches, made the residents of Long Island more susceptible to flood damage from [[Hurricane Sandy]]. The privatization of these beaches took away from the protection offered by the natural landscape. Tidal lands that offer natural protection were drained and developed. This attempt to combat the tragedy of the commons by privatization was counter-productive. Privatization actually destroyed the public good of natural protection from the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahn|first1=Matthew E.|title=Environmental and Urban Economics|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-counter-example-to-tragedy-of-commons.html|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative modernity===
Alternative [[modernity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenstadt|first1=Shmuel|title=Multiple Modernities|journal=Dædalus|date=Winter 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feenberg|first1=Andrew|title=Alternative Modernity : The Technical Turn in Philosophy and Social Theory|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520089860}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a conceptual tool conventionally used to represent the state of present western society. Modernity represents the political and social structures of the society, the sum of interpersonal discourse, and ultimately a snapshot of society's direction at a point in time. Unfortunately conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society. Also, this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world. Problems can be summarized into two elements: inward failure to analyze growth potentials of a given society, and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their growth potentials.

Previously, modernity carried a connotation of the current state of being modern, and its evolution through European colonialism. The process of becoming "modern" is believed to occur in a linear, pre-determined way, and is seen by Philip Brey as a way of to interpret and evaluate social and cultural formations. This thought ties in with [[modernization theory]], the thought that societies progress from "pre-modern" to "modern" societies.

Within the field of science and technology, there are two main lenses with which to view modernity. The first is as a way for society to quantify what it wants to move towards. In effect, we can discuss the notion of "alternative modernity" (as described by Andrew Feenberg) and which of these we would like to move towards. Alternatively, modernity can be used to analyze the differences in interactions between cultures and individuals. From this perspective, alternative modernities exist simultaneously, based on differing cultural and societal expectations of how a society (or an individual within society) should function. Because of different types of interactions across different cultures, each culture will have a different modernity.

===Pace of innovation===
{{See also|Pace of innovation}}

Pace of Innovation is the speed at which technological innovation or advancement is occurring, with the most apparent instances being too slow or too rapid. Both these rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the people that get to use this technology.

===No innovation without representation===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{main|No innovation without representation}}

"No innovation without representation" is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments.

* [[Langdon Winner]] states that groups and social interests likely to be affected by a particular kind of technological change ought to be represented at an early stage in defining exactly what that technology will be. It is the idea that relevant parties have a say in technological developments and are not left in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "Artifact/Ideas and Political Culture." Technology and the Future (1993): 283-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spoken about by [[Massimiano Bucchi]]&lt;ref&gt;Bucchi, Massimiano. "No Innovation without Representation (A Parliament of Things for the New Technical Democracies)." http://www.fondazionebassetti.org/. 20 Dec. 2003. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* This ideal does not require the public to become experts on the topics of science and engineering, it only asks that the opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic decisions, as talked about by [[Steven L. Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Steven L. "No Innovation Without Representation: Technological Action in a Democratic Society." New Worlds, New Technologies, New Issues (1992): 148-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privileged positions of business and science===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{Main|Privileged positions of business and science}}

The privileged positions of business and science refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge, ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

===Legacy thinking===

Legacy thinking is defined as an inherited method of thinking imposed from an external source without objection by the individual, because it is already widely accepted by society.

Legacy thinking can impair the ability to drive technology for the betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into their accepted model of how society works.  By accepting ideas without questioning them, people often see all solutions that contradict these accepted ideas as impossible or impractical.  Legacy thinking tends to advantage the wealthy, who have the means to project their ideas on the public.  It may be used by the wealthy as a vehicle to drive technology in their favor rather than for the greater good.
Examining the role of citizen participation and representation in politics provides an excellent example of legacy thinking in society. The belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized, leading to public acceptance of corporate [[lobbying]]. As a result, a self-established role in politics has been cemented where the public does not exercise the power ensured to them by the Constitution to the fullest extent. This can become a barrier to political progress as corporations who have the capital to spend have the potential to wield great influence over policy.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Bill, and Sarah Harkins. "Fixed Fortunes: Biggest Corporate Political Interests Spend Billions, Get Trillions." Sunlight Foundation Blog. Sunlight Foundation, 17 Nov. 2014. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking however keeps the population from acting to change this, despite polls from Harris Interactive that report over 80% of Americans feel that big business holds too much power in government.&lt;ref&gt;Corso, Regina, SVP. "PACs, Big Companies, Lobbyists, and Banks and Financial Institutions Seen by Strong Majorities as Having Too Much Power and Influence in DC." Harris Interactive: Harris Polls. Harris Interactive, 29 May 2012. Web. 21 Apr. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Americans are beginning to try to steer away this line of thought, rejecting legacy thinking, and demanding less corporate, and more public, participation in political decision making.

Additionally, an examination of [[net neutrality]] functions as a separate example of legacy thinking. Starting with [[dial-up]], the internet has always been viewed as a private luxury good.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Internet today is a vital part of modern-day society members. They use it in and out of life every day.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"&gt;"Net Neutrality: A Free and Open Internet." The White House. The White House, 26 Feb. 2015. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for their internet resources. Since the American public is so dependent upon internet there is little for them to do. Legacy thinking has kept this pattern on track despite growing movements arguing that the internet should be considered a &lt;!--which kind? - human right/..?--&gt;utility. Legacy thinking prevents progress because it was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the internet is a luxury and not a &lt;!--basic?--&gt;utility. Due to pressure from grassroots movements the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has redefined the requirements for broadband and internet in general as a utility.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"/&gt; Now AT&amp;T and other major internet providers are lobbying against this action and are in-large able to delay the onset of this movement due to legacy thinking’s grip on American&lt;!--this article &amp; legacy thinking relates to the global population not just the American--&gt; culture and politics.

For example, those who cannot overcome the barrier of legacy thinking may not consider the [[water privatization|privatization of clean drinking water]] as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Flow. Oscilloscope Pictures, 2008. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partially because access to water has become such a given fact of the matter to them. For a person living in such circumstances, it may be widely accepted to not concern themselves with drinking water because they have not needed to be concerned with it in the past. Additionally, a person living within an area that does not need to worry about their water supply or the sanitation of their water supply is less likely to be concerned with the privatization of water.

This notion can be examined through the thought experiment of "[[veil of ignorance]]".&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward. Science Technology and Society. Spring 2015 ed. N.p.: U Readers, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the implications behind the "you get what you pay for" mentality applied to a life necessity. By utilizing the "veil of ignorance", one can overcome the barrier of legacy thinking as it requires a person to imagine that they are unaware of their own circumstances, allowing them to free themselves from externally imposed thoughts or widely accepted ideas.

 | quote = Smirting took off in the Republic of Ireland in the aftermath of its smoking ban in 2004. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smirting has been so successful that non-smokers try to mingle with the smirters.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news

Sociologist and sexologist [[Pepper Schwartz]] states that the smirters are "defiant and angry, they don't buy the second-hand smoke argument, and want to share this grudge with someone else."

One study found that 25% of Irish couples who had started a relationship during 2007 or 2008 had met while smoking outside.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

'''Social stress''' is [[stress (biological)|stress]] that stems from one's relationships with others and from the social environment in general.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[Appraisal theory|appraisal]] theory of emotion, stress arises when a person evaluates a situation as personally relevant and perceives that s/he does not have the resources to cope or handle the specific situation.&lt;ref&gt;
Smith, C. A., &amp; Lazarus, R. S. (1990) Emotion and adaptation. In L. A. Pervin (Ed.), ''Handbook of Personality: Theory and Research'' (pp. 609-637). New York:Guilford.

== Definitions ==
Researchers define social stress and social stressors in various ways.  Wadman, Durkin, and Conti-Ramsden (2011) defined social stress as "the feelings of discomfort or anxiety that individuals may experience in social situations, and the associated tendency to avoid potentially stressful social situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress in young people with specific language impairment|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197110001016|journal = Journal of Adolescence|date = 2011-06-01|pages = 421–431|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2010.06.010|first = Ruth|last = Wadman|first2 = Kevin|last2 = Durkin|first3 = Gina|last3 = Conti-Ramsden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilfield (1977) defined social stressors as "circumstances of daily social roles that are generally considered problematic or undesirable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Current social stressors and symptoms of depression|journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry|date = 1977-02-01|issn = 0002-953X|pmid = 835737|pages = 161–166|volume = 134|issue = 2|doi = 10.1176/ajp.134.2.161|first = F.

== Measurement ==
Social stress is typically measured through self-report questionnaires.  In the laboratory, researchers can induce social stress through various methods and protocols.

=== Self-reports ===
There are several questionnaires used to assess environmental and psychosocial stress.  Such self-report measures include the Test of Negative Social Exchange,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ruehlman | first=Linda S. |author2=Karoly, Paul  | title=With a little flak from my friends: Development and preliminary validation of the Test of Negative Social Exchange (TENSE) | journal=Psychological Assessment | year=1991  | volume=3 | issue=1 | pages=97–104 | doi=10.1037/1040-3590.3.1.97}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Marital Adjustment Test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Locke | first=Harvey J. |author2=Wallace, Karl M.  | title=Short Marital-Adjustment and Prediction Tests: Their Reliability and Validity | journal=Marriage and Family Living| date=August 1959 | volume=21 | issue=3 | page=251 | doi=10.2307/348022 | jstor=348022}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Risky Families Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Taylor | first=Shelley E |author2=Lerner, Jennifer S |author3=Sage, Rebecca M |author4=Lehman, Barbara J |author5= Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Early environment, emotions, responses to stress, and health | journal=Journal of Personality | date=December 2004 | volume=72 | issue=6 | pages=1365–1393 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2004.00300.x | pmid=15509286 | url=http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/lernerlab/files/taylor_lerner_sage_lehman_seeman_2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Holmes–Rahe Stress Inventory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The social readjustment rating scale|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022399967900104|journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research|pages = 213–218|volume = 11|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0022-3999(67)90010-4|first = Thomas H.|last = Holmes|first2 = Richard H.|last2 = Rahe|pmid=6059863|date=August 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Trierer Inventar zur Erfassung von chronischem Streß (TICS): Skalenkonstruktion, teststatistische Überprüfung und Validierung der Skala Arbeitsüberlastung|url = http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1026//0012-1924.45.1.8|journal = Diagnostica|date = 1999-01-01|issn = 0012-1924|pages = 8–19|volume = 45|issue = 1|doi = 10.1026//0012-1924.45.1.8|first = Peter|last = Schulz|first2 = Wolff|last2 = Schlotz}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Daily Stress Inventory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A daily stress inventory: Development, reliability, and validity|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00845128|journal = Journal of Behavioral Medicine|date = 1987-02-01|issn = 0160-7715|pages = 61–73|volume = 10|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/BF00845128|first = Phillip J.|last = Brantley|first2 = Craig D.|last2 = Waggoner|first3 = Glenn N.|last3 = Jones|first4 = Neil B.|last4 = Rappaport}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Job Content Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ): An instrument for internationally comparative assessments of psychosocial job characteristics.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1076-8998.3.4.322|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|pages = 322–355|volume = 3|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.3.4.322|first = Robert|last = Karasek|first2 = Chantal|last2 = Brisson|first3 = Norito|last3 = Kawakami|first4 = Irene|last4 = Houtman|first5 = Paulien|last5 = Bongers|first6 = Benjamin|last6 = Amick}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Perceived Stress Scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Global Measure of Perceived Stress|journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior|date = 1983-12-01|pages = 385–396|volume = 24|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/2136404|first = Sheldon|last = Cohen|first2 = Tom|last2 = Kamarck|first3 = Robin|last3 = Mermelstein|jstor=2136404|pmid=6668417}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stress and Adversity Inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Slavich, G.

In addition to self-report questionnaires, researchers can employ structured interview assessments. The Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS) is one of the most popular instruments used in research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Measuring Stress: A Guide for Health and Social Scientists|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6NDhBwAAQBAJ|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 1997-11-17|isbn = 9780190283889|first = Sheldon|last = Cohen|first2 = Ronald C.|last2 = Kessler|first3 = Lynn Underwood|last3 = Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social origins of depression: A study of psychiatric disorder in women|last = Brown|first = George William|publisher = Tavistock|year = 1978|isbn = 0-422-76310-1|location = London|pages = |last2 = Harris|first2 = Tirril}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this type of measure is to probe the participant to elaborate on his/her stressful life events, rather than answering singular questions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The UCLA Life Stress Interview (LSI), which is similar to the LEDS, includes questions about romantic partners, closest friendships, other friendships, and family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hammen Lab at UCLA|url = http://hammenlab.psych.ucla.edu/interview.html|website = hammenlab.psych.ucla.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Induction ===
In [[mouse model|rodent models]], [[social disruption]] and [[social defeat]] are two common social stress paradigms. In the social disruption paradigm, an aggressive rodent is introduced into a cage housing male rodents that have already naturally established a social hierarchy. The aggressive "intruder" disrupts the social hierarchy, causing the residents social stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress induces glucocorticoid resistance in macrophages|url = http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/280/6/R1799|journal = American Journal of Physiology.

In human research, the [[Trier social stress test|Trier Social Stress Task]] (TSST) is widely used to induce social stress in the laboratory. In the TSST, participants are told that they have to prepare and give a speech about why they would be a great candidate for their ideal job.  The experimenter films the participant while s/he gives the speech and informs the participant that a panel of judges will evaluate that speech.  After the public speaking component, the experimenter administers a mathematics task that involves counting backwards by certain increments.  If the participant makes a mistake, the experimenter prompts him/her to start again.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kirschbaum | first=C |author2=Pirke, K M |author3=Hellhammer, D H  | title=The 'Trier Social Stress Test'—a tool for investigating psychobiological stress responses in a laboratory setting | journal=Neuropsychobiology | year=1993 | volume=28 | issue=1–2 | pages=76–81 | pmid=8255414 | url=http://p113367.typo3server.info/uploads/media/lit9304.pdf | doi=10.1159/000119004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of negative evaluation is the social stressor. Researchers can measure the stress response by comparing pre-stress salivary cortisol levels and post-stress salivary cortisol levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Other common stress measures used in the TSST are self-report measures like the [[State-Trait Anxiety Inventory]] and physiological measures like heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;Spielberger, C.

In a laboratory conflict discussion, couples identify several specific areas of conflict in their relationship.  The couples then pinpoint a couple topics to discuss later on in the experiment (ex. finances, child-rearing).  Couples are told to discuss the conflict(s) for 10 minutes while being videotaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ditzen | first1 = B. | last2 = Schaer | first2 = M. | last3 = Gabriel | first3 = B. | last4 = Bodenmann | first4 = G. | last5 = Ehlert | first5 = U. | last6 = Heinrichs | first6 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication and reduces cortisol levels during couple conflict | url = | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 9| pages = 728–731 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.10.011 | pmid=19027101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brouwer and Hogervorst (2014) designed the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST) to induce stress in the laboratory setting.  After viewing neutral images with subsequent 1-minute rest periods, the participant is instructed to sing a song after the next 1-minute rest period is complete.  Researchers found that skin conductance and heart rate are significantly higher during the post-song message interval than the previous 1-minute intervals.  The stress levels are comparable to that induced in the Trier Social Stress Task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A new paradigm to induce mental stress: the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST) |journal = Frontiers in Neuroscience|date = 2014-07-29|issn = 1662-4548|pmc = 4114180|pmid = 25120425|volume = 8|doi = 10.3389/fnins.2014.00224|first = Anne-Marie|last = Brouwer|first2 = Maarten A.|last2 = Hogervorst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical indicators of stress in large groups===

A statistical indicator of stress, simultaneous increase of [[variance]] and [[correlations]], was proposed for diagnosis of stress and successfully used in physiology and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T.

Cambridge university press; 1999 Nov 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Its applicability for early diagnosis of social stress in large groups was demonstrated by the analysis of crises. It was examined in the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rybnikov|first1=S.R.|last2=Rybnikova|first2=N.A.|last3=Portnov|first3=B.A.|title=Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?|journal=Psychology &amp; Developing Societies|date=March 2017|volume=29|issue=1|pages=98–123|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065_Public_fears_in_Ukrainian_society_Are_crises_predictable|doi=10.1177/0971333616689398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health ==

Research has consistently demonstrated that social stress increases risk for developing negative [[mental health]] outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, S., 2017. Social stress. New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; One [[prospective study]] asked over fifteen hundred Finnish employees whether they had "considerable difficulties with [their] coworkers/superiors/inferiors during the last 6 months, 5 years, earlier, or never".&lt;ref name=romanov&gt;{{cite journal | last=Romanov | first=K |author2=Appelberg, K |author3=Honkasalo, M L |author4= Koskenvuo, M  | title=Recent interpersonal conflict at work and psychiatric morbidity: a prospective study of 15,530 employees aged 24-64 | journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research | date=February 1996 | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=169–176 | pmid=8778399 | doi=10.1016/0022-3999(95)00577-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information on suicides, hospitalizations due to [[psychosis]], suicidal behavior, alcohol intoxication, depressive symptoms, and medication for chronic psychiatric disorders was then gathered from the national registries of mortality and morbidity. Those who had experienced conflict in the workplace with coworkers or supervisors in the last five years were more likely to be diagnosed with a psychiatric condition.&lt;ref name=romanov /&gt;

Research on the [[LGBT|LGB]] population has suggested that people who identify as LGB suffer more from mental health disorders, such as [[substance abuse]] and [[mood disorder]]s, compared to those who identify as heterosexual.&lt;ref name="Meyer 674–697"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prejudice, Social Stress, and Mental Health in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Populations: Conceptual Issues and Research Evidence|journal = Psychological Bulletin|date = 2003-09-01|issn = 0033-2909|pmc = 2072932|pmid = 12956539|pages = 674–697|volume = 129|issue = 5|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674|first = Ilan H.|last = Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers deduce that the LGB people's higher risk of mental health issues derives from their stressful social environments.

=== Anxiety ===
The biological basis for [[anxiety disorder]]s is rooted in the consistent activation of the stress response.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Fear, which is the defining emotion of an anxiety disorder, occurs when someone perceives a situation (a stressor) as threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shin | first1 = L.

If a person has difficulty regulating this stress response, it may activate inappropriately. Stress can therefore arise when a real stressor is not present or when something isn't actually threatening.  This can lead to the development of an anxiety disorder ([[panic attack]]s, [[social anxiety]], [[OCD]], etc.).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Neuroscience|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=75NgwLzueikC|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2007-01-01|isbn = 9780781760034|first = Mark F.|last = Bear|first2 = Barry W.|last2 = Connors|first3 = Michael A.|last3 = Paradiso}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anxiety disorder]] is defined as the fear of being judged or evaluated by others, even if no such threat is actually present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Anxiety Disorder {{!}} Anxiety and Depression Association of America, ADAA|url = http://www.adaa.org/social-anxiety-disorder|website = www.adaa.org|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-term effects ===
Social stress occurring early in life can have [[psychopathological]] effects that develop or persist in adulthood. One [[longitudinal study]] found that children were more likely to have a psychiatric disorder (e.g. anxiety, depressive, disruptive, personality, and substance use disorders) in late adolescence and early adulthood when their parents showed more maladaptive child-rearing behaviors (e.g., loud arguments between parents, verbal abuse, difficulty controlling anger toward the child, lack of parental support or availability, and harsh punishment). Child [[temperament]] and parental psychiatric disorders did not explain this association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Johnson | first=J G |author2=Cohen, P |author3=Kasen, S |author4=Smailes, E |author5= Brook, J S  | title=Association of maladaptive parental behavior with psychiatric disorder among parents and their offspring | journal=Archives of General Psychiatry | date=May 2001 | volume=58 | issue=5 | pages=453–460 | pmid=11343524 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.58.5.453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have documented the robust relationships between children’s social stress within the family environment and depression, [[aggression]], [[antisocial behavior]], [[anxiety]], [[suicide]], and hostile, oppositional, and delinquent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Repetti | first=Rena L |author2=Taylor, Shelley E |author3=Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Risky families: family social environments and the mental and physical health of offspring | journal=Psychological Bulletin | date=March 2002 | volume=128 | issue=2 | pages=330–366 | pmid=11931522 | url=http://taylorlab.psych.ucla.edu/2002_%20Risky%20Families_Family%20Social%20Environments%20and%20the%20Mental%20and%20Physical%20Health%20of%20Offspring.pdf | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relapse and recurrence ===
Social stress can also exacerbate current psychopathological conditions and compromise recovery. For instance, patients recovering from depression or [[bipolar disorder]] are two times more likely to relapse if there is familial tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miklowitz | first1 = D.

=== Mortality ===
Social status, a macro-social stressor, is a robust predictor of death. In a study of over 1700 British civil servants, [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) was inversely related to mortality. Those with the lowest SES have worse health outcomes and greater mortality rates than those with the greatest SES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Marmot | first=M G |author2=Rose, G |author3=Shipley, M |author4= Hamilton, P J  | title=Employment grade and coronary heart disease in British civil servants | journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | date=December 1978 | volume=32 | issue=4 | pages=244–249 | pmid=744814 | pmc=1060958 | doi=10.1136/jech.32.4.244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have replicated this relationship between SES and mortality in a range of diseases, including infectious, digestive, and respiratory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Adler | first=N E |author2=Boyce, T |author3=Chesney, M A |author4=Cohen, S |author5=Folkman, S |author6=Kahn, R L |author7= Syme, S L  | title=Socioeconomic status and health.

Similarly, social stressors in the micro-environment are also linked to increased mortality. A seminal longitudinal study of nearly 7,000 people found that socially isolated people had greater risk of dying from any cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Berkman | first=L F |author2=Syme, S L  | title=Social networks, host resistance, and mortality: a nine-year follow-up study of Alameda County residents | journal=American Journal of Epidemiology | date=February 1979 | volume=109 | issue=2 | pages=186–204 | pmid=425958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social support]], which is defined as "the comfort, assistance, and/or information one receives through formal or informal contacts with individuals or groups",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallston | first1 = B.

=== Morbidity ===
Social stress also makes people more sick.

In one laboratory study, researchers interviewed participants to determine whether they had been experiencing social conflicts with spouses, close family members and friends.

=== Long-term effects ===
Exposure to social stress in childhood can also have long-term effects, increasing risk for developing diseases later in life.

== Physiology ==

Social stress leads to a number of physiological changes that mediate its relationship to physical health.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the short term, the physiological changes outlined below are adaptive, as they enable the stressed organism to cope better. Dysregulation of these systems or repeated activation of them over the long-term can be detrimental to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McEwen | first=B S |author2=Stellar, E  | title=Stress and the individual: Mechanisms leading to disease | journal=Archives of Internal Medicine | date=27 September 1993 | volume=153 | issue=18 | pages=2093–2101 | pmid=8379800 | url=http://yalerei.org/intmed/resources/docs/McEwen.pdf | doi=10.1001/archinte.153.18.2093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sympathetic nervous system ===
The [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS) becomes activated in response to stress. Sympathetic arousal stimulates the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]] of the [[adrenal glands|medulla]] to secrete [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] into the blood stream, which facilitates the [[fight-or-flight response]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Blood pressure, heart rate, and sweating increase, [[vasoconstriction|veins constrict]] to allow the heart to beat with more force, arteries leading to muscles dilate, and blood flow to parts of the body not essential for the fight or flight response decreases. If stress persists in the long run, then blood pressure remains elevated, leading to hypertension and [[atherosclerosis]], both precursors to [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Sapolsky, R. M. (1994). Why zebras don't get ulcers: A guide to stress, stress related diseases, and coping. New York: W.H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of animal and human studies have confirmed that social stress increases risk for negative health outcomes by increasing SNS activity. Studies of rodents show that social stress causes hypertension and atherosclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sgoifo | first=A | author2=Koolhaas, J; De Boer, S; Musso, E; Stilli, D; Buwalda, B; Meerlo, P | title=Social stress, autonomic neural activation, and cardiac activity in rats | journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | date=November 1999 | volume=23 | issue=7 | pages=915–923 | pmid=10580306 | doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(99)00025-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of non-human primates also show that social stress clogs arteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Manuck | first=S B |author2=Marsland, A L |author3=Kaplan, J R |author4= Williams, J K  | title=The pathogenicity of behavior and its neuroendocrine mediation: an example from coronary artery disease | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=June 1995 | volume=57 | issue=3 | pages=275–283 | pmid=7652128 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/57/3/275.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress, visceral obesity, and coronary artery atherosclerosis: product of a primate adaptation|journal = American Journal of Primatology|date = 2009-09-01|issn = 1098-2345|pmc = 3970187|pmid = 19452515|pages = 742–751|volume = 71|issue = 9|doi = 10.1002/ajp.20706|first = Carol A.|last = Shively|first2 = Thomas C.|last2 = Register|first3 = Thomas B.|last3 = Clarkson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although humans cannot be randomized to receive social stress due to ethical concerns, studies have nevertheless shown that negative social interactions characterized by conflict lead to increases in blood pressure and heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gerin | first=W |author2=Pieper, C |author3=Levy, R |author4= Pickering, T G  | title=Social support in social interaction: a moderator of cardiovascular reactivity | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=June 1992 | volume=54 | issue=3 | pages=324–336 | pmid=1620808 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/54/3/324.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social stress stemming from perceived daily discrimination is also associated with elevated levels of blood pressure during the day and a lack of blood pressure dipping at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tomfohr | first=Lianne |author2=Cooper, Denise C |author3=Mills, Paul J |author4=Nelesen, Richard A |author5= Dimsdale, Joel E  | title=Everyday discrimination and nocturnal blood pressure dipping in black and white americans | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=April 2010 | volume=72 | issue=3 | pages=266–272 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181d0d8b2 | pmid=20124424 | pmc=2894630}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smart Richman | first=Laura |author2=Pek, Jolynn |author3=Pascoe, Elizabeth |author4= Bauer, Daniel J  | title=The effects of perceived discrimination on ambulatory blood pressure and affective responses to interpersonal stress modeled over 24 hours | journal=Health Psychology| date=July 2010 | volume=29 | issue=4 | pages=403–411 | doi=10.1037/a0019045 | pmid=20658828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical axis (HPA) ===
In response to stress, the [[hypothalamus]] releases [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH), stimulating the [[anterior pituitary]] to release [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the [[adrenal cortex]] to secrete [[glucocorticoids]], including [[cortisol]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Social stress can lead to adverse health outcomes by chronically activating the HPA axis or disrupting the HPA system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are a number of studies that link social stress and indications of a disrupted HPA axis; for instance, monkey infants neglected by their mothers show prolonged cortisol responses following a challenging event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dettling | first=A |author2=Pryce, C R |author3=Martin, R D |author4= Döbeli, M  | title=Physiological Responses to parental separation and a strange situation are related to parental care received in juvenile Goeldi's monkeys (''Callimico goeldii'') | journal=Developmental Psychobiology | date=July 1998 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=21–31 | pmid=9664169 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-2302(199807)33:1&lt;21::aid-dev3&gt;3.0.co;2-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inflammation ===

Research has elucidated a relationship between different social stressors and [[cytokines]] (the markers of inflammation). Chronic social stressors, such as caring for a spouse with dementia, lead to greater circulating levels of [[Interleukin 6|cytokine interleukin-6]] (IL-6),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kiecolt-Glaser | first=Janice K |author2=Preacher, Kristopher J |author3=MacCallum, Robert C |author4=Atkinson, Cathie |author5=Malarkey, William B |author6= Glaser, Ronald  | title=Chronic stress and age-related increases in the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | date=22 July 2003 | volume=100 | issue=15 | pages=9090–9095 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1531903100 | pmid=12840146 | pmc=166443|bibcode=2003PNAS..100.9090K }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas acute social stress tasks in the laboratory have been shown to elicit increases in [[proinflammatory cytokines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Steptoe | first=Andrew |author2=Hamer, Mark |author3=Chida, Yoichi  | title=The effects of acute psychological stress on circulating inflammatory factors in humans: a review and meta-analysis | journal=Brain, Behavior, and Immunity | date=October 2007 | volume=21 | issue=7 | pages=901–912 | doi=10.1016/j.bbi.2007.03.011 | pmid=17475444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when faced with another type of social stress, namely social evaluative threat, participants showed increases in IL-6 and a soluble receptor for [[tumor necrosis factor-α]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Slavich | first=George M. |author2=Way, Baldwin M. |author3=Eisenberger, Naomi I. |author4= Taylor, Shelley E.  | title=Neural sensitivity to social rejection is associated with inflammatory responses to social stress | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | date=17 August 2010 | volume=107 | issue=33 | pages=14817–14822 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1009164107 | pmid=20679216 | pmc=2930449| bibcode=2010PNAS..10714817S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dickerson | first=Sally S |author2=Gable, Shelly L |author3=Irwin, Michael R |author4=Aziz, Najib |author5= Kemeny, Margaret E  | title=Social-evaluative threat and proinflammatory cytokine regulation: an experimental laboratory investigation | journal=Psychological Science | date=October 2009 | volume=20 | issue=10 | pages=1237–1244 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02437.x | pmid=19754527 | pmc=2761517}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Miller | first=Gregory E |author2=Rohleder, Nicolas |author3=Stetler, Cinnamon |author4= Kirschbaum, Clemens  | title=Clinical depression and regulation of the inflammatory response during acute stress | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=October 2005 | volume=67 | issue=5 | pages=679–687 | doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000174172.82428.ce | pmid=16204423 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/67/5/679.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in inflammation may persist over time, as studies have shown that chronic relationship stress has been tied to greater IL-6 production 6 months later&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Miller | first=Gregory E |author2=Rohleder, Nicolas |author3=Cole, Steve W  | title=Chronic interpersonal stress predicts activation of pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways 6 months later | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=January 2009 | volume=71 | issue=1 | pages=57–62 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e318190d7de | pmid=19073750 | pmc=2720615}}&lt;/ref&gt; and children reared in a stressful family environment marked by neglect and conflict tend to show elevated levels of [[C-reactive protein]], a marker of IL-6, in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Taylor | first=Shelley E |author2=Lehman, Barbara J |author3=Kiefe, Catarina I |author4= Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Relationship of early life stress and psychological functioning to adult C-reactive protein in the coronary artery risk development in young adults study | journal=Biological Psychiatry | date=15 October 2006 | volume=60 | issue=8 | pages=819–824 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.03.016 | pmid=16712805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interactions of physiological systems ===
There is extensive evidence that the above physiological systems affect one another's functioning.

'''Student Pugwash USA''' engages students to promote the socially responsible use of [[science]] and [[technology]] in the 21st century.  The organization uses a chapter-based model on U.S. college campuses, in addition to other student-focused events run by the national Board of Directors. The student members discuss the ethical, social and global implications of advances in these fields and explore the pursuit of socially responsible careers involving science and technology.  SPUSA is the U.S. affiliate of [[International Student/Young Pugwash]] and the US student affiliate of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], recipients of the 1995 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

As an educational nonprofit organization, SPUSA does not adopt [[advocacy]] positions on policy or political issues or candidates.  The organization posits that, in order to create effective social change, students must first understand the issues at stake, then contemplate their ethical and moral responsibility to themselves and to society as a whole. Its stated purpose is not to advance a particular [[ethics|ethical]] viewpoint regarding scientific and technological issues, but rather to encourage students to consider ethics when thinking about the role of science and technology in society.

==History==
SPUSA was founded in 1979 by [[UC San Diego]] student Jeffrey Leifer, with the fundamental belief that young people play a vital role in determining the socially responsible application of science and technology. In 1955 [[Albert Einstein]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and other eminent scientists issued a [[manifesto]] urging scientists to "think in a new way" about their moral responsibilities in the nuclear age. In 1957, the first Pugwash Conference was held in [[Pugwash, Nova Scotia]], bringing together some of the greatest scientific minds to address nuclear weapons issues and the social responsibility of [[scientist]]s. SPUSA strives to convene the next generation of scientists around today's parallel issues.

SPUSA is the US student affiliate of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], recipients of the 1995 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], and the U.S.A. affiliate of the [[International Student/Young Pugwash]].

A long-standing icon of the organization has been [[Albert Einstein]], for his commitment to advancing both science and its [[peace movement|peaceful]] use. Another icon is Professor [[Joseph Rotblat]], who was the co-founder of Pugwash and the only scientist to leave the Manhattan Project, refusing to work further on the atomic bomb after the Nazis were defeated. In response to Rotblat's call for an ethical Hippocratic Oath for scientists, Student Pugwash created a student pledge, calling young scientists to make a personal commitment to use science and technology in a socially responsible way. In 1999, Student Pugwash initiated the Joseph Rotblat Lecture on Science and Social Responsibility in honor of Rotblat's pioneering life dedicated to the responsible use of science.

Following a decrease in revenue related to the [[Late-2000s recession|late 2000s recession]], the organization returned to its student-run founding with former student board members Sharlissa Moore and Kyle Gracey leading the rebuilding.

==Mission and activities==

The mission of Student Pugwash USA is ''"to promote [[social responsibility]] in science and technology."'' It seeks to achieve this by:
* ''"examining the societal impacts of science and technology;''
* ''creating open and objective forums for debate;''
* ''fostering the exchange of ideas among diverse communities;''
* ''exploring solutions to current dilemmas in science and technology; and''
* ''cultivating the analytical skills needed to address future challenges."''

Activities have included regional, national and international conferences, speaker events at campuses through a national chapter network, and compilation of issue briefs on scientific and technical issues of social importance. Student Pugwash also maintains a student email list, a web log covering the ethical intersection of science and technology policy, and a database of socially responsible employers.

A science and technology election guide for the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]] was profiled in the journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']]. This project was continued with the launch of ''From Electrons to Elections'', a science and technology policy guide to the 2008 and 2012 elections.  From Electrons to Elections is a non-partisan resource designed to educate young voters on science, technology, and health issues and provide them with the platforms of the leading political candidates on these subjects.

==Pledge==

To encourage commitment to socially responsible applications of science and technology, Student Pugwash USA offers the following pledge for individuals to sign:

:''"I promise to work for a better world, where science and technology are used in socially responsible ways. I will not use my education for any purpose intended to harm human beings or the environment. Throughout my career, I will consider the ethical implications of my work before I take action. While the demands placed upon me may be great, I sign this declaration because I recognize that individual responsibility is the first step on the path to peace."''

'''''The ABC of Sex Education for Trainables''''' is a 1975 [[short film|short]] [[educational film]] hosted by Richard Dix.  It was intended to inform people about the need to educate the [[mentally disabled]] ("trainables" as they are referred to in the film) about [[sex]] and sexuality.  Reflecting the views held at the time, the film explains that "trainables" cannot learn in the same manner as those of normal intelligence, but must instead be trained through repetition.

==Background==
The 20 minute video places a high priority on teaching the intellectually disabled about sex so that they will not make inappropriate sexual comments, expose parts of their bodies, [[masturbate]] in public, be involved in unplanned pregnancies, or become victims of rape or molestation. It also notes that the goal of teachers should be to explain sexuality in a factual manner, and that views of sexual morality vary between families and should therefore be left for parents to teach.

The movie is used in "Timmy and the Sex Lesson", an episode of [[The Residents]]' video series ''[[Timmy (The Residents)|Timmy]]''.

==Cast==
The onscreen credits acknowledge that narration was provided by Richard Dix and that dramatic sequences were provided by William Block, M.D., Beverly Camp, Rick Fullerton, Peter Green, Michael Kowalski, Ellen Moats, George Murray, Aaron Orenstein, Christopher Reidy, Murray Zeligman, and members and staff of the Ronald Bruce Nippon Assoc., and [[Planned Parenthood]] of [[Southeastern Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="google video"&gt;{{cite av media | url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2987243478639579087# | title=The ABC's of Sex education for trainables | location=[[Sonar Entertainment|Hallmark Films, Inc.]] credited as studio within the opening 18 seconds, and the onscreen credits role after 19 minutes | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628182015/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2987243478639579087 | archivedate=2011-06-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scenes from the movie ==

*The opening sequence is of a girl (presumably a mentally disabled person) walking down the street. She is approached by a man in a car who leans out of his window and plays with her hair. She then gets in the back seat of his car and rides away.
*A group of teachers are in a workshop together. The instructor encourages the teachers to yell out different [[slang]] terms for the penis while she writes them on a chalkboard. This is intended to make the teachers more comfortable with the words so that they will not be embarrassed to teach mentally disabled children about sex.
*A man sits with a mentally disabled young man and explains to him about how penises become erect using several drawings.
*A man comes into a boy's bedroom, asking him why he has not yet left his bed. The boy replies: "I'm all wet and sticky!". The man proceeds to explain to the boy what a [[wet dream]] is and says he will help him clean up.
*A woman comes into her son's bedroom unannounced and discovers him masturbating. She then explains to him that it is good that he is doing it in private, that it feels good, and that someday she and he will have to talk about it and then leaves the room.

==Reception==
In 2001, ''[[DVD Talk]]'' reviewed the Fantoma Films "Educational Archives" series, ''Sex &amp; Drugs'', and noted ''The ABCs of Sex Education for Trainables'' as among those included, writing the film had the "impact of ''[[Freaks]]''" and that it was intended to "guide teachers in mental institutions, who must try to train (not teach) those patients considered 'trainable', to know enough about their bodies and sex to neither be anti-social nor victimized in public."  They commented upon the film addressing the issues directly by its showing "some very dedicated teachers taking on a really tough job."&lt;ref name="dvdtalk1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s358educate.html | title=Sex and Drugs breakdown- The ABC of Sex-Ed for Trainables | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Glenn Erickson | date=November 13, 2001 | work=[[DVD Talk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When they reviewed the [[DVD]] compilation "Educational Archives" ''School Locker'' in 2006, they made note that collections of educational films from Fantoma "included the best of the best in educational films", and that it was "hard to top marvels like ''The ABCs of Sex Education for Trainables''," and that while this later compilation was not without merit, "it pales in comparison with the earlier releases."&lt;ref name="dvdtalk2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/22988/educational-archives-school-locker/ | title=Educational Archives - School Locker | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Francis Rizzo III | date=August 1, 2006 | work=[[DVD Talk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[DVD Verdict]]'' wrote that the film was "the flip side of all those sex education films directed at children", in how the "well-meaning short teaches teachers how to handle sex education for "retardates," or the developmentally disabled." They noted that the film tended to be more graphic when compared to the other films included on the "Educational Archives" series, ''Sex &amp; Drugs'', and though it tried "very hard to take its subject seriously. Nevertheless, it comes across as very surreal."&lt;ref name="dvdverdict"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/sexanddrugs.php | title=review: Sex And Drugs (Educational Archives Volume I) | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Mike Pinsky | date=April 4, 2002 | work=[[DVD Verdict]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710160729/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/sexanddrugs.php | archivedate=July 10, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Digitally Obsessed'' wrote that the ''ABC of Sex Education for Trainables'' was "produced by Planned Parenthood to train teachers of developmentally-challenged young adults (called "trainables" here) about their bodies, reproduction, and the place of sexual relations in society."  They noted that the film had a few scenes considered (in 2001) as humorous, but that the film "actually does the best job of dealing with the issues of sex in context with society," in how it dealt with such issues as anatomy, aspects of normal development and sexual maturity, the appropriateness of public masturbation, and being aware of exploitation, with the subjects "handled with tact and matter of factness."  They concluded that stylistic problems aside, the film was "quite an interesting piece on what would present a real challenge to those caring for developmentally-challenged individuals, and their responsibilities as sexual beings." and that of the films making up the compilation, it was "the most educational, and least condescending sex education film of the lot."&lt;ref name="digitallyobsessed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=1905 | title=review: The Educational Archives: Volume 1—Sex &amp; Drugs | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Jeff Ulmer | date=November 22, 2001 | work=Digitally Obsessed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transderivational search''' (often abbreviated to '''TDS''') is a [[psychology|psychological]] and [[cybernetics]] term, meaning when a search is being conducted for a [[fuzzy logic|fuzzy]] match across a broad field. In [[computing]] the equivalent function can be performed using [[content-addressable memory]].

Unlike usual searches, which look for literal (i.e. exact, [[logic]]al, or [[regular expression]]) matches, a transderivational search is a search for a possible meaning or possible  match as part of communication, and without which an incoming communication cannot be made any sense of whatsoever. It is thus an integral part of processing [[language]], and of attaching [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] to [[communication]].

A psychological example of TDS is in [[Milton Erickson|Ericksonian]] [[hypnotherapy]], where vague suggestions are used that the patient must process intensely in order to find their own meanings, thus ensuring that the practitioner does not intrude his own beliefs into the subject's inner world.

==TDS in human communication and processing==
Because TDS is a compelling, automatic and unconscious state of internal focus and processing (i.e. a type of everyday trance state), and often a state of internal lack of certainty, or openness to finding an answer (since something is being checked out at that moment), it can be utilized or interrupted, in order to create, or deepen, trance.

TDS is a fundamental part of human language and cognitive processing. Arguably, every word or utterance a person hears, for example, and everything they see or feel and take note of, results in a very brief trance while TDS is carried out to establish a contextual meaning for it.

===Examples===
'''Leading statements:'''

* ''"And those thoughts you had yesterday..."'' the human mind cannot process hearing this phrase, without at some level searching internally for some thoughts or other that it had yesterday, to make the subject of the sentence.
* ''"The many colors that fruit can be"'' likewise starts the human mind considering even if briefly, different fruit sorted by color.
* ''"You did it again, didn't you!"'' This everyday [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] use of TDS usually sends the recipient looking internally for some "it" they may have done for which blame is being fairly given. Regardless of whether such a matter can be identified, guilt or anger may result.
* ''"There has been pain, hasn't there"'' the mind of a patient suffering an illness will find it very hard or impossible to hear or answer this sentence without conducting internal searches to verify whether this is true or not, or to find an example if so.
* ''"You'd forgotten something [or: some part of your body], hadn't you?"'' the mind usually checks through the various things, or parts of the body, on hearing this, seeing if each in turn has been forgotten.

'''Textual ambiguity:'''
* ''"Do you remember line dancing on the steps?"'' Without sufficient context, some statements may trigger TDS in order to resolve inherent [[ambiguity]] in the interpretation of a posed question. Do I remember a bygone fad called "line dancing on the steps"? Do I remember personally engaging in dancing in the past? Do I remember my routine practice dancing by focusing on the steps of the dance? Do I tend to forget about dancing when I am standing on steps?
* ''"Penny-wise and pound the table dance to the beat of a different drummer"''. The mixing of [[cliché]] and stock phrases may trigger TDS in order to reconcile the discrepancies between expected and actual utterances in sequence.

Although TDS is often associated with spoken language, it can be induced in any perceptual system. Thus Milton Erickson's "[[Milton H. Erickson#Handshake induction|hypnotic handshake]]" is a technique that leaves the other person performing TDS in search of meaning to a deliberately ambiguous use of touch.

'''Translation''' is the communication of the [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of a [[source language (translation)|source-language]] text by means of an [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalent]] [[target language (translation)|target-language]] text.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Namit Bhatia, ed., 1992, pp. 1,051–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The English language draws a [[terminology|terminological]] distinction (not all languages do) between ''translating'' (a written text) and ''interpreting'' (oral or sign-language communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of [[writing]] within a language community.

A translator always risks inadvertently introducing source-language [[word]]s, [[grammar]], or [[syntax]] into the target-language rendering. On the other hand, such "spill-overs" have sometimes imported useful source-language [[calque]]s and [[loanword]]s that have enriched target languages.  Translators, including early translators of [[sacred text]]s, have helped shape the very languages into which they have translated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXVIII, no. 2, 1983, pp. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to [[machine translation|automate translation]] or to [[computer-assisted translation|mechanically aid the human translator]].&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Hutchins, ''Early Years in Machine Translation: Memoirs and Biographies of Pioneers'', Amsterdam, John Benjamins, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the rise of the [[Internet]] has fostered a [[world-wide market]] for [[translation services]] and has facilitated "[[language localization]]".&lt;ref&gt;M. Snell-Hornby, ''The Turns of Translation Studies: New Paradigms or Shifting Viewpoints?'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins, 2006, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Rosetta Stone BW.jpeg|thumb|115px|left|[[Rosetta Stone]], a [[secular icon]] for the art of translation.&lt;ref&gt;"Rosetta Stone", ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 5th ed., 1994, p. 2,361.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[English language|English]] word "translation" derives from the [[Latin]] word ''translatio'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vélez|first1=Fabio|title=Antes de Babel|pages=3–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comes from ''[[Wiktionary:trans#Latin|trans]]'', "across" + ''[[Wiktionary:fero#Latin|ferre]]'', "to carry" or "to bring" (''-latio'' in turn coming from ''latus'', the [[past participle]] of ''ferre'').  Thus ''translatio'' is "a carrying across" or "a bringing across":  in this case, of a text from one language to another.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germanic languages]] (except for modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and some [[Slavic languages]] have [[calque#Loan translation: translatio and traductio|calque]]d their words for the [[concept]] of "translation" on ''translatio''.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;

The [[Romance languages]] and the remaining ''Slavic'' languages have derived their words for the concept of "translation" from an alternative Latin word, ''traductio'', itself derived from ''traducere'' ("to lead across" or "to bring across", from ''trans'', "across" + ''[[Wiktionary:duco#Latin|ducere]]'', "to lead" or "to bring").&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] term for "translation", {{lang|grc|μετάφρασις}} (''metaphrasis'', "a speaking across"), has supplied [[English language|English]] with "[[metaphrase]]" (a "[[literal translation|literal]]", or "word-for-word", translation)—as contrasted with "[[paraphrase]]" ("a saying in other words", from  {{lang|grc|παράφρασις}}, ''paraphrasis'').&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83" /&gt; "Metaphrase" corresponds, in one of the more recent terminologies, to "[[Translation#Equivalence|formal equivalence]]"; and "paraphrase", to "[[Translation#Equivalence|dynamic equivalence]]".&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, the concept of metaphrase—of "word-for-word translation"—is an [[Perfection|imperfect]] concept, because a given word in a given language often carries more than one meaning; and because a similar given meaning may often be represented in a given language by more than one word.  Nevertheless, "metaphrase" and "paraphrase" may be useful as ''ideal'' concepts that mark the extremes in the spectrum of possible approaches to translation.{{efn|"Ideal concepts" are useful as well in other fields, such as [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], which include the concepts of perfectly solid bodies, perfectly rigid bodies, perfectly plastic bodies, perfectly black bodies, perfect crystals, perfect fluids, and perfect gases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''On Perfection'' (first published in Polish in 1976 as ''O doskonałości''); English translation by [[Christopher Kasparek]] subsequently serialized in 1979–1981 in ''Dialectics and Humanism:  The Polish Philosophical Quarterly'', and reprinted in [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''On Perfection'', Warsaw University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Theories==

===Western theory===
[[File:John Dryden by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|125px|[[John Dryden]]]]
Discussions of the theory and practice of translation reach back into [[ancient history|antiquity]] and show remarkable continuities. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] distinguished between ''[[metaphrase]]'' ([[literal translation]]) and ''[[paraphrase]]''. This distinction was adopted by English [[poet]] and [[translator]] [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700), who described translation as the judicious blending of these two modes of phrasing when selecting, in the target language, "counterparts," or [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]], for the expressions used in the source language:

{{blockquote|When [words] appear... literally graceful, it were an injury to the author that they should be changed. But since... what is beautiful in one [language] is often barbarous, nay sometimes nonsense, in another, it would be unreasonable to limit a translator to the narrow compass of his author's words: 'tis enough if he choose out some expression which does not vitiate the sense.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;}}

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero]]]]
Dryden cautioned, however, against the license of "imitation", i.e., of adapted translation: "When a painter copies from the life... he has no privilege to alter features and lineaments..."&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

This general formulation of the central concept of translation—[[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalence]]—is as adequate as any that has been proposed since [[Cicero]] and [[Horace]], who, in 1st-century-BCE [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], famously and literally cautioned against translating "word for word" ({{lang|la|verbum pro verbo}}).&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

Despite occasional theoretical diversity, the actual ''practice'' of translation has hardly changed since [[ancient history|antiquity]]. Except for some extreme [[metaphrase]]rs in the early [[Christian]] period and the [[Middle Ages]], and adapters in various periods (especially pre-Classical Rome, and the 18th century), translators have generally shown prudent flexibility in seeking [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]]—"[[literal translation|literal]]" where possible, [[paraphrase|paraphrastic]] where necessary—for the original [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and other crucial "values" (e.g., [[Style (fiction)|style]], [[verse form]], concordance with [[music]]al accompaniment or, in [[film]]s, with speech [[Manner of articulation|articulatory]] movements) as determined from context.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

[[File:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds 2.png|thumb|100px|[[Samuel Johnson]]]]
In general, translators have sought to preserve the [[Context (language use)|context]] itself by reproducing the original order of [[sememe]]s, and hence [[word order]]—when necessary, reinterpreting the actual [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, for example, by shifting from [[active voice|active]] to [[passive voice]], or ''vice versa''. The grammatical differences between "fixed-word-order" [[language]]s&lt;ref&gt;Typically, [[analytic language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]]) and "free-word-order" languages&lt;ref&gt;Typically, [[synthetic language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]]) have been no impediment in this regard.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;  The particular [[syntax]] (sentence-structure) characteristics of a text's source language are adjusted to the syntactic requirements of the target language. 
[[File:Martin Luther, 1529.jpg|thumb|left|110px|[[Martin Luther]]]]
When a target language has lacked [[terminology|terms]] that are found in a source language, translators have borrowed those terms, thereby enriching the target language. Thanks in great measure to the exchange of [[calque]]s and [[loanword]]s between languages, and to their importation from other languages, there are few [[concept]]s that are "[[untranslatability|untranslatable]]" among the modern European languages.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;  A greater problem, however, is translating terms relating to cultural concepts that have no equivalent in the target language.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of this are described in the article, [http://www.noproblem.no/translate.html "Translating the 17th of May into English and other horror stories"], retrieved 2010-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  For full comprehension, such situations require the provision of a [[gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]].

Generally, the greater the contact and exchange that have existed between two languages, or between those languages and a third one, the greater is the ratio of [[metaphrase]] to [[paraphrase]] that may be used in translating among them. However, due to shifts in [[ecological niche]]s of words, a common [[etymology]] is sometimes misleading as a guide to current meaning in one or the other language. For example, the English ''actual'' should not be confused with the [[cognate]] French {{lang|fr|actuel}} ("present", "current"), the Polish {{lang|pl|aktualny}} ("present", "current," "topical", "timely", "feasible"),&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; the Swedish ''aktuell'' ("topical", "presently of importance"), the Russian {{lang|ru|актуальный}} ("urgent", "topical") or the Dutch ''actueel'' ("current").

The translator's role as a bridge for "carrying across" values between cultures has been discussed at least since [[Terence]], the 2nd-century-BCE Roman adapter of Greek comedies. The translator's role is, however, by no means a passive, mechanical one, and so has also been compared to that of an [[artist]].  The main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as [[Cicero]]. [[John Dryden|Dryden]] observed that "Translation is a type of drawing after life..." Comparison of the translator with a [[musician]] or [[actor]] goes back at least to [[Samuel Johnson]]'s remark about [[Alexander Pope]] playing [[Homer]] on a [[flageolet]], while Homer himself used a [[bassoon]].&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"/&gt;
[[File:Herder by Kügelgen.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Johann Gottfried Herder]]]]
If translation be an art, it is no easy one.  In the 13th century, [[Roger Bacon]] wrote that if a translation is to be true, the translator must know both [[language]]s, as well as the [[science]] that he is to translate; and finding that few translators did, he wanted to do away with translation and translators altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ignacy Krasicki 111.PNG|thumb|125px|[[Ignacy Krasicki]]]]
The translator of the Bible into German, [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), is credited with being the first European to posit that one translates satisfactorily only toward his own language. L.G. Kelly states that since [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in the 18th century, "it has been axiomatic" that one translates only toward his own language.&lt;ref&gt;L.G. Kelly, cited in Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounding the demands on the translator is the fact that no [[dictionary]] or [[thesaurus]] can ever be a fully adequate guide in translating. The Scottish historian [[Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee|Alexander Tytler]], in his ''Essay on the Principles of Translation'' (1790), emphasized that assiduous [[reading (activity)|reading]] is a more comprehensive guide to a language than are dictionaries. The same point, but also including [[listening]] to the [[spoken language|''spoken'' language]], had earlier, in 1783, been made by the Polish poet and [[grammar]]ian [[Onufry Kopczyński]].&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 86"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The translator's special role in society is described in a posthumous 1803 essay by "Poland's [[La Fontaine]]", the Roman Catholic [[Primate of Poland]], [[Poetry|poet]], [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedist]], [[Novelist|author]] of the first Polish novel, and translator from French and Greek, [[Ignacy Krasicki]]:

{{blockquote|[T]ranslation... is in fact an art both estimable and very difficult, and therefore is not the labor and portion of common minds; [it] should be [practiced] by those who are themselves capable of being actors, when they see greater use in translating the works of others than in their own works, and hold higher than their own glory the service that they render their country.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 87, from [[Ignacy Krasicki]], {{lang|pl|"O tłumaczeniu ksiąg"}} ("On Translating Books"), in {{lang|pl|Dzieła wierszem i prozą}} (Works in Verse and Prose), 1803, reprinted in [[Edward Balcerzan]], ed., {{lang|pl|Pisarze polscy o sztuce przekładu, 1440–1974: Antologia}} (Polish Writers on the Art of Translation, 1440–1974: an Anthology), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other traditions===
Due to [[Western colonialism]] and cultural dominance in recent centuries, Western translation traditions have largely replaced other traditions. The Western traditions draw on both ancient and medieval traditions, and on more recent European innovations.

Though earlier approaches to translation are less commonly used today, they retain importance when dealing with their products, as when historians view ancient or medieval records to piece together events which took place in non-Western or pre-Western environments. Also, though heavily influenced by Western traditions and practiced by translators taught in Western-style educational systems, Chinese and related translation traditions retain some theories and philosophies unique to the Chinese tradition.

==== Near East ====
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
Traditions of translating material among the languages of ancient [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Assyria]] ([[Syriac language]]), [[Anatolia]], and [[Israel]] ([[Hebrew language]]) go back several millennia.  There exist partial translations of the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' (c. 2000 BCE) into [[Southwest Asia]]n languages of the second millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, "Translation", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, vol. 27, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of a [[bilingual]] document is the 1274 BCE [[Treaty of Kadesh]] between the [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[Hittite Empire|Hittie empire]]s.

====Asia====
{{Further|Chinese translation theory}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'', translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] by [[Kumārajīva]]:  world's oldest known dated printed book (868 CE)]]

There is a separate tradition of translation in [[South Asia|South]], [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[East Asia]] (primarily of texts from the [[India]]n and [[China|Chinese]] civilizations), connected especially with the rendering of religious, particularly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], texts and with the governance of the Chinese empire. Classical Indian translation is characterized by loose adaptation, rather than the closer translation more commonly found in Europe; and [[Chinese translation theory]] identifies various criteria and limitations in translation.

In the East Asian sphere of Chinese cultural influence, more important than translation ''per se'' has been the use and reading of Chinese texts, which also had substantial influence on the Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese languages, with substantial [[Sino-Xenic vocabularies|borrowings of Chinese vocabulary]] and writing system. Notable is the Japanese [[kanbun]], a system for [[Gloss (annotation)|glossing]] Chinese texts for Japanese speakers.

Though Indianized states in [[Southeast Asia]] often translated [[Sanskrit]] material into the local languages, the literate elites and scribes more commonly used Sanskrit as their primary language of culture and government.
[[File:VOA Perry Link.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Perry Link]]]]
Some special aspects of translating from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] are illustrated in [[Perry Link]]'s discussion of translating the work of the [[Tang Dynasty]] poet [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (699–759 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry" (review of [[Eliot Weinberger]], with an afterword by [[Octavio Paz]], ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (with More Ways)'', New Directions; and [[Eliot Weinberger]], ''The Ghosts of Birds'', New Directions), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Some of the art of classical [[Chinese poetry]] [writes Link] must simply be set aside as [[untranslatability|untranslatable]].  The internal structure of [[Chinese characters]] has a beauty of its own, and the [[calligraphy]] in which classical poems were written is another important but untranslatable dimension.  Since Chinese characters do not vary in length, and because there are exactly five characters per line in a poem like [the one that [[Eliot Weinberger]] discusses in ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (with More Ways)''], another untranslatable feature is that the written result, hung on a wall, presents a rectangle.  Translators into languages whose word lengths vary can reproduce such an effect only at the risk of fatal awkwardness....

Another imponderable is how to imitate the 1-2, 1-2-3 [[rhythm]] in which five-[[syllable]] lines in classical Chinese poems normally are read.  Chinese characters are pronounced in one syllable apiece, so producing such rhythms in Chinese is not hard and the results are unobtrusive; but any imitation in a Western language is almost inevitably stilted and distracting.  Even less translatable are the patterns of [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] arrangement in classical Chinese poetry.  Each syllable (character) belongs to one of two categories determined by the [[pitch contour]] in which it is read; in a classical Chinese poem the patterns of alternation of the two categories exhibit [[Parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and mirroring.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 49"&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Once the [[untranslatability|untranslatables]] have been set aside, the problems for a translator, especially of Chinese poetry, are two:  What does the translator think the poetic line says?  And once he thinks he understands it, how can he render it into the [[Target language (translation)|target language]]?  Most of the difficulties, according to Link, arise in addressing the second problem, "where the impossibility of perfect answers spawns endless debate."  Almost always at the center is the letter-versus-spirit [[dilemma]].  At the [[literal translation|literalist]] extreme, efforts are made to dissect every conceivable detail about the language of the original Chinese poem.  "The dissection, though," writes Link, "normally does to the art of a poem approximately what the [[scalpel]] of an [[anatomy]] instructor does to the life of a frog."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 49"/&gt;

Chinese characters, in avoiding [[grammar|grammatical]] specificity, offer advantages to poets (and, simultaneously, challenges to poetry translators) that are associated primarily with absences of [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical tense|tense]].&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the norm in classical Chinese poetry, and common even in modern Chinese prose, to omit [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]]; the reader or listener infers a subject.  Some Western languages, however, ask by grammatical rule that subjects always be stated.  Most of the translators cited in Eliot Weinberger's ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]]'' supply a subject.  Weinberger points out, however, that when an "I" as a subject is inserted, a "controlling individual mind of the poet" enters and destroys the effect of the Chinese line.  Without a subject, he writes, "the experience becomes both universal and immediate to the reader."  Another approach to the subjectlessness is to use the target language's [[passive voice]]; but this again particularizes the experience too much.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

[[Noun]]s have no [[Grammatical number|number]] in Chinese.  "If," writes Link, "you want to talk in Chinese about one rose, you may, but then you use a "[[measure word]]" to say "one blossom-of roseness."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

Chinese [[verb]]s are [[grammatical tense|tense]]-less:  there are several ways to specify when something happened or will happen, but [[verb tense]] is not one of them.  For poets, this creates the great advantage of [[ambiguity]].  According to Link, Weinberger's insight about subjectlessness—that it produces an effect "both universal and immediate"—applies to timelessness as well.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

Link proposes a kind of uncertainty principle that may be applicable not only to translation from the Chinese language, but to all translation:

{{blockquote|Dilemmas about translation do not have definitive right answers (although there can be unambiguously wrong ones if misreadings of the original are involved).  Any translation (except machine translation, a different case) must pass through the mind of a translator, and that mind inevitably contains its own store of perceptions, memories, and values.

[[Eliot Weinberger|Weinberger]] [...] pushes this insight further when he writes that "every reading of every poem, regardless of language, is an act of translation:  translation into the reader's intellectual and emotional life."  Then he goes still further:  because a reader's mental life shifts over time, there is a sense in which "the same poem cannot be read twice."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;}}

====Islamic world====
Translation of material into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] expanded after the creation of [[Arabic script]] in the 5th century, and gained great importance with the rise of [[Islam]] and Islamic empires. Arab translation initially focused primarily on politics, rendering Persian, Greek, even Chinese and Indic diplomatic materials into Arabic. It later focused on translating classical Greek and Persian works, as well as some Chinese and Indian texts, into Arabic for scholarly study at major Islamic learning centers, such as the [[Madrasah of Al-Karaouine|Al-Karaouine]] ([[Fes]], [[Morocco]]), [[Al-Azhar Madrasah|Al-Azhar]] ([[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]), and the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]]. In terms of theory, Arabic translation drew heavily on earlier Near Eastern traditions as well as more contemporary Greek and Persian traditions.

Arabic translation efforts and techniques are important to Western translation traditions due to centuries of close contacts and exchanges.  Especially after the [[Renaissance]], Europeans began more intensive study of Arabic and Persian translations of classical works as well as scientific and philosophical works of Arab and oriental origins.  Arabic and, to a lesser degree, Persian became important sources of material and perhaps of techniques for revitalized Western traditions, which in time would overtake the Islamic and oriental traditions.

In the 19th century, after the [[Middle East]]'s [[Islam]]ic clerics and copyists
{{blockquote|had conceded defeat in their centuries-old battle to contain the corrupting effects of the [[printing press]], [an] explosion in publishing... ensued.  Along with expanding secular education, printing transformed an overwhelmingly illiterate society into a partly literate one.

In the past, the [[sheikh]]s and the government had exercised a monopoly over knowledge.  Now an expanding elite benefitted from a stream of information on virtually anything that interested them.  Between 1880 and 1908... more than six hundred newspapers and periodicals were founded in Egypt alone.

The most prominent among them was ''al-Muqtataf''...  [It] was the popular expression of a '''translation movement''' that had begun earlier in the century with military and medical manuals and highlights from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] canon.  ([[Montesquieu]]'s ''Considerations on the Romans'' and [[Fénelon]]'s ''Telemachus'' had been favorites.)&lt;ref name = debellaigue77&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950'', University of Chicago Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A translator who contributed mightily to the advance of the Islamic Enlightenment was the Egyptian cleric Rifaa al-Tahtawi (1801–73), who had spent five years in Paris in the late 1820s, teaching religion to Muslim students.  After returning to Cairo with the encouragement of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1769–1849), the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] viceroy of Egypt, al–Tahtawi became head of the new school of languages and embarked on an intellectual revolution by initiating a program to translate some two thousand European and Turkish volumes, ranging from ancient texts on geography and geometry to [[Voltaire]]'s biography of [[Peter the Great]], along with the ''[[Marseillaise]]'' and the entire ''[[Code Napoléon]]''.  This was the biggest, most meaningful importation of foreign thought into Arabic since [[Abbasid]] times (750–1258).&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], "The Islamic Road to the Modern World" (review of [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], ''The Islamic Enlightenment:  The Struggle between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times'', Liveright; and Wael Abu-'Uksa, ''Freedom in the Arab World:  Concepts and Ideologies in Arabic Thought in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 11 (22 June 2017), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|In France al-Tahtawi had been struck by the way the [[French language|French]] language... was constantly renewing itself to fit modern ways of living.  Yet [[Arabic]] has its own sources of reinvention.  The root system that Arabic shares with other [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] tongues such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is capable of expanding the meanings of words using structured [[consonant]]al variations:  the word for airplane, for example, has the same root as the word for bird.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], "The Islamic Road to the Modern World" (review of [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], ''The Islamic Enlightenment:  The Struggle between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times'', Liveright; and Wael Abu-'Uksa, ''Freedom in the Arab World:  Concepts and Ideologies in Arabic Thought in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

[[File:Muhammad Abduh (trimmed).JPG|thumb|140px|[[Muhammad Abduh]]]]
The movement to translate English and European texts transformed the Arabic and [[Ottoman Turkey|Ottoman]] [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages, and new words, simplified [[syntax]], and directness came to be valued over the previous convolutions.  Educated Arabs and Turks in the new professions and the modernized [[civil service]] expressed [[skepticism]], writes [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "with a freedom that is rarely witnessed today....  No longer was legitimate knowledge defined by texts in the religious schools, interpreted for the most part with stultifying literalness.  It had come to include virtually any intellectual production anywhere in the world."  One of the [[neologisms]] that, in a way, came to characterize the infusion of new ideas via translation was ''"darwiniya"'', or "[[Darwinism]]".&lt;ref name = debellaigue77/&gt;

One of the most influential liberal Islamic thinkers of the time was [[Muhammad Abduh]] (1849–1905), Egypt's senior judicial authority—its chief [[mufti]]—at the turn of the 20th century and an admirer of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] who in 1903 visited Darwin's exponent [[Herbert Spencer]] at his home in [[Brighton]].  Spencer's view of [[social organism|society as an organism]] with its own laws of evolution paralleled Abduh's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], when Britain and France divided up the Middle East's countries, apart from Turkey, between them, pursuant to the [[Sykes-Picot agreement]]—in violation of solemn wartime promises of postwar Arab autonomy—there came an immediate reaction:  the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] emerged in Egypt, the [[House of Saud]] took over the [[Hijaz]], and regimes led by army officers came to power in [[Iran]] and Turkey.  "[B]oth illiberal currents of the modern Middle East," writes [[Christopher de Bellaigue|de Bellaigue]], "Islamism and militarism, received a major impetus from Western [[Imperialism|empire-builders]]."  As often happens in countries undergoing social crisis, the aspirations of the Muslim world's translators and modernizers, such as Muhammad Abduh, largely had to yield to retrograde currents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

==Fidelity and transparency&lt;!--linked from 'Friedrich Schleiermacher'--&gt;==
[[File:John Dryden by John Michael Wright, 1668 (detail), National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|right|175px|[[John Dryden|Dryden]]]]
[[Fidelity]] (or "faithfulness") and felicity&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; (or [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]]), dual ideals in translation, are often (though not always) at odds. A 17th-century French critic coined the phrase "{{lang|fr|les belles infidèles}}" to suggest that translations, like women, can be either faithful or beautiful, but not both.{{efn|French philosopher and writer [[Gilles Ménage]] (1613-92) commented on translations by humanist Perrot Nicolas d'Ablancourt (1606-64):  "They remind me of a woman whom I greatly loved in [[Tours]], who was beautiful but unfaithful."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Amparo Hurtado Albir, ''La notion de fidélité en traduction'' (The Idea of Fidelity in Translation), Paris, Didier Érudition, 1990, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  [[Fidelity]] is the extent to which a translation accurately renders the meaning of the [[source text]], without distortion.[[Transparency (linguistic)|Transparency]] is the extent to which a translation appears to a native speaker of the target language to have originally been written in that language, and conforms to its grammar, syntax and idiom. [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700) wrote in his preface to the translation anthology ''Sylvae'':
{{blockquote|Where I have taken away some of [the original authors'] Expressions, and cut them shorter, it may possibly be on this consideration, that what was beautiful in the Greek or Latin, would not appear so shining in the English; and where I have enlarg'd them, I desire the false Criticks would not always think that those thoughts are wholly mine, but that either they are secretly in the Poet, or may be fairly deduc'd from him; or at least, if both those considerations should fail, that my own is of a piece with his, and that if he were living, and an Englishman, they are such as he wou'd probably have written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dryden|first1=John|title=Preface to Sylvae|url=http://www.bartleby.com/204/180.html|website=Bartelby.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A translation that meets the criterion of fidelity (faithfulness) is said to be "faithful"; a translation that meets the criterion of transparency, "[[idiomatic]]".  Depending on the given translation, the two qualities may not be mutually exclusive.  The criteria for judging the [[fidelity]] of a translation vary according to the subject, type and use of the text, its literary qualities, its social or historical context, etc.  The criteria for judging the [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]] of a translation appear more straightforward: an unidiomatic translation "sounds wrong"; and, in the extreme case of [[literal translation|word-for-word translations]] generated by many [[machine translation|machine-translation]] systems, often results in patent nonsense.
[[File:Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]]]]  
Nevertheless, in certain contexts a translator may consciously seek to produce a [[literal translation]]. Translators of [[literary]], [[religious]], or [[historic]] texts often adhere as closely as possible to the source text, stretching the limits of the target language to produce an unidiomatic text.  Also, a translator may adopt expressions from the source language in order to provide "local color".
[[File:Lawrence Venuti.jpeg|thumb|90px|[[Lawrence Venuti|Venuti]]]]
While current Western translation practice is dominated by the dual concepts of "fidelity" and "transparency", this has not always been the case.  There have been periods, especially in pre-Classical Rome and in the 18th century, when many translators stepped beyond the bounds of translation proper into the realm of ''[[adaptation]]''.  [[Adapted translation]] retains currency in some non-Western traditions. The [[India]]n epic, the ''[[Ramayana]]'', appears in many versions in the various [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], and the stories are different in each.  Similar examples are to be found in [[medieval Christianity|medieval Christian]] literature, which adjusted the text to local customs and mores.

Many non-transparent-translation theories draw on concepts from [[German Romanticism]], the most obvious influence being the German theologian and philosopher [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]. In his seminal lecture "On the Different Methods of Translation" (1813) he distinguished between translation methods that move "the writer toward [the reader]", i.e., [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]], and those that move the "reader toward [the author]", i.e., an extreme [[fidelity]] to the foreignness of the [[source text]]. Schleiermacher favored the latter approach; he was motivated, however, not so much by a desire to embrace the foreign, as by a nationalist desire to oppose France's cultural domination and to promote [[German literature]].

In recent decades, prominent advocates of such "non-transparent" translation have included the French scholar [[Antoine Berman]], who identified twelve deforming tendencies inherent in most prose translations,&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoine Berman]], ''L'épreuve de l'étranger'', 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and the American theorist [[Lawrence Venuti]], who has called on translators to apply "foreignizing" rather than domesticating translation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Venuti]], "Call to Action", in ''The Translator's Invisibility'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equivalence===
{{main|Dynamic and formal equivalence}}
The question of [[fidelity]] vs. [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]] has also been formulated in terms of, respectively, "''formal'' equivalence" and "''dynamic'' [or ''functional''] equivalence" – expressions associated with the translator [[Eugene Nida]] and originally coined to describe ways of translating the ''[[Bible]]''; but the two approaches are applicable to any translation.  "Formal equivalence" corresponds to "[[metaphrase]]", and "dynamic equivalence" to "[[paraphrase]]".  "Formal equivalence" (sought via [[literal translation|"literal" translation]]) attempts to render the text literally, or "word for word" (the latter expression being itself a word-for-word rendering of the [[classical Latin]] {{lang|la|verbum pro verbo}}) – if necessary, at the expense of features natural to the target language.  By contrast, "dynamic equivalence" (or "''functional'' equivalence") conveys the essential thoughts expressed in a source text—if necessary, at the expense of [[literal translation|literality]], original [[sememe]] and [[word order]], the source text's active vs. passive [[voice (grammar)|voice]], etc. 
 
There is, however, no sharp boundary between formal and functional equivalence. On the contrary, they represent a spectrum of translation approaches. Each is used at various times and in various contexts by the same translator, and at various points within the same text – sometimes simultaneously. Competent translation entails the judicious blending of formal and functional [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", pp. 83-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common pitfalls in translation, especially when practiced by inexperienced translators, involve false equivalents such as "[[false friend]]s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog-english.jrlanguage.com/overcome-5-challenges-of-english-to-spanish-translation/|title=How to Overcome These 5 Challenges of English to Spanish Translation|date=23 June 2017|publisher=Jr Language|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[false cognate]]s.

===Back-translation===
A "back-translation" is a translation of a translated text back into the language of the original text, made without reference to the original text. 
Comparison of a back-translation with the original text is sometimes used as a check on the accuracy of the original translation, much as the accuracy of a mathematical operation is sometimes checked by reversing the operation.  But the results of such reverse-translation operations, while useful as approximate checks, are not always precisely reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.atc.org.uk/winter2004.pdf |title=Back Translation: Same questions – different continent |journal=Communicate |issue=Winter 2004 |page=5 |last=Crystal |first=Scott |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520035802/http://www.atc.org.uk/winter2004.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Back-translation must in general be less accurate than back-calculation because [[linguistic]] symbols ([[word]]s) are often [[ambiguous]], whereas mathematical symbols are intentionally unequivocal.  In the context of [[machine translation]], a back-translation is also called a "round-trip translation."  When translations are produced of material used in medical [[clinical trial]]s, such as [[informed consent|informed-consent forms]], a back-translation is often required by the [[Ethics Committee (European Union)|ethics committee]] or [[institutional review board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gts-translation.com/medicaltranslationpaper.pdf |title=Back Translation for Quality Control of Informed Consent Forms |journal=Journal of Clinical Research Best Practices |format=PDF |accessdate=1 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505141653/http://www.gts-translation.com/medicaltranslationpaper.pdf |archivedate=5 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mark Twain, Brady-Handy photo portrait, Feb 7, 1871, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|80px|[[Mark Twain]], back-translator]]
[[Mark Twain]] provided humorously telling evidence for the frequent unreliability of back-translation when he issued his own back-translation of a French translation of his [[short story]], "[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]".  He published his back-translation in a 1903 volume together with his English-language original, the French translation, and a "Private History of the 'Jumping Frog' Story". The latter included a synopsized adaptation of his story that Twain stated had appeared, unattributed to Twain, in a Professor Sidgwick's ''Greek Prose Composition'' (p.&amp;nbsp;116) under the title, "The Athenian and the Frog"; the adaptation had for a time been taken for an independent [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] precursor to Twain's "Jumping Frog" story.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=ld_3LPm8FKkC&amp;dq=french+The+Jumping+Frog&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=4trjrMcmq3&amp;sig=P23kCS1s9qiu-1hdnJSzWWKvIJc&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA66,M1 [[Mark Twain]], ''[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County|The Jumping Frog]]: In English, Then in French, and Then Clawed Back into a Civilized Language Once More by Patient, Unremunerated Toil'', illustrated by F. Strothman, New York and London, Harper &amp; Brothers, Publishers, MCMIII [1903&amp;#93;].&lt;/ref&gt;

When a document survives only in translation, the original having been lost, researchers sometimes undertake back-translation in an effort to reconstruct the original text. An example involves the novel ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa|The Saragossa Manuscript]]'' by the Polish aristocrat [[Jan Potocki]] (1761–1815), who wrote the novel in French and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 1813–14. Portions of the original French-language manuscript were subsequently lost; however, the missing fragments survived in a Polish translation that was made by [[Edmund Chojecki]] in 1847 from a complete French copy, now lost. French-language versions of the complete ''Saragossa Manuscript'' have since been produced, based on extant French-language fragments and on French-language versions that have been back-translated from Chojecki's Polish version.&lt;ref&gt;[[Czesław Miłosz]], ''The History of Polish Literature'', pp. 193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many works by the influential [[classical antiquity|Classical]] physician [[Galen]] survive only in medieval [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation. Some survive only in [[Renaissance Latin]] translations from the Arabic, thus at a second remove from the original. To better understand Galen, scholars have attempted back-translation of such works in order to reconstruct the original [[ancient Greek|Greek]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

When historians suspect that a document is actually a translation from another language, back-translation into that hypothetical original language can provide supporting evidence by showing that such characteristics as [[idiom]]s, [[pun]]s, peculiar [[grammar|grammatical]] structures, etc., are in fact derived from the original language.  For example, the known text of the ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'' folk tales is in [[High German]] but contains puns that work only when back-translated to [[Low German]].  This seems clear evidence that these tales (or at least large portions of them) were originally written in Low German and translated into High German by an over-metaphrastic translator.

Supporters of [[Aramaic primacy]]—of the view that the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[New Testament]] or its sources were originally written in the [[Aramaic language]]—seek to prove their case by showing that difficult passages in the existing [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text of the New Testament make much better sense when back-translated to [[Aramaic]]: that, for example, some incomprehensible references are in fact Aramaic puns that do not work in Greek.  Due to similar indications, it is believed that the 2nd century Gnostic [[Gospel of Judas]], which survives only in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], was originally written in [[Greek language|Greek]].

[[John Dryden]] (1631–1700), the dominant English-language literary figure of his age, illustrates, in his use of back-translation, translators' influence on the evolution of languages and literary styles.  Dryden is believed to be the first person to posit that English sentences should not end in [[preposition]]s because Latin sentences cannot end in prepositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/data/B_HIST_EU.html Gilman, E.

Pullum, 2002, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press, p. 627f.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dryden often translated his writing into [[Latin]], to check whether his writing was concise and elegant, Latin being considered an elegant and long-lived language with which to compare; then he back-translated his writing back to English according to Latin-grammar usage. As Latin does not have sentences ending in prepositions, Dryden may have applied Latin grammar to English, thus forming the controversial rule of no sentence-ending prepositions, subsequently adopted by other writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=word+by+word+kory+stamper#v=onepage&amp;q=word%20by%20word%20kory%20stamper&amp;f=false|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=47|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Cf. a supposed comment by [[Winston Churchill]]:  "This is the type of pedantry up with which I will not put."}}

== Translators ==
Competent translators show the following attributes:
*a ''very good'' knowledge of the language, written and spoken, ''from which'' they are translating (the [[Source language (translation)|source language]]);
*an ''excellent'' command of the language ''into which'' they are translating (the [[Target language (translation)|target language]]);
*familiarity with the subject matter of the text being translated;
*a profound understanding of the [[etymological]] and [[idiomatic]] correlates between the two languages, including [[Register (sociolinguistics)|sociolinguistic register]] when appropriate; and
*a finely tuned sense of when to ''[[metaphrase]]'' ([[literal translation|"translate literally]]") and when to ''[[paraphrase]]'', so as to assure true rather than spurious ''[[Translation#Equivalence|equivalents]]'' between the source- and target-language texts.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and Curtin's Translation," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXI, nos. 2–3 (1986), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

A competent translator is not only [[bilingual]] but [[bicultural]].  A [[language]] is not merely a collection of [[word]]s and of rules of [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] for generating [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, but also a vast interconnecting system of [[connotation]]s and [[culture|cultural]] references whose mastery, writes [[linguist]] [[Mario Pei]], "comes close to being a lifetime job."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mario Pei]], ''The Story of Language'', p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;  The complexity of the translator's task cannot be overstated; one author suggests that becoming an accomplished translator—after having already acquired a good basic knowledge of both languages and cultures—may require a minimum of ten years' experience.  Viewed in this light, it is a serious misconception to assume that a person who has fair fluency in two languages will, by virtue of that fact alone, be consistently competent to translate between them.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 86"/&gt;

The translator's role in relation to a text has been compared to that of an artist, e.g., a musician or actor, who interprets a work of art.  Translation, like other human activities,&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt]], "Can We Ever Master King Lear?", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 3 (February 23, 2017), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; entails making choices, and choice implies interpretation.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"/&gt;{{efn|"Interpretation" in this sense is to be distinguished from the function of an "[[Translation#Interpreting|"interpreter"]] who translates orally or by the use of [[sign language]].}}  [[Mark Polizzotti]] writes:  "A good translation offers not a reproduction of the work but an interpretation, a re-representation, just as the performance of a [[Play (theatre)|play]] or a [[sonata]] is a representation of the [[Play (theatre)|script]] or the [[Sheet music|score]], one among many possible representations."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Polizzotti]], quoted in [[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The English-language novelist [[Joseph Conrad]], whose writings [[Zdzisław Najder]] has described as verging on "auto-translation" from Conrad's Polish and French linguistic personae,&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. IX.&lt;/ref&gt; advised his niece and [[Polish language|Polish]] translator [[Aniela Zagórska]]:  "[D]on't trouble to be too scrupulous...  I may tell you (in French) that in my opinion ''il vaut mieux interpréter que traduire'' [it is better to interpret than to translate]....  ''Il s'agit donc de trouver les équivalents.  Et là, ma chère, je vous prie laissez vous guider plutôt par votre tempérament que par une conscience sévère....'' [It is, then, a question of finding the equivalent expressions.  And there, my dear, I beg you to let yourself be guided more by your temperament than by a strict conscience....]"&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conrad advised another translator that the prime requisite for a good translation is that it be "idiomatic".  "For in the [[idiom]] is the ''clearness'' of a language and the language's force and its picturesqueness—by which last I mean the picture-producing power of arranged words."&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conrad thought [[C.K. Scott Moncrieff]]'s English translation of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''À la recherche du temps perdu'' (''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''—or, in Scott Moncrieff's rendering, ''Remembrance of Things Past'') to be preferable to the French original.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaiser, "A Hero of Translation" (a review of Jean Findlay, ''Chasing Lost Time:  The Life of [[C.K. Scott Moncrieff]]:  Soldier, Spy, and Translator''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|See "[[Translation#Poetry|Poetry]]", below, for a similar observation concerning the occasional superiority of the translation over the original.}}

The necessity of making [[choice]]s, and therefore of interpretation, in translating{{efn|[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]] writes that "translation always involves interpretation, and [requires] every translator... to think as deeply as humanly possible about each verbal, poetic, and interpretative [[choice]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]], "A Doggish Translation" (review of ''The Poems of [[Hesiod]]:  Theogony, Works and Days, and The Shield of Herakles'', translated from the Greek by [[Barry B. Powell]], [[University of California Press]], 2017, 184 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXV, no. 1 (18 January 2018), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}} (and in other fields of human endeavor) stems from the [[ambiguity]] that subjectively pervades the [[universe]].  Part of the ambiguity, for a translator, involves the structure of human [[language]]. [[Psychology|Psychologist]] and [[neural science|neural scientist]] [[Gary Marcus]] notes that "virtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways.  Our brain is so good at comprehending language that we do not usually notice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of linguistic ambiguity is the "pronoun disambiguation problem" ("PDP"):  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such disambiguation is not infallible by a human, either.

Ambiguity is a concern to both translators and, as the writings of poet and literary critic [[William Empson]] have demonstrated, to [[literary criticism|literary critics]].  Ambiguity may be desirable, indeed essential, in [[poetry]] and [[diplomacy]]; it can be more problematic in ordinary [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bromwich]], "In Praise of Ambiguity" (a review of [[Michael Wood (academic)|Michael Wood]], ''On Empson'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''), vol. LXIV, no. 16 (26 October 2017), pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

A translator is faced with two contradictory tasks:  when translating, he must strive for [[omniscience]]; when reviewing his translation, he must assume (the naive reader's) [[ignorance]]. 

A translator may render only parts of the original text, provided he indicates that this is what he is doing.  But a translator should not assume the role of [[Censorship|censor]] and surreptitiously delete or [[bowdlerize]] passages merely to please a political or moral interest.&lt;ref name="Billiani, Francesca 2001"&gt;Billiani, Francesca (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Translating has served as a school of writing for many an author, much as the copying of masterworks of [[painting]] has schooled many a novice painter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anka Muhlstein]], "Painters and Writers:  When Something New Happens", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 1 (January 19, 2017), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  A translator who can competently render an author's thoughts into the translator's own language, should certainly be able to adequately render, in his own language, any thoughts of his own.  Translating (like [[analytic philosophy]]) compels precise analysis of [[language|language element]]s and of their usage.  In 1946 the poet [[Ezra Pound]], then at [[St. Elizabeth's Hospital]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], advised a visitor, the 18-year-old beginning poet [[W.S. Merwin]]:  "The work of translation is the best teacher you'll ever have."&lt;ref&gt;''[[W.S. Merwin: To Plant a Tree]]'':  one-hour documentary shown on [[PBS]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Elsewhere Merwin recalls Pound saying:  "[A]t your age you don't have anything to write about.  You may think you do, but you don't.  So get to work translating.  The [[Occitan language|Provençal]] is the real source...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ange Mlinko]], "Whole Earth Troubador" (review of ''The Essential W.S. Merlin'', edited by [[Michael Wiegers]], Copper Canyon, 338 pp., 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 19 (7 December 2017), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Merwin, translator-poet who took Pound's advice to heart, writes of translation as an "impossible, unfinishable" art.&lt;ref&gt;Merwin's introduction to his 2013 ''Selected Translations'', quoted by [[Ange Mlinko]], "Whole Earth Troubador" (review of ''The Essential W.S.

Translators, including monks who spread [[Buddhist]] texts in [[East Asia]], and the early modern European translators of the [[Bible]], in the course of their work have shaped the very [[language]]s into which they have translated. They have acted as bridges for conveying knowledge between [[culture]]s; and along with ideas, they have imported from the source languages, into their own languages, [[loanword]]s and [[calque]]s of [[grammar|grammatical structures]], [[idiom]]s, and [[vocabulary]].

===Interpreting===

{{Main|Interpreting}}
[[Interpreting]], or "interpretation," is the facilitation of [[speech communication|oral]] or [[sign language|sign-language]] [[communication]], either simultaneously or consecutively, between two, or among three or more, speakers who are not speaking, or signing, the same language.  The term "interpreting," rather than "interpretation," is preferentially used for this activity by [[English language|Anglophone]] translators, to avoid confusion with other meanings of the word "[[wikt:interpret|interpretation]]."  Unlike English, many languages do not employ two separate words to denote the activities of [[writing|written]] and live-communication ([[speech communication|oral]] or [[sign language|sign-language]]) translators.{{efn|For example, in [[Polish language|Polish]], a "translation" is "{{lang|pl|przekład}}" or "{{lang|pl|tłumaczenie}}." Both "translator" and "interpreter" are "{{lang|pl|tłumacz}}." For a time in the 18th century, however, for "translator," some writers used a word, "{{lang|pl|przekładowca}}," that is no longer in use.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Balcerzan]], {{lang|pl|Pisarze polscy o sztuce przekładu, 1440–1974: Antologia}} (Polish Writers on the Art of Translation, 1440–1974: an Anthology), 1977, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Even English does not always make the distinction, frequently using "translating" as a synonym for "interpreting."

Interpreters have sometimes played crucial roles in [[History of the world|history]].  A prime example is [[La Malinche]], also known as ''Malintzin'', ''Malinalli'' and ''Doña Marina'', an early-16th-century [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] woman from the Mexican [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]].  As a child she had been sold or given to [[Maya peoples|Maya]] slave-traders from Xicalango, and thus had become bilingual. Subsequently, given along with other women to the invading Spaniards, she became instrumental in the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest of [[Mexico]], acting as interpreter, adviser, intermediary and lover to [[Hernán Cortés]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''Conquest: Montezuma, Cortes and the Fall of Old Mexico'', New York, Simon and Schuster, 1993, pp. 171-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly three centuries later, in the [[United States]], a comparable role as interpreter was played for the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] of 1804–6 by [[Sacagawea]]. As a child, the [[Lemhi Shoshone]] woman had been kidnapped by [[Hidatsa]] Indians and thus had become bilingual.  Sacagawea facilitated the expedition's traverse of the [[North American continent]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sacagawea", ''[[The Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, volume 24, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sworn translation===
[[Translating for legal equivalence|Sworn translation]], also called "certified translation," aims at legal equivalence between two documents written in different languages. It is performed by someone authorized to do so by local regulations. Some countries recognize declared competence. Others require the translator to be an official state appointee. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, translators must be accredited by certain translation institutes or associations in order to be able to carry out certified translations.

===Telephone===
Many commercial services exist that will interpret spoken language via telephone.  There is also at least one custom-built mobile device that does the same thing. The device connects users to human interpreters who can translate between English and 180 other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/06/27/186525030/translation-please-hand-held-device-bridges-language-gap |title=Translation, Please: Hand-Held Device Bridges Language Gap |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
Web-based human translation is generally favored by companies and individuals that wish to secure more accurate translations. In view of the frequent inaccuracy of machine translations, human translation remains the most reliable, most accurate form of translation available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/15582327?story_id=15582327&amp;source=hptextfeature | work=The Economist | title=The many voices of the web | date=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the recent emergence of translation [[crowdsourcing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Graham |first=Paul |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/04/mechanical-turkish-ackuna |title=How Ackuna wants to fix language translation by crowdsourcing it &amp;#124; Wired UK |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517232045/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/04/mechanical-turkish-ackuna |archive-date=2012-05-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.benzinga.com/press-releases/11/02/p843476/translation-services-usas-crowdsourcing-translator-ackuna-com-raises-th |title=Translation Services USA's Crowdsourcing Translator, Ackuna.com, Raises the Bar for More Accurate Machine Translations |publisher=Benzinga |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Translation memory|translation-memory]] techniques, and [[internet]] applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/346412 |title=Translation Cloud Application for Facebook Releases Version 2.0 |publisher=Digital Journal |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; translation agencies have been able to provide on-demand human-translation services to [[Small and medium businesses|business]]es, individuals, and enterprises.

===Computer assist===
{{Main|Computer-assisted translation}}
Computer-assisted translation (CAT), also called "computer-aided translation," "machine-aided human translation" (MAHT) and "interactive translation," is a form of translation wherein a human translator creates a [[target text]] with the assistance of a computer program. The machine supports a human translator.

Computer-assisted translation can include standard [[dictionary]] and grammar software. The term, however, normally refers to a range of specialized programs available to the translator, including [[translation memory|translation-memory]], [[terminology|terminology-management]], [[concordancer|concordance]], and alignment programs.

These tools speed up and facilitate human translation, but they do not provide translation.  The latter is a function of tools known broadly as machine translation.

==Machine translation==
{{Main|Machine translation}}
Machine translation (MT) is a process whereby a computer program analyzes a [[source text]] and, in principle, produces a target text without human intervention. In reality, however, machine translation typically does involve human intervention, in the form of pre-editing and [[post-editing]].&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;See the [https://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/ annually performed NIST tests since 2001] and [[Bilingual Evaluation Understudy]]&lt;/ref&gt;  With proper [[terminology|terminology work]], with preparation of the [[source text]] for machine translation (pre-editing), and with reworking of the machine translation by a human translator (post-editing), commercial machine-translation tools can produce useful results, especially if the machine-translation system is integrated with a [[translation memory|translation-memory]] or [[Globalization Management System|globalization-management system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Unedited machine translation is publicly available through tools on the [[Internet]] such as [[Google Translate]], [[Babel Fish (website)|Babel Fish]], [[Babylon translator|Babylon]], and [[StarDict]]. These produce rough translations that, under favorable circumstances, "give the gist" of the source text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://blog.ititranslates.com/why-translation-services-are-more-beneficial-than-machined-translation-programs|title=Why Professional Translators Are More Beneficial Than Google Translate|last=Choquette|first=Brandon|date=January 2016|journal=Interpreter and Translators, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the Internet, translation software can help non-native-speaking individuals understand web pages published in other languages. Whole-page-translation tools are of limited utility, however, since they offer only a limited potential understanding of the original author's intent and context; translated pages tend to be more erroneously humorous and confusing than enlightening.

Interactive translations with [[Pop-up ad|pop-up windows]] are becoming more popular. These tools show one or more possible equivalents for each word or phrase. Human operators merely need to select the likeliest equivalent as the mouse glides over the foreign-language text. Possible equivalents can be grouped by pronunciation.  Also, companies such as [[Ectaco]] produce pocket devices that provide machine translations.
[[File:Claude Piron.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Claude Piron]]]]
Relying exclusively on unedited machine translation, however, ignores the fact that communication in [[natural language|human language]] is [[wikt:context|context]]-embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability. It is certainly true that even purely human-generated translations are prone to error; therefore, to ensure that a machine-generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable-quality translation is achieved, such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human.{{efn|J.M. Cohen observes: "Scientific translation is the aim of an age that would reduce all activities to [[Technology|techniques]]. It is impossible however to imagine a literary-translation machine less complex than the human brain itself, with all its knowledge, reading, and discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, "Translation", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, vol. 27, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  [[Claude Piron]] writes that machine translation, at its best, automates the easier part of a translator's job; the harder and more time-consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve [[ambiguity|ambiguities]] in the [[source text]], which the [[grammatical]] and [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] exigencies of the target language require to be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Piron]], ''Le défi des langues'' (The Language Challenge), Paris, L'Harmattan, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Such research is a necessary prelude to the pre-editing necessary in order to provide input for machine-translation software, such that the output will not be [[garbage in garbage out|meaningless]].&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;

The weaknesses of pure [[machine translation]], unaided by human expertise, are [[Logology (science of science)#Artificial intelligence|those of artificial intelligence itself]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish [[artificial intelligence]] from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), pp. 58–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Translator Mark Polizzotti holds that machine translation, by [[Google Translate]] and the like, is unlikely to threaten human translators anytime soon, because machines will never grasp nuance and [[connotation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Wilson, Emily]], "The Pleasures of Translation" (review of Mark Polizzotti, ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', MIT Press, 2018, 182 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXV, no. 9 (24 May 2018), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary translation==
Translation of [[literature|literary works]] ([[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], [[theatre|plays]], [[poetry|poems]], etc.) is considered a literary pursuit in its own right. Notable in [[Canadian literature]] ''specifically'' as translators are figures such as [[Sheila Fischman]], [[Robert Dickson (writer)|Robert Dickson]], and [[Linda Gaboriau]]; and the Canadian [[Governor General's Awards]] annually present prizes for the best English-to-French and French-to-English literary translations.

Other writers, among many who have made a name for themselves as literary translators, include [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], [[Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Robert Stiller]], [[Lydia Davis]], [[Haruki Murakami]], [[Achy Obejas]], and [[Jhumpa Lahiri]].

In the 2010s a substantial gender imbalance was noted in literary translation into English,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/dispatches/article/where-are-the-women-in-translation|title=Where Are the Women in Translation?|last=Anderson|first=Alison|date=May 14, 2013|website=Words Without Borders|access-date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with far more male writers being translated than women writers. In 2014 Meytal Radzinski launched the ''Women in Translation'' campaign to address this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://literarytranslators.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/women-in-translation-an-interview-witth-meytal-radzinski/|title=Women in Translation: An Interview with Meytal Radzinski|date=25 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/tags-bookseller/meytal-radzinski|title=Meytal Radzinski - The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblibio.blogspot.com/2018/07/exclusion-is-choice-bias-in-best-of.html|title=Biblibio: Exclusion is a choice - Bias in "Best of" lists|first=Meytal|last=Radzinski|date=3 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The first important translation in the West was that of the [[Septuagint]], a collection of [[Jew]]ish Scriptures translated into early [[Koine Greek]] in [[Alexandria]] between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE. The dispersed [[Jew]]s had forgotten their ancestral language and needed Greek versions (translations) of their Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], [[Latin]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the western learned world. The 9th-century [[Alfred the Great]], king of [[Wessex]] in [[England]], was far ahead of his time in commissioning [[vernacular]] [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] translations of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'' and [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]''. Meanwhile, the [[Christian Church]] frowned on even partial adaptations of [[St. Jerome]]'s ''[[Vulgate Bible|Vulgate]]'' of c. 384 CE,&lt;ref&gt;J.M Cohen, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; the standard [[Latin]] ''[[Bible]]''.

In [[Asia]], the spread of [[Buddhism]] led to large-scale ongoing translation efforts spanning well over a thousand years. The [[Tangut Empire]] was especially efficient in such efforts; exploiting the then newly invented [[block printing]], and with the full support of the government (contemporary sources describe the Emperor and his mother personally contributing to the translation effort, alongside sages of various nationalities), the Tanguts took mere decades to translate volumes that had taken the [[China|Chinese]] centuries to render.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The [[Arabs]] undertook large-scale efforts at translation.  Having conquered the Greek world, they made [[Arabic]] versions of its philosophical and scientific works.  During the [[Middle Ages]], translations of some of these Arabic versions were made into Latin, chiefly at [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Cohen13"&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  King Alfonso X el Sabio (Alphonse the Wise) of Castille in the 13th century promoted this effort by founding a ''Schola Traductorum'' (School of Translation) in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].  There Arabic texts, Hebrew texts, and Latin texts were translated into the other tongues by Muslim, Jewish and Christian scholars, who also argued the merits of their respective religions.  Latin translations of Greek and original Arab works of scholarship and science helped advance European [[Scholasticism]], and thus European science and culture.
[[File:Chaucer Hoccleve.png|thumb|170px|[[Geoffrey Chaucer]]]]
The broad historic trends in Western translation practice may be illustrated on the example of translation into the [[English language]].

The first fine translations into English were made in the 14th century by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who adapted from the [[Italian language|Italian]] of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in his own ''[[Knight's Tale]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''; began a translation of the [[French-language]] ''[[Roman de la Rose]]''; and completed a translation of [[Boethius]] from the [[Latin]]. Chaucer founded an English [[poetry|poetic]] tradition on ''[[Literary adaptation|adaptations]]'' and translations from those earlier-established [[literary language]]s.&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

The first great English translation was the ''[[Wycliffe Bible]]'' (c. 1382), which showed the weaknesses of an underdeveloped English [[prose]]. Only at the end of the 15th century did the great age of English prose translation begin with [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte Darthur]]''—an adaptation of [[Arthurian romance]]s so free that it can, in fact, hardly be called a true translation. The first great [[Tudor period|Tudor]] translations are, accordingly, the ''[[Tyndale Bible|Tyndale New Testament]]'' (1525), which influenced the ''[[Authorized Version]]'' (1611), and [[Lord Berners]]' version of [[Jean Froissart]]'s ''Chronicles'' (1523–25).&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;
[[File:Portrait of Marsilio Ficino at the Duomo Firence 2.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Marsilio Ficino]]]]
Meanwhile, in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], a new period in the history of translation had opened in [[Florence]] with the arrival, at the court of [[Cosimo de' Medici]], of the [[Byzantine]] scholar [[Georgius Gemistus Pletho]] shortly before the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the Turks (1453). A Latin translation of [[Plato]]'s works was undertaken by [[Marsilio Ficino]]. This and [[Erasmus]]' Latin edition of the ''[[New Testament]]'' led to a new attitude to translation. For the first time, readers demanded rigor of rendering, as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the exact words of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

Non-scholarly literature, however, continued to rely on ''adaptation''. [[France]]'s ''[[Pléiade]]'', [[England]]'s [[Tudor period|Tudor]] poets, and the [[Elizabethan]] translators adapted themes by [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Petrarch]] and modern Latin writers, forming a new poetic style on those models. The English poets and translators sought to supply a new public, created by the rise of a [[middle class]] and the development of [[printing]], with works such as the original authors ''would have written'', had they been writing in England in that day.&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

The [[Elizabethan]] period of translation saw considerable progress beyond mere [[paraphrase]] toward an ideal of [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] equivalence, but even to the end of this period, which actually reached to the middle of the 17th century, there was no concern for [[Words|verbal]] [[accuracy]].&lt;ref name=Cohen14&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 17th century, the poet [[John Dryden]] sought to make [[Virgil]] speak "in words such as he would probably have written if he were living and an Englishman". As great as Dryden's poem is, however, one is reading Dryden, and not experiencing the Roman poet's concision. Similarly, [[Homer]] arguably suffers from [[Alexander Pope]]'s endeavor to reduce the Greek poet's "wild paradise" to order. Both works live on as worthy ''English'' epics, more than as a point of access to the Latin or Greek.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;
[[File:Edward FitzGerald.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]]]
Throughout the 18th century, the watchword of translators was ease of reading. Whatever they did not understand in a text, or thought might bore readers, they omitted. They cheerfully assumed that their own style of expression was the best, and that texts should be made to conform to it in translation. For scholarship they cared no more than had their predecessors, and they did not shrink from making translations from translations in third languages, or from languages that they hardly knew, or—as in the case of [[James Macpherson]]'s "translations" of [[Ossian]]—from texts that were actually of the "translator's" own composition.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;
[[File:Benjamin Jowett - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Benjamin Jowett]]]]
The 19th century brought new standards of accuracy and style. In regard to accuracy, observes J.M. Cohen, the policy became "the text, the whole text, and nothing but the text", except for any [[bawdy]] passages and the addition of copious explanatory [[footnote]]s.{{efn|For instance, Henry Benedict Mackey's translation of [[St. Francis de Sales]]'s "[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/desales/love.html Treatise on the Love of God]" consistently omits the saint's analogies comparing God to a nursing mother, references to Bible stories such as the rape of Tamar, and so forth.}} In regard to style, the [[Victorians]]' aim, achieved through far-reaching [[metaphrase]] (literality) or ''pseudo''-metaphrase, was to constantly remind readers that they were reading a ''foreign'' classic. An exception was the outstanding translation in this period, [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]'' of [[Omar Khayyam]] (1859), which achieved its Oriental flavor largely by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes and actually drew little of its material from the Persian original.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;

In advance of the 20th century, a new pattern was set in 1871 by [[Benjamin Jowett]], who translated [[Plato]] into simple, straightforward language. Jowett's example was not followed, however, until well into the new century, when accuracy rather than style became the principal criterion.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;

===Modern translation===
As a language evolves, texts in an earlier version of the language—original texts, or old translations—may become difficult for modern readers to understand. Such a text may therefore be translated into more modern language, producing a "modern translation" (e.g., a "modern English translation" or "modernized translation").

Such modern rendering is applied either to literature from classical languages such as [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]], notably to the [[Bible]] (see "[[Modern English Bible translations]]"), or to literature from an earlier stage of the same language, as with the works of [[William Shakespeare]] (which are largely understandable by a modern audience, though with some difficulty) or with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s Middle English ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' (which is understandable to most modern readers only through heavy dependence on footnotes).

Modern translation is applicable to any language with a long literary history.  For example, in Japanese the 11th-century ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]'' is generally read in modern translation  (see "[[The Tale of Genji#Modern readership|''Genji:'' modern readership]]").

Modern translation often involves literary scholarship and textual revision, as there is frequently not one single canonical text. This is particularly noteworthy in the case of the Bible and Shakespeare, where modern scholarship can result in substantive textual changes.

Modern translation meets with opposition from some traditionalists.  In English, some readers prefer the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the Bible to modern translations, and Shakespeare in the original of c. 1600 to modern translations.

An opposite process involves translating modern literature into classical languages, for the purpose of [[extensive reading]] (for examples, see "[[List of Latin translations of modern literature]]").

===Poetry===
[[File:Hofstadter2002B.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]]]]
[[File:Roman Jakobson.jpg|thumb|65px|[[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson]]]]
[[File:Vladimir Nabokov 1973.jpg|thumb|55px|[[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]]]
Views on the possibility of satisfactorily translating poetry show a broad spectrum, depending largely on the degree of latitude to be granted the translator in regard to a poem's formal features (rhythm, rhyme, verse form, etc.).  [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his 1997 book, ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'', argued that a good translation of a poem must convey as much as possible not only of its literal meaning but also of its form and structure (meter, rhyme or alliteration scheme, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;A discussion of Hofstadter's otherwise latitudinarian views on translation is found in Tony Dokoupil, "[http://www.newsweek.com/id/195684 Translation: Pardon My French: You Suck at This]," ''[[Newsweek]]'', May 18, 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russia]]n-born [[linguist]] and [[semiotician]] [[Roman Jakobson]], however, had in his 1959 paper "[[On Linguistic Aspects of Translation]]", declared that "poetry by definition [is] untranslatable".  [[Vladimir Nabokov]], another Russian-born author, took a view similar to Jakobson's.  He considered rhymed, metrical, versed poetry to be in principle untranslatable and therefore rendered his 1964 English translation of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s [[Eugene Onegin#Into English|''Eugene Onegin'' in prose]].

Hofstadter, in ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'', criticized Nabokov's attitude toward verse translation.  In 1999 Hofstadter published his own translation of ''Eugene Onegin'', in verse form.

Gregory Hays, in the course of discussing [[ancient Rome|Roman]] adapted translations of [[ancient Greek literature]], makes approving reference to some views on the translating of poetry expressed by [[David Bellos]], an accomplished French-to-English translator.  Hays writes:
{{blockquote|Among the ''idées reçues'' [received ideas] skewered by David Bellos is the old saw that "poetry is what gets lost in translation."  The saying is often attributed to [[Robert Frost]], but as Bellos notes, the attribution is as dubious as the idea itself.  A translation is an assemblage of words, and as such it can contain as much or as little poetry as any other such assemblage.  The [[Japanese people|Japanese]] even have a word (''chōyaku'', roughly "hypertranslation") to designate a version that deliberately improves on the original.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Hays, "Found in Translation" (review of [[Denis Feeney]], ''Beyond Greek:  The Beginnings of Latin Literature'', Harvard University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 11 (22 June 2017), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Book titles ===

Book-title translations can be either descriptive or symbolic. Descriptive book titles, for example [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s ''[[Le Petit Prince]]''  (The Little Prince), are meant to be informative, and can name the protagonist, and indicate the theme of the book.  An example of a symbolic book title is [[Stieg Larsson]]'s  ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', whose original Swedish title is ''Män som hatar kvinnor''  (Men Who Hate Women).  Such symbolic book titles usually indicate the theme, issues, or atmosphere of the work.

When translators are working with long book titles, the translated titles are often shorter and indicate the theme of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Levý, ''The Art of Translation'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plays ===

The translation of plays poses many problems such as the added element of actors, speech duration, translation literalness, and the relationship between the arts of drama and acting. Successful play translators are able to create language that allows the actor and the playwright to work together effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Harry G.

=== Chinese literature ===
In translating Chinese literature, translators struggle to find true fidelity in translating into the [[target language (translation)|target language]]. In ''The Poem Behind the Poem'', Barnstone argues that poetry "can't be made to sing through a mathematics that doesn't factor in the creativity of the translator".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Stewart, ''The Poem Behind the Poem'', Washington, Copper Canyon Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable piece of work translated into English is the ''[[Wen Xuan]]'', an anthology representative of major works of Chinese literature. Translating this work requires a high knowledge of the [[genre]]s presented in the book, such as poetic forms, various prose types including memorials, letters, proclamations, praise poems, edicts, and historical, philosophical and political disquisitions, threnodies and laments for the dead, and examination essays. Thus the literary translator must be familiar with the writings, lives, and thought of a large number of its 130 authors, making the ''Wen Xuan'' one of the most difficult literary works to translate.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Eoyang and Lin Yao-fu, ''Translating Chinese Literature'', Indiana University Press, 1995, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Translation generally, much as with [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|conception of mathematics]], requires, to varying extents, more information than appears in the page of text being translated.

===Sung texts===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Catherine Winkworth.PNG|thumb|left|100px|[[Catherine Winkworth]]]] --&gt;
Translation of a text that is sung in vocal music for the purpose of singing in another language—sometimes called "singing translation"—is closely linked to translation of poetry because most [[vocal music]], at least in the Western tradition, is set to [[Verse (popular music)|verse]], especially verse in regular patterns with [[rhyme]]. (Since the late 19th century, musical setting of [[prose]] and [[free verse]] has also been practiced in some [[art music]], though [[popular music]] tends to remain conservative in its retention of [[stanza]]ic forms with or without [[refrain]]s.) A rudimentary example of translating poetry for singing is church [[hymn]]s, such as the German [[chorale]]s translated into English by [[Catherine Winkworth]].{{efn|For another example of poetry translation, including translation of sung texts, see [http://vagalecs.narod.ru/ Rhymes from Russia].}}

Translation of sung texts is generally much more restrictive than translation of poetry, because in the former there is little or no freedom to choose between a versified translation and a translation that dispenses with verse structure. One might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation, but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator.  There is the option in prose sung texts, less so in verse, of adding or deleting a syllable here and there by subdividing or combining notes, respectively, but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line.

Other considerations in writing a singing translation include repetition of words and phrases, the placement of rests and/or punctuation, the quality of vowels sung on high notes, and rhythmic features of the vocal line that may be more natural to the original language than to the target language. A sung translation may be considerably or completely different from the original, thus resulting in a [[contrafactum]].

Translations of sung texts—whether of the above type meant to be sung or of a more or less literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a work is being sung in a language not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or [[surtitles]] projected during [[opera]] performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well), and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they are singing.

===Religious texts===
{{Further|Bible translations|Quran translations}}

[[File:Domenico Ghirlandaio - St Jerome in his study.jpg|thumb|left|135px|[[Jerome]], [[patron saint]] of translators and [[encyclopedia|encyclopedists]]]]
An important role in history has been played by translation of religious texts. Such translations may be influenced by tension between the text and the religious values the translators wish to convey. For example, [[Buddhist]] [[monk]]s who translated the [[India]]n [[sutra]]s into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] occasionally adjusted their translations to better reflect [[China]]'s distinct [[culture]], emphasizing notions such as [[filial piety]].

One of the first recorded instances of translation in the West was the rendering of the [[Old Testament]] into [[Greek language|Greek]] in the 3rd century BCE. The translation is known as the "[[Septuagint]]", a name that refers to the supposedly seventy translators (seventy-two, in some versions) who were commissioned to translate the [[Bible]] at [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. According to legend, each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell, and,  according to legend, all seventy versions proved identical. The ''Septuagint'' became the [[source text]] for later translations into many languages, including [[Latin]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]].

Still considered one of the greatest translators in history, for having rendered the ''[[Bible]]'' into [[Latin]], is [[Jerome]] (347–420 C.E.), the [[patron saint]] of translators. For centuries the [[Roman Catholic Church]] used his translation (known as the [[Vulgate]]), though even this translation stirred controversy.  By contrast with Jerome's contemporary, [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 C.E.), who endorsed precise translation, Jerome believed in adaptation, and sometimes invention, in order to more effectively bring across the meaning.  Jerome's colorful Vulgate translation of the Bible includes some crucial instances of "overdetermination".  For example, [[Isaiah]]'s prophecy announcing that the Savior will be born of a virgin, uses the word '''almah'', which is also used to describe the dancing girls at [[Solomon]]'s court, and simply means young and nubile.  Jerome, writes [[Marina Warner]], translates it as ''virgo'', "adding divine authority to the virulent cult of [[sex]]ual disgust that shaped Christian moral theology (the [Moslem] ''[[Quran]]'', free from this linguistic trap, does not connect [[Maryam (name)|Mariam]]/[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]'s miraculous nature with moral horror of sex)."  The [[apple]] that [[Eve]] offered to [[Adam]], according to Mark Polizzotti, could equally well have been an [[apricot]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], or [[banana]]; but Jerome liked the [[pun]] ''malus/malum'' (apple/evil}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pope Francis]] has suggested that the phrase "lead us not into temptation", in the [[Lord's Prayer]] found in the [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospels of Matthew]] (the first Gospel, written c. 80–90 C.E.) and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (the third Gospel, written c. 80–110 C.E.), should more properly be translated, "do not let us fall into temptation", commenting that God does not lead people into temptation—[[Satan]] does.{{efn|MJC Warren, Lecturer in Biblical and Religious Studies, [[University of Sheffield]], points out (more explicitly than Charles McNamara) that Luke gives a shorter version of [[Jesus]]'s Lord's Prayer, leaving off the request that God "deliver us from evil"; that (as Charles McNamara also says) accurate translation is not the question here; and that the Bible records a number of incidents when God commands evil actions, such as that [[Abraham]] kill his only son, [[Isaac]] (whose execution is canceled at the last moment).&lt;ref&gt;MJC Warren, "‘Lead us not into temptation’: why Pope Francis is wrong about the Lord’s Prayer", ''[[The Conversation]]'', December 8, 2017 [https://theconversation.com/lead-us-not-into-temptation-why-pope-francis-is-wrong-about-the-lords-prayer-88886]&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Some important early Christian authors interpreted the Bible's Greek text and [[Jerome]]'s [[Latin Vulgate]] similarly to Pope Francis.  A.J.B. Higgins&lt;ref&gt;A.J.B. Higgins, "'Lead Us Not into Temptation':  Some Latin Variants", ''[[Journal of Theological Studies]]'', 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1943 showed that among the earliest Christian authors, the understanding and even the text of this devotional verse underwent considerable changes.  These ancient writers suggest that, even if the Greek and Latin texts are left unmodified, something like "do not let us fall" could be an acceptable English rendering.  Higgins cited [[Tertullian]], the earliest of the Latin [[Church Fathers]] (c. 155–c. 240 C.E., "do not allow us to be led") and [[Cyprian]] (c. 200–258 C.E., "do not allow us to be led into temptation").  A later author, [[Ambrose]] (C. 340–397 C.E.), followed Cyprian's interpretation.  [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430), familiar with Jerome's Latin Vulgate rendering, observed that "many people... say it this way:  'and do not allow us to be led into temptation.'"&lt;ref&gt;Charles McNamara, "Lead Us Not into Temptation?  Francis Is Not the First to Question a Key Phrase of the Lord's Prayer", ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', January 1, 2018.  [https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/lead-us-not-temptation]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 863 C.E. the brothers [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s "Apostles to the Slavs", began translating parts of the [[Bible]] into the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language, using the [[Glagolitic script]] that they had devised, based on the [[Greek alphabet]].

The periods preceding and contemporary with the [[Protestant Reformation]] saw translations of the [[Bible]] into [[vernacular]] (local) European languages—a development that contributed to [[Western Christianity]]'s split into [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]] over disparities between Catholic and Protestant renderings of crucial words and passages (and due to a Protestant-perceived need to reform the Roman Catholic Church).  Lasting effects on the religions, cultures, and languages of their respective countries were exerted by such [[Bible]] translations as [[Martin Luther]]'s into [[German language|German]] (the [[New Testament]], 1522), [[Jakub Wujek]]'s into [[Polish language|Polish]] (1599, as revised by the [[Jesuits]]), and [[William Tyndale]]'s (New Testament, 1526 and revisions) and the ''[[King James Version]]'' into [[English language|English]] (1611). 
[[File:Moses (Michaelangelo - San Pietro in Vincoli - Rome).jpg|thumb|left|140px|right|Mistranslation: [[Michelangelo]]'s horned [[Moses]]]]
Efforts to translate the Bible into English had their [[martyr]]s. [[William Tyndale]] (c. 1494–1536) was convicted of [[heresy]] at [[Antwerp]], was strangled to death while tied at the stake, and then his dead body was burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Farris |first=Michael |title=From Tyndale to Madison |year=2007 |page=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier, [[John Wycliffe]] (c. mid-1320s – 1384) had managed to die a natural death, but 30 years later the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415 declared him a heretic and decreed that his works and earthly remains should be burned; the order, confirmed by [[Pope Martin V]], was carried out in 1428, and Wycliffe's corpse was exhumed and burned and the ashes cast into the [[River Swift]].  Debate and religious [[schism]] over different translations of religious texts continue, as demonstrated by, for example, the [[King James Only movement]].

A famous ''mistranslation'' of a [[Biblical]] text is the rendering of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word {{lang|he|קֶרֶן|rtl=yes}} (''keren''), which has several meanings, as "horn" in a context where it more plausibly means "beam of light":  as a result, for centuries artists, including sculptor [[Michelangelo]], have rendered [[Moses|Moses the Lawgiver]] with horns growing from his forehead.
[[File:Chinese quran.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Chinese language|Chinese]] translation, verses 33–34 of ''Quran'''s [[Ya Sin|''surah'' (chapter) 36]]]]
Such fallibility of the translation process has contributed to the [[Islamic]] world's ambivalence about translating the ''[[Quran]]'' (also spelled ''Koran'') from the original [[Arabic]], as received by the prophet [[Muhammad]] from [[Allah]] (God) through the angel [[Gabriel]] incrementally between 609 and 632 C.E., the year of Muhammad's death.  During prayers, the ''Quran'', as the miraculous and inimitable word of Allah, is recited only in Arabic.  However, as of 1936, it had been translated into at least 102 languages.&lt;ref name = fatani&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first =Afnan|last = Fatani|title =Translation and the Qur'an|editor-link =Oliver Leaman|editor-first = Oliver| editor-last = Leaman|encyclopedia=The Qur'an:  An Encyclopaedia|publisher = Routledge|date = 2006|pages = 657–669|isbn = 978-0415775298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental difficulty in translating the ''Quran'' accurately stems from the fact that an Arabic word, like a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word, may have a [[Polysemy|range of meanings]], depending on [[Context (language use)|context]].  This is said to be a linguistic feature, particularly of all [[Semitic languages]], that adds to the usual similar difficulties encountered in translating between any two languages.&lt;ref name = fatani/&gt;  There is always an element of human judgment—of interpretation—involved in understanding and translating a text.  Muslims regard any translation of the ''Quran'' as but one possible interpretation of the [[Classical Arabic|Quranic (Classical) Arabic]] text, and not as a full equivalent of that divinely communicated original.  Hence such a translation is often called an "interpretation" rather than a translation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], ''Islam in the World'', Granta, 2006, p. 90, {{ISBN|978-1-86207-906-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To complicate matters further, as with other languages, the meanings and usages of some expressions have changed ''over time'', between the Classical Arabic of the ''Quran'', and modern Arabic.  Thus a modern Arabic speaker may misinterpret the meaning of a word or passage in the ''Quran''.  Moreover, the interpretation of a Quranic passage will also depend on the historic context of Muhammad's life and of his early community.  Properly researching that context requires a detailed knowledge of ''[[hadith]]'' and ''[[Prophetic biography|sirah]]'', which are themselves vast and complex texts.  Hence, analogously to the translating of [[Translation#Chinese literature|Chinese literature]], an attempt at an accurate translation of the ''Quran'' requires a knowledge not only of the Arabic language and of the [[Target language (translation)|target language]], including their respective evolutions, but also a deep understanding of the two [[culture]]s involved.

== Technical translation ==
{{main|Technical translation}}
[[Technical translation]] renders documents such as manuals, instruction sheets, internal memos, minutes, financial reports, and other documents for a limited audience (who are directly affected by the document) and whose useful life is often limited.  Thus, a user guide for a particular model of refrigerator is useful only for the owner of the refrigerator, and will remain useful only as long as that refrigerator model is in use.  Similarly, software documentation generally pertains to a particular software, whose applications are used only by a certain class of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne |first=Jody|year=2006 |title=Technical Translation: Usability Strategies for Translating Technical Documentation |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36851">'''Women-led uprisings''' are mass protests that are initiated by women as an act of resistance or rebellion in defiance of an established government. A [[protest]] is a statement or action taken part to express disapproval of or object an authority; most commonly led in order to influence [[public opinion]] or [[government policy]]. They range from village food riots against imposed taxes to protests that initiated the Russian revolution.

==Food riots==
[[E.P. Thompson]]'s classic article "The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the 18th Century" emphasised women's role in many food riots. He argued that the rioters insisted on the idea of a moral community that was obliged to feed them and their families. As one contemporary commentator wrote: 'Women are more disposed to be mutinous ... [and] in all public tumults they are foremost in violence and ferocity.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/tags/e-p-thompson E.P.Thompson, ''Customs in Common'', p234].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Bohstedt]] later argued that Thompson had exaggerated women's role in food riots. Thompson responded by forcefully rejecting Bohstedt's criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/tags/e-p-thompson E.P.Thompson, 'The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the 18th Century' and 'Moral Economy Reviewed' in ''Customs in Common''], p185-335; Malcolm Thomis and Jennifer Grimmett, ''Women in Protest, 1800–1850'', p28ff; John Bohstedt, 'The Myth of the Feminine Food Riot' in Harriet Applewhite and Darlene Levy, ''Women and Politics in the Age of Democratic Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; We will never know the exact proportion of women's involvement in 18th Century food riots, but it appears that, at the very least, women led or initiated a significant minority of such riots and they participated in many more. Women had participated more fully in food riots than they had in earlier anti-[[impressment]] riots of 1747, in which they defended community interest and enforced community morality. These riots of revolution and resistance opened up opportunities for women to take political action as social and economic influencers, and not just as a republican's wife or a mother.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Smith, Barbara Clark. "Food Rioters and the American Revolution." The William and Mary Quarterly, vol. 51, no. 1, 1994, pp. 3–38. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2947003.&lt;/ref&gt; He indicates that women's new assertiveness had something to do with the weakening of the patriarchal control of women as [[feudalism]] declined and market relations expanded.

Men and women participated in food riots in [[Ireland]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]] (where contemporary reports claimed that women initiated many riots). Dutch tax riots in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were more numerous often more violent with participants of both lower and lower-middle classes, whereas food riots drew only lower class participants. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, at last 26 riots and 50 demonstrations involved women with 10 being chiefly under their control. Women did the cooking and purchased foodstuffs for their families; therefore, they were the first parties to be confronted with scarcities of food and high prices. In doing so women generally controlled much of the household finances. Another reason for their participation is due to the fact that food riots typically started in market places near shops and mills, which is where women gathered the most. One of the most prominent tax riots in 1616 has even gone on record as "the Women's Revolt of Delft".&lt;ref&gt;Dekker, Rudolf M. "Women in revolt." Theory and Society 16.3 (1987): 337-362&lt;/ref&gt; Women also conducted nearly a third of food riots during the [[American Revolution]] &lt;ref&gt;William Sheehan, Riotous Assemblies, p160; [http://lowcountries.nl/papers2009/papers2009_ronsijn.pdf Wouter Ronsijn, ''Western Europe's last food riots: a comparison of the market riots of the 1840's and 1850's in Flanders'']; H.Applewhite and D.Levy, ''Women and Politics in the Age of Democratic Revolution'', 127-30; Manfred Gailus in K.Hagemann, ''Civil Society and Gender'', p174-9; [http://libcom.org/history/food-rioters-american-revolution-barbara-clark-smith Barbara Clark Smith, 'Food Rioters and the American Revolution'], ''William and Mary Quarterly'', Vol. 51, No. 1, p3-5, 26-9.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that women were excluded from the vote, unqualified to serve as jurors at courts and law, and were essentially politically disabled by their [[Dependant|dependent]] status.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; It made a difference that Americans knew that women figured prominently in food riots in England and Europe, and it made a difference that ideas of equity, neighborly dealing, and charity informed American women's daily lives in the colonial period. Roughly 100 women marched a "Female Riot" and took to the streets in July 1777 insisting on their right to enforce equitable exchange.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

==French Revolutions==
Women were especially prominent in food riots in French marketplaces (although men dominated those in the countryside).&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Bouton, 'Gendered Behavior in Subsistence Riots', ''Journal of Social History'', Vol.23, No.4; C. Bouton, ''The Flour War: Gender, Class and Community in Late Ancien Regime French Society''.&lt;/ref&gt; The most momentous French food riot was [[The Women's March on Versailles]]. This occurred in October 1789, when the market women of Paris began calling the men 'cowards' and declaring: 'We will take over!' These women proceeded to march to Versailles with soldiers following them. This crowd then forced the King to return to Paris where, three years later, women were again major participants in the demonstrations that led to the abolition of the monarchy. As a police inspector said in 1793: 'It is mainly the women who are stirred up, women who in turn communicate all their frenzy to the men, heating them up with their seditious propositions and stimulating the most violent effervescence.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/history/everyday-lives-parisian-women-october-days-1789-david-garrioch D. Garrioch, 'Everyday Lives of Parisian Women in the October Days, 1789'], ''Social History,'' Vol.24, p231-2; H.Applewhite and D.Levy, ''Women and Politics in the Age of Democratic Revolution'', p76, 81ff; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uK6JVxh92QUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Olwen+H.+Hufton%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pe4FT6P1HcWS8gPS2eTJBA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=inauthor%3A%22Olwen%20H.%20Hufton%22&amp;f=false Olwen Hufton, ''Women and the Limits of Citizenship in the French Revolution''], p1-49; [http://libcom.org/history/political-revolution-women-case-paris-darline-gay-levy-harriet-b-applewhite H.Applewhite and D.Levy, 'Women and Political Revolution in Paris'], in Renate Bridenthal, ''Becoming Visible, Women in European History'' (1987 Edition), p285-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, women in the countryside initiated 'counter-revolutionary' protests against the new government's policies of the repression of the Church and the conscription of male peasants into the army.&lt;ref&gt;James Mcmillan, ''France and Women, 1789-1914'', p25-6; Wikipedia: [[War in the Vendee]].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], women lead the fight for religion. Their fight would lead the way for the [[Feminization (sociology)|feminization]] of religions. Women felt that they were one responsible for maintaining a spiritual balance within their family. They fought harder than their male counterparts, invoking violent and illegal actions sometimes to get their voices heard. If women were ever arrested, the males in their lives would downplay the damage they could do and were also seen as more hysterical and vulnerable as a whole, so society never thought much of their violent and illegal actions. But if a woman refused or avoided taking part in [[Petition|petitions]] or marches, she would be shamed until guilted into taking part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desan|first=Suzanne|date=Spring 1989|title=The Role of Women in Religious Riots During the French Revolution|jstor=2738896|journal=Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=22| issue =  3 Special Issue: The French Revolution in Culture|pages=451–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women during the French Revolution also fought for their own rights. [[Aristocratic]] women were not as likely to partake in the activities that could ruin their family and/or their chance of inheriting the family fortune (or what she would receive), so they were reluctant to participate. [[Working class]] women also faced this dilemma, but because they were already the suppressed class, the good of what they could achieve outweighed the loss of family pride and/or fortune. [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] had allowed all people who paid taxes to vote, but since women could not pay taxes, they could not vote. While the [[Third estate|Third Estate]] made rules, women would present their opinions through pamphlets and petitions to let the Third Estate know what they wanted. ''Pétition des femmes du Tiers-Etat au Roi'' stated that women wanted education to go beyond French and Latin for Church, more jobs to be available to women, and to raise the max pay of 5-6 sous. ''Motion en Faveur du Sexe'' and ''Discours préliminaire de la pauvre Javotte'' focused on dowries and marriage. In the working class, finding a job was hard enough for men, harder for women, and saving enough money to get married was almost impossible. Women didn't want to have to pay a dowry to get married, this applied only in the Third Estate. ''The Rights of Woman'' by Olympe de Gou was a complete pamphlet that stated all the rights that women should have. It was copied almost word for word from the ''Declaration of the Rights of Man'', but applied to women. A booklet ''"Griefs et plaintes des femmes mal mariées"'' placed criticism on marriage laws oppressing women into submission to their male counterpart and demanded the legalization of divorce. In the sector of Bourgeoises, Madame Etta Palm van Aelder was a leading figure in fighting to women's rights. She demanded for the equal right to an education, political freedom, divorce and legality of women of age 21 and over. While political freedom would not be gained until after the Revolution, all other demands would be meet in some way. In August 1792, women of the age of 21 and above were given legal freedom from their parents. In September 1792, women were granted the right to divorce and the Law of 1794 eased the divorce process. Educational programs were advanced and allowed women to be trained for careers in the work field, but they still did not obtain equality. Female teachers were paid less than males and primary school classes were divided by gender. By the end of the advancements and improvements in the educational system, the women weren't much better off than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Racz|first=Elizabeth|date=Spring 1952|title=The Women's Rights Movement in the French Revolution|jstor=40400125|journal=Science and Society|publisher=Guilford Press|volume=16| issue =  2|pages=151–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R. B. Rose argues that despite the efforts of women during the Revolution, little changed. The Revolution was a revolution for the men, and a place of chaos for the women.The French Revolutionary Constitution of 1791 allowed women to be labeled as citizens, but nothing else than that. They still didn't have voting rights or the ability to run for office. The Napoleonic Law of 1804 suppressed wives into submission to their husbands, reversing all equality demands made during the Revolution. Women still couldn't own land because they couldn't legally sign any contract, putting the land into the hands of her closest masculine relative figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rose|first=R. B.|date=Winter 1995|title=Feminism, Women and the French Revolution|jstor=41299020|journal=Historical Reflections / Réflexions Historiques|publisher=Berghahn Books|volume=21| issue =  1|pages=187–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian War of 1871]], women were prominent in preventing the army from moving their cannons from Paris, an event which helped spark the [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref&gt;Gay Gullickson, ''Unruly Women of Paris'', p24ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
Women's protests for the right to vote became particularly [[militant]] in Britain. They included arson, widespread window breaking and attempts to storm both [[Parliament]] and [[Buckingham Palace]]. The shift to wartime patriotism in 1914, however, derailed the [[suffragette movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Kent, ''Gender and Power in Britain, 1640-1990'', p262, 268-73; [[Women's Social and Political Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Image:Suffragette handbill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Suffragette handbill]]

During [[World War I]], women led large numbers of food riots in Germany, [[Russia]], [[Italy]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Belinda Davis in K.Hagemann, Home/Front; the Military, War and Gender in Twentieth Century Germany, Ch.4; [https://books.google.com/books?id=hFqZcQmlOBsC&amp;pg=0_0#PPA1,M1 Keith Allen, 'Food and the German Home-Front' and Simonetta Ortaggi, 'Italian Women During the Great War' in Gail Braybon, ''Evidence, History and the Great War''], p181, 190, 218-36; [http://libcom.org/history/subsistence-riots-russia-during-world-war-i-barbara-engel Beverley Engel, 'Subsistence Riots in Russia during World War One'], ''Journal of Modern History'', Vol.69; [http://libcom.org/history/women-communal-strikes-crisis-1917-1922-temma-kaplan Temma Kaplan, 'Women and Communal Strikes in the Crisis of 1917-1922'], in Renate Bridenthal, ''Becoming Visible: Women in European History'' (1987 Edition); Lynne Taylor, 'Food Riots Revisited', ''Journal of Social History'', Vol.30, No.2; Manuel Castells, ''The City and the Grassroots'', Ch.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Women workers also led the way in strike-waves in [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]]. The German authorities reported that [[Labor Union|union]] leaders were doing 'everything possible to prevent such disturbances and strikes over food provisions, but ... it is the countless female workers who constantly agitate and stir things up.' Women's prominence in these struggles helped delegitimize the war, and the regimes that were fighting it, paving the way for the huge strike-waves and revolutions at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=loCIRHrIOaMC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=#PPA293 Ute Daniel, ''The War from Within: German Women in the First World War''], p293, 246-50; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QHxs3y8yXAQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=downs+manufacturing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zfn-Ttv5H8nz8QOq-fmlAQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg&amp;pg=0_0#PPA1,M119 Laura Lee Downs, ''Manufacturing Inequality: Gender Division in the French and British Metalworking Industries, 1914-39''], p119-144; Davis in Hagemann ''Home/Front ...,'' p131.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:DisturbiosPorHambreEnBerlín.png|thumb|right|400px|Aftermath of Berlin food riot, 1918]]

Women also led food riots in [[Japan]] and non-belligerent [[Spain]]. Women's protests against high food prices spread across Spain in both 1913 and 1918. In [[Barcelona]], in 1918, women used the slogan: 'In the name of humanity, all women take to the streets!'. They organised repeated demonstrations and attacked shops, warehouses, government offices and music halls. Women also staged food riots during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VE4YVw9iBksC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=seidman+egos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=okkhT6G-LYKD4gSFlYG5Cw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20riots&amp;f=false Michael Seidman, Republic of Egos, p102, 219].&lt;/ref&gt; Temma Kaplan has theorised such uprisings as examples of 'female [[consciousness]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lewis, ''Rioters and Citizens; Mass Protests in Imperial Japan''; [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft9q2nb672&amp;chunk.id=d0e2460&amp;toc.id=d0e2193&amp;brand=ucpress Temma Kaplan, ''Red City, Blue Period: Social Movements in Picasso's Barcelona''], Ch.4 and 5; [http://libcom.org/history/female-consciousness-collective-action-barcelona-temma-kaplan Temma Kaplan, 'Female Consciousness and Collective Action: The Case of Barcelona, 1910-1918'], ''Signs'', Vol.7; Kaplan 'Women and Communal Strikes...'.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian Revolution==
[[Karl Marx]] had recognized that "great social revolutions are impossible without the feminine ferment"&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Gailus in K.Hagemann, ''Civil Society and Gender'', p178-80;  ''Marx, Engels Collected Works'', Vol.43, p184.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1917, it was [[Petrograd]]'s (Saint Petersburg) female workers who spread the idea of a general strike on 8 March, [[International Women's Day]]. On that day, hundreds of women threw stones and snowballs at factory windows demanding for bread. [[Economic depression]] in 1917, particularly devastated the working class women because price of daily necessities increases tremendously, but their low paid wages does not compensate for the increased in price of goods. After a long and tiring hours of labor, women had to line up for hours just to get a loaf of bread. Sometimes after wasting hours lining up, the breads would ran out and it resulted in starvation for a lot of families. The protest led by thousand of female workers inspired fellow male factory workers to joined them and demand changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A People's History Of The Russian Revolution|last=Faulkner|first=Neil|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2017|isbn=9781786800190|location=London|pages=111–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women participated in the riots by attacking [[Police station|police stations]] and bakeries. However, many troops refused to shoot protesting women, who were often walking with their children. As [[Leon Trotsky]] later wrote, the women took hold of the soldiers' rifles and 'beseeched almost commanded: "put down your [[Bayonet|bayonets]] and join us"', and, within five days, the centuries-old Tsarist regime had collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xyC-9mQ7SlsC&amp;pg=0_0#PPA43 Choi Chatterjee, ''Celebrating Women; Gender, Festival, Culture and Bolshevik Ideology''], p43-54; Jane McDermid and Anna Hillyar, ''Midwives of the Revolution'', 147-157; [http://libcom.org/history/women-communal-strikes-crisis-1917-1922-temma-kaplan Kaplan in Bridenthal, ''Becoming Visible...,''].&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bolshevik took over Petrograd and [[Moscow]] in October 1917, tense relationship were discern between rulers and working-class women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clements|first=Barbara Evans|date=1982|title=Working-Class and Peasant Women in the Russian Revolution, 1917-1923|jstor=3173897|journal=Signs|volume=8|issue=2|pages=215–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarcity and hunger made it very difficult for Russian workers to transform society themselves and women's participation did not continue at the same level as in February/March 1917. However, it was women's food protests, in May 1918, that sparked the first major wave of workers' unrest against the new [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BEoBCGJ4VqYC&amp;pg=0_0#PPA229 Alexander Rabinowitch, ''The Bolsheviks in Power''], p229-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, later, during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s program of breakneck [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and forced [[Collectivism|collectivization]], women were again at the forefront of the workers' strikes and peasant protests that resisted this brutal policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynne Viola]], [http://libcom.org/history/peasant-womens-protest-during-collectivization-lynne-viola ''Peasant Rebels under Stalin''], p176-84, 202-9, 237-8; [https://books.google.com/books?id=X09ZuZG_JNwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq= Jeffrey Rossman, ''Worker Resistance under Stalin''], p6-7, 206, 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin's regime was, however, able to contain all resistance through starvation and repression.

==Colonial revolts==
Women were prominent in various revolts in the colonial and ex-colonial world. One of the most notable in Africa was the [[Igbo Women's War]] against British tax collection in [[Nigeria]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie G.Smith, ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History'', Vol.1, p540; M.J.Diamond, ''Women and Revolution; Global Expressions''.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in southern [[Igboland]] believed that they were being wrongfully taxed for palm products by the British. This led to what the British called the Aba Riots, and the Igbo, the Women's War. This rebellion tested the political institutions of the Igbo women which have been established prior to colonization. Women took initiative by sending messages through the market and kinship networks connecting to other villages calling for a mikiri meeting. They also took advantage of strikes, boycotts, and force to project their opinions and retaliate against authority. Women of wealth and generosity who could speak well typically took leading roles in village wide mikiri gatherings, which had the largest influence on the rise of the Women's War. During mikiri, decisions were made on how to respond against being wronged by the Warrant Chief's corruption and by the taxes that they anticipated to be enforced upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Van Allen (1972) "Sitting on a Man": Colonialism and the Lost Political Institutions of Igbo Women, Canadian Journal of African Studies/La Revue canadienne des études africaines, 6:2, 165-181, DOI: 10.1080/00083968.1972.10803664&lt;/ref&gt;

==The civil rights movement and feminism since the 1950s==
It was a [[Montgomery Bus Boycott#Rosa Parks|boycott of segregated buses by African-American women]] that sparked the [[civil rights movement]] in 1955. This case inspired activists across the world to make a change and fight oppressions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pzwcfZil93EC&amp;pg=0_0#PPA5 M. Bahati Kuumba, ''Gender and Social Movements''] (2001), [[AltaMira Press]], U.S. p24, 33-4, 74, 80. {{ISBN|0759101884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young women's rejection of the patriarchal family and sexual repression was also a major factor in the rebellions of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/commentary/%E2%80%98liberate-socialist-eminences-from-their-bourgeois-cocks%E2%80%99 'Women '68ers, Marching on Alone'], [[Lynne Segal]],''[[Radical Philosophy]]'', No.149.&lt;/ref&gt; Women started to defy the typical housewife characteristics and they also demanded equal pay for man and women who worked the same job. [[Sexual revolution]] was also transcending in the 1960s as women embraced their sexuality and nature more openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=AgMEphGu86QC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=civil+rights+movement+by+women&amp;ots=HROxi7jW71&amp;sig=cBIoRDB6NHsE8LQriOZaRvQ_f48#v=onepage&amp;q=civil%20rights%20movement%20by%20women&amp;f=false|title=Personal Politics: The Roots of Women's Liberation in the Civil Rights Movement and the New Left|last=Evans|first=Sara Margaret|date=1979|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=9780394742281|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revived feminist movement then helped transform gender roles in the following decades. [[Marsha P. Johnson]], a black trans woman, and [[Stormé DeLarverie]], a black lesbian, are credited with inciting the [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall Riots]] in New York City in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/tgi-bios/marsha-p-johnson|title=Marsha "Pay it no Mind" Johnson · Challenging Gender Boundaries: A Trans Biography Project · outhistory.org|website=outhistory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/remembering-stormé-the-woman-who-incited-the-stonewall_us_5933c061e4b062a6ac0ad09e|title=Remembering Stormé - The Woman Of Color Who Incited The Stonewall Revolution|last=Robertson|first=Julia Diana|date=2017-06-05|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stonewall was a turning point in the [[gay liberation]] and [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] rights movements.

Women were also at the forefront of many working class struggles in the 1970s and 1980s. (For example, in the [[British Isles]], women's protests and leadership were significant during the '[[troubles]]' in Northern Ireland, during the [[Grunwick strike]] and [[Women Against Pit Closures|during the miners' strike]].&lt;ref&gt;Fairweather, McDonough and McFadyean, ''Only the Rivers Run Free: Northern Ireland, the Women's War'' (1984), [[Pluto Press]] {{ISBN|0861046684}}; Wikipedia: [[Grunwick Dispute]]; Wikipedia: [[Women Against Pit Closures]].&lt;/ref&gt;) For a long time, Iranian women struggled with basic human rights and oppression due to traditional religious affiliations and political attributes. Their Islamic beliefs conceal the issues of gender inequalities and the domination of man towards [[Women in Iran|Iranian women]]. On 1979, in the course of [[Islamic Revolution]], women gathered and protested on the streets but the changes were nonexistent. It wasn't until 1990s where the impact of Islamic Revolution was seen as intolerant to women. This is when young women and activist started going against the Islamic ideologies, for instance, getting a divorce or wearing clothes that were revealing. Significant changes of basic human rights and the oppression of Iranian women has been perceived since 1990s and it has been progressing notably until today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sq4ya5rf2q.search.serialssolutions.com/?genre=article&amp;isbn=&amp;issn=15398706&amp;title=Journal%20of%20International%20Women%5C's%20Studies&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=1&amp;date=20071101&amp;atitle=Iranian%20women%20and%20the%20civil%20rights%20movement%20in%20Iran:%20feminism%20interacted&amp;aulast=Mohammadi,%20Majid&amp;spage=1&amp;sid=EBSCO:General%20OneFile&amp;pages=1-21|title=Journals at the LMU William H.

Recently on January 20, 2017, the day after [[Donald Trump]] was inaugurated as the 45th US president, women, men, and children all over the United States gathered to march in protest of Trump and promote solidarity with other women to resist women's oppression and mistreatment. Over 680 marches throughout the country and in more than 68 countries around the world were held as part of the [[2017 Women's March|Women's March]]. More than 1,000,000 people participated in  the "flagship march" in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Chenoweth, Erica; Pressman, Jeremy (2017-02-07).

== Kurdish Women and the Rojava Revolution ==
Northern [[Syria]] is what is referred to as the [[Rojava]]. The Rojava revolution, or [[Rojava conflict]], is the political disaster, social revolution, and military battle that has taken place in recent years. The Rojava Revolution has been characterized by the prominent role women have had during these times of strife.[[File:Kurdish YPG Fighters (30358638660).jpg|thumb|The YPG, Women's Protection Units]]
The novel ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan'' documents the [[Kurdish women]] and how they were and still are oppressed. As Kurds, they were denied basic rights, in many cases even citizenship; and as women they were trapped in patriarchal domination.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan|last=Knapp|first=Michael|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kurdish women's movement seeks to overcome the alienation of Kurdish women. The fight for women's rights has always been a part of Kurdish history. One of the first signs of revolution in Rojava was the election of [[Hêvî Îbrahîm]] to the post of the prime minister in February 2014.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bengio|first=Ofra|date=Winter 2016|title=Game Changers: Kurdish Women in Peace and War|url=|journal=Middle East Institute|volume=70|pages=38|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, many women were assuming leadership positions. [[Asya Abdullah]] is regarded to be one of the most radical and effective revolutionaries in the world today. She has been the driving force in the battle for Kurdish freedom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/kurdish-woman-building-feminist-democrac-fighting-isis-at-the-same-time-syria-kurdistan-rojava-new-a7487151.html|title=The Kurdish Woman Building Feminist a Democracy and Fighting ISIS at the Same Time|last=McKernan|first=Bethan|date=5 January 2017|website=Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wants women around the world to become more aware of their own fight.

With this transformation, women also began getting involved with security and military roles. In 2012, women from the PYD, the [[People's Protection Units]], created a unit dedicated to the fight for women. The Women's fighting units, also known as [[YPJ]], have played a role in the liberations of towns like [[Kobanî|Kobani]] and [[Manbij]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since September 2014, Kurdish women have been playing a leading role in the fight against [[ISIS]]. The creation of the YPJ is a fascinating development in a region where women's rights are often repressed. But with the formation of these groups, has come with sexist media coverage. The media is more concerned with the fighters looks rather than what they are fighting for.

Women in the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] guerrilla army have developed Jineoloji (also known as Jineology) which simply put, means women's science. The goal of [[jineology]] is to given women and society access to science and knowledge and to strengthen the connections of science and knowledge to society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Rojava Revolution]] has been characterized by a high level of women participation politics, safe houses for women dealing with sexual assault or violence, and women-run academies dedicated to the study of [[Jineology]].

Out of the conflict of the popular uprising in [[Syria]], Kurdish women took up arms alongside men and took control of Northern Syria, also known as [[Rojava]]. The women fight alongside men both in mixed units of the [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG) as well as in their own [[Women's Protection Units]] (YPJ). Women constitute an estimated 35 percent of the entire Kurdish forces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==The creation of the first human societies==
Studies of contemporary [[hunter-gatherer]]s show that their strong sense of moral community is maintained by autonomous individuals who constantly resist any form of personal domination. In fact, many hunter-gatherers are so egalitarian and communistic that even a non-Marxist anthropologist like [[Christopher Boehm]] argues that hunter-gatherer societies - the first human societies - must have originated in uprisings against dominant males.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ljxS8gUlgqgC&amp;printsec=frontcover Christopher Boehm, ''Hierarchy in the Forest; the Evolution of Egalitarian Behaviour''], p1-10, 84-9, 172-3, 193-6, 249, 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]], and other anthropologists influenced by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], have theorised that these uprisings were led by women looking for collective support to ease their childcare burdens.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Knight, [http://libcom.org/library/sex-human-revolution-chris-knight 'Sex and the Human Revolution'] and [http://libcom.org/library/solidarity-sex-chris-knight 'Solidarity and Sex']; Chris Knight, Camilla Power, Ian Watts, [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/pub_knight_power_watts_big.pdf 'The Human Symbolic Revolution', ''The Cambridge Archaeological Journal''], Vol.5, p75ff; www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/publications.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; They have used a wide range of evidence from anthropology, [[primatology]], mythic narratives, [[evolutionary biology]] and archaeology. Some Marxists have dismissed these ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.de/science/harmeng/engels1.htm Chris Harman, ''International Socialism'', No.54, p169-74]. Some other Marxists have been more positive, e.g. Jack Conrad, [http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/798/originsofreligion.php 'Origins of Religion and the Human Revolution'].&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the idea of women-led uprisings creating the first societies is controversial, a number of highly respected anthropologists have taken the thesis seriously. ([[Mary Douglas]], [[Robin Dunbar]], [[David Lewis-Williams]], [[Caroline Humphrey]], [[Marilyn Strathern]], Clive Gamble, [[Keith Hart (anthropologist)|Keith Hart]] and [[Chris Stringer]] have all made favourable comments about Knight's work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TECGMrey5UEC&amp;pg=PA586&amp;lpg=PA586&amp;dq=times+literary+supplement+knight+blood+relations+peter+redgrove&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qgE__d9vu4&amp;sig=Cn6Bnwlcq0b04MJ4oX3MMk3dsv4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ku0GT6KvMtGd8gPitr2kDw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Chris Knight, ''Blood Relations'']; [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/category/reviews/ Reviews of ''Blood Relation'']; Chris Stringer, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=U2qDI94mJYAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chris+stringer+human+evolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1OQGT7fZFIXr8QPgzp29Cg&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chris%20knight%22&amp;f=false''The Origin of Our Species''].&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Upward Communication''' is the process of [[information flow]]ing from the lower levels of a [[hierarchy]] to the upper levels.  This type of [[communication]] is becoming more popular in organizations as traditional forms of communication are becoming less popular. The more traditional organization types such as a hierarchy, places people into separate ranks.

Upward [[communication]] helps [[employees]] to express their [[requirements]], ideas, and feelings. For the top management, upward communication is an important source of information for [[Business &amp; Decision|business decisions]]. It helps in alerting top management about the requirement of changes in an organisations. Upward contribution is the core contributor of business process re-engineering in many organisations.

Upward communication is widely used as part of [[Whistleblower|whistleblowing]] policy in many large organisations. Under whistle blowing policy, each employee is permitted to directly communicate with top management about matters requiring examination on vigilance angle. Hence it is used as a [[fraud prevention]] tool as well.

Upward communication keeps managers aware of how employees feel about their jobs, policies and procedures, and the business in general. It consists of methods like Feedback from employees, helps in bringing Mutual Trust and helps the organization to determine, implement or decide upon new policies. It keeps the organization updated or prone to upcoming challenges.

Upward communication is not free from disadvantages too. It suffers from problems like information can be changed during transmission, unwillingness to participate, fear of inefficiency, bypassing and flattery too. Sometimes top level executives discourage the upward flow of information and neglect the constructive suggestions and opinions about the work related issues of the organization. It is a time taking process and is comparatively slow too.
