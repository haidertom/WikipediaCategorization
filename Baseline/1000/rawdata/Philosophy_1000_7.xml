In the [[19th century]], the philosophies of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] began to have a dramatic effect, the landmark works of philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] influencing new generations of thinkers. In the late 18th century a movement known as [[Romanticism]] began; it validated strong emotion as an authentic not of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as trepidation, horror and terror and awe. Key ideas that sparked changes in philosophy were the fast progress of science; [[evolution]], as postulated by [[Lucilio Vanini|Vanini]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo|Lord Monboddo]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], and [[Charles Darwin]]; and what might now be called [[Emergence|emergent]] order, such as the [[free market]] of [[Adam Smith]] within nation states. Pressures for [[egalitarianism]], and more rapid change culminated in a period of revolution and turbulence that would see philosophy change as well.

== Brief historical outline ==
With the tumultuous years of 1789–1815, European culture was transformed by revolution, war and disruption. By ending many of the social and cultural props of the previous century, the stage was set for dramatic economic and political change. European philosophy reflected on, participated in, and drove, many of these changes.

=== Influences from the late Enlightenment ===
The last third of the 18th century produced a host of ideas and works which would both systematize previous philosophy, and present a deep challenge to the basis of how philosophy had been systematized. [[Immanuel Kant]] is a name that most would mention as being among the most important of influences, as is [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. While both of these philosophers were products of the 18th century and its assumptions, they pressed at the boundaries. In trying to explain the nature of the state and government, Rousseau would challenge the basis of government with his declaration that "Man is born free, but is everywhere in chains". Kant, while attempting to preserve axiomic skepticism, was forced to argue that we do not see true reality, nor do we speak of it. All we know of reality is appearances. Since all we can see of reality is appearances, which are subject to certain necessary and subjective forms of perceptions, Kant postulates the idea of an unknowable (while at the same time limiting our use of science and the principle of causality to the appearances). Hegel's distinction between the unknowable and the circumstantially unknown can be seen as the beginnings of Hegel's rational system of the universe.

Yet another philosopher of the late Enlightenment that was influential in the 19th century was [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827), whose formulation of [[nomological determinism]] is famous up to this day.

== Philosophical schools and tendencies ==
This is a partial list of schools of 19th-century philosophy (also known as [[late modern philosophy]]).

===German idealism===
{{main|German idealism}}
{{also|Post-Hegelianism|Neo-Kantianism}}
One of the first philosophers to attempt to grapple with Kant's philosophy was [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], whose development of Kantian metaphysics became a source of inspiration for the [[Romanticism|Romantics]]. In ''[[Wissenschaftslehre (Fichte)|Wissenschaftslehre]]'', Fichte argues that the self posits itself and is a self-producing and changing process.

[[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], a student of Fichte, continued to develop many of the same ideas and was also assimilated by the Romantics as something of an official philosopher for their movement. But it was another of Fichte's students, and former roommate of Schelling, who would rise to become the most prominent of the post-Kantian idealists: [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. His work revealed the increasing importance of historical thinking in German thought.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], rejecting Hegel and also materialism, called for a return to Kantian transcendentalism, at the same time adopting [[atheism]] and [[determinism]], amongst others. His secular thought became more popular in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, which coincided with the advents of [[Darwinism]], [[positivism]], [[Marxism]] and [[David Strauss|philological analysis of the Bible]]. 

In the second half of the 19th century, an even more orthodox return to Kantian thought was espoused by a number of [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian]] philosophers based in two main locations: the Marburg School and the Baden School. This trend of thought survived into the beginning of the next century, influencing 20th century philosophical movements such as Neopositivism and Phenomenology.

One of the most famous opponents of idealism in the first half of the German 19th century was [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], who advocated [[materialism]] and [[atheism]].

===Utilitarianism===
{{main|Utilitarianism}}
In early 19th century [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] promoted the idea that actions are right as they maximize happiness, and happiness alone.

===Marxism===
{{main|Marxism}}
Developed by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in the mid-to-late-19th Century, Marxism is a sociopolitical and economic view based on the philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]], which opposes [[idealism]] in favour of the [[materialism|materialist]] viewpoint. Marx analysed [[Marx's theory of history|history]] itself as the progression of [[dialectic]]s in the form of [[class struggle]]. From this it is argued that "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." According to Marx, this began with the phase of [[primitive communism]] ([[hunter-gatherer]] society), after which the [[Neolithic Revolution]] gave way to [[slavery|slave societies]], progressing into the [[feudal society]], and then into his present era of the [[Industrial Revolution]], after which he held that the next step was for the [[proletariat]] to overthrow the owners of industry and establish a [[socialist]] society, which would further develop into a [[communist]] society, in which class distinctions, money, and the state would have withered from existence entirely.

Marxism had a profound influence on the history of the 20th Century.

===Existentialism===
{{main|Existentialism|Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche}}
[[Existentialism]] as a philosophical movement is properly a [[20th-century philosophy|20th-century]] movement, but its major antecedents, [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote long before the rise of existentialism. In the 1840s, academic philosophy in Europe, following Hegel, was almost completely divorced from the concerns of individual human life, in favour of pursuing abstract metaphysical systems. Kierkegaard sought to reintroduce to philosophy, in the spirit of [[Socrates]]: subjectivity, commitment, faith, and passion, all of which are a part of the [[human condition]].

Like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche saw the moral values of 19th-century Europe disintegrating into [[nihilism]] (Kierkegaard called it the ''levelling'' process). Nietzsche attempted to undermine traditional moral values by exposing its foundations. To that end, he distinguished between [[master-slave morality|master and slave moralities]], and claimed that man must turn from the meekness and humility of Europe's slave-morality.

Both philosophers are precursors to existentialism, among other ideas, for their importance on the "great man" against the age. Kierkegaard wrote of 19th-century Europe, "Each age has its own characteristic depravity. Ours is perhaps not pleasure or indulgence or sensuality, but rather a dissolute pantheistic contempt for the individual man."

===Positivism===
{{main|Positivism}}
[[Auguste Comte]], the self-professed founder of modern [[sociology]], put forward the view that the rigorous ordering of confirmable observations alone ought to constitute the realm of human knowledge. He had hoped to order the sciences in increasing degrees of complexity from mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and a new discipline called "sociology", which is the study of the "dynamics and statics of society".&lt;ref&gt;Comte, Auguste. ''Course on Positive Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pragmatism===
{{main|Pragmatism}}
The [[American philosophy|American philosophers]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] developed the pragmatist philosophy in the late 19th century.

===British idealism===
The twilight years of the 19th century in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] saw the rise of [[British idealism]], a revival of interest in the works of Kant and Hegel.

===Transcendentalism===
{{main|Transcendentalism}}
Transcendentalism was rooted in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] and [[German idealism]], led by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. The main belief was in an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through the individual's intuition, rather than through the doctrines of established religions.

===Social Darwinism===
{{main|Social Darwinism}}
"Social Darwinism" refers to theories that apply the [[evolutionary]] concept of [[natural selection]] to [[human society]].

'''Abstractionism''' is the [[theory]] that the [[mind]] obtains some or all of its [[concept]]s by [[abstraction|abstracting]] them from concepts it already has, or from [[experience]].&lt;ref name="Geach1957"&gt;Geach, Peter (1957) Mental Acts - Their Contents and Their Objects. Routledge Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; One may, for example, abstract 'green' from a set of experiences which involve green along with other [[property (philosophy)|properties]]. Also, for example, one may abstract a generic concept like 'vegetable' from the already possessed concepts of its instances (carrot, broccoli, onion, etc.). This view was criticized by [[George Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_philosophy/summary/v024/24.4flage.html | title=Berkeley on Abstraction | journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy | year=1986 | volume=24 | issue=4 | pages=483–501 | doi=10.1353/hph.1986.0073 | last=Flage | first=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Geach]].&lt;ref name="Geach1957"/&gt;

== Development ==
Abstractionism has its roots in [[Aristotle]]'s writings, particularly those rejecting the [[Plato|Platonic]] [[Theory of forms|theory of Forms]]. They were adopted and developed further by the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] so that the doctrine became entrenched in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Berkeley's Philosophy of Mathematics|last=Jesseph|first=Douglas|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2010|isbn=0226398978|location=Chicago|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] also developed his own theory of abstract ideas although it was against the Scholastic theory of essences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Causality and Mind: Essays on Early Modern Philosophy|last=Jolley|first=Nicholas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199669554|location=Oxford|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, ideas originate through the senses and the materials or the sensory data provided by these become the basis of the way we form general ideas of classes of things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philosophy of Human Learning|last=Winch|first=Christopher|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0415161908|location=London|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory contradicts the [[Empiricism|empiricist]] standpoint due to its focus on intuitive and demonstrative knowledge as demonstrated in Locke's recognition that pure mathematics and pure morals are founded on intuition and demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Phenomenology|last=Sinha|first=D|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1969|isbn=9789024702664|location=The Hague|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several modern versions of abstractionism and these include those developed by theorists such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jerry Fodor]], who proposed that concepts are preformed at birth and that we learn to match the words of our language onto the pre-existing concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Education: The Key Concepts|last=Gingell|first=John|last2=Winch|first2=Christopher|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=9780415428927|location=New York|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky, for instance, explained the "deep structure" of the [[Internet]] or the grammar of meaning hidden beneath the surface of words by citing that "linguists isolate from an essentially heterogeneous linguistic reality a standard and homogeneous system, thus grounding abstraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Interlock: Art, Conspiracy, and the Shadow Worlds of Mark Lombardi|last=Goldstone|first=Patricia|publisher=Counterpoint|year=2015|isbn=9781619025653|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Berkeley's opposition to abstractionism is considered to be primarily directed at Locke's claim that words are made general through the mediation of general ideas. This is due to the view that Locke's argument is tantamount to claiming that the word "triangle" can be applied to many different triangles because the abstract general idea of the form is used as a template or standard when identifying new instances as being of the same sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on the Philosophy of George Berkeley|last=Sosa|first=Ernest|publisher=D.

Thus, it is often used to limit or contradict fault in a matter.

Other examples include:
*"The current world is in a state of chaos, but that's understandable, since humans have got a lot less organized, more stupid, and more populous".
*"The building was coming down anyway."

Anangeon can be seen as a part of [[logos]] and is a type of [[Non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]].

In philosophy, '''animalism''' is a theory according to which humans are animals.&lt;ref&gt;Eric T. Olson (2007) ''What are we?: a study in personal ontology'', Oxford University Press, section 2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of animalism is advocated by philosophers [[Eric T. Olson (philosopher)|Eric T. Olson]], Paul Snowdon, Stephan Blatti, and [[David Wiggins]].&lt;ref name=garrett&gt; Brian Garrett, ''Personal Identity and Self-Consciousness''.

'''Anna Willess Williams''' (1857 – April 17, 1926) was a teacher and philosophical writer best known as the model for [[George T. Morgan|George T. Morgan's]] silver dollar design, popularly known as the [[Morgan dollar]].

[[File:1899 obverse.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1899 Morgan dollar]]

In 1876, George T. Morgan began creating a series of new coin designs at the behest of Director of the Mint, [[Henry Linderman|Dr. Henry R. Linderman]].&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;Van Allen &amp; Mallis, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan opted to use the profile of an American girl to depict [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] instead of simply creating an imaginary figure for the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of his new design.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; After he rejected several possible candidates, Morgan's friend, artist [[Thomas Eakins]], recommended Anna Williams of [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Eakins knew Williams through her father, Henry Williams, and she had posed for several of Eakins's paintings.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; 

Williams reluctantly sat for five modelling sessions with Morgan in November 1876 after being convinced to do so by friends.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Morgan was impressed with her profile, stating that it was the most perfect he had seen in England or America.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; The [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]] bearing her likeness was first struck on March 11, 1878.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; A condition of her sitting for Morgan was that her identity be kept secret, but the subject of the portrait was revealed to be Williams shortly after the dollar was released.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Williams was troubled by her newly acquired fame, receiving thousands of letters and visits at both her home and workplace.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Williams preferred not to talk about her modelling work with Morgan, dismissing it as an "incident of my youth."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

'''Artificial philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] branch conceived by author Louis Molnar&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267156955_A_Step_Beyond_AI_Artificial_Philosophy "article: Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications", ResearchGate, (retrieved November 25, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; to consider what a being bestowed with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) might consider about its own [[existence]] once it reaches a higher state of [[consciousness]]. The author reasons in his dissertation that at some point, either through [[Computer_programming|programming]] or organic [[self-development]], [[robot]]s will not see themselves as extensions of those that created them, and that their saying "Who am I?" will not lead them to think of themselves as one with [[human]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1259">'''Byzantine rhetoric''' — of the [[Byzantine Empire]] — followed largely the precepts of ancient Greek rhetoricians, especially those belonging to the [[Second Sophistic]] that extended from the time of [[Augustus]] through the fifth century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Greek Literature |first=Gregory |last=Nagy |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-93771-X |pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rhetoric]] was the most important and difficult topic studied in the Byzantine education system, beginning at the  ''[[Pandidakterion]]'' in early fifth century [[Constantinople]], where the school emphasized the study of rhetoric with eight teaching chairs, five in Greek and three in Latin.&lt;ref name=jeffreys&gt;{{cite book|title=Rhetoric in Byzantium: Papers from the Thirty-Fifth Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies |first=Elizabeth |last=Jeffreys |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |pages=39–43 |isbn=0-7546-3453-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  '''''Calculus ratiocinator''''' is a theoretical universal logical calculation framework, a concept described in the writings of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], usually paired with his more frequently mentioned ''[[characteristica universalis]]'', a universal conceptual language.

==Two views==
There are two contrasting points of view on what Leibniz meant by ''calculus ratiocinator''. The first is associated with [[computer software]], the second is associated with [[computer hardware]].

=== The analytic view ===
*The received point of view in [[analytic philosophy]] and formal [[logic]], is that the ''calculus ratiocinator'' anticipates [[mathematical logic]]&amp;mdash;an "algebra of logic".&lt;ref&gt;Fearnley-Sander 1982: p.164&lt;/ref&gt; The analytic point of view understands that the ''calculus ratiocinator'' is a formal [[inference engine]]&lt;!--what makes an inference engine formal or informal--&gt; or [[computer program]], which can be designed so as to grant primacy to calculations. That logic began with [[Frege]]'s 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' and [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]]'s writings on logic in the 1880s. [[Frege]] intended his "concept script" to be a ''calculus ratiocinator'' as well as a ''[[lingua characteristica]]''. That part of formal logic relevant to the calculus comes under the heading of [[proof theory]]. From this perspective the ''calculus ratiocinator'' is only a part (or a subset) of the ''[[universal characteristic]]'', and a complete ''universal characteristic'' includes a "logical calculus".

=== The synthetic view ===
*A contrasting point of view stems from [[Herbert Spencer#Synthetic philosophy|synthetic philosophy]] and fields such as [[cybernetics]], [[electronic engineering]] and [[general systems theory]]. It is little appreciated in analytic philosophy. The synthetic view understands the ''calculus ratiocinator'' as referring to a "calculating machine". The cybernetician [[Norbert Wiener]] considered Leibniz's ''calculus ratiocinator'' a forerunner to the modern day digital computer:

{{cquote|The history of the modern computing machine goes back to Leibniz and Pascal. Indeed, the general idea of a computing machine is nothing but a mechanization of Leibniz's ''calculus ratiocinator''. (Wiener 1948: 214)}}

{{cquote|...like his predecessor Pascal, [Leibniz] was interested in the construction of computing machines in the Metal. ... just as the [[calculus of arithmetic]] lends itself to a mechanization progressing through the abacus and the desk computing machine to the utra-rapid computing machines of the present day, so the ''calculus ratiocinator'' of Leibniz contains the germs of the ''[[machina ratiocinatrix]]'', the reasoning machine (Wiener 1965: 12)}}

Leibniz constructed just such a machine for mathematical calculations, which was also called a [[Stepped Reckoner]]. As a computing machine, the ideal ''calculus ratiocinator'' would perform Leibniz's integral and differential calculus. In this way the meaning of the word, "ratiocinator" is clarified and can be understood as a mechanical instrument that combines and compares ratios.
&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;

File:Leibnitzrechenmaschine.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Hartley Rogers saw a link between the two, defining the ''calculus ratiocinator'' as "an algorithm which, when applied to the symbols of any formula of the characteristica universalis, would determine whether or not that formula were true as a statement of science" (Hartley Rogers, Jr. 1963; p.&amp;nbsp;934).

A classic discussion of the ''calculus ratiocinator'' is Couturat (1901: chapters 3 and 4), who maintained that the ''characteristica universalis''—and thus the ''calculus ratiocinator''—were inseparable from Leibniz's encyclopedic project (chapter 5). Hence the ''characteristic'', ''calculus ratiocinator'', and encyclopedia form three pillars of Leibniz's project.

'''Chronocentrism''' is the assumption that certain time periods (typically the [[present]]) are better, more important, or a more significant frame of reference than other time periods, either past or future.

==History==
Chronocentrism (from the Greek ''[[wikt:chrono-|chrono-]]'' meaning "time") was coined by sociologist Jib Fowles in an article in the journal ''Futures'' in February, 1974. Fowles described chronocentrism as "the belief that one's own times are paramount, that other periods pale in comparison".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fowles |first1=Jib |title=On Chronocentrism |work=Futures |volume=6 |number=1 |doi=10.1016/0016-3287(74)90008-1 |date=February 1974 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "the egotism that one's own generation is poised on the very cusp of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Standage |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Standage |title=[[The Victorian Internet|The Victorian Internet: The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century's On-line Pioneers]] |year=2007 |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |isbn=0-8027-1604-0 |pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term had been used earlier in a study about attitudes to ageing in the workplace. Chronocentricity: "...only seeing the value of one's own age cohort...described the tendency for younger managers to hold negative perceptions of the abilities or other work-related competencies of older employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyon |first1=Phil |last2=Pollard |first2=D|title=Perceptions of the older employee: is anything really changing?|journal=Personnel Review|volume=26 |number=4 |doi=10.1108/00483489710172051|date=1 January 1997 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discrimination is a form of [[ageism]].

==Ethnocentrism==

Chronocentrism as [[ethnocentrism]] is the perceiving and judging of a culture's historical values in terms of the standards of one's own time period.

==Antichronocentrism==

The [[Long Now Foundation]] is an organization that encourages the use of 5-digit years, e.g. "02016" instead of "2016," to help emphasize how early the present time is in their vision of the timeline of humanity.  The use of two-digit years before [[Y2K]] was an example of chronocentrism (in the early years of computing, the years 2000 and 1899 were believed to be too far in the future or the past, and thus of less importance than being able to save two digits in computerizing and typing out years).

==In science==
The "Copernican time principle" is a temporal analog of the [[Copernican principle]] for space, which states that no spatial location is any more or less special of a frame of reference than any other spatial location (i.e., that our physical universe has no center). Some authors have extended this to also include that no point in time is any more or less special than any other point in time (e.g., in outdated [[steady-state theories]]), though this cannot be universally applied (e.g., the [[Big-Bang singularity]] is a special point in time that can be logically used as a frame of reference to date later events.)

A '''closed-circle''' argument is one that is [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]].

[[Psychoanalytic]] theory, for example, is held up by the proponents of [[Karl Popper]] as an example of an [[ideology]] rather than a [[science]]. A patient regarded by his psychoanalyst as "[[in denial]]" about his [[sexual orientation]] may be viewed as confirming he is [[homosexual]] simply by denying that he is; and if he has had sex with women, he may be accused of trying to buttress his denials. In other words, there is no way the patient could convincingly demonstrate his heterosexuality to his analyst. This is an example of what Popper called a "closed circle": The proposition that the patient is homosexual is not falsifiable.

Closed-circle theory is sometimes used to denote a [[relativism|relativist]], [[anti-realism|anti-realist]] philosophy of science, such that different groups may have different self-consistent truth claims about the natural world.

A '''co-premise''' is a [[premise]] in [[reasoning]] and [[informal logic]] which is not the main supporting reason for a [[main contention|contention]] or a [[Lemma (logic)|lemma]], but is logically necessary to ensure the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of an [[argument]]. One premise by itself, or a group of co-premises can form a reason. 

== Logical structure ==

Every significant term or phrase appearing in a premise of a [[simple argument]], should also appear in the contention/conclusion or in a co-premise. But this by itself does not guarantee a valid argument, see the [[fallacy of the undistributed middle]] for an example of this.

Sometimes a co-premise will not be explicitly stated. This type of argument is known as an 'enthymematic' argument, and the co-premise may be referred to as a 'hidden' or an 'unstated' co-premise and will often be subject to an [[inference objection]]. In this [[argument map]] of a simple argument the two reasons for the main contention are co-premises and not separate reasons for believing the contention to be true. They are both necessary to ensure that the argument as a whole retains logical validity.

In this example, "What the Bible says is true" is a hidden co-premise.

'''{{lang|la|De se}}''' is Latin for "of oneself" and, in philosophy, it is a phrase used to mark off what some believe to be a category of ascription distinct from "[[De dicto and de re|''de dicto'' and ''de re'']]".

==Overview==
A sentence such as:  "Peter thinks that he is pale" where the pronoun "he" is meant to refer to Peter is ambiguous in a way not captured by the {{lang|la|[[de dicto]]}} / {{lang|la|[[de re]]}} distinction. Such a sentence could report that Peter has the following thought: "I am pale". Or Peter could have the following thought: "he is pale", where it so happens that the pronoun "he" refers to Peter, but Peter is unaware of it. The first meaning expresses a belief {{lang|la|de se}}, while the second does not.

This notion is now thoroughly discussed in the philosophical literature, but especially in the theoretical linguistic literature, the latter because some linguistic phenomena clearly are sensitive to this notion.

[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]'s 1979 article "Attitudes De Dicto and De Se" gave full birth to the topic, and his expression of it draws heavily on his distinctive theory of [[possible world]]s.

But modern discussions on this topic originate with Hector-Neri Casteñeda's discovery of what he called quasi indexicals (or “quasi-indicatorsl”): according to Casteñeda, the speaker of the sentence “Mary believes that she herself is  the winner” uses the quasi-indicator “she herself” (often written “she∗”) to express Mary’s first-person reference to herself (i.e., to Mary). That sentence would be the speaker’s way of depicting the proposition that Mary would unambiguously express in the first person by “I am the winner”.

A clearer case can be illustrated simply. Imagine the following scenario:

Peter, who is running for office, is drunk. He is watching an interview of a candidate on TV, not realizing that this candidate is himself. Liking what he hears, he says: "I hope this candidate gets elected." Having witnessed this, one can truthfully report Peter's hopes by uttering: "Peter hopes that he will get elected", where "he" refers to Peter, since "this candidate" indeed refers to Peter. However, one could not report Peter's hopes by saying: "Peter hopes to get elected". This last sentence is only appropriate if Peter had a {{lang|la|de se}} hope, that is a hope in the first person as if he had said "I hope I get elected", which is not the case here.

The study of the notion of belief ''de se'' thus includes that of quasi-indexicals, the linguistic theory of  [[logophoricity]] and logophoric pronouns, and the linguistic and literary theory of [[free indirect speech]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2607">'''Defeasibility''' is the property of something – such as a [[contract]], a [[proposition]] or an understanding – that can be [[annul]]led, [[Validity (logic)|invalidated]], or similarly "defeated". In [[law]], it refers to the possibility of a contract or other legal agreement being terminated by circumstances that arise later, or of legal reasoning being overturned. In [[philosophy]] – especially in [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], or the [[philosophy of law]] – it refers to the possibility of a particular principle, rule or understanding being overridden in appropriate circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=defeasibility |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |editor1-last=Bunnin |editor1-first=Nicholas |editor2-first=Jiyuan |editor2-last=Yu |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell |doi=10.1111/b.9781405106795.2004.x |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode.html?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067955_ss1-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pragmatics]], a subfield of [[linguistics]], it refers to the fact that certain kinds of implicitly conveyed information such as [[conversational implicature]]s and [[presupposition]]s can be "defeated" without sounding contradictory. For example, "[[Flag of Libya#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|This flag]] is green" normally implicates that it is ''completely'' green; but "[[Flag of Bangladesh|This flag]] is green. It contains a red disc" is no contradiction. Likewise, "John never stopped smoking" normally presupposes that he used to smoke (and still does), but you can say "John never stopped smoking because actually he never did smoke" without contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-22235-4 | last = Levinson | first = Stephen C. | title = Pragmatics | location = Cambridge | series = Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics | year = 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1568">'''Disciplinary institutions''' ([[French language|French]]: ''institution disciplinaire'') is a [[concept]] proposed by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975).  [[School]], [[prison]], [[barracks]], or the [[hospital]] are examples of historical disciplinary [[institution]]s, all created in their modern form in the 19th century with the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Discipline "cannot be identified with any one institution or apparatus," [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]] explains, "precisely because it is a type of [[Power (philosophy)|power]], a technology, that traverses every kind of apparatus or institution, linking them, prolonging them, and making them converge and function in a new way."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1986, 26).&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept may be related to the concept of "[[total institution]]" proposed by [[Erving Goffman]] in 1961, as well as to [[Louis Althusser]]'s [[Ideological State Apparatus]]es (ISA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">The '''Earth immune system''' is a controversial proposal, claimed to be a consequence of  the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. The Gaia hypothesis holds that the entire earth may be considered a single organism (Gaia). As a self-maintaining organism, Earth would have an [[immune system]] of some sort in order to maintain its health.

Some proponents of this speculative concept, for example, hold that [[human|humankind]] can be considered an "[[infection]]" of Gaia, and that [[AIDS]] is an attempt by this immune system to reject the infection. 
"[[Cancer]]" might be a more accurate term, as humans [[evolution|evolved]] within Gaia, and are not external invaders.
An opposite view is that humankind is Gaia's immune system itself, perhaps evolved to avert future catastrophes such as the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|Permian]] and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous]] [[mass extinction]]s of species.

[[James Lovelock]]'s book "[[The Revenge of Gaia]]" suggests that Gaia has many mechanisms for eliminating [[civilization]]s that do harm through [[greenhouse gas emission]]s and [[global warming]], but suggests that with increasing heat being received from the sun, Gaia's ability to "bounce back" as it did after the [[Permian]] and [[Cretaceous]] [[extinction]] events, may be increasingly compromised.

[[Paul Hawken]] suggests in ''[[Blessed Unrest]]'' that when Earth is considered a living system then Earth's immune system is made up of the million or so organizations all around the globe that are working for social justice, the environment, and indigenous people's rights. Many of these groups are linked through the Internet and other means so there is a vast network of interconnected people and groups working to protect the planet, its people, and all beings. For example, one organization that serves to link groups working on sustainable energy is Inforse in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inforse.org/ |title=International Network for Sustainable Energy |work=INFORSE |year=2015 |accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''eikasía''' ({{lang-grc|εἰκασία}}), meaning  imagination in Greek, was used by [[Plato]] to refer to a human way of dealing with appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?eikasia |title=eikasia |work=FOLDOC |accessdate=2006-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620035437/http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?eikasia |archivedate=2006-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the inability to perceive whether a [[perception]] is an [[image]] of something else. It therefore prevents us from perceiving that a [[dream]] or [[memory]] or a reflection in a [[mirror]] is not [[reality]] as such.

It is apart of [[Analogy of the divided line|Plato's Analogy of the Divided Line]].

In [[philosophy of science]], the '''empirical limits of science''' define problems with [[observation]], and thus are limits of human ability to inquire and answer questions about phenomena. These include topics such as [[infinity]], [[the future]] and [[god]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/scientific-experiments/scientific-method10.htm|agency=How Stuff Works|accessdate=6 March 2018|title=Limitations of the Scientific Method|author=William Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century several of these were well-documented or proposed in [[physics]]:

*The [[Planck length]] - actually a limit on [[distance]] itself.
*The [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[paradox]].
*The [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].
*The theorized [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole]] in [[special relativity]].
*The cosmological horizon of the [[observable universe]].

{{Italic title}}
'''''Esoteric Buddhism''''' is a book originally published in 1883 in London; it was compiled by a member of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]].{{sfn|Formats and editions}}{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=154}} It was one of the first books written for the purpose explain of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] for the wide range of readers,{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}} and was "made up of the [[Mahatma Letters|author's correspondence]] with an [[Koot Hoomi|Indian mystic]]."{{sfn|WorldCat Identities}} This is the most significant theosophical work of the author. According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]], it "disseminated the basic teachings of Theosophy in its new Asian cast."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|"His [Sinnett's] second book, ''Esoteric Buddhism,'' an outline of some of the main teachings of theosophy, attracted much attention and served as a harbinger of [[Helena Blavatsky|H.P.B.'s]] monumental work, ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}}}

== From history of compilation ==
Through the mediation of [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]]{{refn|group=note|P. Washington wrote that Blavatsky with Sinnett and his wife Patience has been in sincere friendship.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 3}}}} Sinnett began a correspondence in 1880 with the two adepts, who sponsored the Theosophical Society, the [[mahatma]]s [[Kuthumi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]].{{sfn|Theosopedia}}{{refn|group=note|Goodrick-Clarke wrote that "the very concept of the [[mahatma|Masters]]" is the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] idea of "invisible and secret adepts, working for the advancement of humanity."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=6}} And Tillett stated: "The concept of Masters or Mahatmas as presented by [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] involved a mixture of western and eastern ideas; she located most of them in India or Tibet. Both she and Colonel [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]] claimed to have seen and to be in communication with Masters. In Western [[occultism]] the idea of 'Supermen' has been found in such schools as... the fraternities established by [[Martinez de Pasqually|de Pasqually]] and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin|de Saint-Martin]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=966}}}} [[Olav Hammer|Hammer]] noted that between 1880 and 1884 Sinnett received from the mahatmas circa one hundred twenty letters with explanation of "[[occult]] cosmology". From this material, he attempted to formulate in his new book "the basis of a revised theosophy."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=381}} By foundation of the book became "Cosmological notes" received from the Mahatma Morya{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letters 12, 13}} together with a long series of answers to questions sent by mahatma Kuthumi{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letters 14–18}} during the summer of 1882.{{sfn|Hanson|1980|loc=Ch. IX}}&lt;br/&gt;[[Tallapragada Subba Row|Subba Row]] received from his Master mahatma Morya the instruction to provide assistance to Sinnett in his work on the book, but, according to the memoirs of the author, he did it reluctantly, and what little help. The main help came from the mahatmas through Blavatsky in the form of answers to the questions referred to her by the author.{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=23}}

In preface to the original edition author says that [[exoteric]] [[Buddhism]] "has remained in closer union with the [[esoteric]] doctrine" than any other [[Major religious groups|world religion]]. Thus, specification of the "inner knowledge" addressed to modern readers will be connected with the familiar features of the Buddhist teaching. Sinnett argues that esoteric teaching "be most conveniently studied in its Buddhist aspect."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=xviii}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=123}}

=== Esoteric teachers ===
At the beginning of the first chapter the author makes the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am bringing to my readers knowledge which I have obtained by favour{{refn|group=note|[[Mahatma Letters|Letters from mahatmas]] formed the basis of two theosophical books by Sinnett.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=61}}}} rather than by effort. It will not be found the less valuable on that account; I venture, on the contrary, to declare that it will be found of incalculably greater value, easily as I have obtained it, than any results in a similar direction which I could possibly have procured by ordinary methods of research."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=1|Лесевич|1887|2p=16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the question of the whereabouts of his teachers Sinnett says that for a long time in [[Tibet]] there is a "certain secret region," hitherto unknown and inaccessible to ordinary people and for those living in the surrounding mountains as well as for visitors, "in which adepts have always congregated. But the country generally was not in Buddha's time, as it has since become, the chosen habitation of the great brotherhood. Much more than they are at present, were the Mahatmas in former times, distributed about the world." But the development of civilization has led to the fact that many occultists gathered in Tibet. The system of rules and laws for them has been developed in the 14th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsong-ka-pa]].{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=181–182}}{{sfn|Lopez|1999|p=50}}

=== The constitution of man ===
The author argues that "a complete, or perfect man" is made up of [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven elements]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#The [[Physical body|Physical Body]] (''[[Rūpa]]'').
#Vitality (''[[Prana]]'', or ''Jiva'').
#[[Subtle body|Astral Body]] (''Linga Sharira'').
#Animal [[Soul]] ([[Kāma|''Kāma Rūpa'']]).
#Human Soul ([[Manas (early Buddhism)|''Manas'']]).
#Spiritual Soul (''[[Buddhi]]'').
#[[Spirit]] ([[Ātman (Buddhism)|''Ātma'']]).{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=24|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|2p=17}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The world periods ===
A French philosopher [[René Guénon]] stated that the central place of the Theosophical doctrine [which there is in Sinnett's book] is occupied the "idea of evolution." He then wrote that, according to the Theosophical teaching, there are
&lt;blockquote&gt;"seven '[[Root race|mother-races]]' succeed one another in the course of a 'world period', that is to say while the 'wave of life' sojourns on a given planet. Each 'race' includes seven 'sub-races', each of which is divided into seven 'branches'. On the other hand, the 'wave of life' successively runs through seven globes in a '[[Round (Theosophy)|round]]', and this 'round' is repeated seven times in a same 'planetary chain', after which the 'wave of life' passes to another 'chain', composed likewise of seven planets which will be traversed seven times in their turn. Thus there are seven 'chains' in a 'planetary system', also called an 'enterprise of evolution'; and finally, our solar system is formed of ten 'planetary systems'... We are presently in the fifth 'race' of our 'world period', and in the fourth 'round' of the 'chain' of which the earth forms part and in which it occupies the fourth rank. This 'chain' is also the fourth of our 'planetary system'."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1pp=55, 131|Guénon|2004|2p=98}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Man after death ===
In the fifth chapter of his book, Sinnett explains the fate of man after death. Of the seven components that make up our personality, the three lower at the time of physical death, moving away from us.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=77}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}} The four upper components move on [[Astral plane|Kama loca]], and "from there [soul] proceed to Devachan, a kind of theosophical version of heaven." (The analogy should not be carried overly; Sinnett argues that Devachan is a state, not a place.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=81}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}}) Then these four components divide themselves, the law of [[karma]] specifies that it will happen to them—different souls receive different devachanic experience. Only after a long stay in this state, the soul [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reincarnates]].{{refn|group=note|"The lower four, or quaternary, are transitory, while the upper triad is related to the eternal element in man, his real nature and identity with the universal soul."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=24}}{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=17}}}} New incarnations on the [[Physical plane|earth plane]] are actually rather rare, "but re-birth in less than fifteen hundred years is spoken of as almost impossible."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=98}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}}

Sinnett says that the mediums contact with the inhabitants of Devachan, but very rare, and in this time occurs the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The spirit of the [[Psychic|sensitive]], getting odylized,{{sfn|Melton|2001}} so to say, by the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of the spirit in the Devachan, ''becomes'' for a few minutes that departed personality, and writes in the handwriting of the latter, in his language and in his thoughts, as they were during his lifetime. The two spirits become blended in one, and the preponderance of one over the other during such phenomena determines the preponderance of personality in the characteristic exhibited. Thus it may incidentally be observed, what is called ''[[rapport]],'' is, in plain fact, an identity of molecular vibration between the astral part of the incarnate medium and the astral part of the disincarnate personality."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=95|Hammer|2003|2p=467}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult philosophy ===
[[File:Man on planet.jpg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Diagram "Man on a Planet".{{refn|group=note|"Man evolves in seven major or root-races; 49 minor races; and the subordinate races or offshoots. The arrow indicates the direction taken by the evolutionary impulse.&lt;br/&gt;
I, II, III, IV, etc., are the seven major or [[root race|root-races]].&lt;br/&gt;
1, 2, 3, etc., are the minor races.&lt;br/&gt;
a, a, a, are the subordinate or offshoot races.&lt;br/&gt;
N, the initial and terminal point of evolution on the planet.&lt;br/&gt; 
S, the axial point where the development equilibrates or adjusts itself in each race evolution.&lt;br/&gt; 
E, the equatorial points wherein the descending arc intellect overcomes spirituality and in the ascending arc spirituality outstrips intellect.&lt;br/&gt;
A word or two [globe, earth] added to make it apply as well  to a whole manwantaric chain of worlds."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Lavoie noted that in Sinnett's book there are the two major questions – "the structure of the universe and [[spiritual evolution]]." He selected "some key terms" in the book.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}

[[Avīci|'''Avitchi''']] is a state "of punishment reached only in exceptional cases and by exceptional natures." The usual man will work his karma out in a new [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|incarnation]].{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=93}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Sukhavati|'''Devachan''']] is a state of greatest bliss where "the levels of intensity and the duration of stay are based on the karma one produces in his/her lifetime."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=92}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''Eighth sphere''' is a planet associated with our planetary chain that is more materialistic than the earth.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=113}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}} The Soul in the mean of the fifth round "can be sent to the eighth sphere for annihilation if it has developed a positive attraction to materialism and a repulsion of spirituality."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=162}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Astral plane|'''Kama loca''']] is "an unconscious state of gestation. It is here that the fourth principle (the animal soul) is separated from the others." The fourth component and some of the fifth component stays in Kama loca while "the rest of the principles continue on in their spiritual evolution."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=100–101}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}} The Ego's duration in Kama loca can last from few moments to years.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=97}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''[[Manvantara]]''' is a period of activity or manifestation.{{sfn|Glossary|1999}} There are three different manvantaras: 1) the mahamanvantara, 2) the solar manvantara, 3) the minor manvantara.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Monad (philosophy)|'''Monad''']] is upper triad of the seven principles of man (Atma-Buddhi-Manas).{{sfn|Glossary|1999}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''[[Pralaya]]''' is a state of nonbeing.{{sfn|Glossary|1999}} "Pralaya is described by Sinnett as a type of sleep, rest, or a time of inactivity." There are three different pralayas: 1) the mahapralaya, 2) the solar pralaya, 3) the minor pralaya.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Round (Theosophy)|'''Round''']] is a full turnover via the seven globes. "During each round there is a maximum of 120 incarnations for each monad in each race with the average of 8,000 years between incarnations."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=143}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}

Man begins as a monad and dwells in seven major races on each of the seven planets. Each race takes circa one million years. Only 12,000 of those will be used for objective existence on the planets. The rest of that time will be used mainly in a subjective existence on the [[Mental plane|devachanic plane]]. "This meant that out of one million years – 988,000 years are spent reaping the effects of karma."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=142–143}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=199}}{{refn|group=note|In ''Mahatma Letters'' (letter 14) this number is "slightly different."{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=244}} The letter states that man "has passed in all his lives upon our planet (in this Round) but 77,700 years he has been in the subjective spheres 922,300 years."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}}} A branch race is one of seven belonging to a subrace, itself one of seven belonging to a main race. "If each monad in each race incarnates once, the total number of incarnations in each globe would be 343 (7 branch races x 7 subraces x 7 [[root race]]s); however, each monad incarnates typically at a minimum of two times and some even more frequently."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=60–61, 140}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=199}} In ''Mahatma Letters'' it is said that "one life in each of the seven root-races; seven lives in each of the 49 sub-races – or 7 x 7 x 7 = 343 and add 7 more. And then a series of lives in offshoot and branchlet races; making the total incarnations of man in each station or planet 777."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=244}}

=== Theosophical Buddha ===
The ninth chapter of Sinnett's book called "Buddha". It begins with the words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The historical Buddha, as known to the custodians of the esoteric doctrine, is a personage whose birth is not invested with the quaint marvels popular story has crowded round it. Nor was his progress to adeptship traced by the literal occurrence of the supernatural struggles depicted in symbolic legend. On the other hand, the incarnation, which may outwardly be described as the birth of Buddha, is certainly not regarded by occult science as an event like any other birth, nor the spiritual development through which Buddha passed during his earth-life a mere process of intellectual evolution, like the mental history of any other philosopher. The mistake which ordinary European writers make in dealing with a problem of this sort lies in their inclination to treat exoteric legend either as a record of a miracle about which no more need be said, or as pure myth, putting merely a fantastic decoration on a remarkable life."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=167|Lopez|2008|2pр=187–188}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Lopez]], author of ''Esoteric Buddhism'' "has a broader view of the Buddha" than that of Western Buddhologists and scholars of Oriental studies. Sinnett stated that the Buddha is simply one of a row "of adepts who have appeared over the course of the centuries."{{Sfn|Lopez|2008|p=189}} Buddha's next incarnation happened approximately sixty years after his death. He appeared as [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], the well-known Vedantic philosopher. Sinnett noted that for the uninitiated it is known that date of Shankara's birth is one thousand years after Buddha's death, and that he was hostile to Buddhism. Sinnett wrote that the Buddha came as Shankara "to fill up some gaps and repair certain errors in his own previous teaching."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=176}} The Buddha had leaved "from the practice of earlier adepts by opening the path" to adeptship to men of all [[caste]]s. "Although well-intentioned, this led" to a deterioration of occult knowledge when it was penetrated into ignominious hands.{{Sfn|Lopez|2008|p=189}} Sinnett wrote that to further appeared a need "to take no candidates except from the class which, on the whole, by reason of its hereditary advantages, is likely to be the best nursery of fit candidates."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=177}}&lt;br/&gt;Sinnett claimed that the  Buddha's next incarnation was as the great Tibetan adept reformer of the 14th century Tsong-ka-pa.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=181}}

=== Against blind faith ===
In the tenth chapter Sinnett expresses (as well as the Mahatmas) his very negative attitude to religiosity of any kind. He argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nothing can produce more disastrous effects on human progress, as regards the destiny of individuals, than the very prevalent notion that one religion followed out in a pious spirit, is as good as another, and that if such and such doctrines are perhaps absurd when you look into them, the great majority of good people will never think of their absurdity, but will recite them in a blamelessly devoted attitude of mind."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1pp=194–195|Guénon|2004|2p=126}}{{refn|group=note|"It is priestly imposture that rendered these gods so terrible to man; it is religion that makes of him the selfish bigot, the fanatic that hates all mankind out of his own sect without rendering him any better or more moral for it. It is the belief in God and gods that makes two-thirds of humanity the slaves of a handful of those who deceive them under the false pretence of saving them. &lt;...&gt; In our [Tibetan] temples there is neither a god nor gods worshipped, only the thrice sacred memory of the greatest as the holiest [[Gautama Buddha|''man'']] that ever lived."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 10}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
The presence of a secret or esoteric teaching in Buddhism is "not accepted by orthodox Buddhist."{{sfn|Harris}} For example, [[Thomas Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In this connection, I shall doubtless be expected to say a few words on Theosophy, if only because one of the books giving an account of that very curious and widely spread movement has been called ''Esoteric Buddhism.'' It has always been a point of wonder to me why the author should have chosen this particular title for his treatise. For if there is anything that can be said with absolute certainty about the book it is, that it is not esoteric, and not Buddhism. The original Buddhism was the very contrary of esoteric."{{sfn|Rhys Davids|1896|pp=209–210}}{{refn|group=note|Nonetheless [[Christmas Humphreys|Humphreys]] wrote that "Buddha's Teaching was not born from a spiritual vacuum, but was an expression of some portion of that Gupta Vidya 'the accumulated Wisdom of the ages', which antedates all known religions."{{sfn|Humphreys|2012|p=23}}&lt;br/&gt;
"'''Gupta-vidya''' (Sanskrit) ''Gupta-vidyā'' [from ''gupta'' from the verbal root ''gup'' to conceal, preserve + ''vidyā'' knowledge, wisdom] Secret knowledge, secret wisdom; the source of all religions and philosophies known to the world: theosophy, the ancient wisdom-religion, the esoteric philosophy."{{sfn|Glossary|1999}}}}{{refn|group=note|Sinnett received instructions from the Tibetan Masters, and Rhys Davids believed that [[Lamaism]] was a Religion not only different from Buddhism, but and being in his time in antagonism with the teachings and the institutions of original Buddhism.{{sfn|Лесевич|1887|p=16}} See also a book by Eva M. Dargyay{{sfn|Dargyay|1979}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[René Guénon|Guénon's]] opinion on the subject was the same. He wrote that never was genuine "esoteric Buddhism." The ancient Buddhism was substantially an exoteric teaching "serving as theoretical support for a social movement with egalitarian tendencies."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=93}} According to Guénon, Sinnett, who "at the beginning probably contributed more than anybody else to make [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophism]] known in Europe, was genuinely fooled by all of Mme Blavatsky's tricks."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}}

Some Theosophists did not share the views presented by Sinnett in his new work; for example, according to [[Anna Kingsford|Kingsford]], this book was very distant from the esoteric, and the main mistake of the author was that he thought about the symbols as reality.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 4}}

== New editions and translations ==
After its first publication in 1883 the book was reprinted several times: in the same 1883 came 2nd edition, in 1885 – 5th, 1898 – 8th. This work has been translated into several European languages: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian.{{sfn|Formats and editions}}{{refn|group=note|"153 editions published between 1883 and 2016 in 8 languages and held by 610 WorldCat member libraries worldwide".{{sfn|WorldCat Identities}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">The '''faculties of the soul''' are the individual characteristics of a [[soul]].  There have been different attempts to define them over the centuries.

==Plato, Aristotle and their followers==

[[Plato]] defined the faculties of the soul in terms of a three-fold division: the intellect (''noûs''), the nobler affections (''thumós''), and the appetites or passions (''epithumetikón'')&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Faculties of the Soul}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aristotle]] also made a three-fold division of natural faculties, into vegetative, appetitive and rational elements,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 88-90&lt;/ref&gt; though he later distinguished further divisions in the rational faculty, such as the faculty of judgement and that of cleverness (deinotes).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 218-222&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic philosophers continued his three-fold division;&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Hawi, ''Islamic Naturalism and Mysticism'' (1974) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  but later Scholastic philosophers defined five groups of faculties:&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Faculties of the Soul|Faculties of the Soul]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* dunámeis - the "vegetative" faculty (threptikón), concerned with the maintenance and development of organic life
* the appetite (oretikón), or the tendency to any good
* the faculty of sense perception (aisthetikón)
* the "locomotive" faculty (kinetikón), which presides over the various bodily movements
* reason (dianoetikón)

==Calvin==
[[John Calvin]] opposed the scholastic philosophers, favoring a two-fold division of the soul, consisting of intellect and of will.&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'' (2008) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty psychology==
The secularisation of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] produced a [[faculty psychology]] of different but inherent mental powers such as intelligence or memory, distinct (as in Aristotelianism) from the acquired habits.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gregory, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 253-4&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2398">'''Fictionalism''' is the view in [[philosophy]] according to which statements that appear to be descriptions of the world should not be construed as such, but should instead be understood as cases of "make believe", of pretending to treat something as literally true (a "useful fiction"). Two important strands of fictionalism are [[modal fictionalism]] developed by [[Gideon Rosen]], which states that [[possible worlds]], regardless of whether they exist or not, may be a part of a useful discourse, and [[Philosophy of mathematics#Fictionalism|mathematical fictionalism]] advocated by [[Hartry Field]], which states that talk of numbers and other mathematical objects is nothing more than a convenience for doing science. Also in [[meta-ethics]], there is an equivalent position called moral fictionalism (championed by [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]]). Many modern versions of fictionalism are influenced by the work of [[Kendall Walton]] in aesthetics.

Fictionalism consists in at least the following three theses:
# Claims made within the [[domain of discourse]] are taken to be [[truth-apt]]; that is, true or false
# The domain of discourse is to be interpreted at face value—not reduced to meaning something else 
# The aim of discourse in any given domain is not truth, but some other virtue(s) (e.g., simplicity, explanatory scope).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8157">'''Fitch's paradox of knowability''' is one of the fundamental puzzles of [[epistemic logic]]. It provides a challenge to the ''knowability thesis'', which states that every truth is, in principle, knowable. The [[paradox]] is that this assumption implies the ''omniscience principle'', which asserts that every truth is known. Essentially, Fitch's paradox asserts that the existence of an unknown truth is unknowable. So if all truths were knowable, it would follow that all truths are in fact known.

The paradox is of concern for [[verificationist]] or [[anti-realist]] accounts of truth, for which the ''knowability thesis'' is very plausible,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/MLLETO|title=Epistemic theories of truth: The justifiability paradox investigated|date=1996|last=Müller|first=Vincent C. W|author2=Stein, Christian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the omniscience principle is very implausible.

The paradox appeared as a minor [[theorem]] in a 1963 paper by [[Frederic Brenton Fitch|Frederic Fitch]], "A Logical Analysis of Some Value Concepts". Other than the knowability thesis, his proof makes only modest assumptions on the [[modal operator|modal]] nature of [[knowledge]] and of [[subjunctive possibility|possibility]]. He also generalised the proof to different modalities. It resurfaced in 1979 when [[W. D. Hart]] wrote that Fitch's proof was an "unjustly neglected logical gem".

== Proof ==
Suppose ''p'' is a sentence that is an ''unknown truth''; that is, the sentence ''p'' is true, but it is not ''known'' that ''p'' is true.  In such a case, the sentence "the sentence ''p'' is an unknown truth" is true; and, if all truths are knowable, it should be possible to know that "''p'' is an unknown truth". But this isn't possible, because as soon as we know "''p'' is an unknown truth", we know that ''p'' is true, rendering ''p'' no longer an ''unknown'' truth, so the statement "''p'' is an unknown truth" becomes a falsity.  Hence, the statement "''p'' is an unknown truth" cannot be both known and true at the same time.  Therefore, if all truths are knowable, the set of "all truths" must not include any of the form "''something'' is an unknown truth"; thus there must be no unknown truths, and thus all truths must be known.

This can be formalised with [[modal logic]]. '''K''' and '''L''' will stand for ''known'' and ''possible'', respectively. Thus '''LK''' means ''possibly known'', in other words, ''knowable''. The modality rules used are:

{|
|- 
|(A)
| '''K'''''p'' → ''p'' || – knowledge [[material conditional|implies]] truth.
|-
|(B)|| '''K'''(''p'' &amp; ''q'') → ('''K'''''p'' &amp; '''K'''''q'') || – knowing a [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] implies knowing each conjunct.
|-
|(C)|| ''p'' → '''LK'''''p'' || – all truths are knowable.
|-
|(D)|| from ¬''p'', deduce ¬'''L'''''p'' || – if ''p'' can be proven false without assumptions, then ''p'' is impossible (which is similar to the [[rule of necessitation]]: if ''p'' can be proven true without assumptions, then ''p'' is [[logical truth|necessarily true]]).
|}

The proof proceeds:

{|
|- 
|1. Suppose '''K'''(''p'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''p'') 
|- 
|2. '''K'''''p'' &amp; '''K'''¬'''K'''''p'' || from line 1 by rule (B)
|-
|3. '''K'''''p'' || from line 2 by [[conjunction elimination]]
|-
|4. '''K'''¬'''K'''''p'' || from line 2 by conjunction elimination
|-
|5. ¬'''K'''''p'' || from line 4 by rule (A)
|- 
|6. ¬'''K'''(''p'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''p'') || from lines 3 and 5 by [[reductio ad absurdum]], discharging assumption 1
|- 
|7. ¬'''LK'''(''p'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''p'') || from line 6 by rule (D)
|- 
|8. Suppose ''p'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''p'' 
|- 
|9. '''LK'''(''p'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''p'') || from line 8 by rule (C)
|- 
|10. ¬(''p'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''p'') || from lines 7 and 9 by reductio ad absurdum, discharging assumption 8.
|-
|11. ''p'' → '''K'''''p'' || from line 10 by a classical [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]
|}

The last line states that if ''p'' is true then it is known. Since nothing else about ''p'' was assumed, it means that every truth is known.

=== Generalisations ===
The proof uses minimal assumptions about the nature of '''K''' and '''L''', so other modalities can be substituted for "known". Joe Salerno gives the example of "caused by God": rule (C) becomes that every true fact ''could have been'' caused by God, and the conclusion is that every true fact ''was'' caused by God. Rule (A) can also be weakened to include modalities that don't imply truth. For instance instead of "known" we could have the [[doxastic logic|doxastic]] modality "believed by a rational person" (represented by '''B'''). Rule (A) is replaced with:

{|
|- 
|(E)
| '''B'''''p'' → '''BB'''''p'' || – rational belief is transparent; if ''p'' is rationally believed, then it is rationally believed that ''p'' is rationally believed.
|-
|(F)|| ¬('''B'''''p'' &amp; '''B'''¬''p'') || – rational beliefs are consistent
|}

This time the proof proceeds:

{|
|- 
|1. Suppose '''B'''(''p'' &amp; ¬'''B'''''p'') 
|- 
|2. '''B'''''p'' &amp; '''B'''¬'''B'''''p'' || from line 1 by rule (B)
|-
|3. '''B'''''p'' || from line 2 by conjunction elimination
|-
|4. '''BB'''''p'' || from line 3 by rule (E)
|-
|5. '''B'''¬'''B'''''p'' || from line 2 by conjunction elimination
|-
|6. '''BB'''''p'' &amp; '''B'''¬'''B'''''p'' || from lines 4 and 5 by [[conjunction introduction]]
|-
|7. ¬('''BB'''''p'' &amp; '''B'''¬'''B'''''p'') || by rule (F)
|-
|8. ¬'''B'''(''p'' &amp; ¬'''B'''''p'') || from lines 6 and 7 by [[reductio ad absurdum]], discharging assumption 1
|}

The last line matches line 6 in the previous proof, and the remainder goes as before. So if any true sentence could possibly be believed by a rational person, then that sentence is believed by one or more rational persons.

Some anti-realists advocate the use of [[intuitionistic logic]]; however, except for the very last line, which moves from ''there are no unknown truths'' to ''all truths are known'', the proof is, in fact, intuitionistically valid.

== The knowability thesis ==
Rule (C) is generally held to be at fault rather than any of the other logical principles employed. It may be contended that this rule does not faithfully translate the idea that all truths are knowable, and that rule (C) should not apply unrestrictedly. Kvanvig contends that this represents an illicit substitution into a modal context.

[[Gödel's Theorem]] proves that in any recursively axiomatized system sufficient to derive mathematics (e.g. Peano Arithmetic), there are statements which are undecidable. In that context, it is difficult to state that "all truths are knowable" since some potential truths are uncertain.

However, jettisoning the knowability thesis does not necessarily solve the paradox, since one can substitute a weaker version of the knowability thesis called (C').
{|
| (C')|| ∃''x''((''x'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''x'') &amp; '''LK'''''x'') &amp; '''LK'''((''x'' &amp; ¬'''K'''''x'') &amp; '''LK'''''x'') || – There is an unknown, but knowable truth, and it is knowable that there is an unknown, but knowable truth.
|}
The same argument shows that (C') results in contradiction, indicating that all knowable truths are known; conversely, it states that if a truth is unknown, then it is unknowable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4462">'''Franz August Schmölders''' (28 November 1809 in [[Rhede]], [[Münsterland]] &amp;ndash; 21 February 1880 in [[Breslau]]) was a German orientalist. His focus was the Arabic language and literature.

==Education==
Schmölders studied from 1830 on philosophy and theology at the [[University of Bonn]]. Under the influence of professors Christian August Brandis, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Freytag, Christian Lassen and August Wilhelm Schlegel, he soon concentrated on the oriental, especially Arabic philosophy. He learned to Hebrew, Arabic, Avestan, Persian Syriac and Sanskrit.

During his studies Schmölders dealt especially with the Arabic translations of the writings of Aristotle. In 1835, he won with a text edition of the works of the Indian philosopher Bhartrihari the price of the Faculty of Arts. On 22 July 1836 he was a Dr. phil. PhD.

A scholarship from the Prussian Academy of Sciences allowed Schmölders after studying one-half-year stay in Paris, where he deepened his studies. He attended lectures by the great French Arabist [[silvestre de Sacy]], [[Joseph Toussaint Reinaud]] (1795-1867) and [[Pierre Amédée Jaubert]]. During his time in Paris he wrote his first book in French, in which he discussed the history of philosophy among the Arabs. It was published in 1842 by the publisher Firmin Didot. Shortly thereafter came Schmölders back to Bonn and performed his habilitation there.

== University career ==
On 22 December 1842 Schmölders held his inaugural lecture at the [[University of Bonn]]. As a lecturer, he was able to receive a steady income. The Prussian Minister Johann Albrecht Friedrich Eichhorn supported him with scholarships. After only one and a half years (1844) Schmölders became an Associate Professor of Oriental Languages and Literatures at the University of Breslau. He followed this calling on 29 June 1844.

In Breslau, Schmölders spent 16 years as university scholar and as a teacher. He provided part-time lesssons in Hebrew and French  at Matthew Gymnasium and taught with official permission also an English course, in which he tutored gifted students. On 1 May 1846 he became a full member in the German Oriental Society.

After the death of his older colleague Georg Heinrich Bernstein (1860) Schmölders received on 10 October's full professor of Oriental Studies. Thus he was able to quit his teaching at the high school. He worked for twenty years as a professor at the University and received during this time many honors at home and abroad.

== Further activities and heritage ==
Because of his language skills - he mastered 22 languages - Schmölders was in high demand outside the university. As a member of the Scientific Examination committee, he took exams in English and French. He worked as a sworn interpreter in court, e.g. the royal Appellate. His many obligations, his keen interest in teaching and an abdominal illness prevented him since the 1860s from further publications. His grandson [[Günter Schmölders]] became professor for economics in Breslau and Cologne, his grand-granddaughter [[Claudia Schmölders]] an author and cultural scholar in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schmoelders-stiftung.de/guenter-schmoelders/|title=Günter Schmölders – Schmölders Stiftung|website=www.schmoelders-stiftung.de|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Günter, Schmölders: Gut durchgekommen?“ Lebenserinnerungen.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born on 15 December 1923, at [[Crowthorne]] in [[Berkshire]], Dyson is the son of the English composer [[George Dyson (composer)|George Dyson]], who was later knighted. His mother had a law degree, and after Dyson was born she worked as a social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/quarkpark_dyson.php |title=The Scientist as Rebel |access-date=5 December 2017}} Wild River Review Interview by Joy E. Stocke&lt;/ref&gt; Although not known to be related to the early 20th-century astronomer [[Frank Watson Dyson]], as a small boy Dyson was aware of him and has credited the popularity of an astronomer sharing his surname with helping to spark his own interest in science.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson. From Eros to Gaia 1992 p.vii&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of five he calculated the number of atoms in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |medium=Video |title=Greatest Mysteries of the Cold War: America's Interplanetary Spaceship (Project Orion) |publisher=BBC Four}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he showed an interest in large numbers and in the solar system, and was strongly influenced by the book ''[[Men of Mathematics]]'' by [[Eric Temple Bell]].&lt;ref name=wired20140331 /&gt; Politically, Dyson says he was "brought up as a socialist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ghodsee | first = Kristen | year = 2015 | title = The Left Side of History: World War II and the Unfulfilled Promise of Communism in Eastern Europe | location = Durham, NC | publisher = Duke University Press | page = 5 | isbn = 978-0-822-35823-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1936 to 1941, Dyson was a Scholar at [[Winchester College]], where his father was Director of Music. At age 17 he studied mathematics with [[G.H. Hardy]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (where he won a scholarship at age 15) and at age 19 was assigned to war work in the [[Operations research#Second World War|Operational Research Section]] (ORS) of the Royal Air Force's [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]],&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|last=Dyson|first=Freeman|title=A Failure of Intelligence|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/article/406789/a-failure-of-intelligence/|website=MIT Technology Review Magazine|publisher=MIT Technology Review|access-date=20 October 2013|date=1 November 2006|quote=Prominent physicist Freeman Dyson recalls the time he spent developing analytical methods to help the British Royal Air Force bomb German targets during World War II.}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he developed analytical methods to help the Royal Air Force bomb German targets during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt; After the war, Dyson was readmitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;''Fractals in Physics: Essays in Honour of Benoit B. Mandelbrot : Proceedings of the International Conference Honouring Benoit B. Mandelbrot on His 65th Birthday, Vence, France, 1–4 October 1989'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in mathematics.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Freeman Dyson|url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/dyson/|website=Institute for Advanced Study, School of Natural Sciences|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1946 to 1949, he was a [[Fellow]] of his college, occupying rooms just below those of the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who resigned his professorship in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (10 Nov 2011) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/nov/08/what-can-you-really-know/?pagination=false "What Can You Really Know"], [[New York Review of Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Dyson published two papers in [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Approximation to Algebraic Numbers by Rationals," Acta Mathematica (Uppsala), 89, 1947, pp. 225–240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"On Simultaneous Diophantine Approximations," Proceedings of the London
Mathematical Society, Series 2, 49, 1947, pp. 409–420.&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and colleagues describe him as shy and self-effacing, with a contrarian streak that his friends find refreshing but his intellectual opponents find exasperating. "I have the sense that when consensus is forming like ice hardening on a lake, Dyson will do his best to chip at the ice", [[Steven Weinberg]] said of him. His friend, the neurologist and author [[Oliver Sacks]], said: "A favourite word of Freeman's about doing science and being creative is the word 'subversive'. He feels it's rather important not only to be not orthodox, but to be subversive, and he's done that all his life."&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dawidoff |first=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=magazine |title=The Civil Heretic |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|reason=How does the following pertain to character?|date=November 2013}}

===Career in the United States===
On [[G. I. Taylor]]'s advise and recommendation, Dyson moved to the United States in 1947 as a Commonwealth Fellow to earn a physics doctorate with [[Hans Bethe]] at [[Cornell University]] (1947–48).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject= Freeman Dyson |interviewer=Finn Aaserud |title=Freeman Dyson |url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4585 |publisher=American Institute of Physics |location=Princeton, New Jersey |date=17 December 1986 |work=Oral History Interviews }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = QED and the Men Who Made It|last = Schweber|first = Silvan S.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Princeton, NJ|pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=61n5dE7FJQgC&amp;pg=492 392ff]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week, however, he had made the acquaintance of [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlaPLvETBug|title = Freeman Dyson: A 'Rebel' Without a Ph.D|last = |first = |date = 11 June 2015|language = |at = Event at 1:17 |publisher = Quanta Magazine|access-date = 20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budding English physicist recognized the brilliance of the flamboyant American, and attached himself as quickly as possible. He then moved to the Institute for Advanced Study (1948–49), before returning to England (1949–51), where he was a research fellow at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |publisher=The American Institute of Physics |access-date=23 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017131442/http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson never got his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree.

In 1949, Dyson demonstrated the equivalence of two then-current formulations of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED): [[Richard Feynman]]'s diagrams and the operator method developed by [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Shin'ichirō Tomonaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson|title= The radiation theories of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=75|pages=486–502|year=1949|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.486|issue=3|bibcode = 1949PhRv...75..486D }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first person after their creator to appreciate the power of [[Feynman diagram]]s, and his paper written in 1948 and published in 1949 was the first to make use of them. He said in that paper that Feynman diagrams were not just a computational tool, but a physical theory, and developed rules for the diagrams that completely solved the [[renormalization]] problem. Dyson's paper and also his lectures presented Feynman's theories of QED in a form that other physicists could understand, facilitating the physics community's acceptance of Feynman's work. [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], in particular, was persuaded by Dyson that Feynman's new theory was as valid as Schwinger's and Tomonaga's. Oppenheimer rewarded Dyson with a lifetime appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study, "for proving me wrong", in Oppenheimer's words.&lt;ref name="Dyson, F.J. 1979"/&gt;

Also in 1949, in related work, Dyson invented the [[Dyson series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson|title= The S matrix in quantum electrodynamics|journal=[[Phys. Rev.]]|volume=75|pages=1736–1755|year=1949|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.1736|issue=11|bibcode = 1949PhRv...75.1736D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this paper that inspired [[John Clive Ward|John Ward]] to derive his celebrated [[Ward–Takahashi identity#The Ward identity|Ward identity]].&lt;ref name="qeid-jw-1950"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=J. C. Ward|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=78|page=182|year=1950|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..182W |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.78.182|title=An Identity in Quantum Electrodynamics|issue=2 }}. [Note: this Ward letter opens with "It has been recently proven by Dyson&amp;nbsp;..."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Dyson joined the faculty at Cornell as a physics professor, although still lacking a doctorate, and in 1953, he received a permanent post at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where he has now lived for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt; In 1957, he became a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] of the United States and renounced his [[British nationality law|British nationality]]. One reason he gave decades later is that his children born in the United States had not been recognized as British subjects.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abjure" /&gt;

From 1957 to 1961, he worked on [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]], which proposed the possibility of space-flight using [[nuclear pulse propulsion]]. A prototype was demonstrated using [[Explosive material|conventional explosives]], but the 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|Partial Test Ban Treaty]], in which Dyson was involved and supported, permitted only [[underground nuclear weapons testing]], so the project was abandoned.

In 1958, he led the design team for the [[TRIGA]], a small, inherently safe [[nuclear reactor]] used throughout the world in hospitals and universities for the production of [[Isotopes in medicine|medical isotopes]].

A seminal paper by Dyson came in 1966, when, together with Andrew Lenard and independently of [[Elliott H. Lieb]] and [[Walter Thirring]], he proved rigorously that the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] plays the main role in the stability of bulk matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson, A. Lenard|journal=[[J. Math. Phys.]]|volume=8|issue=3|pages=423–434|year=1967|doi=10.1063/1.1705209|title=Stability of Matter.

In [[condensed matter physics]], Dyson also analysed the phase transition of the [[Ising model]] in 1 dimension and [[spin wave]]s.&lt;ref name=SelectedPapers&gt;F. J. Dyson, E. H. Lieb, ''Selected papers by Freeman Dyson'', AMS (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyson also did work in a variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and [[Random matrix|random matrices]].&lt;ref name="SelectedPapers" /&gt; There is an interesting story involving random matrices. In 1973, the number theorist [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture|pair correlation conjecture]] concerning the distribution of the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. He showed his formula to the mathematician [[Atle Selberg]] who said it looked like something in [[mathematical physics]] and he should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the [[pair correlation function]] of the [[Gaussian unitary ensemble]], which has been extensively studied by physicists. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the [[distribution of primes]] 2,3,5,7,11,&amp;nbsp; ... and the energy levels in the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[heavy elements]] such as [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Derbyshire]], ''[[Prime Obsession]]'', 2004, {{ISBN|0309085497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1979, Dyson worked with the [[Oak Ridge Associated Universities|Institute for Energy Analysis]] on [[Climatology|climate studies]]. This group, under the direction of [[Alvin Weinberg]], pioneered multidisciplinary climate studies, including a strong biology group. Also during the 1970s, he worked on climate studies conducted by the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] defense advisory group.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt;

Dyson retired from the Institute for Advanced Study in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/freeman-dyson.html|access-date=2011-12-19|title=InterViews Freeman Dyson|date=2004-07-23|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035534/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/freeman-dyson.html|archive-date=1 December 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Dyson joined the board of the [[Solar Electric Light Fund]]. {{As of|2003}} he was president of the [[Space Studies Institute]], the space research organization founded by [[Gerard K. O'Neill]]; {{as of|2013}} he is on its Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssi.org/about/ssi-officers-and-board/|title=Officers and Board|publisher=Space Studies Institute|access-date=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson is a long-time member of the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] group.

Dyson has won numerous scientific awards but never a [[Nobel Prize]]. Nobel physics laureate [[Steven Weinberg]] has said that the [[Nobel Committee for Physics|Nobel committee]] has "fleeced" Dyson, but Dyson himself remarked in 2009, "I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years. That wasn't my style."&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt; Dyson is a regular contributor to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.

In 2012, he published (with [[William H. Press]]) a fundamental new result about the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] in [[PNAS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/16/1206569109.full.pdf+html "Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent"].

===Family===
With his first wife, the Swiss mathematician [[Verena Huber-Dyson]], Dyson had two children, [[Esther Dyson|Esther]] and [[George Dyson (science historian)|George]]. In 1958, he married Imme Jung, a [[Masters athletics (track and field)|masters runner]], and they had four more children, Dorothy, Mia, Rebecca, and Emily Dyson.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt;

Dyson's eldest daughter, Esther, is a digital technology consultant and investor; she has been called "the most influential woman in all the computer world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26858383 |title=Esther Dyson: Breaking through tech's glass ceiling|last=McKelvey|first=Tara|date=27 May 2014|access-date=11 February 2017|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His son George is a [[history of science|historian of science]],&lt;ref&gt;See excerpt from [http://www.edge.org/documents/digerati/Dyson.html Digerati: Encounters with the Cyber Elite] by John Brockman (HardWired Books, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; one of whose books is ''[[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)#note-0|Project Orion]]: The Atomic Spaceship 1957–1965''.

==Concepts==

===Biotechnology and genetic engineering===
{{quote|My book ''[[The Sun, the Genome and the Internet|The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet]]'' (1999) describes a vision of green technology enriching villages all over the world and halting the migration from villages to megacities. The three components of the vision are all essential: the sun to provide energy where it is needed, the genome to provide plants that can convert sunlight into chemical fuels cheaply and efficiently, the Internet to end the intellectual and economic isolation of rural populations. With all three components in place, every village in Africa could enjoy its fair share of the blessings of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (19 July 2007) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20370 "Our Biotech Future"], [[New York Review of Books]]. Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dyson cheerfully admits his record as a prophet is mixed, but "it is better to be wrong than to be vague."&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1999) ''The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet''&lt;/ref&gt;

"To answer the world's material needs, technology has to be not only beautiful but also cheap."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Greening of the Galaxy" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Origin of Life''===
Dyson favors the dual origin concept: Life first formed cells, then enzymes, and finally, much later, genes. This was first propounded by the Russian [[Alexander Oparin]].&lt;ref&gt;Oparin, A. I. ''The Origin of Life'', Moscow Worker publisher, 1924 (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. B. S. Haldane]] developed the same theory independently.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin of Life'', J.B.S.Haldane, The Rationalist Annual, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson has simplified things by saying simply that life evolved in two stages, widely separated in time. He regards it as too unlikely that genes could have developed fully blown in one process, because of the biochemistry. Current cells contain [[adenosine triphosphate]] or ATP and [[adenosine 5'-monophosphate]] or AMP, which greatly resemble each other but have completely different functions. ATP transports energy around the cell, and AMP is part of RNA and the genetic apparatus. Dyson proposes that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, RNA and replication were invented accidentally because of the similarity between AMP and RNA. He suggests that AMP was produced when ATP molecules lost two of their phosphate radicals, and then one cell somewhere performed [[Manfred Eigen|Eigen]]'s experiment and produced RNA.

Unfortunately there is no direct evidence for the dual origin concept, because once genes developed, they took over, obliterating all traces of the earlier forms of life. In the first origin, the cells were probably just drops of water held together by surface tension, teeming with enzymes and chemical reactions, and a primitive kind of growth or replication. When the liquid drop became too big, it split into two drops. Many complex molecules formed in these "little city economies" and the probability that genes would eventually develop in them was much greater than in the prebiotic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, ''Origins of Life,,. Second Edition'', Cambridge University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dyson rings.PNG|thumb|Artist's concept of Dyson rings, forming a stable [[Dyson Sphere#Dyson swarm|Dyson swarm]], or "Dyson sphere"]]

===Dyson sphere===
{{Main|Dyson sphere}}
{{quote|One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview&gt;{{cite interview |subject= Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.omnimag.com/archives/interviews/dyson.html |title=Freeman Dyson: Imagine … |interviewer=Monte Davis |date=October 1978 |work=[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]] |access-date=2006-12-17 |deadurl=usurped |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981207065016/http://www.omnimag.com/archives/interviews/dyson.html |archivedate=1998-12-07 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1960, Dyson wrote a short paper for the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', titled "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation| doi=10.1126/science.131.3414.1667| journal=Science| volume= 131| pages= 1667–1668| first=Freeman J.| last=Dyson| date=3 June 1960| issue=3414| pmid=17780673| bibcode= 1960Sci...131.1667D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he theorized that a technologically advanced [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilization]] might completely surround its native star with artificial structures in order to maximize the capture of the star's available energy. Eventually, the civilization would completely enclose the star, intercepting [[electromagnetic radiation]] with wavelengths from visible light downwards and radiating waste heat outwards as [[infrared]] radiation. Therefore, one method of [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|searching for extraterrestrial civilizations]] would be to look for large objects radiating in the infrared range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Dyson conceived that such structures would be clouds of [[asteroid]]-sized [[space habitat]]s, though [[science fiction]] writers have preferred a solid structure: either way, such an artifact is often called a [[Dyson sphere]], although Dyson used the term "shell". Dyson says that he used the term "artificial biosphere" in the article meaning a habitat, not a shape.&lt;ref&gt;20 minutes into [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=350379535220823176&amp;q=genome a video]&lt;/ref&gt; The general concept of such an energy-transferring shell had been advanced decades earlier by author [[Olaf Stapledon]] in his 1937 novel ''[[Star Maker]]'', a source that Dyson has credited publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Living Through Four Revolutions |first = Freeman | last = Dyson | event = Perimeter Institute Public Lecture Series | location = Waterloo, Ontario, Canada | date = 1 June 2011 | url = https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/videos/living-through-four-revolutions }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 211, "Some science fiction writers have wrongly given me the credit of inventing the artificial biosphere. In fact, I took the idea from Olaf Stapledon, one of their own colleagues"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyson tree===
{{Main|Dyson tree}}

Dyson has also proposed the creation of a ''Dyson tree'', a [[genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] plant capable of growing on a [[comet]]. He suggested that comets could be engineered to contain hollow spaces filled with a breathable atmosphere, thus providing self-sustaining habitats for humanity in the outer [[Solar System]].

{{quote|Plants could grow greenhouses ... just as turtles grow shells and polar bears grow fur and polyps build coral reefs in tropical seas. These plants could keep warm by the light from a distant Sun and conserve the oxygen that they produce by photosynthesis. The greenhouse would consist of a thick skin providing thermal insulation, with small transparent windows to admit sunlight. Outside the skin would be an array of simple lenses, focusing sunlight through the windows into the interior ... Groups of greenhouses could grow together to form extended habitats for other species of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish&gt;Dyson, FJ, "Warm-blooded plants and freeze-dried fish: the future of space exploration.

===Space colonies===
{{quote|I've done some historical research on the costs of the Mayflower's voyage, and on the Mormons' emigration to Utah, and I think it's possible to go into space on a much smaller scale. A cost on the order of $40,000 per person [1978 dollars, $143,254 in 2013 dollars] would be the target to shoot for; in terms of real wages, that would make it comparable to the colonization of America. Unless it's brought down to that level it's not really interesting to me, because otherwise it would be a luxury that only governments could afford.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview /&gt;}}

Dyson has been interested in space travel since he was a child, reading such [[science fiction]] classics as [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Star Maker]]''. As a young man, he worked for [[General Atomics]] on the nuclear-powered [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion]] spacecraft. He hoped Project Orion would put men on Mars by 1965, Saturn by 1970. He's been unhappy for a quarter-century about how the government conducts space travel:
{{quote|The problem is, of course, that they can't afford to fail. The rules of the game are that you don't take a chance, because if you fail, then probably your whole program gets wiped out.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview /&gt;}}

He still hopes for cheap space travel, but is resigned to waiting for private entrepreneurs to develop something new and inexpensive.

{{quote|No law of physics or biology forbids cheap travel and settlement all over the solar system and beyond. But it is impossible to predict how long this will take. Predictions of the dates of future achievements are notoriously fallible. My guess is that the era of cheap unmanned missions will be the next fifty years, and the era of cheap manned missions will start sometime late in the twenty-first century.

Any affordable program of manned exploration must be centered in biology, and its time frame tied to the time frame of biotechnology; a hundred years, roughly the time it will take us to learn to grow warm-blooded plants, is probably reasonable.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish /&gt;}}

Dyson also proposed the use of bioengineered space colonies to colonize the Kuiper Belt on the outer edge of our Solar System. He proposed that habitats could be grown from space hardened spores. The colonies could then be warmed by large reflector plant leaves that could focus the dim, distant sunlight back on the growing colony. This was illustrated by Pat Rawlings on the cover of the National Space Society's Ad Astra magazine.

===Space exploration===
{{quote|A direct search for life in Europa's ocean would today be prohibitively expensive. Impacts on Europa give us an easier way to look for evidence of life there. Every time a major impact occurs on Europa, a vast quantity of water is splashed from the ocean into the space around Jupiter. Some of the water evaporates, and some condenses into snow. Creatures living in the water far enough from the impact have a chance of being splashed intact into space and quickly freeze-dried. Therefore, an easy way to look for evidence of life in Europa's ocean is to look for freeze-dried fish in the ring of space debris orbiting Jupiter.

Freeze-dried fish orbiting Jupiter is a fanciful notion, but nature in the biological realm has a tendency to be fanciful. Nature is usually more imaginative than we are. ... To have the best chance of success, we should keep our eyes open for all possibilities.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish /&gt;}}

===Dyson's eternal intelligence===
{{Main|Dyson's eternal intelligence}}
Dyson's proposal that intelligent beings may be capable of thinking an infinite number of thoughts in an open/ expanding universe.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, [http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Omega/dyson.txt "Time without end: Physics and biology in an open universe,"] ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', Vol. 51, Issue 3 (July 1979), pp. 447-460; {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyson's transform===
{{Main|Dyson's transform}}
Dyson also has some credits in pure mathematics. His concept "Dyson's transform" led to one of the most important [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] of [[Olivier Ramaré]]'s theorem that every even integer can be written as a sum of no more than six primes.

===Dyson series===
The [[Dyson series]], the formal solution of an explicitly time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] by iteration, and the corresponding Dyson time-ordering operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal T\,,&lt;/math&gt; an entity of basic importance in the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], are also named after Dyson.

===Quantum physics and prime numbers===
Dyson and [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] discovered together an intriguing connection between quantum physics and [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture]] about the zeros of the Zeta function. The primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ... are described by the [[Riemann Zeta function]], and Dyson had previously developed a description of quantum physics based on m by m arrays of totally random numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = Freeman J. | year = 1962 | title = A Brownian?Motion Model for the Eigenvalues of a Random Matrix | url = | journal = J. Math. Phys. | volume = 3 | issue = 6| page = 1191 | doi = 10.1063/1.1703862 |bibcode = 1962JMP.....3.1191D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  What Montgomery and Dyson discovered is that the ''[[eigenvalues]]'' of these matrices are spaced apart in exactly the same manner as Montgomery conjectured for the nontrivial zeros of the Zeta function. [[Andrew Odlyzko]] has verified the conjecture on a computer, using his  [[Odlyzko–Schönhage algorithm]] to calculate many zeros. Dyson recognized this connection because of a number-theory question Montgomery asked him. Dyson had published results in [[number theory]] in 1947, while a Fellow at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and so was able to understand Montgomery's question. If Montgomery had not been visiting the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] that week, this connection might not have been discovered.

There are in nature one, two, and three dimensional [[quasicrystals]]. Mathematicians define a quasicrystal as a set of discrete points whose [[Fourier transform]] is also a set of discrete points. [[Andrew Odlyzko]] has done extensive computations of the Fourier transform of the nontrivial zeros of the [[Riemann Zeta function]], and they seem to form a one dimensional quasicrystal. This would in fact follow from the [[Riemann hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, Selected papers, 1990-2014, pp. 41–42, World Scientific, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===Metaphysics===
Dyson has suggested a kind of cosmic metaphysics of [[mind]]. In his book ''[[Infinite in All Directions]]'' he writes about three levels of mind: "The universe shows evidence of the operations of mind on three levels. The first level is the level of elementary physical processes in quantum mechanics. Matter in quantum mechanics is ... constantly making choices between alternative possibilities according to probabilistic laws. ... The second level at which we detect the operations of mind is the level of direct human experience. ... [I]t is reasonable to believe in the existence of a third level of mind, a mental component of the universe. If we believe in this mental component and call it God, then we can say that we are small pieces of God's mental apparatus" (p.&amp;nbsp;297).

===Climate change===
Dyson agrees that anthropogenic [[global warming]] exists. While he agrees that "[one] of the main causes of warming is the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from our burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal and natural gas",&lt;ref name="heretic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dysonf07/dysonf07_index.html|publisher=Edge|title=Heretical Thoughts about Science and Society|date=8 August 2007|author=Freeman Dyson|access-date=2007-09-05}}dl&lt;/ref&gt; he believes that existing simulation models of climate fail to account for some important factors, and hence the results will contain too much error to reliably predict future trends:

{{quote|The models solve the equations of fluid dynamics, and they do a very good job of describing the fluid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans. They do a very poor job of describing the clouds, the dust, the chemistry and the biology of fields and farms and forests. They do not begin to describe the real world we live in&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt;}}

and, in 2009:

{{quote|What has happened in the past 10 years is that the discrepancies between what's observed and what's predicted have become much stronger. It's clear now the models are wrong, but it wasn't so clear 10 years ago.&lt;ref name=dy8&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/11/freeman_dyson_interview/ "Top boffin Freeman Dyson on climate change, interstellar travel, fusion, and more"], interview published 2 June 2009 by [[The Register]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He is among signatories of a letter to the UN criticizing the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=d4b5fd23-802a-23ad-4565-3dce4095c360 |title=Don't fight, adapt |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |dead-url=yes |access-date=19 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911074152/http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=d4b5fd23-802a-23ad-4565-3dce4095c360 |archivedate=11 September 2016 |df=dmy }} Open Letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

"[H]eretics who question the dogmas are needed&amp;nbsp; ... I am proud to be a heretic. The world always needs heretics to challenge the prevailing orthodoxies."&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt;

Dyson says his views on global warming have been strongly criticized. In reply, he notes that "[m]y objections to the global warming propaganda are not so much over the technical facts, about which I do not know much, but it's rather against the way those people behave and the kind of intolerance to criticism that a lot of them have."&lt;ref name=e360&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090608114821/http://www.e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2151 "Freeman Dyson Takes On The Climate Establishment"], interview published 2 June 2009 by [[Yale University]]'s ''Environment 360''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he endorsed the now common usage of "global warming" as synonymous with global anthropogenic climate change, referring to "measurements that transformed global warming from a vague theoretical speculation into a precise observational science."&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (12 June 2008) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21494 "The Question of Global Warming"], The New York Review of Books. Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has, however, argued that political efforts to reduce the causes of climate change distract from other global problems that should take priority:

{{quote|I'm not saying the warming doesn't cause problems, obviously it does. Obviously we should be trying to understand it. I'm saying that the problems are being grossly exaggerated. They take away money and attention from other problems that are much more urgent and important. Poverty, infectious diseases, public education and public health. Not to mention the preservation of living creatures on land and in the oceans.&lt;ref name="um"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831094244/http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?DysonWinCom05|archivedate=31 August 2006 |url=http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?DysonWinCom05|title= University of Michigan 2005 Winter Commencement Address|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an opinion piece in the Boston Globe of 3 Dec 2015 he wrote,

{{quote|[T]he environmental movement [has been] hijacked by a bunch of climate fanatics, who have captured the attention of the public with scare stories. ...

China and India have a simple choice to make. Either they get rich [by burning prodigious quantities of coal and causing] a major increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, or they stay poor. I hope they choose to get rich. ...

The good news is that the main effect of carbon dioxide ... is to make the planet greener, [by] feeding the growth of green plants of all kinds [and] increasing the fertility of farms and fields and forests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dyson|first1=Freeman|title=Misunderstandings, questionable beliefs mar Paris climate talks|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/12/03/freeman-dyson-misunderstandings-questionable-beliefs-mar-paris-climate-talks/vG3oBrbmcZlv2m22DTNjMP/story.html|access-date=7 December 2015|publisher=''Boston Globe''|date=3 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since originally taking interest in climate studies in the 1970s, Dyson has suggested that [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the atmosphere could be controlled by planting fast-growing trees. He calculates that it would take a trillion trees to remove all carbon from the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, "Can we control the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?", Energy, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1977, Pages 287–291. {{doi|10.1016/0360-5442(77)90033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;

In a 2014 interview, he said that "What I'm convinced of is that we don't understand climate ...  It will take a lot of very hard work before that question is settled."&lt;ref name=wired20140331&gt;

He is a member of the academic advisory council of the [[Global Warming Policy Foundation]], a climate sceptic think tank chaired by [[Nigel Lawson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegwpf.org/who-we-are/academic-advisory-council/ |title=Academic Advisory Council |website=The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) |access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear winter===
From his 1988 book ''[[Infinite in All Directions]]'', he offered some criticism of then current models predicting a devastating [[nuclear winter]] in the event of a large-scale nuclear war:

{{quote|As a scientist I want to rip the theory of nuclear winter apart, but as a human being I want to believe it.  This is one of the rare instances of a genuine conflict between the demands of science and the demands of humanity.  As a scientist, I judge the nuclear winter theory to be a sloppy piece of work, full of gaps and unjustified assumptions.  As a human being, I hope fervently that it is right.  Here is a real and uncomfortable dilemma.  What does a scientist do when science and humanity pull in opposite directions?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Freeman J. Dyson|title=Infinite in All Directions: Gifford Lectures Given at Aberdeen, Scotland April—November 1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ca3OH0a4tZoC&amp;pg=PA259|access-date=8 October 2011|date=22 July 2004|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-072889-2|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Warfare and weapons===

At the [[British Bomber Command]], Dyson and colleagues proposed removing two gun turrets from the RAF [[Lancaster bomber]]s, to cut the catastrophic losses due to German fighters in the [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Battle of Berlin]]. A Lancaster without turrets could fly {{convert|50|mph|-1|abbr=on}} faster and be much more maneuverable.

{{quote|All our advice to the commander in chief [went] through the chief of our section, who was a career civil servant. His guiding principle was to tell the commander in chief things that the commander in chief liked to hear ... To push the idea of ripping out gun turrets, against the official mythology of the gallant gunner defending his crew mates ... was not the kind of suggestion the commander in chief liked to hear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Children's Crusade" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On hearing the news of the bombing of [[Hiroshima]]:

{{quote|I agreed emphatically with [[Henry Stimson]]. Once we had got ourselves into the business of bombing cities, we might as well do the job competently and get it over with. I felt better that morning than I had felt for years ... Those fellows who had built the atomic bombs obviously knew their stuff ... Later, much later, I would remember [the downside].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Blood of a Poet" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|I am convinced that to avoid nuclear war it is not sufficient to be afraid of it. It is necessary to be afraid, but it is equally necessary to understand. And the first step in understanding is to recognize that the problem of nuclear war is basically not technical but human and historical. If we are to avoid destruction we must first of all understand the human and historical context out of which destruction arises.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1984) ''Weapons and Hope''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1967, in his capacity as a military adviser Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the [[Vietnam War]]. When a general said in a meeting, "I think it might be a good idea to throw in a nuke now and then, just to keep the other side guessing ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Ethics of Defense" in ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write an objective report discussing the pros and cons of using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, ''Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia'', published by the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], was obtained, with some redactions, by the [[Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability]] under the [[Freedom of Information act]] in 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;F.J. Dyson, R. Gomer, S. Weinberg, S.C. Wright [http://nautilus.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tactical_nukes_vietnam.pdf "Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia"] (March 1967) [declassified December 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; It was sufficiently objective that both sides in the debate based their arguments on it. Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons. Dyson stated on the [[Dick Cavett show]] that the use of nuclear weaponry was a bad idea for the US at the time because "our targets were large and theirs were small." (His unstated assumption was that the Soviets would respond by supplying tactical nukes to the other side.)

Dyson opposed the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]]. He supported [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 US presidential election]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' has described him as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political liberal]].&lt;ref name=civil /&gt; He was one of 29 leading US scientists who wrote a strongly supportive letter to Obama regarding his administration's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.&lt;ref name = "29 support letter"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Broad | first = William J. | date = 8 August 2015 | title = 29 U.S. Scientists Praise Iran Nuclear Deal in Letter to Obama | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/world/29-us-scientists-praise-iran-nuclear-deal-in-letter-to-obama.html | work = The New York Times | access-date = 9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil defence===
While teaching for a few weeks in Zurich, Dyson was visited by two officials from the Swiss civil defence authority. Their experts were telling them that fairly simple shelters on a large scale would enable them to survive a nuclear attack, and they wanted confirmation. They knew that Dyson had a security clearance. Dyson reassured them that their shelters would do the job. The US does not build such shelters because it would be contrary to the doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction]], since the US would be able to launch a first strike but survive retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1984) "Shelters" in ''Weapons and Hope''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of failure===
{{quote|You can't possibly get a good technology going without an enormous number of failures. It's a universal rule. If you look at [[bicycles]], there were thousands of weird models built and tried before they found the one that really worked. You could never design a bicycle theoretically. Even now, after we've been building them for 100 years, it's very difficult to understand just why a bicycle works – it's even difficult to formulate it as a mathematical problem. But just by trial and error, we found out how to do it, and the error was essential.&lt;ref name=BrandInterview&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/dyson.html?pg=7&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= Interview by Stewart Brand, February 1998].

===On English academics===
{{quote|My view of the prevalence of doom-and-gloom in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] is that it is a result of the English class system.  In England there were always two sharply opposed middle classes, the academic middle class and the commercial middle class. In the nineteenth century, the academic middle class won the battle for power and status.  As a child of the academic middle class, I learned to look on the commercial middle class with loathing and contempt.  Then came the triumph of [[Margaret Thatcher]], which was also the revenge of the commercial middle class.  The academics lost their power and prestige and the business people took over. The academics never forgave Thatcher and have been gloomy ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Freeman-Dyson.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703082513/http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Freeman-Dyson.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 July 2007|

===Science and religion===
He is a [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational Christian]] and has attended various churches from [[Presbyterian]] to [[Roman Catholic]]. Regarding doctrinal or [[Christological]] issues, he has said, "I am neither a saint nor a theologian. To me, good works are more important than theology."&lt;ref name="edge68.html"&gt;{{cite speech |url=https://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge68.html |author= Freeman Dyson |event=Templeton Prize Lecture |title=Progress In Religion |via=[[Edge.org]] |date=15 March 2000 |access-date=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Science and religion are two windows that people look through, trying to understand the big universe outside, trying to understand why we are here. The two windows give different views, but they look out at the same universe. Both views are one-sided, neither is complete. Both leave out essential features of the real world. And both are worthy of respect.

Trouble arises when either science or religion claims universal jurisdiction, when either religious or scientific dogma claims to be infallible. Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute. The media exaggerate their numbers and importance. The media rarely mention the fact that the great majority of religious people belong to moderate denominations that treat science with respect, or the fact that the great majority of scientists treat religion with respect so long as religion does not claim jurisdiction over scientific questions.&lt;ref name="edge68.html" /&gt;}}

Dyson partially disagrees with the famous remark by his fellow physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] that "With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion."&lt;ref name="nyrb06.html"&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion from the Outside |author=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19090 |date=22 June 2006 |work=The New York Review of Books |access-date=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Weinberg's statement is true as far as it goes, but it is not the  whole truth. To make it the whole truth, we must add an additional clause: "And for bad people to do good things—that [also] takes religion." The main point of Christianity is that it is a religion for sinners. Jesus made that very clear. When the Pharisees asked his disciples, "Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?" he said, "I come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance." Only a small fraction of sinners repent and do good things but only a small fraction of good people are led by their religion to do bad things.&lt;ref name="nyrb06.html" /&gt;}}

While Dyson has labeled himself a Christian, he identifies himself as agnostic about some of the specifics of his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Back to Hell |publisher=Xulon Press |isbn=9781591608158 |author=Moses Gbenu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8aLHpyW7vEC&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=110 |quote=The cash part of this award is over $1 million.

Officially, he calls himself an agnostic, but his writings make it clear that his agnosticism is tinged with something akin to deism. |access-date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, here is a passage from Dyson's review of ''The God of Hope and the End of the World'' from [[John Polkinghorne]]:

{{quote|I am myself a Christian, a member of a community that preserves an ancient heritage of great literature and great music, provides help and counsel to young and old when they are in trouble, educates children in moral responsibility, and worships God in its own fashion. But I find Polkinghorne's theology altogether too narrow for my taste. I have no use for a theology that claims to know the answers to deep questions but bases its arguments on the beliefs of a single tribe. I am a practicing Christian but not a believing Christian. To me, to worship God means to recognize that mind and intelligence are woven into the fabric of our universe in a way that altogether surpasses our comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science &amp; Religion: No Ends in Sight |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/mar/28/science-religion-no-ends-in-sight/ |work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=30 July 2012|author=Freeman Dyson|date=28 March 2002|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] criticized Dyson for accepting the religious [[Templeton Prize]] in 2000; "It would be taken as an endorsement of religion by one of the world's most distinguished physicists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Bantam Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-61868-000-9|page=152|title-link=The God Delusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dyson declared in 2000 that he is a (non-denominational) Christian,&lt;ref name="edge68.html"/&gt; and he has disagreed with Dawkins on several occasions, as when he criticized Dawkins' understanding of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=John Brockman |url=http://www.edge.org/discourse/dawkins_dyson.html |title=Richard Dawkins—Freeman Dyson: an exchange |year=2007 |website=[[Edge.org]]|access-date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''gnosology''' literally means the study of ''[[gnosis]]'', meaning [[knowledge]] or [[esoteric knowledge]]. Gnosology has also been used to render [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s term for his own version of [[transcendental idealism]], ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge|Wissenschaftslehre]]'', meaning "Doctrine of Knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Schwegler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yio-AAAAYAAJ&amp;q= ''Handbook of the history of philosophy''], Edmondston &amp; Co., 1879, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

A term coined by [[Karl Popper]] in his work ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' to denote what he regarded as the main problem of [[methodology]] and the [[philosophy of science]], i.e. to explain and promote the further growth of scientific knowledge. To this purpose, Popper advocated his theory of [[falsifiability]], [[testability]] and testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prb.org 3 Population Bulletin Vol. 61, No. 2 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hierarchy of the sciences''' is a theory formulated by [[Auguste Comte]] in the 19th century. This theory states that science develops over time beginning with the simplest and most general scientific discipline, [[astronomy]], which is the first to reach the "positive stage" (one of three in Comte's [[law of three stages]]). As one moves down the "hierarchy", this theory further states that sciences become more complex and less general, and that they will reach the positive stage later. Disciplines further down the hierarchy are said to depend more on the developments of their predecessors; the highest discipline on the hierarchy is the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.pfeiffer.edu/lridener/DSS/Comte/COMTEW4.HTML |title=Comte - The Work - Hierarchy of the Sciences |website=media.pfeiffer.edu |access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, there are higher levels of consensus and faster rates of advancement in [[physics]] and other [[natural sciences]] than there are in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cole |first=Stephen |date=July 1983 |title=The Hierarchy of the Sciences? |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/227835 |journal=American Journal of Sociology |language=en |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=111–139 |doi=10.1086/227835 |issn=0002-9602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Research has shown that, after controlling for the number of hypotheses being tested, positive results are 2.3 times more likely in the social sciences than in the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fanelli |first=Daniele |date=2010-04-07 |title="Positive" Results Increase Down the Hierarchy of the Sciences |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e10068 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 |pmc=2850928 |pmid=20383332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that the degree of [[scientific consensus]] is highest in the physical sciences, lowest in the social sciences, and intermediate in the [[biological sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fanelli |first=Daniele |last2=Glänzel |first2=Wolfgang |date=2013-06-26 |title=Bibliometric Evidence for a Hierarchy of the Sciences |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=e66938 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 |pmc=3694152 |pmid=23840557}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Simonton]] argues that a composite measure of the scientific status of disciplines ranks [[psychology]] much closer to biology than to sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Simonton |first=Dean Keith |date=2004 |title=Psychology's Status as a Scientific Discipline: Its Empirical Placement Within an Implicit Hierarchy of the Sciences. |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-11097-002 |journal=Review of General Psychology |language=en |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=59–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1365">'''Historical determinism''' is the stance that events are historically predetermined or currently constrained by various forces. Historical determinism can be understood in contrast to its negation, i.e. the rejection of historical determinism.

Some political philosophies (e.g. Early and Stalinist [[Marxism]]) assert a [[historical materialism]] of either predetermination or constraint, or both.

Used as a pejorative, it is normally meant to designate an overdetermination of present possibilities by historical conditions.

'''Idealistic pluralism''' is a philosophical position that suggests while an individual's understanding of the world might be limited to only the ideas within his or her mind, it can be known in this way by more than one mind.

Idealistic pluralism rejects the idea of [[solipsism]], which would be an [[idealistic monism]].  In the philosophy of [[George Berkeley]], an idealistic pluralism is found in his assertion that many minds (each knowing the world though their own representations) exist, separate from each other, and from God.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1973">'''Ideological repression''' refers to forceful activities against competing [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[philosophy|philosophies]].

[[Alan Wolfe]] defines ideological repression as "the attempt to manipulate people's consciousness so they accept the ruling ideology, and distrust and refuse to be moved by competing ideologies".&lt;ref&gt;as cited in "Television as an Instrument of Terror", by [[Arthur Asa Berger]], p. 369 &lt;!-- need to find the original text --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the [[Soviet Union]] and in other countries, ideological repression was carried out by [[political repression]] of the carriers of competing ideologies.

Instruments of ideological repression are [[propaganda]] and [[censorship]]. During the days of "Marxism-Leninism" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu/stable/pdf/1399530.pdf|title=Off-Campus Access - Los Rios Libraries|website=0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Soviet Union -around the early 1930s- students of this particular school of thought were given textbooks that encouraged one particular way of thinking (the Marxist way) as being paramount and the most scientific and true school of thought.

Through ideological repression and control of output information, the Soviet Union was attempting to keep social revolutions at bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu/stable/pdf/1399530.pdf|title=Off-Campus Access - Los Rios Libraries|website=0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ideology''' is a collection of [[normative]] [[beliefs]] and [[values]] that an individual or group holds for other than purely [[epistemic]] reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Honderich |first1=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |date=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866132-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by [[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]] in 1796, who conceived it as the "science of ideas". In contemporary philosophy it is narrower in scope than that original concept, or the ideas expressed in broad concepts such as ''[[worldview]]'', ''[[imaginary (sociology)|imaginary]]'' and ''[[ontology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |last1=Steger |first1=Manfred B. |last2=James |first2=Paul |authorlink2=Paul James (academic) |title=Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies |url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113 |journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology |volume=12 |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the political world, for instance, there are many well-known [[List of political ideologies|political ideologies]], which cover a wide range of human interests.

In the sense defined by French Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]], ideology is "the imagined existence (or idea) of things as it relates to the real conditions of existence".

==Etymology and history==
[[File:Destutt de Tracy.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]] (1754-1836)]]
The term "ideology" was born during the [[Reign of Terror]] of [[French Revolution]], and acquired several other meanings thereafter.

The word, and the system of ideas associated with it, was coined by [[Antoine Destutt de Tracy]] in 1796,&lt;ref name = hart&gt;{{cite web|last = Hart|first = David M. |date = 1 January 2002|url = http://www.econlib.org/library/Tracy/DestuttdeTracyBio.html |title = Life and Works of Antoine Louis Claude, Comte Destutt de Tracy|website = Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he was in prison pending trial during the Terror. The word was created by assembling the words [[idea#John Locke|''idea'']], from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἰδέα|ἰδέα]]}} (near to the [[John Locke|Lockean]] sense) and ''[[-logy]]'', from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}}.

The coup that overthrew [[Maximilien Robespierre]] allowed Tracy to pursue his work.&lt;ref name = kennedy&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=Emmet |date=Jul–Sep 1979 |title="Ideology" from Destutt De Tracy to Marx |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=353–368 |jstor=2709242 |doi=10.2307/2709242|bibcode=1961JHI....22..215C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hart/&gt;

Tracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob impulses that had nearly destroyed him.  He devised the term for a "science of ideas" he hoped would form a secure foundation for the moral and political sciences. He based the word on two things:  1) sensations people experience as they interact with the material world; and 2) the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations. He conceived "Ideology" as a [[liberalism|liberal]] philosophy that would defend individual liberty, property,  [[free markets]], and constitutional limits on state power.  He argues that among these aspects ideology is the most generic term, because the science of ideas also contains the study of their expression and deduction.&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt;

Tracy worked this out during the Napoleonic regime, and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] came to view 'Ideology' a term of abuse, which he often hurled against his liberal foes in Tracy's [[Institut National]]. According to [[Karl Mannheim]]'s historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of ideology, the modern meaning of the word was born when Napoleon used it to describe his opponents as "the ideologues". [[Karl Marx]] adopted this negative sense of the term and used it in his writings (he described Tracy as a "fischblütige Bourgeoisdoktrinär", a fishblooded bourgeois doctrinaire).&lt;ref&gt;De Tracy, Destutt (1801) ''Les Éléments d'idéologie'', 3rd ed. (1817), p. 4, cited by: Mannheim, Karl (1929) Ideologie und Utopie, 2nd footnote in the chapter ''The problem of "false consciousness"''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy's major book, ''[[The Elements of Ideology]]'', was soon translated into the major languages of Europe, and in the next generation, when post-Napoleonic governments adopted a reactionary stance, influenced the Italian, Spanish and Russian thinkers who had begun to describe themselves as "liberals" and who attempted to reignite revolutionary activity in the early 1820s (these included the Carlist rebels in Spain, the Carbonari societies in France and Italy, and the Decembrists in Russia).

In the century after Tracy, the term ideology moved back and forth between positive and negative connotations.

(Perhaps the most accessible source for the near-original meaning of ''ideology'' is [[Hippolyte Taine]]'s work on the [[Ancien Régime]] (the first volume of "Origins of Contemporary France"). He describes ideology as rather like teaching philosophy by the [[Socratic method]], but without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed, and without the examples from observation that practical science would require. Taine identifies it not just with Destutt De Tracy, but also with his milieu, and includes [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]] as one of its precursors. (Destutt de Tracy read the works of Locke and Condillac while he was imprisoned during the [[Reign of Terror]].))

The term "ideology" has [[Euphemism#Euphemism treadmill|dropped some of its pejorative sting]], and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry (1991) ''Ideology. An introduction'', Verso, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Karl Marx]] situated the term within [[class struggle]] and domination,&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Robert C (1978). ''The Marx-Engels Reader'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''MER'', pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt; others believed it was a necessary part of [[structural functionalism|institutional functioning]] and [[social cohesion|social integration]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Silbey, [http://www.credoreference.com/entry/cupsoc/ideology "Ideology"] at ''Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
There has been considerable analysis of different ideological patterns. Some have described this kind of analysis as ''meta-ideology''—the study of the structure, form, and manifestation of ideologies. Recent analysis tends to posit that ideology is a ''coherent system of ideas'' that rely on a few basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis. Ideas become ideologies (that is, become coherent, repeated patterns) through the subjective ongoing choices that people make, serving as the seed around which further thought grows. According to most recent analysis, ideologies are neither necessarily right nor wrong. Believers in ideology range from passive acceptance through fervent advocacy to true belief.

This accords with definitions, such as by [[Manfred Steger]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], that emphasize both the issue of patterning and contingent claims to truth:

{{quote|Ideologies are patterned clusters of normatively imbued ideas and concepts, including particular representations of power relations. These conceptual maps help people navigate the complexity of their political universe and carry claims to social truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2010 |last1=James |first1=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |last2=Steger |first2=Manfred |title=Globalization and Culture, Vol. 4: Ideologies of Globalism |url=https://www.academia.edu/4510893 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The works of George Walford and Harold Walsby, done under the heading of [[systematic ideology]], are attempts to explore the relationships between ideology and social systems. [[Charles Blattberg]] offers an account that distinguishes political ideologies from political philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Blattberg, Charles, "Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies", in ''Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy'', Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1755117]&lt;/ref&gt;

David W. Minar describes six different ways the word "ideology" has been used:
# As a collection of certain ideas with certain kinds of ''content'', usually normative
# As the ''form or internal logical structure'' that ideas have within a set
# By the role ideas play in ''human-social interaction''
# By the role ideas play in the ''structure of an organization''
# As meaning, whose purpose is ''persuasion''
# As the ''locus'' of social interaction

For Willard A. Mullins an ideology should be contrasted with the related (but different) issues of ''utopia'' and ''historical myth''. An ideology is composed of four basic characteristics:
# it must have power over cognition
# it must be capable of guiding one's evaluations;
# it must provide guidance towards action; and
# it must be logically coherent.

[[Terry Eagleton]] outlines (more or less in no particular order) some definitions of ideology:&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry (1991) ''Ideology: An Introduction'', Verso, {{ISBN|0-86091-319-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The process of production of meanings, signs and values in social life
# A body of ideas characteristic of a particular social group or class
# Ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power
# False ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power
# Systematically distorted communication
# Ideas that offer a position for a subject
# Forms of thought motivated by social interests
# Identity thinking
# Socially necessary illusion
# The conjuncture of discourse and power
# The medium in which conscious social actors make sense of their world
# Action-oriented sets of beliefs
# The confusion of linguistic and phenomenal reality
# Semiotic closure
# The indispensable medium in which individuals live out their relations to a social structure
# The process that converts social life to a natural reality

The German philosopher [https://web.archive.org/web/20110701015904/http://www.ideologieforschung.de/web/Christian_Duncker.html Christian Duncker] called for a "critical reflection of the ideology concept" (2006). In his work, he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground, as well as the closely connected concerns of [[epistemology]] and history. In this work, the term ideology is defined in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly claim to absolute truth.

There are many different kinds of ideologies: [[politics|political]], [[Social issues|social]], [[epistemological]], and [[ethics|ethical]].

===Marxist view===
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Karl Marx]] posits that a society's dominant ideology is integral to its superstructure.]]
In the [[Marxist]] [[base and superstructure (Marxism)|economic base and superstructure]] model of society, ''base'' denotes the [[relations of production]] and [[modes of production]], and ''superstructure'' denotes the dominant ideology (religious, legal, political systems). The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology—actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a [[feudal]] [[mode of production]], religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure, while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as [[liberalism]] and [[social democracy]] dominate. Hence the great importance of the ideology justifying a society; it politically confuses the alienated groups of society via [[false consciousness]].

Some explanations have been presented. [[György Lukács]] proposes ideology as a [[psychological projection|projection]] of the [[class consciousness]] of the ruling class. [[Antonio Gramsci]] uses [[cultural hegemony]] to explain why the [[working-class]] have a false ideological conception of what are their best interests. Marx argued that "The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title="The Civil War in France", The Marx-Engels Reader 2nd ed.|year=1978a|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marxist formulation of "ideology as an instrument of social reproduction" is conceptually important to the [[sociology of knowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;In this discipline, there are lexical disputes over the meaning of the word "ideology" ("false consciousness" as advocated by Marx, or rather "false position" of a statement in itself is correct but irrelevant in the context in which it is produced, as in [[Max Weber]]'s opinion): {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Eleggibilità più ampia senza i paletti del peculato d'uso? Un'occasione (perduta) per affrontare il tema delle leggi ad personam |journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia Edizione Online |date=2005| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89394794}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; viz. [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Daniel Bell]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] et al. Moreover, Mannheim has developed, and progressed, from the "total" but "special" Marxist conception of ideology to a "general" and "total" ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology (including [[Marxism]]) resulted from social life, an idea developed by the [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. [[Slavoj Žižek]] and the earlier [[Frankfurt School]] added to the "general theory" of ideology a psychoanalytic insight that ideologies do not include only conscious, but also [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] ideas.

===Louis Althusser's ideological state apparatuses===
[[Louis Althusser]] proposed both spiritual and materialistic conception of ideology, which made use of a special type of discourse: the [[lacunar discourse]]. A number of propositions, which are never untrue, suggest a number of other propositions, which are. In this way, the essence of the lacunar discourse is what is ''not'' told (but is suggested).

For example, the statement "All are equal before the law," which is a theoretical groundwork of current legal systems, suggests that all people may be of equal worth or have equal "opportunities". This is not true, for the concept of [[private property]] and power over the [[means of production]] results in some people being able to own more (''much'' more) than others. This power disparity contradicts the claim that all share both practical worth and future opportunity equally; for example, the rich can afford better legal representation, which practically privileges them before the law.

Althusser also proffered the concept of the [[ideological state apparatus]] to explain his theory of ideology. His first thesis was "''ideology has no history''": while individual ideolog''ies'' have histories, interleaved with the general class struggle of society, the general form of ideology is external to history.

For Althusser, beliefs and ideas are the products of social practices, not the reverse. His thesis that "''ideas are material''" is illustrated by the "scandalous advice" of [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] toward unbelievers: "Kneel and pray, and then you will believe." What is ultimately ideological for Althusser are not the subjective beliefs held in the conscious "minds" of human individuals, but rather discourses that produce these beliefs, the material institutions and rituals that individuals take part in without submitting it to conscious examination and so much more [[critical thinking]].

===Ideology and the Commodity in the works of Guy Debord===
The French [[Marxist]] theorist [[Guy Debord]], founding member of the [[Situationist International]], argued that when the commodity becomes the "essential category" of society, i.e. when the process of [[commodification]] has been consummated to its fullest extent, the image of society propagated by the commodity (as it describes all of life as constituted by notions and objects deriving their value only as commodities tradeable in terms of [[exchange value]]), colonizes all of life and reduces society to a mere representation, [[The Society of the Spectacle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Society of the Spectacle|publisher=Zone Books|author=Guy Debord|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silvio Vietta: ideology and rationality===
{{Disputed section|date=July 2015}}
The German [[cultural historian]] [[Silvio Vietta]] described the development and expansion of Western rationality from ancient times onwards as often accompanied by and shaped by ideologies like that of the "just war", the "true religion", racism, nationalism, or the vision of future history as a kind of heaven on earth in communism. He said that ideas like these became ideologies by giving hegemonic political actions an idealistic veneer and equipping their leaders with a higher and, in the "[[political religion]]s" ([[Eric Voegelin]]), nearly God-like power, so that they became masters over the lives (and the deaths) of millions of people. He considered that ideologies therefore contributed to power politics irrational shields of ideas beneath which they could operate as manifestations of idealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Theory of Global Civilization: Rationality and the Irrational as the Driving Forces of History|publisher=Kindle Ebooks|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rationalität. Eine Weltgeschichte. Europäische Kulturgeschichte und Globalisierung|publisher=Fink|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eric Hoffer:  unifying agents===
The American philosopher [[Eric Hoffer]] identified several elements that unify followers of a particular ideology:&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 91 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
1) Hatred:  "Mass movements can rise and spread without a God, but never without belief in a devil.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "ideal devil" is a foreigner.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

2) Imitation:  "The less satisfaction we derive from being ourselves, the greater is our desire to be like others ... the more we mistrust our judgment and luck, the more are we ready to follow the example of others."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 101-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

3) Persuasion:  The proselytizing zeal of propagandists derives from "a passionate search for something not yet found more than a desire to bestow something we already have."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

4) Coercion:  Hoffer asserts that violence and fanaticism are interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  People forcibly converted to Islamic or communist beliefs become as fanatical as those who did the forcing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  "It takes fanatical faith to rationalize our cowardice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

5) Leadership:  Without the leader, there is no movement.  Often the leader must wait long in the wings until the time is ripe.  He calls for sacrifices in the present, to justify his vision of a breathtaking future.  The skills required include:  audacity, brazenness, iron will, fanatical conviction; passionate hatred, cunning, a delight in symbols; ability to inspire blind faith in the masses and a group of able lieutenants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 112-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlatanism is indispensable, and the leader often imitates both friend and foe, "a single-minded fashioning after a model."  He will not lead followers towards the "promised land," but only "away from their unwanted selves."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 116-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

6) Action:  Original thoughts are suppressed, and unity encouraged, if the masses are kept occupied through great projects, marches, exploration and industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 120-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

7) Suspicion:  "There is prying and spying, tense watching and a tense awareness of being watched."  This pathological mistrust goes unchallenged and encourages conformity, not dissent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ronald Inglehart===

[[Ronald Inglehart]] of the University of Michigan is author of the [[World Values Survey]], which, since 1980, has mapped social attitudes in 100 countries representing 90% of global population. Results indicate that where people live is likely to closely correlate with their ideological beliefs. In much of Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, people prefer traditional beliefs and are less tolerant of liberal values. Protestant Europe, at the other extreme, adheres more to secular beliefs and liberal values. Alone among high-income countries, the United States is exceptional in its adherence to traditional beliefs, in this case Christianity.

==Political ideologies==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Charles de Gaulle]]--&gt;
{{See also|List of political ideologies}}
In [[social studies]], a political ideology is a certain ethical set of [[ideal (ethics)|ideals]], principles, [[doctrine]]s, [[mythology|myths]], or [[symbol]]s of a [[social movement]], [[institution]], [[social class|class]], or large group that explains how society should work, and offers some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society, including (for example): the economy, [[education]], [[health care]], [[labor law]], [[criminal law]], the [[justice system]], the provision of [[social security]] and [[social welfare]], [[trade]], the [[environmentalism|environment]], [[minor (law)|minors]], [[immigration]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], use of the [[military]], [[patriotism]], and [[established religion]].

Political ideologies have two dimensions:
# Goals: how society should work
# Methods: the most appropriate ways to achieve the ideal arrangement

There are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies, each of these different methods generate a specific [[political spectrum]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Ideologies also identify themselves by their position on the [[political spectrum]] (such as the [[left-wing politics|left]], the [[center (politics)|center]] or the [[right-wing politics|right]]), though precision in this respect can very often become controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from [[political strategy|political strategies]] (e.g., [[populism]]) and from single issues that a party may be built around (e.g. [[Marijuana political parties|legalization of marijuana]]). Philosopher Michael Oakeshott provides a good definition of ideology as "the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub-stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition".

A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate [[power (sociology)|power]] and to what ends power should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. Each political ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers the best [[form of government]] (e.g., [[democracy]], [[demagogy]], [[theocracy]], [[caliphate]] etc.), and the best [[economic system]] (e.g. [[capitalism]], [[socialism]], etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, "socialism" may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology that supports that economic system.

Studies of the concept of ideology itself (rather than specific ideologies) have been carried out under the name of [[systematic ideology]].

Post 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bell|Bell, D.]] ''[[The End of Ideology|The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties]] (2000) (2nd ed.). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, pg. 393''&lt;/ref&gt; in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed, and this view is often associated{{by whom|date=August 2015}} with [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s writings on "the end of history".&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, F. (1992)''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. USA: The Free Press, xi&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Nienhueser sees research (in the field of [[human resource management]]) as ongoingly "generating ideology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nienhueser |first1=Werner |year=2011 |title=Empirical Research on Human Resource Management as a Production of Ideology |url=http://www.management-revue.org/papers/mrev_4_11_Nienhueser.pdf |journal=Management Revue |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=367–393 |doi=10.1688/1861-9908_mrev_2011_04_Nienhueser |issn=0935-9915 |access-date=2015-08-27 |quote=[...] current empirical research in HRM is generating ideology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavoj Zizek]] has pointed out how the very notion of post-ideology can enable the deepest, blindest form of ideology. A sort of false consciousness or false cynicism, engaged in for the purpose of lending one's point of view the respect of being objective, pretending neutral cynicism, without truly being so. Rather than help avoiding ideology, this lapse only deepens the commitment to an existing one. Zizek calls this "a post-modernist trap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zizek |first=Slavoj |date=2008 |title=The Sublime Object of Ideology |edition=2nd |publisher=[[London: Verso]]|pages =xxxi, 25–27 |isbn=9781844673001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Sloterdijk]] advanced the same idea already in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sloterdijk |first=Peter |date=1988 |title=Critique of Cynical Reason |publisher=[[US: University of Minnesota Press]] |isbn=9780816615865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several studies that show that affinity to a specific political ideology is heritable.&lt;ref&gt;Bouchard, T. J., and McGue, M. (2003).

''Journal of Neurobiology'', 54 (1), 44–45.” https://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1169974.files/Bouchard%20McGue%202003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cloninger, et al.

===Government ideology===
When a political ideology becomes a dominantly pervasive component within a government, one can speak of an [[ideocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Politics_of_ideocracy.html?id=xC6FAAAAMAAJ |title=Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz, Alfred Wayne Penn. Politics of Ideocracy|isbn=9780791422977|last1=Piekalkiewicz|first1=Jaroslaw|last2=Penn|first2=Alfred Wayne|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of government utilize ideology in various ways, not always restricted to politics and society. Certain ideas and schools of thought become favored, or rejected, over others, depending on their compatibility with or use for the reigning social order.

===Implementation===

"Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back", said [[John Maynard Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;The General Theory, p383-4&lt;/ref&gt; How do ideologies become part of government policy?
In ''[[The Anatomy of Revolution]]'', [[Crane Brinton]] said that new ideology spreads when there is discontent with the old regime.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Extremists such as [[Lenin]] and [[Robespierre]] will overcome more moderate revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, CH 6&lt;/ref&gt;  This stage is soon followed by [[Thermidor]], a reining back of revolutionary enthusiasm under pragmatists like [[Stalin]] and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] who bring "normalcy and equilibrium".&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, CH 8&lt;/ref&gt;
A very similar sequence  ("men of ideas&gt;fanatics&gt;practical men of action") occurs in [[Eric Hoffer]], [[The True Believer]],&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, chapters 15, 16,17&lt;/ref&gt; and Brinton's sequence is reiterated by [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbright, The Arrogance of Power, 1967, chapters 3-7&lt;/ref&gt;
The revolution thus becomes established as an [[Ideocracy]], but its rise is likely to be checked by a [[Political midlife crisis]].

==Epistemological ideologies==
Even when the challenging of existing beliefs is encouraged, as in scientific theories, the dominant [[paradigm]] or [[mindset]] can prevent certain challenges, theories, or experiments from being advanced.

A special case of science adopted as ideology is that of ecology, which studies the relationships among living things on Earth. [[Perceptual psychology|Perceptual psychologist]] [[James J. Gibson]] believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]] itself. [[Linguistics|Linguist]] [[George Lakoff]] has proposed a [[cognitive science of mathematics]] wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception—which is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology.

[[Deep ecology]] and the modern [[ecology movement]] (and, to a lesser degree, [[Green parties]]) appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology.

Some accuse [[ecological economics]] of likewise turning scientific theory into [[political economy]], although theses in that science can often be tested. The modern practice of [[green economics]] fuses both approaches and seems to be part science, part ideology.

This is far from the only theory of economics raised to ideology status. Some notable economically based ideologies include [[neoliberalism]], [[monetarism]], [[mercantilism]], [[mixed economy]], [[social Darwinism]], [[communism]], [[laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]], and [[free trade]]. There are also current theories of [[safe trade]] and [[fair trade]] that can be seen as ideologies.

==Psychological research==
Psychological research&lt;ref name="jost2008"/&gt; increasingly suggests that ideologies reflect (unconscious) motivational processes, as opposed to the view that political convictions always reflect independent and unbiased thinking. Jost, Ledgerwood and Hardin proposed in 2008 that ideologies may function as prepackaged units of interpretation that spread because of basic human motives to understand the world, avoid existential threat, and maintain valued interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="jost2008"&gt;Jost, John T., Ledgerwood, Alison, &amp; Hardin, Curtis D. (2008). "Shared reality, system justification, and the relational basis of ideological beliefs." ''Social and Personality Psychology Compass'', 2, 171–186&lt;/ref&gt; These authors conclude that such motives may lead disproportionately to the adoption of [[system justification|system-justifying]] worldviews. Psychologists have generally found that [[personality traits]], individual difference variables, needs, and ideological beliefs seem to have a common thread.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Ideology and semiotic theory==
According to the semiotician [[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]], ideology "identifies a unitary object that incorporates complex sets of meanings with the social agents and processes that produced them. No other term captures this object as well as 'ideology'. [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s '[[episteme]]' is too narrow and abstract, not social enough. His 'discourse', popular because it covers some of ideology's terrain with less baggage, is too confined to verbal systems. 'Worldview' is too metaphysical, 'propaganda' too loaded. Despite or because of its contradictions, 'ideology' still plays a key role in semiotics oriented to social, political life."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]], [http://www.semioticon.com/seo/I/ideology.html# "Ideology"], at ''Semiotics Encyclopedia Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as [[Michael Freeden]] have also recently incorporated a [[semantics|semantic]] analysis to the study of ideologies.

== Sociological uses ==
Sociologists define ideology as "cultural beliefs that justify particular social arrangements, including patterns of inequality."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociology|last=Macionis|first=John J.|date=2010|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780205749898|edition=13th|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|pages=257|oclc=468109511}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dominant groups use these sets of cultural beliefs and practices to justify the systems of inequality that maintain their group's social power over non-dominant groups. Ideologies use a society's symbol system to organize social relations in a [[hierarchy]], with some social identities being superior to other social identities, which are considered inferior. The dominant ideology in a society is passed along through the society's major social institutions, such as the media, the family, education, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=Jon|publisher=MCGRAW-HILL|year=2017|isbn=978-1259702723|edition=5TH|location=[S.l.]|pages=65|oclc=968304061}}&lt;/ref&gt; As societies changed throughout history, so did the ideologies that justified systems of inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sociological examples of ideologies include: [[racism]]; [[sexism]]; [[heterosexism]]; [[ableism]]; and [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SOC 2018|last=Witt|first=John|publisher=MCGRAW-HILL|year=2017|isbn=978-1259702723|edition=5TH|location=[S.l.]|pages=|oclc=968304061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">The '''javelin argument''', credited to [[Lucretius]], is an ancient [[logical argument]] that the [[universe]], or [[cosmology|cosmological]] [[space]], must be infinite: 

:As to space, I need but ask you, how can that be bounded? For whatever bounds, it that thing must itself be bounded likewise; and to this bounding thing there must be a bound again, and so on for ever and ever throughout all immensity. Suppose, however, for a moment, all existing space to be bounded, and that a man runs forward to the uttermost borders, and stands upon the last verge of things, and then hurls forward a winged javelin,&amp;mdash; suppose you that the dart, when hurled by the vivid force, shall take its way to the point the darter aimed at, or that something will take its stand in the path of its flight, and arrest it? For one or other of these things must happen. There is a dilemma here that you never can escape from.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GyQgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA86 Google Books result]: [[William Hurrell Mallock|W. H. Mallock]], ''[[Lucretius]]''. John B. Alden:New York, 1883. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument was used to support the [[Epicurean]] thesis about the universe.

However, the argument assumes incorrectly that a finite universe must necessarily have a "limit" or edge. The argument fails in the case that [[shape of the universe|the universe might be shaped]] like the surface of a [[hypersphere]] or [[torus]]. (Consider a similar fallacious argument that the Earth's surface must be infinite in area: because otherwise one could go to the Earth's edge and throw a javelin, proving that the Earth's surface continued wherever the javelin hit the ground.)

:''Not to be confused with [[wikt:iustitia|iustitia]], the Latin word for "justice,"  [[Justitia]], the allegorical figure representing justice, or [[Justinian]], the byzantine emperor during the era of ancient Rome.''
'''''Justitium''''' is a [[concept]] of [[Roman law]], equivalent to the declaration of the [[state of emergency]]. It involved the suspension of civil business, typically including the courts, the treasury and the senate.  It was usually declared following a [[Monarch|sovereign]]'s death, during the troubled period of ''[[interregnum]]'', but also in case of invasions. However, in this last case, it was not as much the physical danger of invasion that justified the instauration of a state of exception, as the consequences that the news of the invasion had in [[Rome]] - for example, ''justitium'' was proclaimed at the news of [[Hannibal]]'s attacks.  The earliest recorded occasion of Justitium being invoked was for the same reason, when in 465 BC panic gripped the city due to a mistaken belief of imminent invasion by the [[Aequi]]. 

According to [[Giorgio Agamben]], ''justitium'' progressively came to mean, after the [[Roman Republic]], the public mourning of the sovereign: a sort of privatization or diversion of the danger threatening the ''[[polis]]'', as the sovereign claimed for himself the ''[[auctoritas]]'', or authority, necessary to the rule of law.

{{Marxism}}
Some Marxists{{Who?|date=December 2017}} posit what they deem to be '''Karl Marx's theory of human nature''', which they accord an important place in his critique of [[capitalism]], his conception of [[communism]], and his '[[historical materialism|materialist conception of history]]'. [[Karl Marx|Marx]], however, does not refer to [[human nature]] as such, but to ''Gattungswesen'', which is generally translated as 'species-being' or 'species-essence'. According to a note from the [[young Marx]] in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|Manuscripts of 1844]]'', the term is derived from [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]’s philosophy, in which it refers both to the nature of each human and of humanity as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/footnote.htm#fn20]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the sixth ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'' (1845), Marx criticizes the traditional conception of human nature as a species which incarnates itself in each individual, instead arguing that the conception of human nature is formed by the totality of [[social relations]]. Thus, the whole of human nature is not understood, as in classical idealist philosophy, as permanent and universal: the ''species-being'' is always determined in a specific social and historical formation, with some aspects being biological.

==The sixth thesis on Feuerbach and the determination of human nature by social relations==
The sixth of the ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'', written in 1845, provided an early discussion by Marx of the concept of human nature. It states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man [''menschliches Wesen'' = ‘human nature’]. But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations. Feuerbach, who does not enter upon a criticism of this real essence is hence obliged'': 
:1. ''To abstract from the historical process and to define the religious sentiment regarded by itself, and to presuppose an abstract — isolated - human individual.''
:2. ''The essence therefore can by him only be regarded as ‘species’, as an inner ‘dumb’ generality which unites many individuals only in a natural way.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, Marx appears to say that human nature is no more than what is made by the 'social relations'. [[Norman Geras]]'s ''[[Marx and Human Nature]]'' (1983), however, offers an argument against this position.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular Chapter Two&lt;/ref&gt; In outline, Geras shows that, while the social relations are held to 'determine' the nature of people, they are not the only such determinant. However, Marx makes statements where he specifically refers to a human nature which is more than what is conditioned by the circumstances of one's life. In ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', in a footnote [[Utilitarianism#Karl Marx's criticisms|critiquing utilitarianism]], he says that utilitarians must reckon with 'human nature in general, and then with human nature as modified in each historical epoch'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch24.htm#n50]&lt;/ref&gt; Marx is arguing against an abstract conception of human nature, offering instead an account rooted in sensuous life. While he is quite explicit that '[a]s individuals express their life, so they are. Hence what individuals are depends on the material conditions of their production',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; he also believes that human nature will condition (against the background of the productive forces and relations of production) the way in which individuals express their life.  History involves 'a continuous transformation of human nature',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02c.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; though this does not mean that every aspect of human nature is wholly variable; what is transformed need not be wholly transformed.

Marx did criticise the tendency to 'transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm], a process sometimes called "[[reification (Marxism)|reification]]".&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, he would likely have wanted to criticise certain ''aspects'' of some accounts of human nature.  Some people believe, for example, that humans are naturally selfish - [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/~allenw/webpapers/KantProblem.doc]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/3x.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615025735/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-a.html]&lt;/ref&gt; (Both Hobbes and Kant thought that it was necessary to constrain our human nature in order to achieve a good society - Kant thought we should use rationality, Hobbes thought we should use the force of the state - Marx, as we shall see, thought that the good society was one which allows our human nature its full expression.)  Most Marxists will argue that this view is an ideological illusion and the effect of [[commodity fetishism]]: the fact that people act selfishly is held to be a product of scarcity and capitalism, not an immutable human characteristic. For confirmation of this view, we can see how, in ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' Marx argues that capitalists are not motivated by any essential viciousness, but by the drive toward the bare 'semblance of a human existence'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch04.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; (Marx says 'semblance' because he believes that capitalists are as [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienated]] from their human nature under capitalism as the proletariat, even though their basic needs are better met.)

==Needs and drives==
In the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|1844 Manuscripts]]'' the [[young Marx]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''Man is directly a natural being. As a natural being and as a living natural being he is on the one hand endowed with natural powers, vital powers – he is an active natural being. These forces exist in him as tendencies and abilities – as instincts. On the other hand, as a natural, corporeal, sensuous objective being he is a suffering, conditioned and limited creature, like animals and plants. That is to say, the objects of his instincts exist outside him, as objects independent of him; yet these objects are objects that he needs – essential objects, indispensable to the manifestation and confirmation of his essential powers.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/hegel.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' Marx says his nature is a 'totality of needs and drives'.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch05.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The German Ideology'' he uses the formulation: 'their ''needs'', consequently their nature'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch03o.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; We can see then, that from Marx's early writing to his later work, he conceives of human nature as composed of 'tendencies', 'drives', 'essential powers', and 'instincts' to act in order to satisfy 'needs' for external objectives.  For Marx then, an explanation of human nature is an explanation of the needs of humans, together with the assertion that they will act to fulfill those needs. (c.f. ''The German Ideology'', chapter 3).&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch03abs.htm#p305-7].&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Geras gives a schedule of some of the needs which Marx says are characteristic of humans:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...for other human beings, for sexual relations, for food, water, clothing, shelter, rest and, more generally, for circumstances that are conducive to health rather than disease.  There is another one ... the need of people for a breadth and diversity of pursuit and hence of personal development, as Marx himself expresses these, 'all-round activity', 'all-round development of individuals', 'free development of individuals', 'the means of cultivating [one's] gifts in all directions', and so on.''&lt;ref&gt;Norman Geras, quoting Marx in his ''Marx and Human Nature'' (1983, p. 72)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marx says 'It is true that eating, drinking, and procreating, etc., are ... genuine human functions. However, when abstracted from other aspects of human activity, and turned into final and exclusive ends, they are animal.'&lt;ref&gt;First chapter of the ''1844 Manuscripts''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productive activity, the objects of humans and actualisation==

===Humans as free, purposive producers===
In several passages throughout his work, Marx shows how he believes humans to be essentially different from other animals. 'Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything else you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organisation.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In this passage from ''The German Ideology'', Marx alludes to one difference: that humans produce their physical environments. But do not a few other animals also produce aspects of their environment as well? The previous year, Marx had already acknowledged:

:It is true that animals also produce. They build nests and dwellings, like the bee, the beaver, the ant, etc. But they produce only their own immediate needs or those of their young; they produce only when immediate physical need compels them to do so, while man produces even when he is free from physical need and truly produces only in freedom from such need; they produce only themselves, while man reproduces the whole of nature; their products belong immediately to their physical bodies, while man freely confronts his own product. Animals produce only according to the standards and needs of the species to which they belong, while man is capable of producing according to the standards of every species and of applying to each object its inherent standard; hence, man also produces in accordance with the laws of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same work, Marx writes:

:The animal is immediately one with its life activity. It is not distinct from that activity; it is that activity. Man makes his life activity itself an object of his will and consciousness. He has conscious life activity. It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious life activity directly distinguishes man from animal life activity. Only because of that is he a species-being. Or, rather, he is a conscious being – i.e., his own life is an object for him, only because he is a species-being. Only because of that is his activity free activity. Estranged labour reverses the relationship so that man, just because he is a conscious being, makes his life activity, his essential being, a mere means for his existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the segment on Estranged Labour:

:Man is a species-being, not only because he practically and theoretically makes the species – both his own and those of other things – his object, but also – and this is simply another way of saying the same thing – because he looks upon himself as the present, living species, because he looks upon himself as a universal and therefore free being.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than twenty years later, in ''Capital'', he came to muse on a similar subject:

:A spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality. At the end of every labour-process, we get a result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement. He not only effects a change of form in the material on which he works, but he also realises a purpose of his own that gives the law to his ''modus operandi'', and to which he must subordinate his will. And this subordination is no mere momentary act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

From these passages we can observe something of Marx's beliefs about humans. That they characteristically produce their environments, and that they would do so, even were they not under the burden of 'physical need' - indeed, they will produce the 'whole of [their] nature', and may even create 'in accordance with the laws of beauty'. Perhaps most importantly, though, their creativity, their production is ''purposive'' and ''planned''. Humans, then, make plans for their future activity, and attempt to exercise their production (even lives) according to them. Perhaps most importantly, and most cryptically, Marx says that humans make both their 'life activity' and 'species' the 'object' of their will.  They relate to their life activity, and are not simply identical with it. [[Michel Foucault]]'s definition of [[biopower|biopolitics]] as the moment when "man begins to take itself as a conscious object of elaboration" may be compared to Marx's definition hereby exposed.

===Life and the species as the objects of humans===
To say that A is the object of some subject B, means that B (specified as an agent) acts upon A in some respect. Thus if 'the proletariat smashes the state' then 'the state' is the object of the proletariat (the subject), in respect of smashing. It is similar to saying that A is the ''objective'' of B, though A could be a whole sphere of concern and not a closely defined aim.  In this context, what does it mean to say that humans make their 'species' and their 'lives' their 'object'? It's worth noting that Marx's use of the word 'object' can imply that these are things which humans produces, or makes, just as they might produce a material object. If this inference is correct, then those things that Marx says about human production above, also apply to the production of human life, by humans. And simultaneously, 'As individuals express their life, so they are. What they are, therefore, coincides with their production, both with what they produce and with how they produce. The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

To make one's life one's object is therefore to treat one's life as something that is under one's control. To raise in imagination plans for one's future and present, and to have a stake in being able to fulfill those plans. To be able to live a life of this character is to achieve 'self-activity' (actualisation), which Marx believes will only become possible after communism has replaced capitalism. 'Only at this stage does self-activity coincide with material life, which corresponds to the development of individuals into complete individuals and the casting-off of all natural limitations. The transformation of labour into self-activity corresponds to the transformation of the earlier limited intercourse into the intercourse of individuals as such'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

What is involved in making one's species one's object is more complicated (see Allen Wood 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;16–21). In one sense, it emphasises the essentially social character of humans, and their need to live in a community of the species. In others, it seems to emphasise that we attempt to make our lives expressions of our species-essence; further that we have goals concerning what becomes of the species in general. The idea covers much of the same territory as 'making one's life one's object': it concerns self-consciousness, purposive activity, and so forth.

===Humans as ''homo faber''?===
It is often said that Marx conceived of humans as ''[[homo faber]]'', referring to [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s definition of 'man as the [[tool]]-making animal' - that is, as 'man, the maker',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130110083614/http://media.pfeiffer.edu/lridener/DSS/Marx/MARXW3.HTML]&lt;/ref&gt; though he never used the term himself. Above, we indicated that one of Marx's central contentions about humans was that they were differentiated by the manner in which they produce and that thus, somehow, production was one of humans' essential activities. In this context, it is worth noting that Marx does not always address 'labour' or 'work' in such glowing terms. He says that communism 'does away with labour'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, 'If it is desired to strike a mortal blow at private property, one must attack it not only as a material state of affairs, but also as activity, as labour. It is one of the greatest misapprehensions to speak of free, human, social labour, of labour without private property. “Labour” by its very nature is unfree, unhuman, unsocial activity, determined by private property and creating private property.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/03/list.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Under Capitalism '[t]he capitalist functions only as capital personified, capital as a person, just as the worker only functions as the personification of labour, which belongs to him as torment, as exertion'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/economic/ch02.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally held that Marx's view was that productive activity is an essential human activity, and can be rewarding when pursued freely. Marx's use of the words 'work' and 'labour' in the section above may be unequivocally negative; but this was not always the case, and is most strongly found in his early writing. However, Marx was always clear that under capitalism, labour was something inhuman, and dehumanising. 'labour is external to the worker – i.e., does not belong to his essential being; that he, therefore, does not confirm himself in his work, but denies himself, feels miserable and not happy, does not develop free mental and physical energy, but mortifies his flesh and ruins his mind'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; While under communism, 'In the individual expression of my life I would have directly created your expression of your life, and therefore in my individual activity I would have directly confirmed and realised my true nature, my human nature, my communal nature'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/james-mill/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nature and historical materialism==
[[Marx's theory of history]] attempts to describe the way in which humans change their environments and (in dialectical relation) their environments change them as well. That is:

:Not only do the objective conditions change in the act of reproduction, e.g. the village becomes a town, the wilderness a cleared field etc., but the producers change, too, in that they bring out new qualities in themselves, develop themselves in production, transform themselves, develop new powers and ideas, new modes of intercourse, new needs and new language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch09.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further Marx sets out his 'materialist conception of history' in opposition to 'idealist' conceptions of history; that of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], for instance. 'The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'History does nothing, it “possesses no immense wealth”, it “wages no battles”. It is man, real, living man who does all that, who possesses and fights; “history” is not, as it were, a person apart, using man as a means to achieve its own aims; history is nothing but the activity of man pursuing his aims'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch06_2.htm#history]&lt;/ref&gt; So we can see that, even before we begin to consider the precise character of human nature, 'real, living' humans, 'the activity of man pursuing his aims' is the very building block of Marx's theory of history.  Humans act upon the world, changing it and themselves; and in doing so they 'make history'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; However, even beyond this, human nature plays two key roles. In the first place, it is part of the explanation for the growth of the [[productive forces]], which Marx conceives of as the driving force of history. Secondly, the particular needs and drives of humans explain the class antagonism which is generated under capitalism.

===Human nature and the expansion of the productive forces===
It has been held by several writers that it is Marx's conception of human nature which explains the 'development thesis' (Cohen, 1978) concerning the expansion of the productive forces, which according to Marx, is itself the fundamental driving force of history.  If true, this would make his account of human nature perhaps the most fundamental aspect of his work. Geras writes, (1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;107–108, italics in original) ''historical materialism itself, this whole distinctive approach to society that originates with Marx, rests squarely upon the idea of a human nature''. It highlights that specific nexus of universal needs and capacities which explains the human productive process and man's organized transformation of the material environment; which process and transformation it treats in turn as the basis both of the social order and of historical change.' G.A. Cohen (1988, p.&amp;nbsp;84): 'The tendency's autonomy is just its independence of social structure, its rootedness in fundamental material facts of human nature and the human situation.' Allen Wood (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;75): 'Historical progress consists fundamentally in the growth of people's abilities to shape and control the world about them.  This is the most basic way in which they develop and express their human essence' (see also, the quotation from Allen Wood above).

In his article ''Reconsidering Historical Materialism'', however, Cohen gives an argument to the effect that human nature cannot be the premise on which the plausibility of the expansion of the productive forces is grounded.

:'Production in the historical anthropology is not identical with production in the theory of history.  According to the anthropology, people flourish in the cultivation and exercise of their manifold powers, and are especially productive - which in ''this'' instance means creative - in the condition of freedom conferred by material plenty.  But, in the production of interest to the theory of history, people produce not freely but because they have to, since nature does not otherwise supply their wants; and the development in history of the productive power of ''man'' (that is, of man as such, of man as a species) occurs at the expense of the creative capacity of the ''men'' who are agents and victims of that development.' (p. 166 in ed. Callinicos, 1989)

The implication of this is that hence 'one might ... imagine two kinds of creature, one whose essence it was to create and the other not, undergoing similarly toilsome histories because of similarly adverse circumstances. In one case, but not the other, the toil would be a self-alienating exercise of essential powers' (p.&amp;nbsp;170). Hence, 'historical materialism and Marxist philosophical anthropology are independent of, though also consistent with, each other' (p.&amp;nbsp;174, see especially sections 10 and 11). The problem is this: it seems as though the motivation most people have for the work they do isn't the exercise of their creative capacity; on the contrary, labour is alienated by definition in the capitalist system based on [[salary]], and people only do it because they have to. They go to work not to express their human nature but to find theirs means of subsistence.&lt;!-- see the end of first chapter 1844 Manuscripts: all of labour is alienated, there is no sense in saying "most" --&gt; So in that case, why do the productive forces grow - does human nature have anything to do with it?  The answer to this question is a difficult one, and a closer consideration of the arguments in the literature is necessary for a full answer than can be given in this article. However, it is worth bearing in mind that Cohen had previously been committed to the strict view that human nature (and other 'asocial premises') were ''sufficient'' for the development of the productive forces - it could be that they are only one ''necessary'' constituent. It is also worth considering that by 1988 (see quotation above), he appears to consider that the problem is resolved.

Some needs are far more important than others. In ''The German Ideology'' Marx writes that 'life involves before everything else eating and drinking, a habitation, clothing and many other things'. All those other aspects of human nature which he discusses (such as 'self-activity') are therefore subordinate to the priority given to these. Marx makes explicit his view that humans develop new needs to replace old: 'the satisfaction of the first need (the action of satisfying, and the instrument of satisfaction which has been acquired) leads to new needs'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nature, Marx's ethical thought and alienation==
Geras says of Marx's work that: 'Whatever else it is, theory and socio-historical explanation, and scientific as it may be, that work is a moral indictment resting on the conception of essential human needs, an ethical standpoint, in other words, in which a view of human nature is involved' (1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;83–84).

===Alienation===
:''For the main article on this topic, see [[Marx's theory of alienation]]''
Alienation, for Marx, is the estrangement of humans from aspects of their human nature. Since - as we have seen - human nature consists in a particular set of vital drives and tendencies, whose exercise constitutes flourishing, alienation is a condition wherein these drives and tendencies are stunted.  For essential powers, alienation substitutes disempowerment; for making one's own life one's object, one's life becoming an object of capital.  Marx believes that alienation will be a feature of all society before communism. The opposite of, alienation is 'actualisation' or 'self-activity' - the activity of the self, controlled by and for the self.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Gerald Cohen's criticism ==
One important criticism of Marx's 'philosophical anthropology' (i.e. his conception of humans) is offered by [[Gerald Cohen]], the leader of [[Analytical Marxism]], in ''Reconsidering Historical Materialism'' (in ed. Callinicos, 1989).  Cohen claims: 'Marxist philosophical anthropology is one sided.  Its conception of human nature and human good overlooks the need for self-identity than which nothing is more essentially human.' (p.&amp;nbsp;173, see especially sections 6 and 7).  The consequence of this is held to be that 'Marx and his followers have underestimated the importance of phenomena, such as religion and nationalism, which satisfy the need for self-identity.  (Section 8.)' (p.&amp;nbsp;173).  Cohen describes what he sees as the origins of Marx's alleged neglect: 'In his anti-Hegelian, Feuerbachian affirmation of the radical objectivity of matter, Marx focused on the relationship of the subject to an object which is in no way subject, and, as time went on, he came to neglect the subject's relationship to itself, and that aspect of the subject's relationship to others which is a mediated (that is, indirect), form of relationship to itself' (p.&amp;nbsp;155).

Cohen believes that people are driven, typically, not to create identity, but to preserve that which they have in virtue, for example, of 'nationality, or race, or religion, or some slice or amalgam thereof' (pp.&amp;nbsp;156–159).  Cohen does not claim that 'Marx denied that there is a need for self-definition, but [instead claims that] he failed to give the truth due emphasis' (p.&amp;nbsp;155).  Nor does Cohen say that the sort of self-understanding that can be found through religion etc. is accurate (p.&amp;nbsp;158).  Of nationalism, he says 'identifications [can] take benign, harmless, and catastrophically malignant forms' (p.&amp;nbsp;157) and does not believe 'that the state is a good medium for the embodiment of nationality' (p.&amp;nbsp;164).&lt;!--- ===Unjustified optimism and generalisation===
As scared above, Maxiiii seems to deny that there is anything essentially negative about human nature, though vicious activities can arise from the tendency to selfishly fulfill basic needs.  Theorists of [[evolutionary psychology]] might dispute Marx's contention, though they would not take the diametrically opposed view.  (See, for example, [[Matt Ridley]]'s ''[[The Origins Of Virtue]]''.)  Also, though Marx does stress the importance for each person of development along their own individual lines, he does not recognise (if there really are such to recognise), distinct '[[personality types]]' (see also [[Personality psychology#Personality tests|personality tests]]).  If it were possible to show that some people were essentially leaders, and others followers (for example), it might provide problems for Marx's conception of Communism as a society in which everyone was equal ''and'' able to fully express their human nature.  This might be difficult for his theory, in the same way as would discovery of natural human viciousness.  It should be clearly stated, though, that it has not thus far been possible to show that humans are essentially vicious, or divided pre-socialisation into rigid and immutable types.

===Primary texts===
&lt;small&gt;
The two texts in which Marx most directly discusses human nature are the [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/james-mill/index.htm ''Comments on James Mill''] and the piece on [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm  ''Estranged Labour''] in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (published in 1932).  Both of these pieces date from 1844, and as such were written by the [[young Marx]]; some analysts ([[Louis Althusser]], etc.) assert that work from this period differs markedly in its ideas from the later work. 
&lt;/small&gt;

===Accounts prior to 1978===
&lt;small&gt;
In certain aspects, the views of many earlier writers on this topic are generally believed to have been superseded.  Nevertheless, here is a selection of the best writing prior to 1978.  Much of it addresses human nature through the strongly related concept of alienation:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28933">'''Modern Stoicism'''  is an intellectual and popular movement in the late 20th and early 21st century which attempts to revive the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] in the modern setting. It  is not to be confused with [[Neostoicism]], an analogous phenomenon in the 17th century. The term "Modern Stoicism" covers both the revival of interest in the Stoic philosophy and the philosophical efforts to adjust
Ancient Stoicism to the language and conceptual framework of the present.  'The rise of Modern Stoicism' has received attention in the international media since around November 2012 when the first Annual Stoic Week event was organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joe Gelonesi|title=The rise of Modern Stoicism|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/modern-day-stoicism/5896364|accessdate=20 July 2017|work=ABC - Australian Broadcasting Corporation|agency=ABC - Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
=== Philosophically ===
Modern Stoicism has developed in the context of the 20th-century surge of interest in virtue ethics in general. "The [...] work by philosophers like [[Philippa Foot]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and [[Martha Nussbaum]], among others, have brought back virtue ethics as a viable alternative to the dominant [[Kantian ethics|Kantian]]-[[Deontological ethics|deontological]] and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]]-[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] approaches."&lt;ref name=PigliucciIEP&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/ |title=Stoicism |last=Pigliucci |first=Massimo|date=December 14, 2016 |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Stoicism draws a lot from the late 20th and early 21st century spike in publications of scholarly works on ancient Stoics. Beyond that, “the Modern Stoicism movement traces its roots to the work of Dr Albert Ellis, who developed Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy,&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rebtnetwork.org/ |title=REBT Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Aaron T. Beck,&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_T._Beck/ |title=Arron T Beck |website=Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who is regarded by many as the father to early versions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. [[Viktor Frankl]] also found stoicism useful while he was imprisoned in a [[Nazi concentration camp]] during [[World War II]]; he later developed his theory known as [[logotherapy]]. &lt;ref name=PigliucciIEP/&gt;

One major premise of Modern Stoicism can be expressed as, in [[Lawrence C. Becker|Lawrence Becker]]'s words, "it is interesting to try to imagine what might have happened if Stoicism had had a continuous twenty-three-hundred-year history; if Stoics had had to confront Bacon and Descartes, Newton and Locke, Hobbes and Bentham, Hume and Kant, Darwin and Marx."&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt; Or, as Massimo Pigliucci puts it more concisely, "it is worth considering what it means to 'be a Stoic' in the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/how-to-be-a-stoic/?_r=0|title=How To Be A Stoic?|last=Pigliucci|first=Massimo|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major modern work that spelled out the key premises of Modern Stoicism is, arguably, ''A New Stoicism''&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; by Lawrence Becker, first published in 1997.&lt;ref name="PigliucciIEP" /&gt; For other important books, see the notable books section below.

===Psychology and psychotherapy===
Stoic philosophy was the original philosophical inspiration for modern [[cognitive psychotherapy]], particularly as mediated by Dr Albert Ellis' Rational-Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT), the major precursor of [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]].  The original cognitive therapy treatment manual for depression by Aaron T. Beck et al. states, "The philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Rush, Shaw, &amp; Emery  (1979)  Cognitive Therapy of Depression, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  A well-known quotation from ''The Handbook'' of Epictetus was taught to most clients during the initial session of traditional REBT by Ellis and his followers: "It's not the events that upset us, but our judgments about the events."  This subsequently became a common element in the "socialization" phase of many other approaches to CBT. The question of Stoicism's influence on modern psychotherapy, particularly REBT and CBT, was described in detail in ''The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy'' (2010) by Donald Robertson.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, several early 20th century psychotherapists were influenced by stoicism, most notably the "rational persuasion" school founded by the Swiss neurologist and psychotherapist [[Paul Charles Dubois|Paul DuBois]], who drew heavily on Stoicism in his clinical work and encouraged his clients to study passages from Seneca as homework assignments.

=== As a popular movement ===
It is characteristic of the Modern Stoicism movement that it is global and that it relies heavily on the social media and online communities. As E.O. Scott puts it "Modern Stoicism is really a “Web 2.0” phenomenon."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ericsiggyscott.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/a-quick-map-of-the-online-stoic-community/|title=A Quick Map of the Online Stoic Community|last=Scott|first=E.O.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key sites is the Modern Stoicism website, which harbors the Stoicism Today blog and hosts the Annual Stoic Week (online) and Stoicon (offline) events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/12/05/meet-real-stoics-taking-psychology-back-3rd-century-bc-287901.html|title=Meet the Real Stoics Taking Psychology Back to the 3rd Century BC|first=Timothy Willis On 12/1/14 at 7:33|last=AM|date=1 December 2014|website=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important place is the New Stoa, which was founded in May 1996 and is arguably the first lasting stoic community on the internet. Three key podcasts talking about Stoicism applied to modern thought are the ''Stoic Solutions Podcast'' hosted by Justin Vacula&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://justinvacula.com|title=Stoic Solutions Podcast - Practical Wisdom for Everyday Life|website=Stoic Solutions Podcast|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''The Practical Stoic Podcast'' hosted by Simon Drew &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://practicalstoicpodcast.podbean.com|title=The Practical Stoic Podcast with Simon Drew|last=Development|first=PodBean|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Steve Karafit's ''The Sunday Stoic'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sundaystoic.wixsite.com/home|title=Home {{!}} Sunday Stoic|work=Home {{!}} Sunday Stoic|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of personal blogs exploring stoicism, some of them run by notable stoic scholars (e.g. Massimo Pigliucci, William Irvine or John Sellars) and some by therapists who explore stoic applications (e.g. Donald Robertson). In addition, articles on Stoicism have appeared on popular websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stoicism-lessons-life-death-2017-6|title=7 insights from the ancient philosophy of Marcus Aurelius that will change the way you think about life, death, and time|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-shammas/want-happiness-become-a-p_b_3759317.html|title=Want Happiness?

According to E.O.Scott, "arguably the most important and influential gathering place for Modern Stoics [online]"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; is the "stoicism group" on Facebook of ~27 000 people (as of July 19, 2017). The analogous Reddit group has amassed ~96 400 users (as of June 11, 2018). Beyond the Anglophone there is the “Sztuka życia według stoików” site run by Piotr Stankiewicz, "Stoicyzm Uliczny" run by Marcin Fabjański and Centrum Praktyki Stoickiej run by Tomasz Mazur and others.

Applications of Modern Stoicism are reported across industries. According to "Forbes," Modern Stoic thought "hold[s] fascinating promise for business and government leaders tackling global problems in a turbulent, post-recession slump."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriesheffield/2013/12/01/want-an-unconquerable-mind-try-stoic-philosophy/#7b97cceb750c|title=Want an Unconquerable Mind? Try Stoic Philosophy|last=Sheffield|first=Carrie|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two Stoic academics, Kai Whiting and Leonidas Konstantakos, have warned against using "life-hack Stoicism" or "Silicon Valley Stoicism", as the primary means of understanding Stoic philosophy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/04/17/life-hack-stoicism-is-it-worth-it/|title=Life-Hack Stoicism—Is It Worth It?|last=Whiting|first=Kai|date=2018-04-17|work=The Partially Examined Life Philosophy Podcast|access-date=2018-04-26|last2=Konstantakos|first2=Leonidas|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Subsequently, they discussed on a popular Stoic blog, Stoicism's role in advocating for change in society, including when it comes to standing against gender-based discrimination in the workplace &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailystoic.com/stoicism-beyond-the-self/|title=Taking Stoicism Beyond the Self: The Power To Change Society|last=Whiting|first=Kai|last2=Konstankos|first2=Leonidas|date=5 May 2018|website=The Daily Stoic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Similarities of Modern Stoicism and Third Wave [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]] have been suggested as well, and its potency in treating depression has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/10146546/Anxious-Depressed-Try-Greek-philosophy.html|title=Anxious?

== Key concepts ==
=== Problems with the appeal to nature ===
Presumably, the single most difficult challenge that Modern Stoicism faces is its relationship to the core principle of Ancient Stoicism, that is to the principle of “following nature.” In a word, the Ancient Stoics put forward it was unquestionable that in order to live a good life, one needed to live consistently with nature. According to the Ancient Stoics, nature was by definition good and everything which was conformable to nature was deemed good. Moreover, the Ancient Stoics had a teleological outlook on the world, that is, they held that everything in the universe was purposefully and rationally organized to a good end.

However, this view is much more difficult to uphold in the present day. As Becker puts it, “science presented significant challenges to our [Stoic] metaphysical views.”&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Stoicism|last=Becker|first=Lawrence|publisher=Princetion University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The notion of the rational organization of the world seems much more doubtful in the 21st century than it, presumably, was two millennia ago. “When we face the universe,” Becker writes, “we confront its indifference to us and our own insignificance to it. It takes no apparent notice of us, has no role other than Extra for us to play, no aim for us to follow.”&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;{{rp|11}} Even more pressing questions are raised when we face our own human realm, with the long and still expanding record of genocide and atrocity and the manslaughter that followed. These are major challenges for the ancient Stoic view of the world as a rational and essentially good being.

We happen upon an analogous problem if we narrow down our interest to human nature (as contrasted to the nature of the universe as a whole). In other words, the idea of “following our human nature” also raises serious questions. As Becker describes it, “it is ‘natural’ to find these [defining] traits in human character and conduct, but it is equally natural to find a significant number of exceptions. As a result, none of these characteristics fits into the most familiar forms of ethical argument from human nature, e.g. (a) that humans are by nature X, and that Y is contrary to X, hence, that Y is contrary to human nature; or (b) that X is what defines the unique function (the essence) of a human being, thus to flourish as a human being is to excel at X."&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; In this vein, “following human nature” yields no specific guidelines for conduct either. All told, this is one of the central problems for Modern Stoicism: that in the 21st century it is far more difficult to ground our ethical framework in “nature,” be it universal, cosmic nature, or to special human nature.

=== Following nature as following the facts ===
Becker acknowledges this problem and even goes to the point of asserting that “stoic ethics would be much better off without its ‘follow nature’ slogan."&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Yet, he reflects that the stoics are, “however, too deeply branded with it to renounce it now. The best we can do is reinterpret it.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

The reinterpretation he proposes is this. “Following nature means following the facts. It means getting the facts about the physical and social world we inhabit, and the facts about our situation in it [...] before we deliberate about normative matters. It means facing those facts - accepting them for exactly what they are, no more and no less - before we draw normative conclusions from them. It means doing ethics from the facts constructing normative propositions a posteriori. It means adjusting those normative propositions to fit changes in the facts, and accepting those adjustments for exactly what they are, no more and no less. And it means living within the facts - within the realm of actual rather than hypothetical norm.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

This process of “getting the facts about the [...] world”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; happens in some measure (but not exclusively) through science. In Becker’s words, “The biological, behavioral, and social sciences contribute to ethics in three important ways: they offer a wealth of material that can be used in the naturalistic arguments [...], they offer explanatory theories (e.g. from evolutionary biology) that help separate relatively fixed traits from transient or malleable ones and they offer powerful, elaborate analyses of learning, rationality, and rational choice."&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Ethical reasoning of a stoic “cannot begin until all relevant description, representation, and prediction are in hand, [...] – until, let us say, the empirical work is done.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; This empirical work may be obtained by the scientific method and thus the principle of “following facts” can be (in some contexts) read as “not contradicting science” (not to be confused with simple “following science,” which would be reductive and misleading).

=== Virtue, agency, happiness ===
Becker organizes his reading of stoic ethics around the concept of agency. “The Development of Virtue [happens through] the Perfection of Agency,”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; or through the “ideal agency”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; as he calls it. In other words, this can be described as the belief in the “inherent primacy of virtue in terms of maximization of one’s agency.”&lt;ref name=PigliucciIEP/&gt; This agency is understood in terms of “a balance of control and stability”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; and is executed all-things-considered, i.e. upon having obtained the most detailed information about the facts as available.

Happiness, in this view, is also explained and achieved through agency. “We hold,” this is Becker again, “that happiness as understood by mature and fit agents is a property of whole lives, not of transient mental states. We hold that it is achievable only through a proper balance of stability and control in the exercise of agency.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; And, “this sort of happiness with one’s life also appears to be a psychological consequence of healthy agency [...] The life of a stoic sage is filled with such happiness, as a consequence of virtue."&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

=== Degrees of virtue ===
In Becker’s version of Stoicism, several dogmas of Ancients Stoics are questioned or challenged. For example, the traditional stoic all-or-nothing understanding of virtue is questioned (to some extent). In the original, Orthodox Stoicism one was either a perfect sage or no sage at all, there was no “middle ground,” or “in between.” The Ancient Stoic virtue admits of no degrees. And yet, Becker lays ground for a softer, more nuanced approach. “You can drown,” he writes, “face down on the calm surface of the sea as surely as at the bottom. [...] We [i.e. the Modern Stoics] follow later colleagues in thinking that these doctrines are untenable.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

=== Aspirations for universality ===
Another dogma of the Ancient Stoics that is sometimes questioned in Modern Stoicism is the idea that the gateways of stoic philosophy are open to everyone and that living a stoic life is definitely the best option for every human being. E.g. in Becker’s ''New Stoicism'' suggests that “acting appropriately, as understood here, is a special kind of optimization project – one that it is logically possible to reject. (Which people with compulsive, obsessive, or addictive personalities may in fact reject.) [Modern Stoic] claim is, only healthy agents, at least those well along the road to fitness in their deliberative powers, cannot plausibly reject it.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

=== Stoicism versus Aristotle ===
Another example of possible discrepancies between the Modern Stoic approach and Ancient Stoicism is the question of whether a certain amount of external goods is required for a good life. In the Orthodox Stoic view there are absolutely no entry conditions to living a stoic life. One can become a sage no matter the circumstances: be it poverty, illness, physical adversity and so on. This issue has been traditionally the bone of contention between the stoics (who held the mentioned position) and the followers of Aristotle (who held that a certain amount of external goods is necessary for development of virtue). In this context, Becker’s words are quite non-orthodox coming from the stoic position. He writes that  “it is [...] plausible to conclude, however, that there is an identifiable kernel of bodily and psychological health that is a necessary condition of all further development. If this kernel is damaged, so is the capacity to develop agency.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

=== Dichotomy of control ===
A very important concept of Traditional Stoicism is the distinction between things within one’s power and not within our power. While this concept is embraced fully by many Modern Stoics, some reinterpret it. Becker, for instance, points out that the whole idea of the dichotomy is in fact a major oversimplification. As he puts it, “[the] distinction between things that are within our control, or ‘up to us,’ and those who are not [...] [is] misleading.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Instead, he proposes to read it along the lines of “it is wise to calibrate the strength, depth, and dissemination of our attachments to the fragility and transience of the objects involved.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

On the other hand, William Irvine goes even further and undermines the central premise of the dichotomy, i.e. that the distinction between things “in our power” and “not in our power” is sharp and that there is no third option. In other words, Irvine suggests the possibility of turning the “dichotomy of control” into a “trichotomy of control.” Irvine argues “We can restate Epictetus’s dichotomy as follows: There are things over which we have complete control and things over which we have no control at all. As well as suggesting "the dichotomy is a false dichotomy, since it ignores the existence of things over which we have some but not complete control.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guide to the Good Life. The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy|last=Irvine|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pigliucci describes it as follows: “some things are up to us (chiefly, our judgments and actions), some things are not up to us (major historical events, natural phenomena), but on a number of other things we have partial control. Irvine recasts the third category in terms of internalized goals, which makes more sense of the original dichotomy.”&lt;ref name=PigliucciIEP/&gt;

=== The question of ascesis and renunciation ===
There is also no unity in evaluating the ascetic elements in stoicism and in defining the sage’s attitude towards the ordinary pleasures of life. Becker mentions “the confusion, both among stoics and their critics” and the “false notion that the stoic ideal is a life devoid of the ordinary pleasures of sex, food, drink, music, wealth, fame, friends, and so on”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; (according to Becker this confusion happens because “stoics have occasionally claimed that, for the sage, ''eudaiomonia'' somehow replaces ordinary happiness”.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; In this vein, Stankiewicz argued against the “ascetic misinterpretation,” saying that “stoicism is not asceticism and a stoic is not a monk. In fact, it is the school of The Pale Epicureans that is closer to the ideal of abstemiousness. The stoic proposal is far broader and it extends far beyond the narrow passage of the ascetic way.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoicism Today: Selected Writings vol. II|last=Ussher [ed.]|first=Patrick|publisher=Stoicism Today|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, “we [the Modern Stoics] must face the lushness, diversity and – yes! – sensuality of life and we have to live and thrive inside this world, accepting it as it is. Unlike a monk, a stoic doesn’t dodge the myriad of different aspects of the earthly and sensual life.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On the other hand, Kevin Patrick refutes this argument, ridiculing it as “hedonic stoicism” and saying that the mentioned position “falls into the more common trap and misinterpretation, that since externals are indifferent to us, we should go ahead and indulge in all of those things for which we have a proclivity.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; “Modern Stoics,” he concludes, “ought to be stoics.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Irvine takes a more modest stance and he proposes a program of “voluntary discomfort.” As he describes it: “By undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort – by, for example, choosing to be cold and hungry when we could be warm and well fed – we harden ourselves against misfortunes that might befell us in the future. If all we know is comfort, we might be traumatized when we are forced to experience pain or discomfort, as we someday almost surely will. In other words, voluntary discomfort can be thought of as a kind of vaccine: By exposing ourselves to a small amount of a weakened virus now, we create in ourselves an immunity that will protect us from a debilitating illness in the future.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Overview==
The elements that comprise a philosophical position consist of [[statement (logic)|statements]] which are [[belief|believed]] to be [[truth|true]] by the thinkers who accept them, and which may or may not be [[empiricism|empirical]]. The sciences have a very clear idea of what a theory is; however in the arts such as philosophy, the definition is more hazy.&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt; Philosophical positions are not necessarily [[scientific theory|scientific theories]], although they may consist of both empirical and non-empirical statements.

In essence, the collective statements of all [[philosophical movement]]s, [[school of thought|schools of thought]], and [[belief system]]s consist of philosophical positions. Also included among philosophical positions are many [[principle]]s, [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[Norm (philosophy)|rules]], [[paradox]]es, [[law]]s, as well as 'ologies, 'isms, 'sis's, and [[List of effects|effects]].&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt;

Some examples of philosophical positions include:
* [[Metatheory]]; positions about the formation and content of theorems, such as [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]].
* [[Political theory]]; positions that underlie a [[political philosophy]], such as [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]].
* [[Ethical theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]; positions about the nature and purpose of [[ethical]] statements,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard T. Garner]] and [[Bernard Rosen]], ''Moral Philosophy: A Systematic Introduction to Normative Ethics and Meta-ethics.'' (Macmillan, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Kantianism#Ethics|ethical theory]] of [[Immanuel Kant]].
* [[Critical theory]]; in its narrow sense, a [[Western Europe]]an body of [[Frankfurt School]] [[Marxist]] thought that aims at criticizing and transforming, rather than merely explaining, social structures.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[Max Horkheimer]], ''Traditional and Critical Theory'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; In a broader sense, "critical theory" relates to a wide variety of political, literary, and philosophical positions that take at least some of their inspiration from the Frankfurt School and its dialectic, and that typically contest the possibility of objectivity or aloofness from political positions and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/ Critical theory]" at the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  

Philosophical positions may also take the form of a [[life stance]], [[religion]], [[world view]], or [[ideology]].

{{Science|expanded=phil/hist}}

'''Philosophy of science''' is a sub-field of [[philosophy]] concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of [[science]]. The central questions of this study concern [[Demarcation problem|what qualifies as science]], the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[epistemology]], for example, when it explores the relationship between science and [[truth]].

There is no consensus among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the [[scientific realism|truth about unobservable things]] and [[problem of induction|whether scientific reasoning can be justified]] at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as [[philosophy of biology|biology]] or [[philosophy of physics|physics]]). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.

While philosophical thought pertaining to science dates back at least to the time of [[Aristotle]], philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century in the wake of the [[logical positivism]] movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' was also formative, challenging the view of [[scientific progress]] as steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a "[[paradigm]]," the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324460/Thomas-S-Kuhn Thomas S. Kuhn.] "Instead, he argued that the paradigm determines the kinds of experiments scientists perform, the types of questions they ask, and the problems they consider important."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Popper]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] moved on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for scientific methodology.

Subsequently, the [[Coherentism|coherentist]] approach to science, in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of observations as part of a coherent whole, became prominent due to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] and others. Some thinkers such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] seek to ground science in [[axiomatic]] assumptions, such as the [[uniformity of nature]]. A vocal minority of philosophers, and [[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) in particular, argue that there is no such thing as the "[[scientific method]]", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly [[supernatural]] ones. Another approach to thinking about science involves studying how [[Constructivist epistemology|knowledge is created]] from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, an approach represented by scholars like [[David Bloor]] and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]]. Finally, a tradition in [[continental philosophy]] approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.

Philosophies of the particular sciences range from questions about the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|time]] raised by Einstein's [[general relativity]], to the implications of [[Philosophy and economics|economics]] for [[public policy]]. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be [[Reductionism|reduced]] to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual [[Philosophy of psychology|psychology]]? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the [[foundations of statistics]]. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the [[philosophy of medicine]]. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the [[Philosophy of social science|social sciences]] explore whether the scientific studies of [[human nature]] can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and by social relations.

==Introduction==

===Defining science===
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|right|Karl Popper in the 1980s]]
Distinguishing between science and [[non-science]] is referred to as the demarcation problem. For example, should [[psychoanalysis]] be considered science? How about so-called [[creation science]], the [[Multiverse|inflationary multiverse]] hypothesis, or [[macroeconomics]]? [[Karl Popper]] called this the central question in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Thornton2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|title = Karl Popper|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Thornton|first = Stephen|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninteresting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"&gt;{{cite book | last = Laudan | first = Larry | editor = Adolf Grünbaum |editor2=Robert Sonné Cohen |editor3=Larry Laudan | title = Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum | year = 1983 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-90-277-1533-3 | chapter = The Demise of the Demarcation Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Gardner]] has argued for the use of a [[Potter Stewart standard]] ("I know it when I see it") for recognizing pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=SqOPw9Yq-MEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=pseudoscience+potter+stewart#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudoscience%20potter%20stewart&amp;f=false|pages = 12–13|title = The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe|first = Michael D.|last = Gordin|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780226304427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early attempts by the [[logical positivists]] grounded science in observation while non-science was non-observational and hence meaningless.&lt;ref name="Uebel2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/|title = Vienna Circle|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Uebel|first = Thomas|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popper argued that the central property of science is [[falsifiability]]. That is, every genuinely scientific claim is capable of being proven false, at least in principle.&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{cite book | last = Popper | first = Karl | authorlink = Karl Popper | title = The logic of scientific discovery | year = 2004|edition=reprint| publisher = Routledge Classics | location = London &amp; New York | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yq6xeupNStMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+logic+of+scientific+discovery | isbn=978-0-415-27844-7 | postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First published 1959 by Hutchinson &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or [[junk science]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Pseudoscientific&amp;nbsp;– pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–176, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".

In contrast, science is "a set of methods designed to describe and interpret observed and inferred phenomena, past or present, and aimed at building a testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation"(p. 17)'.{{Cite book|author=Shermer M.|year=1997|title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time|location=New York|publisher=W.

Retrieved 2015-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific explanation===
{{Main|Scientific explanation}}

A closely related question is what counts as a good scientific explanation. In addition to providing predictions about future events, society often takes scientific theories to provide [[explanation]]s for events that occur regularly or have already occurred.  Philosophers have investigated the criteria by which a scientific theory can be said to have successfully explained a phenomenon, as well as what it means to say a scientific theory has [[explanatory power]].

One early and influential theory of scientific explanation is the [[deductive-nomological]] model. It says that a successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a [[scientific law]].&lt;ref name="Hempel1948"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Wesley C. Salmon|Wesley Salmon]] developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained.&lt;ref name="Salmon1971"&gt;{{cite book

===Justifying science===
{{Main|Problem of induction}}
[[File:Chicken farmer in Ghana (5926941911).jpg|thumb|The expectations chickens might form about farmer behavior illustrate the "problem of induction."]]
Although it is often taken for granted, it is not at all clear how one can infer the validity of a general statement from a number of specific instances or infer the truth of a theory from a series of successful tests.&lt;ref name="StanInduction"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/|title = The Problem of Induction|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Vickers|first1 = John|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a chicken observes that each morning the farmer comes and gives it food, for hundreds of days in a row. The chicken may therefore use [[inductive reasoning]] to infer that the farmer will bring food ''every'' morning. However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chicken. How is scientific reasoning more trustworthy than the chicken's reasoning?

One approach is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more [[Probability|probable]]. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about the process of interpreting any given evidence into a probability that the general statement is true. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are [[Bayesian probability|subjective]], or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.&lt;ref name=StanInduction/&gt;

Some argue that what scientists do is not inductive reasoning at all but rather [[abductive reasoning]], or inference to the best explanation. In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observed. As discussed in the previous section, it is not always clear what is meant by the "best explanation." [[Ockham's razor]], which counsels choosing the [[Simplicity|simplest]] available explanation, thus plays an important role in some versions of this approach. To return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking care of it indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this [[heuristic]] principle more precise in terms of theoretical [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] or other measures. Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicity. In other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theories.&lt;ref name="StanSimple"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/|title = Simplicity|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Baker|first1 = Alan|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued for some decades that unity rather than simplicity is the key non-empirical factor in influencing choice of theory in science, persistent preference for unified theories in effect committing science to the acceptance of a metaphysical thesis concerning unity in nature.  In order to improve this problematic thesis, it needs to be represented in the form of a hierarchy of theses, each thesis becoming more insubstantial as one goes up the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (1998) [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-comprehensibility-of-the-universe-9780199261550?lang=en&amp;cc=gb The Comprehensibility of the Universe] Clarendon Press; (2017) [http://www.paragonhouse.com/xcart/Understanding-Scientific-Progress-Aim-Oriented-Empiricism.html Understanding Scientific Progress: Aim-Oriented Empiricism], Paragon House, St. Paul&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation inseparable from theory===
[[Image:Einstein cross.jpg|thumb|right|A celestial object known as the [[Einstein Cross]].]]
When making observations, scientists look through telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they can agree on what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories that have been developed to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]], observers would have likely interpreted the image at right as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and [[Gravitational lens|four different images]] of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be [[theory-laden]].&lt;ref name="StanTheoryObs"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/|title = Theory and Observation in Science|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Bogen|first1 = Jim|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All observation involves both [[philosophy of perception|perception]] and [[cognitive process|cognition]]. That is, one does not make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding of the way in which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.&lt;ref name=StanTheoryObs/&gt;

===The purpose of science===
{{See also|Scientific realism|Instrumentalism}}

Should science aim to determine ultimate truth, or are there questions that science [[Empirical limits in science|cannot answer]]?  ''Scientific realists'' claim that science aims at truth and that one ought to regard [[scientific theories]] as true, approximately true, or likely true.  Conversely, ''scientific anti-realists'' argue that science does not aim (or at least does not succeed) at truth, especially truth about [[unobservable]]s like electrons or other universes.&lt;ref name="Levin1984"&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Levin
 | first = Michael

 | title = Scientific Realism
 | year = 1984
 | publisher = University of California Press
 | location = Berkeley
 | isbn = 978-0-520-05155-3
 | pages = 124–1139

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Instrumentalism|Instrumentalists]] argue that scientific theories should only be evaluated on whether they are useful. In their view, whether theories are true or not is beside the point, because the purpose of science is to make predictions and enable effective technology.

Realists often point to the success of recent scientific theories as evidence for the truth (or near truth) of current theories.&lt;ref name="Boyd2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Specific examples include:

===Values and science===
Values intersect with science in different ways. There are epistemic values that mainly guide the scientific research. The scientific enterprise is embedded in particular culture and values through individual practitioners. Values emerge from science, both as product and process and can be distributed among several cultures in the society.

If it is unclear what counts as science, how the process of confirming theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="StanSocial"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/|title = The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge|accessdate = 2014-03-06|last1 = Longino|first1 = Helen|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on [[evolution]], and values concerning [[social class]] influenced debates on [[phrenology]] (considered scientific at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allchin, "Values in Science and in Science Education," in International Handbook of Science Education, B.J.

==History==
{{See also|History of scientific method|History of science|History of philosophy}}

===Pre-modern===
The origins of philosophy of science trace back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", [[Hugh Tredennick]] (trans.), pp. 181–531 in ''Aristotle, Volume&amp;nbsp;1'', [[Loeb Classical Library]], William Heinemann, London, UK, 1938.
&lt;/ref&gt; who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also analyzed reasoning by [[analogy]]. The eleventh century Arab polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in Latin as [[Alhazen]]) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied [[geometry]], especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the [[Catoptrics|reflection]] and [[Dioptrics|refraction]] of light. [[Roger Bacon]] (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized by many to be the father of modern scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48233-0|pages=350–351|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lOCriv4rSCUC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=alhazen+philosophy+of+science#v=onepage&amp;q=alhazen%20philosophy%20of%20science&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.&lt;ref name="First Scientist, Clegg"&gt;Clegg, Brian.

===Modern===
[[File:Francis Bacon statue, Gray's Inn.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon's statue at [[Gray's Inn]], South Square, London]]
[[Francis Bacon]] (no direct relation to Roger, who lived 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in philosophy of science at the time of the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]]. In his work ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620) – an allusion to Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]'' – Bacon outlined a new [[system of logic]] to improve upon the old philosophical process of [[syllogism]]. Bacon's method relied on experimental ''histories'' to eliminate alternative theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Bacon, Francis]] ''[[Novum Organum]] (The New Organon)'', 1620. Bacon's work described many of the accepted principles, underscoring the importance of empirical results, data gathering and experiment.  ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1911), "[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bacon, Francis|Bacon, Francis]]" states: [In Novum Organum, we ] "proceed to apply what is perhaps the most valuable part of the Baconian method, the process of exclusion or rejection. This elimination of the non-essential,&amp;nbsp;..., is the most important of Bacon's contributions to the logic of induction, and that in which, as he repeatedly says, his method differs from all previous philosophies."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, [[René Descartes]] established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', advocating the central role of [[rationalism|reason]] as opposed to sensory experience. By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' argued that "...&amp;nbsp;hypotheses&amp;nbsp;... have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy[,] propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction. "&lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paricenter.com/library/papers/mullin02.php |title= The Impact of Newton's Principia on the Philosophy of Science  |last1= McMullin |first1= Ernan |last2= |first2= |date= |website= www.paricenter.com |publisher= Pari Center for New Learning |access-date=29 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage influenced a "later generation of philosophically-inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy."  &lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"/&gt; In particular, later in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] would famously articulate [[skepticism]] about the ability of science to determine [[causality]] and gave a definitive formulation of the [[problem of induction]].  The 19th century writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method, as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name="mill"&gt;

===Logical positivism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
[[Instrumentalism]] became popular among physicists around the turn of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces [[verificationism]] (a set of [[epistemology|theories of knowledge]] that combines [[logicism]], [[empiricism]], and [[linguistics]] to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the [[empirical sciences]]). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new ''scientific philosophy'',&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv&gt;Michael Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR14 p xiv].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and the [[Vienna Circle]] propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.

Interpreting [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|philosophy of language]], logical positivists identified a verifiability principle or criterion of cognitive meaningfulness.  From [[Bertrand Russell]]'s logicism they sought reduction of mathematics to logic. They also embraced Russell's [[logical atomism]], [[Ernst Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]]—whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience, which is the content of all sciences, whether physics or psychology—and [[Percy Bridgman]]'s [[operationalism]]. Thereby, only the ''verifiable'' was scientific and ''cognitively meaningful'', whereas the unverifiable was unscientific, cognitively meaningless "pseudostatements"—metaphysical, emotive, or such—not worthy of further review by philosophers, who were newly tasked to organize knowledge rather than develop new knowledge.

Logical positivism is commonly portrayed as taking the extreme position that scientific language should never refer to anything unobservable—even the seemingly core notions of causality, mechanism, and principles—but that is an exaggeration.  Talk of such unobservables could be allowed as metaphorical—direct observations viewed in the abstract—or at worst metaphysical or emotional.  ''Theoretical laws'' would be reduced to ''empirical laws'', while ''theoretical terms'' would garner meaning from ''observational terms'' via ''correspondence rules''.   Mathematics in physics would reduce to [[symbolic logic]] via logicism, while [[rational reconstruction]] would convert [[natural language|ordinary language]] into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a [[logical syntax]].  A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a [[logical calculus]] or [[operationalism|empirical operation]] could verify its falsity or truth.

In the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America.  By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[physicalism]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] had sought to replace ''verification'' with simply ''confirmation''.  With [[World War II]]'s close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, ''logical empiricism'', led largely by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], in America, who expounded the [[covering law model]] of scientific explanation as a way of identifying the logical form of explanations without any reference to the suspect notion of "causation".  The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and dominated [[Anglosphere]] philosophy, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, into the 1960s.  Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems,&lt;ref name="Smith1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=L.D. |last=Smith |year=1986 |title=Behaviorism and Logical Positivism: A Reassessment of the Alliance |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1301-6 |lccn=85030366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ6aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 |page=314 |quote=The secondary and historical literature on logical positivism affords substantial grounds for concluding that logical positivism failed to solve many of the central problems it generated for itself. Prominent among the unsolved problems was the failure to find an acceptable statement of the verifiability (later confirmability) criterion of meaningfulness. Until a competing tradition emerged (about the late 1950's), the problems of logical positivism continued to be attacked from within that tradition. But as the new tradition in the philosophy of science began to demonstrate its effectiveness—by dissolving and rephrasing old problems as well as by generating new ones—philosophers began to shift allegiances to the new tradition, even though that tradition has yet to receive a canonical formulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-06606-7 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of [[Ptolemy]], [[David Hume|Hume]], d'Alembert, [[August Compte|Compte]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Ernst Mach]]. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—[[neo-Thomisism]], [[neo-Kantianism]], [[intuitionism]], dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and [[existentialism]]. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=7 January 2014 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C. [Verifiability Criterion]—but for no defensible reason—or admitting that the V.C. requires a background language, etc., which opens the door to relativism, etc. In light of this dilemma, many folk—especially following Popper's "last-ditch" effort to "save" empiricism/positivism/realism with the falsifiability criterion—have agreed that positivism is a dead-end. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107230818/http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its doctrines were increasingly assaulted. Nevertheless, it brought about the establishment of philosophy of science as a distinct subdiscipline of philosophy, with Carl Hempel playing a key role.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Epicycle and deferent.svg|thumb|For [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]], the addition of [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]] in Ptolemaic astronomy was "normal science" within a paradigm, whereas the [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions#The Copernican Revolution|Copernican revolution]] was a paradigm shift.]]

===Thomas Kuhn===
{{Main|The Structure of Scientific Revolutions}}

In the 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', [[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a [[logically consistent]] "portrait" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. A paradigm also encompasses the set of questions and practices that define a scientific discipline. He characterized ''normal science'' as the process of observation and "puzzle solving" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas ''revolutionary science'' occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Kuhn denied that it is ever possible to isolate the hypothesis being tested from the influence of the theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued that it is not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure [[scientific progress]] across paradigms.

For Kuhn, the choice of paradigm was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="KuhnP206"&gt;T. S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 2nd. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1970, p. 206. {{ISBN|0-226-45804-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.

==Current approaches==
===Naturalism's axiomatic assumptions===
All scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processes.&lt;ref name="Priddy 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Priddy|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitehead|1997|p=135}} ,  “All science must start with some assumptions as to the ultimate analysis of the facts with which it deals.”&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]] concurs that all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts. These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boldman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For naturalists, nature is the only reality, the only paradigm.  There is no such thing as 'supernatural'.  The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality.&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is the implicit philosophy of working scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strahler|1992|p=3}} The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;/ref&gt; The following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}

#''that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers''.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} "The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}} "Objective reality is clearly an essential thing if we are to develop a meaningful perspective of the world. Nevertheless its very existence is assumed." "Our belief that objective reality exist is an assumption that it arises from a real world outside of ourselves.  As infants we made this assumption unconsciously.   People are happy to make this assumption that adds meaning to our sensations and feelings, than live with [[solipsism]]."&lt;ref&gt;

In fact we made this assumption unconsciously when we began to learn about the world as infants. The world outside ourselves appears to respond in ways which are consistent with it being real.  The assumption of objectivism is essential if we are to attach the contemporary meanings to our sensations and feelings and make more sense of them.

#''that reality can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.''{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} Stanley Sobottka said, "The assumption of external reality is necessary for science to function and to flourish.

===Coherentism===

[[File:JeremiahHorrocks.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremiah Horrocks]] makes the first observation of the transit of Venus in 1639, as imagined by the artist [[William Richard Lavender|W.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Lavender]] in 1903]]

In contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/justep-coherence/|title = Coherentist Theories of Epistemic Justification|accessdate = 2015-10-26|last = Olsson|first = Erik|year = 2014|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prediction of a [[transit of Venus]] is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the [[optics]] of telescopes, the [[mechanics]] of the telescope mount, and an understanding of [[celestial mechanics]]. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In fact, according to the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]], after [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]], it is impossible to test a theory in isolation.&lt;ref name="Harding1976"&gt;

For example, to test [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's Law of Gravitation]] in the solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets.  Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of [[Uranus]] in the 19th century led not to the rejection of Newton's Law but rather to the rejection of the hypothesis that the solar system comprises only seven planets. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, [[Neptune]]. If a test fails, something is wrong. But there is a problem in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, or something else.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

One consequence of the Duhem–Quine thesis is that one can make any theory compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of a sufficient number of suitable ''ad hoc'' hypotheses. [[Karl Popper]] accepted this thesis, leading him to reject [[Falsifiability#Naïve falsification|naïve falsification]]. Instead, he favored a "survival of the fittest" view in which the most falsifiable scientific theories are to be preferred.&lt;ref name="Popper 2005ch3-4"&gt;{{cite book| last1 =  Popper

===Anything goes methodology===

{{Main|Epistemological anarchism}}

[[File:Paul Feyerabend Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Karl Feyerabend]]]]

[[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists, and that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the progress of science. He argued that "the only principle that does not inhibit progress is: ''anything goes''".&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;Paul Feyerabend, ''Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'' (1975), {{ISBN|0-391-00381-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-222-1}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-481-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-646-4}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-934-X}}, {{ISBN|0-902308-91-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyerabend said that science started as a liberating movement, but that over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid and had some oppressive features. and thus had become increasingly an [[ideology]]. Because of this, he said it was impossible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from [[religion]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], or [[mythology]]. He saw the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society as [[authoritarian]] and ungrounded.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; Promulgation of this epistemological anarchism earned Feyerabend the title of "the worst enemy of science" from his detractors.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;

===Sociology of scientific knowledge methodology===
{{Main|Sociology of scientific knowledge}}
According to Kuhn, science is an inherently communal activity which can only be done as part of a community.&lt;ref name="KuhnPostParadigm"&gt;{{cite book | author = Kuhn, T. S.| chapter = [Postscript] | title = The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 3rd. ed | publisher = [Univ. of Chicago Pr] | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-45808-3 | authorlink = Thomas Samuel Kuhn|page = 176|quote = A paradigm is what the members of a community of scientists share, ''and'', conversely, a scientific community consists of men who share a paradigm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines is the way in which the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a [[Social constructionism|social construct]].

However, some (such as Quine) do maintain that scientific reality is a social construct:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer&amp;nbsp;... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as ''cultural posits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Quine, Willard Van Orman| chapter = Two Dogmas of Empiricism | title = From a Logical Point of View | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1980 | isbn = 978-0-674-32351-3 | url = http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The public backlash of scientists against such views, particularly in the 1990s, became known as the [[science wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last= Ashman|editor1-first= Keith M.|editor2-last= Barringer|editor2-first= Philip S.|title= After the Science Wars|date= 2001|publisher= Routledge|location= London, UK|isbn= 978-0-415-21209-0|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XImEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=After+the+science+wars#v=onepage&amp;q=After%20the%20science%20wars&amp;f=false|accessdate= 29 October 2015|quote= The 'war' is between scientists who believe that science and its methods are objective, and an increasing number of social scientists, historians, philosophers, and others gathered under the umbrella of Science Studies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major development in recent decades has been the study of the formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including [[David Bloor]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Bruno Latour]], and [[Anselm Strauss]]. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from [[Economics of scientific knowledge|economics have also been applied]]{{by whom|date=October 2017}} for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field has come to be known as [[science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Here the approach to the philosophy of science is to study how scientific communities actually operate.

===Continental philosophy===
Philosophers in the [[continental philosophy|continental philosophical tradition]] are not traditionally categorized as philosophers of science. However, they have much to say about science, some of which has anticipated themes in the analytical tradition. For example, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] advanced the thesis in his "The Genealogy of Morals" that the motive for search of truth in sciences is a kind of ascetic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hatab|first1=Lawrence J.|title=How Does the Ascetic Ideal Function in Nietzsche's ''Genealogy''?|journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies|date=2008|issue=35/36|page=107|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v035/35.hatab.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|left|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In general, science in continental philosophy is viewed from a world-historical perspective.  One of the first philosophers who supported this view was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Philosophers such as [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Gaston Bachelard]] also wrote their works with this world-historical approach to science, predating Kuhn by a generation or more. All of these approaches involve a historical and sociological turn to science, with a priority on lived experience (a kind of Husserlian "life-world"), rather than a progress-based or anti-historical approach as done in the analytic tradition. This emphasis can be traced through [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the late works of [[Merleau-Ponty]] (''Nature: Course Notes from the Collège de France'', 1956–1960), and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name="Gutting"&gt;Gutting, Gary (2004), ''Continental Philosophy of Science'', Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest effect on the continental tradition with respect to science was Martin Heidegger's critique of the [[present-at-hand|theoretical attitude]] in general which of course includes the scientific attitude.&lt;ref name="Wheeler2015"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/|title = Martin Heidegger|accessdate = 2015-10-29|last = Wheeler|first = Michael|year = 2015|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason the continental tradition has remained much more skeptical of the importance of science in human life and philosophical inquiry. Nonetheless, there have been a number of important works: especially a Kuhnian precursor, [[Alexandre Koyré]].  Another important development was that of Michel [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s analysis of the historical and scientific thought in ''[[The Order of Things]]'' and his study of power and corruption within the "science" of [[Insanity|madness]]. Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to the continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include [[Jürgen Habermas]] (e.g., "Truth and Justification", 1998), [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] ("The Unity of Nature", 1980), and [[Wolfgang Stegmüller]] ("Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschafttheorie und Analytischen Philosophie", 1973–1986).

==Other topics==
===Reductionism===

[[Analysis]] is the activity of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts in order to understand it. [[Reductionism]] can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref name="StanUnity"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-unity/|title = The Unity of Science|accessdate = 2014-03-01|last1 = Cat|first1 = Jordi|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls ''[[greedy reductionism]],'' which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=George|title=Darwin Loves You: Natural Selection and the Re-enchantment of the World|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13639-4|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/?id=koy-zqecyewC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=dennett+%22greedy+reductionism%22+%22bad+science%22#v=onepage&amp;q=dennett%20%22greedy%20reductionism%22%20%22bad%20science%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social accountability===
{{See also|The Mismeasure of Man}}
A broad issue affecting the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, what part of the world and man is studied by science. [[Philip Kitcher]] in his "Science, Truth, and Democracy"&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, P. Science, Truth, and Democracy, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; argues that scientific studies that attempt to show one segment of the population as being less intelligent, successful or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science. Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.

==Philosophy of particular sciences==
{{quote|''There is no such thing as philosophy-free science; there is only science whose philosophical baggage is taken on board without examination.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel|title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life|date=1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-2629-5|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y77BAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22there+is+only+science+whose+philosophical+baggage+is+taken+on+board%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22there%20is%20only%20science%20whose%20philosophical%20baggage%20is%20taken%20on%20board%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Daniel Dennett|''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', 1995}}
In addition to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences. They also examine the implications of particular sciences for broader philosophical questions. The late 20th and early 21st century has seen a rise in the number of practitioners of philosophy of a particular science.&lt;ref name="StanPhilNeuro"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/neuroscience/ |title = The Philosophy of Neuroscience |last1 = Bickle|first1 = John|last2 = Mandik|first2 = Peter|last3 = Landreth|first3 = Anthony|year = 2010 |website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|postscript= (Summer 2010 Edition) |editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first= Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of statistics===
{{Main|Philosophy of statistics}}
The problem of induction discussed above is seen in another form in debates over the [[foundations of statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Instead, the typical test yields a [[p-value]], which is the probability of the ''evidence'' being such as it is, under the assumption that the hypothesis being tested is true. If the ''p''-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, [[Bayesian inference]] seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include [[probability interpretations]], [[overfitting]], and the difference between [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation and causation]].

Is asking whether "1+1=2" is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was [[calculus]] invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires [[A priori and a posteriori|experience or reason alone]]. What does it mean to prove a mathematical [[theorem]] and how does one know whether a [[mathematical proof]] is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and [[logic]], human capabilities such as [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]], and the [[material universe]].

===Philosophy of physics===
{{Main|Philosophy of physics}}
{{unsolved|physics|How does the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] description of reality, which includes elements such as the "[[superposition principle|superposition]] of states" and "[[wavefunction collapse]]", give rise to the reality we perceive?}}
Philosophy of physics is the study of the fundamental, [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions underlying modern [[physics]], the study of [[matter]] and [[energy]] and how they [[interaction|interact]]. The main questions concern the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]], [[atom]]s and [[atomism]]. Also included are the predictions of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]], [[causality (physics)|causality]], [[determinism]], and the nature of [[physical law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Philosophy of chemistry===
{{Main|Philosophy of chemistry}}
Philosophy of chemistry is the philosophical study of the [[methodology]] and content of the science of [[chemistry]]. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by [[quantum mechanics]] or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of [[Philosophy of science#Confirmation of theories|how theories are confirmed]] in the context of confirming [[reaction mechanism]]s. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of.&lt;ref name="WeisbergEtal2011"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chemistry/|title = Philosophy of Chemistry|accessdate = 2014-02-14|last1 = Weisberg|first1 = Michael|last2 = Needham|first2 = Paul|last3 = Hendry|first3 = Robin|year = 2011|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as [[chemical bonds]].

===Philosophy of Earth sciences===
The philosophy of Earth science is concerned with how humans obtain and verify knowledge of the workings of the Earth system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere (solid earth). Earth scientists’ ways of knowing and habits of mind share important commonalities with other sciences but also have distinctive attributes that emerge from the complex, heterogeneous, unique, long-lived, and non-manipulatable nature of the Earth system.

===Philosophy of biology===
{{Main|Philosophy of biology}}
Philosophy of biology deals with [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[ethics|ethical]] issues in the [[Biology|biological]] and [[Medical research|biomedical]] sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., [[Aristotle]], [[Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hull D. (1969), What philosophy of biology is not, Journal of the History of Biology, 2, p.&amp;nbsp;241–268.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of science began to pay increasing attention to developments in biology, from the rise of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) in 1953 to more recent advances in [[genetic engineering]].  Other key ideas such as the [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] of all life processes to [[biochemical]] reactions as well as the incorporation of [[psychology]] into a broader [[neuroscience]] are also addressed. Research in current philosophy of biology includes investigation of the foundations of evolutionary theory (such as [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]]'s work),&lt;ref&gt;Recent examples include Okasha S. (2006), ''Evolution and the Levels of Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, and Godfrey-Smith P. (2009), ''Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the role of viruses as persistent symbionts in host genomes. As a consequence the evolution of genetic content order is seen as the result of competent genome editors in contrast to former narratives in which error replication events (mutations) dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Witzany G.

===Philosophy of medicine===
{{Main|Philosophy of medicine}}

Beyond [[medical ethics]] and [[bioethics]], the philosophy of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]/[[metaphysics]] of medicine. Within the epistemology of medicine, [[evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) (or evidence-based practice (EBP)) has attracted attention, most notably the roles of randomisation,&lt;ref name="Papineau 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papineau | first1 = D | year = 1994 | title = The Virtues of Randomization | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 437–450 | doi=10.1093/bjps/45.2.437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worrall 2002"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3081103 Jstor], Worrall, J., 2002.

Philosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated, but also in the nature of such phenomena.

===Philosophy of psychology===
{{Main|Philosophy of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.]]
Philosophy of psychology refers to issues at the theoretical foundations of modern [[psychology]]. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of [[behaviorism|behavior]] to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on [[mentalism (psychology)|mental perception and thought processes]]?&lt;ref name="Routpsych"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Mason|first1 = Kelby|first2 = Chandra Sekhar|last2 = Sripada|first3 = Stephen|last3 = Stich|title = Routledge Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophy|chapter = Philosophy of Psychology|chapterurl = http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/Publications/Papers/PHILOSOPHYofPSYCHOLOGY.pdf|editor-last = Moral|editor-first = Dermot|publisher = Routledge|location = London|year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases in which there is no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a [[Likert scale]], they may be experiencing very different things.

Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of [[cognitive science]], or [[philosophy of mind]]. For example, are humans [[rationality|rational]] creatures?&lt;ref name="Routpsych" /&gt; Is there any sense in which they have [[free will]], and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[artificial intelligence]], questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.

Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, [[neurophilosophy]] has just recently become its own field with the works of [[Paul Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].&lt;ref name=StanPhilNeuro/&gt; Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[monism]]. Another related field is [[philosophy of language]].

A notable recent development in Philosophy of Psychology is [[Functional contextualism|Functional Contextualism]] or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism is a modern philosophy of science rooted in philosophical [[pragmatism]] and [[contextualism]]. It is most actively developed in [[behavioral science]] in general, the field of [[behavior analysis]], and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as [[relational frame theory]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and its most prominent application, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT).&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[radical behaviorism]] first delineated by [[Steven C. Hayes]] which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.

===Philosophy of psychiatry===
{{main|Philosophy of psychiatry}}
Philosophy of psychiatry explores philosophical questions relating to [[psychiatry]] and [[mental illness]]. The philosopher of science and medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Dominic (Spring 2015). "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/psychiatry/ Philosophy of Psychiatry]". ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', edited by Edward N. Zalta. Accessed 18 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amartya Sen NIH.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Amartya Sen]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] for "combining tools from economics and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Prize in Econimic Sciences 1998 |website=NobelPrize.org |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/press.html |date=1998-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Philosophy of economics===
{{Main|Philosophy and economics}}
Philosophy of economics is the branch of philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to [[economics]]. It can also be defined as the branch of economics which studies its own foundations and morality. It can be categorized into three central topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economics/ |title=Philosophy of Economics|last1=Hausman |first1=Daniel |last2= |first2= |date= December 18, 2012 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first concerns the definition and scope of economics and by what methods it should be studied and whether these methods rise to the level of epistemic reliability associated with the other special sciences. For example, is it possible to research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic is the meaning and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of your income) at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of your income) be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society?

===Philosophy of social science===
{{Main|Philosophy of social science}}
The philosophy of social science is the study of the logic and method of the [[social sciences]], such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Hollis |author-link=Martin Hollis (philosopher)|year=1994 |title=The Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |publisher=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-44780-5 |url= | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the [[natural science]]s, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the [[ontology|ontological]] significance of [[structure and agency]].

The French philosopher, [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), established the epistemological perspective of [[positivism]] in ''The Course in Positivist Philosophy'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]: "''[[sociology|sociologie]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte]&lt;/ref&gt; For Comte, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. Comte offers an evolutionary system proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general '[[law of three stages]]'. These are (1) the ''theological'', (2) the ''metaphysical'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte's positivism established the initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and [[social research]]. [[Durkheim]], [[Marx]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]] are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In [[psychology]], a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in [[behaviourism]]. Positivism has also been espoused by '[[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]]' who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;

The positivist perspective has been associated with '[[scientism]]'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be applied to all areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since lost popular support. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences instead take into account the distorting effect of observer [[bias]] and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as [[Thomas Kuhn]], and new philosophical movements such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] and [[neopragmatism]].  The philosopher-sociologist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

{{War}}
The '''philosophy of war''' is the area of [[philosophy]] devoted to examining issues such as the causes of war, the relationship between war and human nature, and the [[ethics]] of war. Certain aspects of the philosophy of war overlap with the [[philosophy of history]], [[political philosophy]], [[international relations]] and the [[philosophy of law]].

==Works about the philosophy of war==
[[File:Carl von Clausewitz.PNG|thumb|Carl von Clausewitz, painting by [[Karl Wilhelm Wach]].]]Perhaps the greatest and most influential work in the [[philosophy]] of war is ''[[On War]]'' by [[Carl von Clausewitz]]. It combines observations on strategy with questions about [[human nature]] and the purpose of war. Clausewitz especially examines the [[teleology]] of war: whether war is a means to an end outside itself or whether it can be an end in itself. He concludes that the latter cannot be so, and that war is "[[politics]] by different means"; i.e. that war must not exist only for its own sake. It must serve some purpose for the state.

[[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[War and Peace]]'' contains frequent philosophical digressions on the philosophy of war (and broader [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculations derived from [[Christianity]] and from Tolstoy's observations of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]). It was influential on later thought about war. Tolstoy's [[Christian]]-centered philosophy of war (especially his essays "[[A Letter to a Hindu]]" and "[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]") was a direct influence on [[Gandhi]]'s [[Hinduism]]-centered [[non-violent resistance]] philosophy.

While [[Sun Tzu|Sun Tzu's]] ''[[The Art of War]]'', focusses mostly on weaponry and strategy instead of philosophy, his observations are often broadened into a philosophy applied in situations extending well beyond war itself (see the main Wikipedia article on ''The Art of War'' for a discussion of the application of Sun Tzu's philosophy to areas other than war). Parts of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Niccolò Machiavelli's]] masterpiece ''[[The Prince]]'' (as well as ''[[Discourses on Livy|Discourses]]'') and parts of his own work titled ''The Art of War'' discuss some philosophical points relating to war, though neither book could be said to be a work in the philosophy of war.

==Just war theory==
[[Just war theory]] is a sect of war philosophy thought to have been founded by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]].  The philosophy of just war theorizes what aspects of war are justifiable according to morally acceptable principles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Augustine/augustine_justwar.html|title=Great Philosophers: Augustine on War|website=oregonstate.edu|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just war theory is based upon four core criteria to be followed by those determined to go to war. The four principles are as follows: just authority; just cause; right intention; last resort.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Just authority===
The criterion of just authority refers to the determined legality of going to war, has the concept of war and the pursuit of it been legally processed and justified?&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.equip.org/article/just-war-tradition/|title=Just War Tradition - Christian Research Institute|work=Christian Research Institute|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Just cause===
Just cause is a justifiable reason that war is the appropriate and necessary response. If war can be avoided, that must be determined first, according to the philosophy of just war theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Right intention===
To go to war, one must determine if the intentions of doing so are right according to morality. Right intention criterion requires the determination of whether or not a war response is a measurable way to the conflict being acted upon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Last resort===
War is a last resort response, meaning that if there is a conflict between disagreeing parties, all solutions must be attempted before resorting to war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Traditions of thought==
Since the philosophy of war is often treated as a subset of another branch of philosophy (for example, political philosophy or the philosophy of law) it would be difficult to define any clear-cut schools of thought in the same sense that, e.g., [[Existentialism]] or [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] can be described as distinct movements. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy refers to Carl von Clausewitz is "the only (so-called) philosopher of war", implying that he is the only (major) philosophical writer who develops a philosophical system focusing ''exclusively'' on war. However, discernible traditions of thought on war have developed over time, so that some writers have been able to distinguish broad categories (if somewhat loosely).

===Teleological categories===
[[Anatol Rapoport]]'s introduction to his edition of the [[J. J. Graham]] [[translation]] of Clausewitz's ''On War'' identifies three main teleological traditions in the philosophy of war: the cataclysmic, the [[eschatology|eschatological]], and the political. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 13). These are not the only possible teleological philosophies of war, but only three of the most common. As Rapoport says,

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;To put it [[metaphor]]ically, in political philosophy war is compared to a game of strategy (like [[chess]]); in eschatological philosophy, to a mission or the dénouement of a [[drama]]; in cataclysmic philosophy, to a [[fire]] or an [[epidemic]].

These do not, of course, exhaust the views of war prevailing at different times and at different places. For example, war has at times been viewed as a pastime or an [[adventure]], as the only proper occupation for a [[nobleman]], as an affair of [[honor]] (for example, the days of [[chivalry]]), as a [[ceremony]] (e.g. among the [[Aztecs]]), as an outlet of aggressive [[instinct]]s or a manifestation of a "[[Suicide|death wish]]", as [[nature]]'s way of ensuring the [[survival of the fittest]], as an [[absurdity]] (e.g. among [[Eskimos]]), as a tenacious custom, destined to die out like [[slavery]], and as a [[crime]]. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 17)&lt;/poem&gt;}}

*The '''Cataclysmic''' school of thought, which was espoused by [[Leo Tolstoy]] in his epic novel ''[[War and Peace]]'', sees war as a bane on humanity – whether avoidable or inevitable – which serves little purpose outside of causing destruction and suffering, and which may cause drastic change to [[society]], but not in any teleological sense. Tolstoy's view may be placed under the subcategory of global cataclysmic philosophy of war.  Another subcategory of the cataclysmic school of thought is the [[ethnocentric]] cataclysmic, in which this view is focused specifically on the plight of a specific [[ethnicity]] or [[nation]], for example the view in [[Judaism]] of war as a [[punishment]] from [[God]] on the [[Israelites]] in certain books of the [[Tanakh|Tenakh]] ([[Old Testament]]). As the Tenakh (in certain books) sees war as an ineluctable act of God, so Tolstoy especially emphasizes war as something that befalls man and is in no way under the influence of man's "[[free will]]", but is instead the result of irresistible global forces. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction 16)
*The '''Eschatological''' school of thought sees all wars (or all major wars) as leading to some goal, and asserts that some final conflict will someday resolve the path followed by all wars and result in a massive upheaval of society and a subsequent new society free from war (in varying theories the resulting society may be either a [[utopia]] or a [[dystopia]]). There are two subsets of this view: the Messianic and the Global theory. The [[Marxist]] concept of a [[communist]] world ruled by the [[proletariat]] after a final worldwide [[revolution]] is an example of the global theory, and the [[Christian]] concept of an [[Armageddon]] war which will usher in the [[second coming]] of [[Christ]] and the final defeat of [[Satan]] is an example of a theory that could fall under Global or Messianic. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 15) The [[messiah|messianic]] eschatological philosophy is derived from the Jewish-Christian concept of a [[Messiah]], and sees wars as culminating in unification of humanity under a single [[faith]] or a single ruler. [[Crusades]], [[Jihad]]s, the [[Nazi]] concept of a [[Master Race]] and the 19th century American concept of [[Manifest Destiny]] may also fall under this heading. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 15) (See main articles for more information: [[Christian eschatology]], [[Jewish eschatology]])
*The '''Political''' school of thought, of which Clausewitz was a proponent, sees war as a tool of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. On page 13 Rapoport says,

{{quote|Clausewitz views war as a rational instrument of national [[policy]]. The three words "[[Rationality|rational]]", "[[Tool|instrument]]" and "national" are the key concepts of his paradigm. In this view, the decision to wage war "ought" to be rational, in the sense that it ought to be based on estimated costs and gains of war. Next, war "ought" to be instrumental, in the sense that it ought to be waged in order to achieve some goal, never for its own sake; and also in the sense that strategy and tactics ought to be directed towards just one end, namely towards victory. Finally, war "ought" to be national, in the sense that its objective should be to advance the interests of a national state and that the entire effort of the nation ought to be mobilized in the service of the military objective.}}

:He later characterizes the philosophy behind the [[Vietnam War]] and other [[Cold War]] conflicts as "Neo-Clausewitzian". Rapoport also includes Machiavelli as an early example of the political philosophy of war (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 13). Decades after his essay, the [[War on Terrorism]] and the [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraq War]] begun by the [[United States]] under President [[George W. Bush]] in 2001 and 2003 have often been justified under the [[doctrine of preemption]], a political motivation stating that the United States must use war to prevent further attacks such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

===Ethical categories===
Another possible system for categorizing different schools of thought on war can be found in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (see external links, below), based on [[ethics]]. The SEP describes three major divisions in the ethics of war: the realist, the pacifist, and the just war Theory. In a nutshell:

* '''Realists''' will typically hold that systems of [[morals]] and ethics which guide ''individuals'' within societies cannot realistically be applied to societies as a whole to govern the way they, as societies, interact with other societies. Hence, a state's purposes in war is simply to preserve its national interest. This kind of thinking is similar to Machiavelli's philosophy, and [[Thucydides]] and [[Hobbes]] may also fall under this category.
* '''[[Pacifism]]''' however, maintains that a moral evaluation of war is possible, and that war is always found to be immoral. Generally, there are two kinds of modern secular pacifism to consider: (1) a more consequentialist form of pacifism (or CP), which maintains that the benefits accruing from war can never outweigh the costs of fighting it; and (2) a more deontological form of pacifism (or DP), which contends that the very activity of war is intrinsically wrong, since it violates foremost duties of justice, such as not killing human beings. [[Eugene Victor Debs]] and others were famous advocates of pacifistic [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] methods instead of war.
* '''[[Nonviolence]]''' also holds that a moral evaluation of war is a duty, and that war is always found to be immoral. [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] were all famous advocates of [[power of truth]], [[law]]fulness, [[soft power]], [[nonviolent resistance]] and [[civil disobedience]] methods instead of war and to prevent war. Gandhi said he disliked more cowardice than violence.
* '''[[Just war theory]]''', along with pacifism, holds that morals do apply to war. However, unlike pacifism, according to just war theory it ''is'' possible for a war to be morally justified. The concept of a morally justified war underlies much of the concept [[International Law]], such as the [[Geneva Conventions]]. [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Aquinas]], and [[Hugo Grotius]] are among the philosophers who have espoused some form of a just war philosophy. One common just war theory evaluation of war is that war is only justified if 1.) waged in a state or nation's self-defense, or 2.) waged in order to end gross violations of [[human rights]]. Political philosopher [[John Rawls]] advocated these criteria as justification for war.

[[Image:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Karl Popper]]]]
In [[philosophy]] and [[models of scientific inquiry]], '''postpositivism''' (also called '''''postempiricism''''') is a [[metatheoretical]] stance that critiques and amends [[positivism]]&lt;ref name="Bergman2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergman|first1=Mats|article=Positivism|title=The International Encyclopedia of Communication Theory and Philosophy|date=2016|isbn=9781118766804|page=1–5|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118766804.wbiect248/full|ref=IntEncycCTP}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While positivists emphasize independence between the researcher and the researched person (or object), postpositivists accept that theories, background, knowledge and values of the researcher can influence what is observed.&lt;ref name="Robson2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robson|first=Colin|title=Real World Research. A Resource for Social Scientists and Practitioner-Researchers (Second Edition)|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden|isbn=0-631-21305-8|pages=624}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postpositivists pursue objectivity by recognizing the possible effects of biases.&lt;ref name="Robson2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Katherine|title=Communication theories : perspectives, processes, and contexts|date=2007|publisher=Peking University Press|location=Beijing|isbn=9787301124314|page=35-45|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TaylorLindlof2011" /&gt; While positivists emphasize quantitative methods, postpositivists consider both quantitative and qualitative methods to be valid approaches&lt;ref name="TaylorLindlof2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Thomas R.|last2=Lindlof|first2=Bryan C.|title=Qualitative communication research methods|date=2011|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1412974738|page=5-13|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Postpositivists believe that human knowledge is based not on a priori assessments from an objective individual&lt;ref name="TaylorLindlof2011"/&gt;, but rather upon human ''[[conjectural|conjectures]]''. As human knowledge is thus unavoidably conjectural, the assertion of these conjectures are ''warranted'', or more specifically, justified by a set of ''[[Theory of justification|warrant]]s'', which can be modified or withdrawn in the light of further investigation.  However, postpositivism is not a form of [[relativism]], and generally retains the idea of [[objective truth]].

===Ontology===
Postpositivists believe that a reality exists, but, unlike positivists, they believe reality can be known only imperfectly&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; and probabilistically.&lt;ref name="Robson2002" /&gt; Postpositivists also draw from [[social constructionism]] in forming their understanding and definition of reality.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

===Axiology===
While positivists believe that research is or can be value-free or value-neutral, postpositivists take the position that bias is undesired but inevitable, and therefore the investigator must work to detect and try to correct it. Postpositivists work to understand how their [[axiology]] (i.e. values and beliefs) may have influenced their research, including through their choice of measures, populations, questions, and definitions, as well as through their interpretation and analysis of their work.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

==History==
Historians identify two types of positivism: classical positivism, an empirical tradition first described by [[Claude_Henri_de_Rouvroy,_comte_de_Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] and [[Auguste Comte]]&lt;ref name="Bergman2016" /&gt;, and [[logical positivism]], which is most strongly associated with the [[Vienna Circle]], which met near Vienna, Austria, in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; Postpositivism is the name D.C. Phillips&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; gave to a group of critiques and amendments which apply to both forms of positivism.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

One of the first thinkers to criticize [[logical positivism]] was [[Karl Popper|Sir Karl Popper]]. He advanced [[Falsifiability|falsification]] in lieu of the logical positivist idea of [[verificationism]].&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;. Falsificationism argues that it is impossible to verify that beliefs about universals or unobservables are true, though it is possible to reject false beliefs if they are phrased in a way amenable to falsification. [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s idea of [[paradigm shift]]s offers a broader critique of logical positivism, arguing that it is not simply individual theories but whole [[worldview]]s that must occasionally shift in response to evidence.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; 

Postpositivism is not a rejection of the [[scientific method]], but rather a reformation of positivism to meet these critiques.  It reintroduces the basic assumptions of positivism: the possibility and desirability of [[objective truth]], and the use of [[experiment]]al [[methodology]]. The work of philosophers [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] and [[Ian Hacking]] are representative of these ideas.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Postpositivism of this type is described in [[social science]] guides to research methods.&lt;ref name="soc_rsch_Trochim"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trochim|first1=William|title=Social Research Methods Knowledge Base|url=https://socialresearchmethods.net/kb|website=socialresearchmethods.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Structure and Nature of a Postpositivist Theory==

Robert Dubin describes the basic components of a postpositivist theory as being composed of basic "units" or ideas and topics of interest, "laws of interactions" among the units, and a description of the "boundaries" for the theory.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; A postpositivist theory also includes "empirical indicators" to connect the theory to observable phenomena, and hypotheses that are testable using the scientific method.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

According to Thomas Kuhn, a postpositivist theory can be assessed on the basis of whether it is "[[Accuracy and precision|accurate]]", "[[Consistency|consistent]]", "has broad scope", "[[Occam's razor|parsimonious]]", and "fruitful".&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

{{expert needed|date=June 2015}}

In [[theoretical physics]], the '''problem of time''' is a conceptual conflict between [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] in that quantum mechanics regards the flow of time as universal and absolute, whereas general relativity regards the flow of time as malleable and relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Quantum Gravity’s Time Problem | author=Wolchover, Natalie | date=December 1, 2016 | magazine=Quanta Magazine | url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-gravitys-time-problem-20161201/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem raises the question of what [[time]] really is in a physical sense and whether it is truly a real, distinct phenomenon. It also involves the related question of why time seems to flow in a single direction, despite the fact that no known physical laws seem to require a single direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Newsflash: Time May Not Exist | author=Folger, Tim | date=June 12, 2007 | magazine=Discover | url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jun/in-no-time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Time in quantum mechanics ==
In [[classical mechanics]], a special status is assigned to time in the sense that it is treated as a classical background parameter, external to the system itself. This special role is seen in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics. It is regarded as part of an a priori given classical background with a well defined value. In fact, the classical treatment of time is deeply intertwined with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, and, thus, with the conceptual foundations of quantum theory: all measurements of observables are made at certain instants of time and probabilities are only assigned to such measurements.

[[Special relativity]] has modified the notion of time. But from a fixed [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz]] observer's viewpoint time remains a distinguished, absolute, external, global parameter. The Newtonian notion of [[Time#Relativistic time versus Newtonian time|time]] essentially carries over to special relativistic systems, hidden in the [[spacetime]] structure.

== Overturning of absolute time in general relativity ==
Though classically [[spacetime]] appears to be an absolute background, [[general theory of relativity|general relativity]] reveals that spacetime is actually dynamical; gravity is a manifestation of spacetime geometry.  Matter reacts with spacetime: {{Quote|text=Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.|author=[[John Archibald Wheeler]]|source=Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam, p. 235&lt;ref name="Wheeler2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Archibald Wheeler|title=Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam: A Life in Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGFkK2tTXPsC|date=18 June 2010|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-07948-7|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also, spacetime can interact with itself (e.g. gravitational waves). The dynamical nature of spacetime has a vast array of consequences.

{{confusing section|reason=vocabulary needs to be explained: diffeomorphism, Hamiltonian, [[Dirac observables]], perennials, partial observables.  Need to illustrate with example|date=September 2014}}
The dynamical nature of spacetime, via the [[hole argument]], implies that the theory is [[diffeomorphism]] invariant. The constraints are the imprint in the canonical theory of the diffeomorphism invariance of the four-dimensional theory. They also contain the dynamics of the theory, since the Hamiltonian identically vanishes. The quantum theory has no explicit dynamics; wavefunctions are annihilated by the constraints and Dirac observables commute with the constraints and hence are constants of motion. Kuchar introduces the idea of "perennials" and Rovelli the idea of "partial observables". The expectation is that in physical situations some of the variables of the theory will play the role of a "time" with respect to which other variables would evolve and define dynamics in a relational way. This runs into difficulties and is a version of the "problem of time" in the canonical quantization.&lt;ref&gt;K. Kuchar, in "Proceedings of the 4th Canadian meeting on Relativity and Relativistic Astrophysics", editors G. Kunstatter, D. Vincent, J. Williams, World Scientific, Singapore (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed solutions to the problem of time ==
{{main|Multiple histories}}

The quantum concept of time was invented by physicist [[Bryce DeWitt]] in 1960's:&lt;ref name="Deutsch2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Deutsch|title=The Fabric of Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7uFxViR19oC&amp;pg=PT240|date=14 April 2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-196961-9|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"Different times are special cases of different universes"''

In other words, time is an [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] phenomenon, which places all equal clock readings (of correctly prepared clocks - or of any objects usable as clocks) into the same history. This was first understood by physicist [[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]] and [[William Wootters]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = David|last =  Deutsch|title= The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform The World| page= 299|date = 2011|publisher = Penguin UK|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ex5xge75SR4C|isbn = 9780141969695}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a proposal to address the problem of time in systems like general relativity called conditional probabilities interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Page|first1 = Don N.|last2 =  Wootters|first2 =  William K.|date = 15 June 1983|journal =  Phys. Rev. D|volume = 27|page =  2885|title = Evolution without evolution: Dynamics described by stationary observables|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.27.2885|bibcode =1983PhRvD..27.2885P}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists in promoting all variables to quantum operators, one of them as a clock, and asking conditional probability questions with respect to other variables. They made a solution based on the quantum phenomenon of entanglement. Page and Wootters showed how [[quantum entanglement]] can be used to measure time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aron|first1=Jacob|title=Entangled toy universe shows time may be an illusion|url=https://www.newscientist.com//article/dn24473-entangled-toy-universe-shows-time-may-be-an-illusion|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018065554/http://www.newscientist.com//article/dn24473-entangled-toy-universe-shows-time-may-be-an-illusion|archivedate=2016-10-18|date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, at the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM) in Turin, Italy, Ekaterina Moreva, together with Giorgio Brida, Marco Gramegna, Vittorio Giovannetti, Lorenzo Maccone, and Marco Genovese performed the first experimental test of Page and Wootters' ideas. They confirmed that time is an emergent phenomenon for internal observers but absent for external observers of the universe just as the [[Wheeler-DeWitt equation]] predicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantum Experiment Shows How Time ‘Emerges’ from Entanglement|url=https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/quantum-experiment-shows-how-time-emerges-from-entanglement-d5d3dc850933|website=The Physics arXiv Blog|date=Oct 23, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603063357/https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/quantum-experiment-shows-how-time-emerges-from-entanglement-d5d3dc850933|archivedate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreva|first1=Ekaterina|last2=Brida|first2=Giorgio|last3=Gramegna|first3=Marco|last4=Giovannetti|first4=Vittorio|last5=Maccone|first5=Lorenzo|last6=Genovese|first6=Marco|title=Time from quantum entanglement: An experimental illustration|journal=Physical Review A|date=20 May 2014|volume=89|issue=5|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.89.052122|arxiv=1310.4691|bibcode=2014PhRvA..89e2122M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreva|first1=Ekaterina|last2=Gramegna|first2=Marco|last3=Brida|first3=Giorgio|last4=Maccone|first4=Lorenzo|last5=Genovese|first5=Marco|title=Quantum time: Experimental multitime correlations|journal=Physical Review D|date=16 November 2017|volume=96 |issue=5|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.96.102005|arxiv=1710.00707|bibcode=2017PhRvD..96j2005M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent discretizations approach developed by [[Jorge Pullin]] and [[Rodolfo Gambini]] have no constraints. These are lattice approximation techniques for quantum gravity. In the canonical approach if one discretizes the constraints and equations of motion, the resulting discrete equations are inconsistent: they cannot be solved simultaneously. To address this problem one uses a technique based on discretizing the action of the theory and working with the discrete equations of motion. These are automatically guaranteed to be consistent. Most of the hard conceptual questions of quantum gravity are related to the presence of constraints in the theory. Consistent discretized theories are free of these conceptual problems and can be straightforwardly quantized, providing a solution to the problem of time. It is a bit more subtle than this. Although without constraints and having "general evolution", the latter is only in terms of a discrete parameter that isn't physically accessible. The way out is addressed in a way similar to the Page–Wooters approach. The idea is to pick one of the physical variables to be a clock and asks relational questions. These ideas where the clock is also quantum mechanical have actually led to a new interpretation of quantum mechanics — the [[Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics#Other|Montevideo interpretation]] of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gambini|first1=Rodolfo|last2=Pullin|first2=Jorge|title=The Montevideo interpretation of quantum mechanics: frequently asked questions|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|date=1 June 2009|volume=174|pages=012003|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/174/1/012003|arxiv=0905.4402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gambini|first1=Rodolfo|last2=Garc?a-Pintos|first2=Luis Pedro|last3=Pullin|first3=Jorge|title=An axiomatic formulation of the Montevideo interpretation of quantum mechanics|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|date=November 2011|volume=42|issue=4|pages=256–263|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2011.10.002|arxiv=1002.4209|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9927/|bibcode=2011SHPMP..42..256G}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new interpretation solves the problems of the use of environmental decoherence as a solution to the [[problem of measurement]] in quantum mechanics by invoking fundamental limitations, due to the quantum mechanical nature of clocks, in the process of measurement in quantum mechanics. These limitations are very natural in the context of generally covariant theories as quantum gravity where the clock must be taken as one of the degrees of freedom of the system itself. They have also put forward this fundamental decoherence as a way to resolve the [[black hole information paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gambini|first1=Rodolfo|last2=Porto|first2=Rafael A.|last3=Pullin|first3=Jorge|title=No Black Hole Information Puzzle In A Relational Universe|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D|date=December 2004|volume=13|issue=10|pages=2315–2320|doi=10.1142/S0218271804006383|arxiv=hep-th/0405183|bibcode=2004IJMPD..13.2315G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gambini|first1=Rodolfo|last2=Porto|first2=Rafael A.|last3=Pullin|first3=Jorge|title=Realistic Clocks, Universal Decoherence, and the Black Hole Information Paradox|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=6 December 2004|volume=93|issue=24|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.240401|arxiv=hep-th/0406260|bibcode=2004PhRvL..93x0401G}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain circumstances, a matter field is used to de-parametrize the theory and introduce a physical Hamiltonian. This generates physical time evolution, not a constraint.

Reduced phase space quantization constraints are solved first then quantized. This approach was considered for some time to be impossible as it seems to require first finding the general solution to Einstein's equations. However, with use of ideas involved in Dittrich's approximation scheme (built on ideas of Rovelli) a way to explicitly implement, at least in principle, a reduced phase space quantization was made viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thiemann|first1=T|title=Reduced phase space quantization and Dirac observables|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=21 February 2006|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1163–1180|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/23/4/006|arxiv=gr-qc/0411031|bibcode=2006CQGra..23.1163T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The thermal time hypothesis ==
{{main|Thermal time hypothesis|thermodynamics}}

[[Generally covariant]] theories do not have a notion of a distinguished physical time with respect to which everything evolves. However, it is not needed for the full formulation and interpretation of the theory. The dynamical laws are determined by correlations which are sufficient to make predictions. But then a mechanism is needed which explains how the familiar notion of time eventually emerges from the timeless structure to become such an important ingredient of the macroscopic world we live in as well as of our conscious experience.

A possible solution to this problem has been put forward by [[Carlo Rovelli]] and [[Alain Connes]], both in the classical and quantum theory, and goes by the name of the thermal time hypothesis. It postulates that physical time flow is not an a priori given fundamental property of the theory, but is a macroscopic feature of thermodynamical origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connes|first1=A|last2=Rovelli|first2=C|title=Von Neumann algebra automorphisms and time-thermodynamics relation in generally covariant quantum theories|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=1 December 1994|volume=11|issue=12|pages=2899–2917|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/12/007|url=http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/carlotime.pdf|arxiv=gr-qc/9406019|bibcode=1994CQGra..11.2899C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some thinkers have attempted to ascribe the term Reconstructivism to the post-postmodern art movement. In an essay by Chris Sunami, ([http://kitoba.com/pedia/Reconstructivist+Art.html Art Essays: Reconstructivist Art]) "reconstructivist art" is described as follows:

{{quote|A reconstructivist art work builds upon prior, [[deconstructionist]] artworks and techniques, but adapts them to classic themes and structures, with the goal of creating works of genuine emotion and significance. In this way, reconstructivism (when it works) combines the vitality and originality of deconstructionism with the comforts, pleasures and rewards of [[classicism]]. The overall purpose of reconstructivism is to reawaken a sense of the Real in a world where everything has been demonstrated to be an illusion.}}

One of the examples Sunami provides of this technique is the way some modern music incorporates deconstructed samples of older music and combines and arranges the samples in a new way as part of a new composition.

In [[philosophy]] and particularly [[political philosophy]], '''theoreticism''' is the preference for theory over practice (or, more broadly, abstract knowledge over concrete action), or a philosophical position which would lead to such a preference.

The term is often used pejoratively.  In [[Marxist philosophy]], for instance, theoreticism is often identified as a political error, valorizing the efforts of [[academic]] Marxism over those of revolutionary struggle.  [[Louis Althusser]], for instance, criticized his own early work for theoreticism.  In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], theoreticism would be something closer to the over-valuing of [[knowledge]] at the cost of losing a proper appreciation of [[experience]].  [[Martin Heidegger]] claimed this trend was begun by [[Plato]], and that it continued in an "intensification and hardening of 'theoreticism', the drive toward technical and objectifying modes of knowledge and, with it, the oblivion of any more primordial or more reverential kind of existence."

{{Universalism|expanded=all}}
'''Universalism''' is a theological and philosophical concept that some ideas have [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] application or applicability.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} A community that calls itself ''universalist'' may emphasize the universal principles of most religions, and accept others in an inclusive manner. It is centered around the belief in a universal reconciliation between humanity and the divine.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} For example, some forms of [[Abrahamic religions]] claim the universal value of their doctrine and moral principles, and "feel inclusive"{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--"claim universal value" is very different from "feel inclusive". What does the latter even mean?--&gt;.&lt;ref name='Schaff-Herzog'/&gt;

[[Christian Universalism]] is focused around the idea of [[universal reconciliation]]. Also known as universal salvation, it is a doctrine stating that every human soul will ultimately be reconciled to God because of divine love and mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Otis Ainsworth Skinner (1807-1861), ''A Series of Sermons in Defense of the Doctrine of Universal Salvation'', Page 209, It is not part of mainline Christian doctrine either Catholic or Protestant. "Repentance is a means by which all men are brought into the enjoyment of religion, and we do expect any man will be saved while he continues in sin. However, Unitarian Universalism holds a universal salvation, because is, "we expect all men will repent."&lt;/ref&gt;

A belief in one fundamental truth is another important tenet in Universalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The living truth is seen as more far-reaching than the national, cultural, or religious boundaries or interpretations of that one truth. As the [[Rig Veda]] states, "Truth is one; sages call it by various names."&lt;ref&gt;[https://vedanta.org/what-is-vedanta/harmony-of-religions/ Vedanta Society of Southern California ''Harmony of Religions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Universalism has had an influence on modern day [[Hinduism]], in turn influencing western modern spirituality.{{sfn|King|2002|p=}}{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

[[Unitarian Universalism]] emphasizes that religion is a universal human quality, and also focuses on the universal principles of most religions. They accept all religions in an inclusive manner.

==Philosophy==
===Universality===
{{Main|Universality (philosophy)}}
In philosophy, universality is the notion that universal facts can be discovered and is therefore understood as being in opposition to [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonnett, A. (2005). ''Anti-Racism''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain religions, universalism is the quality ascribed to an entity whose existence is consistent throughout the universe.

=== Moral universalism ===
{{Main|Moral universalism|Moral particularism}}
Moral universalism (also called ''moral objectivism'' or ''universal morality'') is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] position that some system of [[ethics]] are applied [[universality (philosophy)|universally]]. That system is inclusive of all individuals,&lt;ref name=PhilPages&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/u.htm#unvby |title=A Dictionary of Philosophical Terms and Names |work=Philosophy Pages |first=Garth|last=Kemerling |date=November 12, 2011 |quote=According to [http://www.philosophypages.com/ph/kant.htm Immanuel Kant] and [http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/h.htm#hare Richard Mervyn Hare]...moral imperatives must be regarded as equally binding on everyone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of [[culture]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[religion]], [[nationality]], [[sexual orientation]], or any other distinguishing feature.&lt;ref name=Gowans&gt;{{cite web |quote=Let us say that moral objectivism maintains that moral judgments are ordinarily true or false in an absolute or universal sense, that some of them are true, and that people sometimes are justified in accepting true moral judgments (and rejecting false ones) on the basis of evidence available to any reasonable and well-informed person. |first=Chris|last=Gowans |title=Moral Relativism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2012 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/moral-relativism/ |date=Dec 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral universalism is opposed to [[moral nihilism]] and [[moral relativism]]. However, not all forms of moral universalism are [[moral absolutism|absolutist]], nor do they necessarily [[value monism]]. Many forms of universalism, such as [[utilitarianism]], are non-absolutist. Other forms such as those theorized by [[Isaiah Berlin]], may [[value pluralism|value pluralist ideals.]]

==Religion==

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
In Bahá'í belief, a single God has sent all the historic founders of the world religions in a process of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]]. As a result, the major world religions are seen as divine in origin and are continuous in their purpose. In this view, there is unity among the founders of world religions, but each revelation brings a more advanced set of teachings in human history and none are syncretic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paradise and Paradigm: Key Symbols in Persian Christianity and the Bahá'í Faith |location=Albany |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1999 |page=292 |last=Buck |first=Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this universal view, the unity of humanity is one of the central teachings of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name="Stockman"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Stockman |title=Sourcebook of the World's Religions |isbn=1-57731-121-3 |publisher=New World Library |year=2000 |editor-first=Joel |editor-last=Beversluis|chapter=The Baha'i Faith |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bahá'í teachings]] state that since all humans have been created in the image of God, God does not make any distinction between people with regard to race, colour or religion.&lt;ref name="Smith138"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |year=2008 |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-86251-5 |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, because all humans have been created equal, they all require equal opportunities and treatment.&lt;ref name="Stockman" /&gt; Hence the Bahá'í view promotes the unity of humanity, and that people's vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation.&lt;ref name="Smith138" /&gt;

The teaching, however, does not equate unity with uniformity; instead the Bahá'í writings advocate the principle of ''unity in diversity'' where the variety in the human race is valued.&lt;ref name="Smith139"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |year=2008 |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-86251-5 |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating on a worldwide basis this cooperative view of the peoples and nations of the planet culminates in a vision of the practicality of the progression in world affairs towards, and the inevitability of, [[world peace]].&lt;ref name="Smith-peace"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=peace |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian Universalism}}
The fundamental idea of Christian Universalism is [[universal reconciliation]] – that all humans will eventually be saved. They will eventually enter God's kingdom in Heaven, through the grace and works of the lord [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/chr-univ.html |title=What Is Christian Universalism? |publisher=Auburn.edu |date=|accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Universalism teaches that an eternal [[Hell]] does not exist, and that it was not what Jesus had taught. They point to historical evidence showing that some early fathers of the church were universalists, and attribute the perpetuating idea of hell to eternal mistranslation.&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org"&gt;[http://christianuniversalist.org/resources/articles/salvation-conspiracy/ The Salvation Conspiracy: How Hell Became Eternal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Universalists cite numerous Biblical passages which reference the salvation of all beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gary Amirault |url=http://www.tentmaker.org/tracts/TheFateOfTheWicked.html |title=The Fate of the Wicked |publisher=Tentmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they argue that an eternal hell is both unjust, and against the nature and attributes of a loving God.&lt;ref&gt;Guild, E.E. 'Arguments in Favour of Universalism'. http://www.tentmaker.org/books/InFavorCh20.html
http://godfire.net/eby/saviour_of_the_world.html
http://www.godfire.net/Hellidx.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining beliefs of Christian Universalism are generally compatible with the fundamentals of Christianity{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
* [[God in Christianity|God]] is the loving Parent of all peoples, see [[Love of God]].
* [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] reveals the nature and character of God, and is the spiritual leader of humankind.
* Humankind is created with an [[immortal soul]], which death can not end—or a [[Christian mortalism|mortal soul]] that shall be resurrected and preserved by God. A soul which God will not wholly destroy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tentmaker.org/books/TheBibleHell.html ''The Bible Hell'']. TentMaker.org. "The immortal soul is not meant, but the life. As though Jesus had said: "Fear Not those who can only kill the body, but rather him, who ''if he chose could'' destroy the soul"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christian views on sin|Sin]] has negative consequences for the sinner either in this life or the [[afterlife]]. All of God's punishments for sin are corrective and remedial. None of such punishments will last forever, or result in the permanent destruction of a soul. Some Christian Universalists believe in the idea of a Purgatorial Hell, or a temporary place of purification that some must undergo before their entrance into Heaven.&lt;ref name="Scott2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam Van Scott |title=The Encyclopedia of Hell: A Comprehensive Survey of the Underworld |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1EnBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA240 |date=10 February 2015 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-1-4668-9119-7 |page=240 |chapter=Purgatorial Hell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 the Universalist General Convention, later called the [[Universalist Church of America]], adopted the Five Principles: the belief in God, Jesus Christ, the immortality of the human soul, the reality of sin and [[universal reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/prof.html |title=See section entitled "Five Principles of Faith" |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
{{See also|Universal reconciliation#History|l1=History of Universal Reconciliation}}
Universalist writers such as [[George T. Knight (Universalist)|George T. Knight]] have claimed that Universalism was a widely held view among theologians in [[Early Christianity]].&lt;ref name='Schaff-Herzog'&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc12/Page_96.html [[George T. Knight (Universalist)|George T. Knight]] The Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, 1953, vol. 12, p. 96; retrieved 30/04/09]&lt;/ref&gt; These included such important figures such as Alexandrian scholar [[Origen]] as well as [[Clement of Alexandria]], a Christian theologian. Origen and Clement both included the existence of a non-eternal Hell in their teachings. Hell was remedial, in that it was a place one went to purge one's sins before entering into Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stanrock.net/2015/05/20/purgatorial-hell-faq/ |title=Purgatorial Hell FAQ |publisher=StanRock.net |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first undisputed documentations of Christian Universalist ideas occurred in 17th-century England and 18th-century Europe as well as in colonial America. Between 1648-1697 English activist [[Gerrard Winstanley]], writer [[Richard Coppin]], and dissenter [[Jane Leade]], each taught that God would grant all human beings salvation. The same teachings were later spread throughout 18th-century France and America by [[George de Benneville]]. People who taught this doctrine in America would later become known as the [[Universalist Church of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wyatt |first1=Neal |last2=Dwyer |first2=Tierney V |last3=Dwyer |first3=Tierney V |year=2008 |title=Unitarian Universalism: A Research Guide |url=|journal=Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly |volume=47 |issue=3|pages=210–214 |doi=10.5860/rusq.47n3.210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term ''[[apocatastasis|apocatastas]]'' came to be related by some to the beliefs of [[Christian Universalism]], but central to the doctrine was the restitution, or restoration of all sinful beings to God, and to His state of blessedness.  In early [[Patristics]], usage of the term is distinct.

====Universalist theology====
{{Main|Christian Universalism}}
{{religious text primary|section|date=February 2012}}
Universalist theology is grounded in history, scripture and assumptions about the nature of God. [[Thomas Whittemore (Universalist)|Thomas Whittemore]] wrote the book "100 Scriptural Proofs that Jesus Christ Will Save All Mankind"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tentmaker.org/books/ScripturalProofs.html |title=100 Scriptural Proofs That Jesus Christ Will Save All Mankind |publisher=Tentmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; quoting both Old and New Testament verses which support the Universalist viewpoint.

Some Bible verses he cites and are cited by other Christian Universalists are:
# 1 Corinthians 15:22&lt;ref name="Tent"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Wicked|url=http://www.tentmaker.org/tracts/TheFateOfTheWicked.html|work=tentmaker.org|publisher=Tentmaker|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Tentmaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#* "For as in Adam '''ALL''' die, so also in Christ shall '''ALL''' be made alive." ([[English Standard Version|ESV]]; emphasis added)
# 2 Peter 3:9
#* "'''The Lord''' is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, '''not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance'''." (ESV; emphasis added)
# 1 Timothy 2:3–6&lt;ref name="Tent" /&gt;
#* "This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who '''wants all men to be saved''' and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for '''ALL''' men—the testimony given in its proper time." (NIV; emphasis added)
# 1 John 2:2
#* "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world." (NIV)
# 1 Timothy 4:10&lt;ref name="Tent" /&gt;
#* "For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the '''Savior of all people, especially of those who believe'''." (ESV; emphasis added)
# Romans 11:32&lt;ref name="Tent" /&gt;
#* "For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all." (NIV)

====Mistranslations====
Christian Universalists point towards the mistranslations of the Greek word αιών (Lit. aion), as giving rise to the idea of Eternal Hell, and the idea that some people will not be saved.&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tentmaker1"&gt;[http://www.tentmaker.org/articles/EternalPunishmentNotTrueToGreek.html "Eternal" Punishment (Matthew 25:46) Is NOT Found In The Greek New Testament.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://carm.org/look-word-aionion A look at the word "aionion"]&lt;/ref&gt;

This Greek word is the origin of the modern English word [[aeon]], which refers to a period of time or an epoch.

The 19th century theologian [[Marvin Vincent]] wrote about the word ''aion'', and the supposed connotations of "eternal" or "temporal":
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Aion''', transliterated '''''aeon''''', is a period of longer or shorter duration, having a beginning and an end, and complete in itself. [...] Neither the noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of ''endless'' or ''everlasting''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vincent|first=Marvin|title=Note on Olethron Aionion (eternal destruction)|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/vincent.html|work=Word Studies in the New Testament|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. Ken Vincent writes that "When it (aion) was translated into Latin Vulgate, "aion" became "aeternam" which means "eternal".&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org"/&gt;

====New Thought====
{{Main|New Thought}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
[[Unity Church]], [[Religious Science]], and [[Divine Science]] are denominations within the New Thought movement. Each teaches that there is a common thread of truth at the heart of all religions. New Thought is an ever-evolving belief system which will incorporate ''Truth'' where ever it is found, hence the name ''New Thought''. ''All is God, But God transcends all''.

====Unitarian Universalism====
{{Main|Unitarian Universalism}}
Unitarian Universalism (UU) is a theologically liberal religion characterized by a "free and responsible search for truth and meaning".&lt;ref&gt;(The 4th principle of Unitarian Universalism)[http://www.uua.org/visitors/6798.shtml UUA.org Seven principles]&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian Universalists do not share a [[creed]]; rather, they are unified by their shared search for [[spiritual growth]] and by the understanding that an individual's theology is a result of that search and not a result of obedience to an authoritarian requirement. Unitarian Universalists draw from all major world religions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Rastafarianism |title=Major Religions Ranked by Size |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many different theological sources and have a wide range of beliefs and practices.

While having its origins in Christianity, UU is no longer a Christian church. As of 2006, fewer than about 20% of Unitarian Universalists identified themselves as Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ford |first=James Ishmael |title=Zen Master Who? |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |year=2006 |page=187 |isbn=0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Unitarian Universalism espouses a pluralist approach to religious belief, whereby members may describe themselves as [[Humanism|humanist]], agnostic, [[deist]], [[atheist]], pagan, Christian, [[monotheist]], [[pantheism|pantheist]], [[polytheist]], or assume no label at all.

The [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA) was formed in 1961, a consolidation of the [[American Unitarian Association]], established in 1825, and the Universalist Church of America,&lt;ref name="harvard1"&gt;Harvard Divinity School: [http://div.hds.harvard.edu/library/bms/merger_timeline_1900s.html Timeline of Significant Events in the Merger of the Unitarian and Universalist Churches During the 1900s]&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1866. It is headquartered in [[Boston]], and mainly serves churches in the United States. The [[Canadian Unitarian Council]] became an independent body in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;CUC-UUA Tradition. Canadian Unitarian Council [http://cuc.ca/who_we_are/cuc-uua_transition.htm Growing Vital Religious Communities In Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Non-religious Universalism=====
Universalism is not only a set of values, but a worldview to which any can subscribe if they observe and believe in the universality of the human experience—and that of all sentient life—and work to uphold the principles, ethics, and actions that safeguard these fundamental things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unitarian Universalism |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/types/unitarianuniversalism.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, many Universalists may be attracted to the logic of universally applicable principles, rather than any belief or dogma. Human unity, solidarity, and the perceived need for a sustainable and socially conscious global order are among the tendencies of non-religious Universalist thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unitarian Universalism|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/u-u.htm|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
Author David Frawley says that Hinduism has a "background universalism" and its teachings contain a "universal relevance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haindavakeralam.com/pluralism-and-universalism-within-hinduism-david-frawley-hk5500 ''Pluralism and Universalism Within Hinduism''] "Hindu teachings were also denigrated accordingly and the deeper philosophies of Hinduism were often ignored, especially their universal relevance. For conversion purposes it was easier to define Hinduism in a limited way as a local phenomenon only. Yet the universality of Hindu teachings continued, though few outside of India understood this until recent years. This background universalism of Sanatana Dharma affords Hinduism a synthetic tendency, an ability to incorporate within itself a diversity of views and approaches, including at times those from groups outside of Hinduism or even opposed to Hinduism. Because of this syncretic view, sometimes Hinduism is equated with a blind universalism that accepts without discrimination anything that calls itself religious or spiritual, as if differences of spiritual teachings did not matter in any way. While this may be true of some Hindus, the Hindu tradition also contains a lively tradition of free debate on all aspects of theology, philosophy and metaphysics, showing differences as well as similarities, and not simply equating all teachings as they are. A good example of this is the debates between the dualistic and non-dualistic schools of Vedantic philosophy, but many other examples exist as well. The different sects within Hinduism have always been free to disagree, though each sect has its particular guidelines and there is an overall respect for Dharma."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism]] is also naturally [[Religious pluralism|religiously pluralistic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hafsite.org/hinduism-101/hinduism-basics Hindu American Foundation "Hinduism Basics"]&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known ''[[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]]'' hymn says: "Truth is One, though the sages know it variously."&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 1.164.46&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' (4:11), God, manifesting as an incarnation, states: "As people approach me, so I receive them. All paths lead to me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=56UM3BIvbHYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=easwaran+1586380273&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=as%20people%20approach%20me&amp;f=false Page 194] in [[Eknath Easwaran]] (2008).

Albany: State University of New York Press, p. 211. {{ISBN|0-87395-831-4}}, which translates the same passage as "They who, in whatever way, take refuge in Me, them I reward."&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu religion has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions. Hinduism emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God, whether one knows it or not.&lt;ref&gt;See Swami Bhaskarananda, ''Essentials of Hinduism'' (Viveka Press 2002) {{ISBN|1-884852-04-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hinduism has an openness and tolerance towards other religions, it also has a wide range of diversity within it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hafsite.org/hinduism-101/hinduism-basics Hindu American Foundation ''Hinduism Basics'' "It is a richly diverse family of philosophies, traditions, and practices that have been followed primarily throughout Asia for thousands of years."]&lt;/ref&gt; There are considered to be six orthodox Hindu schools of philosophy/theology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://veden-akademie.de/index.php?article_id=154&amp;clang=1 "Shat-darshana: The Philosophical Schools of Sanatana Dharma"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as multiple unorthodox or "hetrodox" traditions called [[darshanas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clearias.com/indian-philosophy-schools/ ''Indian Philosophy: Orthodox and Heterodox Schools'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu Universalism====
{{Main|Neo-Vedanta|Hindu reform movements}}
''Hindu Universalism'', also called ''Neo-Vedanta''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/neo-vedanta-the-problem-with-hindu-universalism-frank-gaetano-morales/ Frank Morales, ''Neo-Vedanta: The problem with Hindu Universalism'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''neo-Hinduism'',{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} is a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and [[orientalism]]. It denotes the ideology that all religions are true and therefore worthy of toleration and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What Is Hinduism?: Modern Adventures Into a Profound Global Faith|year=2007|publisher=Himalayan Academy Publications|isbn=1934145009|page=416|author=Editors of Hinduism Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a modern interpretation that aims to present Hinduism as a "homogenized ideal of Hinduism"{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338}} with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} For example, it presents that:
{{quote|... an imagined "integral unity" that was probably little more than an "imagined" view of the religious life that pertained only to a cultural elite and that empirically speaking had very little reality "on the ground," as it were, throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}}}}

Hinduism embraces universalism by conceiving the whole world as a single family that deifies the one truth, and therefore it accepts all forms of beliefs and dismisses labels of distinct religions which would imply a division of identity.&lt;ref&gt;(Rigveda 1:164:46) "Ekam sat vipra bahudha vadanti" - Truth is one; sages call it many names&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Maha Upanishad: Chapter 6, Verse 72) "[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]]" - The entire world is a one big family&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Badlani |first=Hiro |title=Hinduism: Path of the Ancient Wisdom |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |year=2008 |page=303 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8NrQhyxH-GgC |isbn=978-0-595-70183-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

This modernised re-interpretation has become a broad current in Indian culture,{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} extending far beyond the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]], the Advaita Vedanta Sampradaya founded by [[Adi Shankara]]. An early exponent of Hindu Universalism was [[Ram Mohan Roy]], who established the [[Brahmo Samaj]].{{sfn|Ghazi|2010}} Hindu Universalism was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by [[Vivekananda]]{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} Veneration for all other religions was articulated by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]:
{{quote|After long study and experience, I have come to the conclusion that [1] all religions are true; [2] all religions have some error in them; [3] all religions are almost as dear to me as my own Hinduism, in as much as all human beings should be as dear to one as one's own close relatives. My own veneration for other faiths is the same as that for my own faith; therefore no thought of conversion is possible.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Gandhi, ''All Men Are Brothers: Life and Thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi as told in his own words'', Paris, UNESCO 1958, p 60.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Western orientalists played an important role in this popularisation, regarding Vedanta to be the "central theology of Hinduism".{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} Oriental scholarship portrayed Hinduism as a "single world religion",{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and denigrated the heterogeneousity of Hindu beliefs and practices as 'distortions' of the basic teachings of Vedanta.{{sfn|King|1999|p=135}}{{Citation not found}}

===Islam===
{{Further|Ummah|Divisions of the world in Islam|People of the Book|Dhimmi|Dawah|}}
{{Original Research|date=June 2018}}
Islam recognizes to a certain extent the validity of the [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Quran]] identifying Jews, Christians, and "[[Sabians|Sabi'un]]" (usually taken as a reference to the [[Mandaeans]]) as "people of the Book" (''ahl al-kitab''). Later Islamic theologians expanded this definition to include [[Zoroastrians]], and later even Hindus, as the early Islamic empire brought many people professing these religions under its dominion, but the Qur'an explicitly identifies only Jews, Christians, and [[Sabians]] as People of the Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crone|first=Patricia|title=God's Rule: Government and Islam: Six Centuries of Medieval Islamic Political Thought|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13291-6|page=472}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2015}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lapidus|first1=Ira M.|title=Ira M.

There are several views within Islam with respect to Universalism. According to the most inclusive teachings, common among the [[liberal Muslim movements]], all monotheistic religions or people of the book have a chance of salvation. For example, Surah 2:62,256 states that:&lt;ref&gt;1. S. A. Rahman, Punishment of Apostasy in Islam, Institute of Islamic Culture, Lahore, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2017}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}} {{quote|Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve...let there be no compulsion in religion}}

However, the most exclusive teachings disagree. For example, the [[Salafi]] refer to Surah 9:5,29:{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} {{quote|Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters [''mushrikun''] wherever ye find them, and take them, and besiege them, and lay in wait in every stratagem of war. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the ''Zakat'', then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful [...] Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture [i.e. people of the book] as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the ''jizya'' readily, being brought low [in submission].}}

The interpretation of all of these passages are hotly contested amongst various schools of thought, traditionalist and reform-minded, and branches of Islam, from the reforming [[Quranism]] and [[Ahmadiyya]] to the ultra-traditionalist [[Salafi]], as is the doctrine of abrogation (''[[Naskh (tafsir)|naskh]]'') which is used to determine which verses take precedence, based on reconstructed chronology, with later verses superseding earlier ones. The traditional chronology places Surah 9 as the last or second-to-last surah revealed, thus, in traditional exegesis, it gains a large power of abrogation, and verses 9:5,29,73 are held to have abrogated 2:256&lt;ref name="Ibn Kathir 2000 6608"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Kathir|first=Ismail (1301-1373)|title=Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Aziz (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)|year=2000|publisher=Maktaba Darussalam|location=Riyadh, Saudi Arabia|isbn=978-1-59144-020-8|page=6608|edition=English Abridged|editor=Sheikh Safiur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri|language=English, Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ahadith also play a major role in this, and different schools of thought assign different weightings and rulings of authenticity to different hadith, with the four schools of Sunni thought accepting the Six Authentic Collections, generally along with the [[Muwatta Imam Malik]]. Depending on the level of acceptance of rejection of certain traditions, the interpretation of the Koran can be changed immensely, from the Qur'anists and Ahmadiyya who reject the ahadith, to the Salafi, or ''ahl al-hadith'', who hold the entirety of the traditional collections in great reverence.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish views on religious pluralism}}
{{See also|Noahidism}}
Judaism teaches that God [[Jews as the chosen people|chose the Jewish people]] to be in a unique covenant with God, and one of their beliefs is that Jewish people were charged by the [[Torah]] with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah to other nations. This view does not preclude a belief that God also has a relationship with other peoples—rather, Judaism holds that God had entered into a covenant with all humanity as [[Noahidism|Noachides]], and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God, as well as being universal in the sense that it is open to all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Polish |first1=David |year=1985 |title=Covenant-Jewish Universalism and Particularism |journal=Judaism |volume=34 |issue=3 |page=284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An on-line organization, the Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute founded and led by [[Steven Blane]], who calls himself an "American Jewish Universalist Rabbi", believes in a more inclusive version of Jewish Universalism, stating that "God equally chose all nations to be lights unto the world, and we have much to learn and share with each other. We can only accomplish [[Tikkun Olam]] by our unconditional acceptance of each other's peaceful doctrines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Universalism|url=http://www.jsli.net/jewish-universalism|work=Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manichaeism===
{{main|Manichaeism}}
Manichaeism, like Christian [[Gnosticism]] and [[Zurvanism]], was inherently universalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Manichaeism in the Early Sasanian Empire|author=Manfred Hutter |date=January 1993|publisher=BRILL|jstor=3270395|volume=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2015}}

===Sikhism===
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
{{expand section|date=February 2012}}
}}
In [[Sikhism]], all the religions of the world are compared to rivers flowing into a single ocean. Although the [[Sikh gurus]] did not agree with the practices of [[fasting]], [[idolatry]] and pilgrimage during their times, they stressed that all religions should be tolerated and considered on equal footing. The Sikh scripture, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], contains the writings of not just the Sikh guru themselves, but the writings of several Hindu and Muslim saints, known as the ''[[Bhagat]]s''. 

The very first word of the Sikh scripture is "Ik", followed by "Oh-ang-kar". This literally means that there is only one god, and that one is wholesome, inclusive of the whole universe. It further goes on to state that all of creation, and all energy is part of this primordial being. As such, it is described in scripture over and over again, that all that occurs is part of the divine will, and as such, has to be accepted. It occurs for a reason, even if its beyond the grasp of one person to understand.

Although Sikhism does not teach that men are created as an [[image of God]], it states that the essence of the One is to be found throughout all of its creation.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} As was said by Yogi Bhajan, the man who is credited with having brought Sikhism to the West:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you can't see God in all, you can't see God at all". (Sri Singh Sahib, Yogi Bhajan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sikhdharma.org/about-the-siri-singh-sahib-yogi-bhajan/|title=About the Siri Singh Sahib – Sikh Dharma International|website=www.sikhdharma.org|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The First Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]] said himself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/There_is_no_Hindu_and_no_Musalman|title=There is no Hindu and no Musalman - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|website=www.sikhiwiki.org|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhs.org/guru1.htm|title=Sikhism Religion of the Sikh People|website=www.sikhs.org|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gurmat.info/sms/smspublications/gurunanakforchildren/chapter4/#No%20Hindu,%20and%20no%20Muslim|title=Guru Nanak (for Children) - No Hindu, and no Muslim|last=Munde |first=Amarpreet Singh|website=www.gurmat.info|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By this, Guru Nanak meant that there is no distinction between religion in God's eyes, whether polytheist, monotheist, [[pantheist]], or even atheist, all that one needs to gain salvation is purity of heart, tolerance of all beings, compassion and kindness. Unlike many of the major world religions, Sikhism does not have [[proselytism|missionaries]], instead it believes men have the freedom to find their own path to [[salvation]].

===Zoroastrianism===
{{main|Zoroastrianism}}
Some varieties of Zoroastrian (such as [[Zurvanism]]) are universalistic in application to all races, but not necessarily universalist in the sense of universal salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Porter Berkey ''The formation of Islam: religion and society in the Near East'' 2003 p28 "This is not to say that there was no universalist dimension to Zoroastrian religious life; but what universalism there was derived directly, and to a greater degree than in the case of Rome and Christianity, from the explicit connection between religion and the state."&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2015}}

==Critics==
In his book ''The Miracle of Theism: Arguments for and against the Existence of God'', the Australian philosopher [[J. L. Mackie]] noted that whilst in the past a miracle performed by Jesus had served as proof to Christians that he was the 'one true God', and that a miracle performed by another religion's deity had served as a (contradictory) proof to its own adherents, the universalist approach resulted in any such miracle being accepted as a validation of all religions, a situation that he characterised as "Miracle-workers of the world, unite!"&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Mackie |author-first1=J. L. |title=The Miracle of Theism: Arguments for and against the Existence of God |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=November 1982 |isbn=978-0198246824|quote="It is no longer 'The heathen in his blindness…', but rather 'We worship the same god, but under different names and in different ways’. Carried far enough, this modern tendency would allow Christian miracles to support, not undermine, belief in the supernatural achievements of stone-age witch doctors and medicine men, and vice versa. It is as if someone had coined the slogan, Miracle-workers of the world, unite!"|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
