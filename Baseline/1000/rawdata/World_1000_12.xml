[[Globalization|Globalization’s]] impact on [[gender inequality]] in the 21st century in the [[United States|USA]] and around the world has surfaced as a contentious issue. While some argue that globalization is beneficial, it is also claimed that not everyone is benefiting from globalization equally. In particular, females often do not benefit to the extent of their male counterparts. Contemporary globalizing forces such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[United Nations]] have worked to deconstruct the barriers of inequality and existing gender gaps. As a result, this article is focused on the 21st century economic transformation that has emerged through globalization as it has impacted not only global markets, but also, the overall landscape at an individual level. At the same time, there is a need to present the various struggles and existing realities of gender inequality in America’s workforce, which still finds itself on the path towards full equality.

==Economic opportunities==
Globalization has brought increased access to economic opportunities. Most of these opportunities have come as a result of trade openness and the spread of information and communication technologies (ICTs). This has led to an increase in women's access to economic opportunities and in some cases increased their wages relative to men's. More specifically, the World Bank claims, “trade openness and the diffusion of new information and technologies have translated into more jobs and stronger connections to markets for many women”.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2011, 'Globalization's Impact on Gender Equality: What's happened and what's needed', in World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality, World Bank, Washington DC, Ch. 6. 254-277.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased access to information, primarily through television and the Internet, allows the general American public to learn about social mores in other places, which can change perceptions and promote the establishment of egalitarian attitudes. Instead, egalitarian attitudes are currently hindered by the existing reality of woman making up the majority of the low-wage workforce industry. More specifically, the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), in a recent report shows that “in 2010, women constituted 59 percent of the low-wage workforce”.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/beirutglobal.htm. Web. January 16. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalizing organizations and institutions such as the United Nations, and the World Bank have worked to promote gender equality. The task has not been easy given the need to undo many institutionalized and systemic influences on gender equality. Thus, the ability to override these forms of oppression stems from spreading awareness. Globalizing institutions have used increased awareness to shed light issues of gender inequality, particularly in the work force. For example, “The Beijing + 5 process provides an opportunity to reflect on the impact of Globalization in determining further actions and initiatives for the full implementation of the Beijing commitments”.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/beirutglobal.htm. Web. January 16. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ability to promote awareness is by default facilitated because, for example, in the nonagricultural sector, the total share percentage of women employed is at 48% from a 2012 report. Thus, when the gender binaries of male and female in the U.S. constitute half of the entire workforce respectively, the females that receive unequal treatment have the ability to speak out against the cause with the understanding that a high proportion of the public backs them.

==Public perceptions==
Public opinion in the USA on Globalization and its impacts on gender inequality has been shaped by denial of basic [[human rights]] in the workforce abroad. The World Bank states that  “Public opinion in developed countries generally connects globalization with sweatshops where child labor is common and workers are denied the most basic rights”.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2011, 'Globalization's Impact on Gender Equality: What's happened and what's needed', in World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality, World Bank, Washington DC, Ch. 6. Pg. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the issue of sweatshops is acute in the informal sector. For example, the arrangements such as sub-contracting and outsourcing have become an integral part of the contemporary market economy. Thus, issues of unfair pay and poor working environments are commonly interpreted as issues abroad. However, there remains high contestation against transnationals that allow these issues to happen in the first place through the act of shifting their manufacturing bases away from the U.S. and into other countries with lenient regulations and restrictions.

==Gender roles in industries==
Globalization's impact on gender inequality has also had its fair share of benefits in the U.S. to the extent that the “demand for female workers in the export and ICT-enabled sectors has increased, and as women have filled these new jobs”.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2011, 'Globalization's Impact on Gender Equality: What's happened and what's needed', in [[World Development Report]] 2012: Gender Equality, World Bank, Washington DC, Ch. 6. 254-277. Pg. 254&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has been on the forefront of the technological advancements around the world. As a result, the ICT industry impacts and reflects both a benefit, and a hindrance to gender inequality. This is mostly due to the reality that forces of globalization are real and their influences are felt everywhere. More specifically, the Inter-agency network on women and gender equality by the United Nations claims, “Equitable access to information and Communication technologies can be an important tool for empowering women.” ICT can empower women through increasing their activity, as well as help reduce gender inequalities by “reducing women’s and girls’ time demands, increasing their access to income-generating activities, and allowing them to benefit from technological advances”.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, September 2005, ‘Women2000 and Beyond: Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women through ICT’. Pg. 2-35.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also argued that ICT sectors have not necessarily helped women. Instead, “women are under-represented in ICT decision making structures including policy and regulatory institutions”.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, September 2005, ‘Women2000 and Beyond: Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women through ICT’. Pg 9&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the workforce continues to fluctuate between becoming increasingly viewed as supportive of gender equality as well as the belief that it has promoted precisely the opposite.

While there is a strong concentration around the role of women, they are the ones that mostly suffer from gender inequality. However, there are also masculine organizations that also promote the need to fix the issue of gender inequality. There is an existing belief that “Men and boys are thus, in several ways, gatekeepers for gender equality and should be targeted and included in efforts to promote gender equality so as to ensure men’s support and partnership”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/gender/Informationresources/WCMS_232755/lang--en/index.htm. Web. January 16. 2014. page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only through a collective effort that gender equality can flourish. However, it should be noted that the reality of gender inequality in the U.S. is one where men also “face vulnerabilities because of gender inequality, such as experiencing stress from being regarded, and regarding themselves, as the main breadwinner”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/gender/Informationresources/WCMS_232755/lang--en/index.htm. Web. January 16. 2014. Pg 7&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, failing to get a job, or losing their job and the inability to earn enough money can also lead to an erosion of their self-worth as men.

==Continuing inequality==
There are various studies available that depict globalization as a hindrance toward gender inequality. For example, shortly before the transition into the 21st century, “recent studies such as UNCTAD’s Trade and Development Report (1997) and the UNDP’s Human Development Reports (1997 and 1999) suggest that economic growth fostered by recent liberalization policies can be accompanied by increased inequality and a decline in living standards".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/beirutglobal.htm. Web. January 16. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the other hand, positive effects may include “increased employment opportunities for women in non-traditional sectors” thus enabling them to earn and control income" &lt;ref&gt;United Nations. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/beirutglobal.htm. Web. January 16. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the USA serves as one of the key players in the international system that is not to say that it is immune to the gender pay gaps that exist around the world. In fact, the great recession and [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]] demonstrates the reality of these inequalities given that men and women were affected differently. Statistically, in the U.S. alone, men lost more jobs than women in the recession. But at the same time, men also experienced a steadier recovery. “One in five women are working part time because they cannot find full time work while at the start of the recession less than one in ten women were doing so”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/washington/areas/gender-equality-in-the-workplace/WCMS_159496/lang--en/index.htm. Web. January 16. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these developments, the overall unemployment rate for women is lower than men’s and they are also less likely to be among the long-term unemployed.

21st century globalization and its impact on gender equality remains highly influenced by the past. The World Bank openly admitted to the influence of the past by claiming, “even among those who have benefited from higher access to economic opportunities, old patterns of employment segregation by gender can emerge”.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2011, 'Globalization's Impact on Gender Equality: What's happened and what's needed', in World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality, World Bank, Washington DC, Ch. 6. 254-277. Page 268&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ability to undermine these old patterns is by continually raising awareness. The ability to raise awareness and counter old patterns is prominent in the U.S. and visible through globalizing organization-sponsored groups. One important group that has worked to raise awareness is known as WomenWatch, a United Nations inter-agency website on gender equality reducing women’s and girls’ time demands, increasing their access to income-generating activities, and allowing them to benefit from technological advances”.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, September 2005, ‘Women2000 and Beyond: Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women through ICT’. Pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Their mission is essentially to shed light to the various ways gender equality can become a reality if everyone’s concerns converge and coalesce.

Globalization on its own cannot end gender inequality. There should be an understanding that the Globalization process as a whole offers both opportunities, as well as challenges for human development. Consequently, a collective effort implies an understanding that “the specific gender-related needs of men are overlooked, as well as the important role that men can play in achieving gender equality and empowering women”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/gender/Informationresources/WCMS_232755/lang--en/index.htm. Web. January 16. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is precisely through understanding the dynamics of gender inequality while incorporating both males and females into the playing field that equality can ultimately be achieved.

The continent of '''Australia''', sometimes known in technical contexts by the names '''Sahul''', '''Australinea''' or '''Meganesia''' to distinguish it from the [[Australia|country of Australia]], consists of the land masses which sit on Australia's continental shelf. This includes mainland Australia, Tasmania, and the island of New Guinea (comprising Papua New Guinea and two Indonesian provinces).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://countrydigest.org/is-australia-a-country-or-a-continent/|title=Is Australia a Country or a Continent? - Country Digest|date=2016-09-07|work=Country Digest|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated in the geographical region of [[Oceania]], it is the smallest of the seven traditional continents in the English conception.

The continent lies on a [[continental shelf]] overlain by shallow seas which divide it into several landmasses—the [[Arafura Sea]] and [[Torres Strait]] between mainland Australia and New Guinea, and [[Bass Strait]] between mainland Australia and Tasmania. When [[sea level]]s were lower during the [[quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]], including the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] about 18,000 BC, they were connected by dry land. During the past 10,000 years, rising sea levels overflowed the lowlands and separated the continent into today's low-lying [[arid]] to [[semi-arid]] mainland and the two mountainous islands of New Guinea and Tasmania.&lt;ref name="JohnsonPage12"&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = David Peter | year = 2004 | title = The Geology of Australia | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Port Melbourne, Victoria | id = | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Australia New Guinea continent.jpg|thumb|[[Mainland Australia]] showing the continental [[Sahul Shelf]] (light blue) extending to the islands of New Guinea in the north, the island of Timor in the northwest, and Tasmania in the south]]

Archaeological terminology for this region has changed repeatedly. Before the 1970s, the single Pleistocene landmass was called ''Australasia'', derived from the [[Latin]] ''australis'', meaning "southern", although this word is most often used for a wider region that includes lands like New Zealand that are not on the same continental shelf. In the early 1970s, the term ''Greater Australia'' was introduced for the Pleistocene continent.&lt;ref name=ballard&gt;{{cite conference |first=Chris |last=Ballard |title=Stimulating minds to fantasy?

In 1984 W.

As the country of Australia is mostly on a single landmass, and comprises most of the continent, it is sometimes informally referred to as an island continent, surrounded by oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Löffler |first=Ernst |author2=A.J.

[[File:Map of Sunda and Sahul.png|thumb|250px|left|The [[Sahul Shelf|Sahul]] continent]]

Geological forces such as [[tectonic uplift]] of mountain ranges or clashes between tectonic plates occurred mainly in Australia's early history, when it was still a part of [[Gondwana]]. Australia is situated in the middle of the tectonic plate, and therefore currently has no active volcanism.&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/land-of-earthquakes-and-volcanoes.htm |title=Land of earthquakes and volcanoes? |author=Kevin Mccue |accessdate=25 April 2010 |date=26 February 2010 |publisher=[[Australian Geographic]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306150520/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/land-of-earthquakes-and-volcanoes.htm |archivedate=6 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continent primarily sits on the Indo-Australian Plate. Because of its central location on its tectonic plate Australia doesn't have any active volcanic regions, the only continent with this distinction.&lt;ref name="aeppp"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australian Environments: Place, Pattern and Process |last=Barrett |author2=Dent |year=1996 |publisher=Macmillan Education AU |isbn=0732931207 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AUcU_35C9sC |accessdate=13 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529100215/https://books.google.com/books?id=9AUcU_35C9sC |archivedate=29 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lands were joined with [[Antarctica]] as part of the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] until the plate began to drift north about 96 million years ago. For most of the time since then, Australia–New Guinea remained a continuous landmass. When the [[last glacial period]] ended in about 10,000 BC, rising sea levels formed [[Bass Strait]], separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating New Guinea, the [[Aru Islands]], and the Australian mainland.

A northern arc consisting of the [[New Guinea Highlands]], the [[Raja Ampat Islands]], and [[Halmahera]] was uplifted by the northward migration of Australia and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]]. The [[Outer Banda Arc]] was accreted along the northwestern edge the continent; it includes the islands of [[Timor]], [[Tanimbar]], and [[Seram Island|Seram]]. Papua New Guinea has [[List of volcanoes in Papua New Guinea|several volcanoes]], as it is situated along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].

Among the fungi, the remarkable association between ''[[Cyttaria]]'' ''gunnii'' (one of the "golf-ball" fungi) and its associated trees in the genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'' is evidence of that drift: the only other places where this association is known are New Zealand and southern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;Korf, R.P. ''Cyttaria'' (Cyttariales): coevolution with ''Nothofagus'', and evolutionary relationship to the Boedijnpezizeae (Pezizales, Sarcoscyphaceae). pp. 77–87 in K.A. Pirozynski &amp; J. Walker [eds] Pacific Mycogeography: a Preliminary Approach. ''Australian Journal of Botany'' Supplementary Series No. 10, 172 pp. (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to [[aridity]] and fire which include [[sclerophyll|scleromorphy]] and [[serotiny]]. These adaptations are common in species from the large and well-known families [[Proteaceae]] (''[[Banksia]]''), [[Myrtaceae]] (''[[Eucalyptus]]'' – gum trees), and [[Fabaceae]] (''[[Acacia]]'' – wattle). 

For about 40 million years Australia–New Guinea was almost completely isolated. During this time, the continent experienced numerous changes in climate, but the overall trend was towards greater aridity. When [[South America]] eventually separated from Antarctica, the development of the cold [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] changed weather patterns across the world. For Australia–New Guinea, it brought a marked intensification of the drying trend. The great inland seas and lakes dried out. Much of the long-established broad-leaf [[deciduous]] forest began to give way to the distinctive hard-leaved [[sclerophyllous]] plants that characterise the modern Australian landscape. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many [[tropical rainforest]] species with origins in Asia, together with typically Australasian flora. Typical Southern Hemisphere flora include the [[conifer]]s ''[[Podocarpus]]'' and the rainforest emergents ''[[Araucaria]]'' and ''[[Agathis]]'', as well as [[tree fern]]s and several species of ''Eucalyptus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/samples/australiaburningsample.pdf |title=Australia Burning: Fire Ecology, Policy and Management Issues |publisher=CSIRO Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many species, the primary refuge was the relatively cool and well-watered [[Great Dividing Range]]. Even today, pockets of remnant vegetation remain in the cool uplands, some species not much changed from the Gondwanan forms of 60 or 90 million years ago. Eventually, the Australia–New Guinea tectonic plate collided with the [[Eurasian plate]] to the north. The collision caused the northern part of the continent to buckle upwards, forming the high and rugged mountains of New Guinea and, by reverse (downwards) buckling, the [[Torres Strait]] that now separates the two main landmasses. The collision also pushed up the islands of [[Wallacea]], which served as island 'stepping-stones' that allowed plants from [[Southeast Asia]]'s rainforests to colonise New Guinea, and some plants from Australia–New Guinea to move into Southeast Asia. The ocean straits between the islands were narrow enough to allow plant dispersal, but served as an effective barrier to exchange of land mammals between Australia–New Guinea and Asia.

As the continent drifted north from Antarctica, a unique [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]], [[Flora (plants)|flora]] and [[Fungi|mycobiota]] developed. [[Marsupial]]s and [[monotreme]]s also existed on other continents, but only in Australia–New Guinea did they out-compete the [[Placentalia|placental]] [[mammals]] and come to dominate. New Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: monotremes, three orders of marsupials, [[rodent]]s and [[bat]]s; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has a rich diversity of [[coral]] life and 1,200 species of [[fish]] have been found. Also about 600 species of reef-building coral—the latter equal to 75 percent of the world’s known total. New Guinea has 578 species of breeding birds, of which 324 species are endemic.[[Aves|Bird]] life also flourished — in particular, the [[songbird]]s (order [[Passerine|Passeriformes]], suborder Passeri) are thought to have evolved 50 million years ago in the part of [[Gondwana]] that later became [[Australia]], New Zealand, [[New Guinea]], and [[Antarctica]], before radiating into a great number of different forms and then spreading around the globe.&lt;ref name=Low&gt;{{Citation

Animal groups such as [[Macropodidae|macropods]], [[monotremes]], and [[Cassowary|cassowaries]] are endemic to Australia. There were three main reasons for the enormous diversity that developed in animal, fungal and plant life.

* While much of the rest of the world underwent significant cooling and thus loss of species diversity, Australia–New Guinea was drifting north at such a pace that the overall global cooling effect was roughly equalled by its gradual movement toward the [[equator]]. [[Temperature]]s in Australia–New Guinea, in other words, remained reasonably constant for a very long time, and a vast number of different animal, fungal and plant species were able to evolve to fit particular [[ecological niche]]s.
* Because the continent was more isolated than any other, very few outside species arrived to colonise, and unique native forms developed unimpeded.
* Finally, despite the fact that the continent was already very old and thus relatively infertile, there are dispersed areas of high fertility. Where other continents had [[Volcanism|volcanic]] activity and/or massive [[Glacier|glaciation]] events to turn over fresh, unleached [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s rich in [[mineral]]s, the rocks and [[soil]]s of Australia–New Guinea were left largely untouched except by gradual [[erosion]] and deep [[weathering]]. In general, fertile soils produce a profusion of life, and a relatively large number of species/level of biodiversity. This is because where [[nutrient]]s are plentiful, competition is largely a matter of outcompeting rival species, leaving great scope for innovative [[co-evolution]] as is witnessed in tropical, fertile ecosystems. In contrast, infertile soils tend to induce competition on an abiotic basis meaning individuals all face constant environmental pressures, leaving less scope for divergent evolution, a process instrumental in creating new species.

Although New Guinea is the most northerly part of the continent, and could be expected to be the most [[tropical climate|tropical]] in climate, the altitude of the New Guinea highlands is such that a great many animals and plants that were once common across Australia–New Guinea now survive only in the tropical highlands where they are severely threatened by [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Australia}}
In New Guinea, the climate is mostly [[monsoonal]] (December to March), southeast monsoon (May to October), and [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest]] with slight seasonal temperature variation. In lower altitudes, the temperature is around 80 °F (27 °C) year round. But the higher altitudes, such as [[Mendi]], are constantly around 70 °F (21 °C) with cool lows nearing 52 °F (11 °C), with abundant rainfall and high humidity. The [[New Guinea Highlands]] are one of the few regions close to the [[equator]] that experience [[snowfall]], which occurs in the most elevated parts of the mainland. Some areas in the island experience an extraordinary amount of precipitation, averaging roughly {{convert|4500|mm}} of rainfall annually.

The Australian landmass's climate is mostly [[desert]] or [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], with the southern coastal corners having a [[Temperateness|temperate]] climate, such as [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] and [[humid subtropical]] climate in the east coast and [[Mediterranean climate]] in the west. The northern parts of the country have a [[tropical climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclim.html|title=BOM - Climate of Australia|first=National Climate|last=Centre|website=pandora.nla.gov.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclim.html|archivedate=2009-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Snow]] falls frequently on the [[Great Dividing Range|highlands]] near the east coast, in the states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]] and in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Temperatures in Australia have ranged from above {{convert|50|C}} to well below {{convert|0|C}}. Nonetheless, minimum temperatures are moderated. The [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] is associated with seasonal abnormality in many areas in the world. Australia is one of the continents most affected and experiences [[Drought in Australia|extensive drought]]s alongside considerable wet periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uwQ7FulHCCsC&amp;pg=PA376&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;dq=As+a+whole,+Australia+has+an+annual+average+rainfall+of+419+mm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SosQR1-8E8&amp;sig=KK7BIXo9B5NfI1xIwy6gmuQFb34&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a8CmT63jN_GViAet3fjYAw&amp;ved=0COYDEOgBMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=As%20a%20whole%2C%20Australia%20has%20an%20annual%20average%20rainfall%20of%20419%20mm&amp;f=false| title = Precipitation in Australia | work = Climates and Weather of Australia | publisher = Routledge | accessdate = 2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] came into being when the [[Constitution of Australia|Federal Constitution]] was proclaimed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Hopetoun]], on 1 January 1901. From that point a system of [[federalism in Australia]] came into operation, entailing the establishment of an entirely new national government (the Commonwealth government) and an ongoing division of powers between that government and the States. With the encouragement of Queensland, in 1884, a [[British protectorate]] had been proclaimed over the southern coast of New Guinea and its adjacent islands. [[British New Guinea]], was annexed outright in 1888. The possession was placed under the authority of the newly federated Commonwealth of Australia in 1902 and with passage of the Papua Act of 1905, British New Guinea became the Australian [[Territory of Papua]], with formal Australian administration beginning in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2797.htm |title=Papua New Guinea |publisher=State.gov |date=8 October 2010 |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between July and November 1942, Australian forces repulsed Japanese attempts on the city by way of the [[Kokoda Track campaign|Kokoda Track]], in the highlands of [[New Guinea]]. The [[Battle of Buna–Gona]], between November 1942 and January 1943, set the tone for the bitter final stages of the [[New Guinea campaign]], which persisted into 1945. The offensives in Papua and New Guinea of 1943–44 were the single largest series of connected operations ever mounted by the Australian armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/wartime/23/new-guinea-offensive/ |title=Wartime Issue 23 – New Guinea Offensive &amp;#124; Australian War Memorial |publisher=Awm.gov.au |date= |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections in 1972 resulted in the formation of a ministry headed by Chief Minister [[Michael Somare]], who pledged to lead the country to self-government and then to independence. Papua New Guinea became self-governing on 1 December 1973 and achieved independence on 16 September 1975. The country joined the [[United Nations]] (UN) on 10 October 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=S'(X%20.Q!_*!%40!-%0A |title=Thirty Years On |work=[[The Economist]] |date=25 August 2005}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration brought large numbers of southern and central Europeans to Australia for the first time. A 1958 government leaflet assured readers that unskilled non-British migrants were needed for "labour on rugged projects ...work which is not generally acceptable to Australians or British workers".&lt;ref&gt;cited in Michael Dugan and Josef Swarc (1984) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two [[world war]]s and became a long-standing [[ANZUS|ally of the United States]] when threatened by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]]. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |title=DFAT.gov.au |publisher=DFAT.gov.au |date=19 April 1984 |accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papua New Guinea is rich in natural resources, which account for two thirds of their export earnings. Though PNG is filled with resources, the lack of country's development led foreign countries to take over few sites and continued foreign demand for PNG's resources and as a result, the United States constructed an oil company and began to export in 2004 and this was the largest project in PNG's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pp.html|title=The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apecpng2018.org/|title=APECPNG2018.ORG|website=www.apecpng2018.org|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papua New Guinea is classified as a [[Developing country|developing economy]] by the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2014&amp;ey=2014&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=16&amp;pr1.y=7&amp;c=512%2C668%2C914%2C672%2C612%2C946%2C614%2C137%2C311%2C962%2C213%2C674%2C911%2C676%2C193%2C548%2C122%2C556%2C912%2C678%2C313%2C181%2C419%2C867%2C513%2C682%2C316%2C684%2C913%2C273%2C124%2C868%2C339%2C921%2C638%2C948%2C514%2C943%2C218%2C686%2C963%2C688%2C616%2C518%2C223%2C728%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C522%2C692%2C622%2C694%2C156%2C142%2C624%2C449%2C626%2C564%2C628%2C565%2C228%2C283%2C924%2C853%2C233%2C288%2C632%2C293%2C636%2C566%2C634%2C964%2C238%2C182%2C662%2C453%2C960%2C968%2C423%2C922%2C935%2C714%2C128%2C862%2C611%2C135%2C321%2C716%2C243%2C456%2C248%2C722%2C469%2C942%2C253%2C718%2C642%2C724%2C643%2C576%2C939%2C936%2C644%2C961%2C819%2C813%2C172%2C199%2C132%2C733%2C646%2C184%2C648%2C524%2C915%2C361%2C134%2C362%2C652%2C364%2C174%2C732%2C328%2C366%2C258%2C734%2C656%2C144%2C654%2C146%2C336%2C463%2C263%2C528%2C268%2C923%2C532%2C738%2C944%2C578%2C176%2C537%2C534%2C742%2C536%2C866%2C429%2C369%2C433%2C744%2C178%2C186%2C436%2C925%2C136%2C869%2C343%2C746%2C158%2C926%2C439%2C466%2C916%2C112%2C664%2C111%2C826%2C298%2C542%2C927%2C967%2C846%2C443%2C299%2C917%2C582%2C544%2C474%2C941%2C754%2C446%2C698%2C666&amp;s=PPPPC&amp;grp=0&amp;a= World Economic Outlook Database, October 2015], [http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28 International Monetary Fund].

Papua New Guinea is a [[Commonwealth realm]]. As such, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] is its sovereign and head of state. The constitutional convention, which prepared the draft constitution, and Australia, the outgoing metropolitan power, had thought that Papua New Guinea would not remain a monarchy. The founders, however, considered that imperial honours had a cachet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Sarah |title=Elizabeth: A Biography of Britain's Queen |year=1997 |publisher=Riverhead Books |isbn=1-57322-600-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monarch is represented by the [[Governor-General of Papua New Guinea]], currently [[Bob Dadae]]. Papua New Guinea (and the [[Solomon Islands]]) are unusual among Commonwealth realms in that governors-general are elected by the legislature, rather than chosen by the executive branch.

It is estimated that more than 7000 different cultural groups exist in Papua New Guinea, and most groups have their own language. Because of this diversity, in which they take pride, many different styles of cultural expression have emerged; each group has created its own expressive forms in [[art]], [[performance art]], [[weapon]]ry, [[costume]]s and [[architecture]]. Papua New Guinea is one of the few cultures in Oceania to practice the tradition of [[bride price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Papua New Guinea – culture |work=Datec Pty Ltd |url=http://www.datec.com.au/png/culture.htm |accessdate=16 December 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990210114159/http://www.datec.com.au/png/culture.htm |archivedate=10 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Papua New Guinea is world-famous for carved wooden [[sculpture]]: masks, canoes, story-boards.

[[File:Conflict minerals 961w.jpg|thumb|Four common conflict minerals, clockwise from top left: [[coltan]], [[cassiterite]], [[gold]] ore, and [[wolframite]].]]
'''Conflict resources''' are [[natural resource]]s extracted in a [[conflict zone]] and sold to perpetuate the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;p.8, Conflict and Development: Peacebuilding and Post-conflict Resolution; Sixth Report of Session 2005–06, Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: International Development Committee, The Stationery Office, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There is both statistical and anecdotal evidence that belligerent accessibility to precious commodities can prolong conflicts (a "[[Resource curse#Conflict|resource curse]]").&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Le Billon, "Fuelling War: Natural Resources and Armed Conflicts", Adelphi Paper 373, IISS &amp; Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ross,"How Do Natural Resources Influence Civil War? Evidence from Thirteen Cases", International Organization, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Fearon and David lotinakin "Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War" [[American Political Science Review]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent contemporary example has been the eastern provinces of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), where various armies, rebel groups, and outside actors have profited from mining while contributing to violence and exploitation during wars in the region.

The four most commonly mined '''conflict minerals''' (known as 3TGs, from their initials)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assentcompliance.com/conflict-minerals-consulting-services/|title=Assent Compliance|author=|date=|website=Assent Compliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[cassiterite]] (for [[tin]]), [[wolframite]] (for [[tungsten]]), [[coltan]] (for [[tantalum]]), and [[gold]] ore, which are extracted from the eastern Congo, and passed through a variety of intermediaries before being purchased. These minerals are essential in the manufacture of a variety of devices, including [[consumer electronics]] such as mobile phones, laptops, and MP3 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Elizabeth |last=Dias |date=July 24, 2009 |title=First Blood Diamonds, Now Blood Computers? |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1912594,00.html |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1B1lxV6?url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1912594%2C00.html |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extraction and sale of [[blood diamond]]s, also known as "conflict diamonds", is a better-known phenomenon which occurs under virtually identical conditions. Even [[petroleum]] can be a conflict resource; [[Oil production and smuggling in ISIL|ISIS used oil revenue]] to finance its military and terrorist activities.

International efforts to reduce trade in conflict resources, tried to reduce incentives to extract and fight over them. For example, in the United States, the 2010 [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Section 1502, known as the "Conflict Mineral Law", to be enforced by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; required manufacturers to audit their [[supply chain]]s and report use of conflict minerals.  In 2015 a US [[United States court of appeals|federal appeals court]] struck down some aspects of the reporting requirements as a violation of [[Corporate personhood|corporations’ freedom of speech]], but left others in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43639.pdf |title=Conflict Minerals and Resource Extraction: Dodd-Frank, SEC Regulations, and Legal Challenges |author=Michael V. Seitzinger |author2=Kathleen Ann Ruane |publisher=Congressional Research Service |accessdate=May 1, 2016 | date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The concept of 'conflict resource', or 'conflict [[commodity]]' emerged in the late 1990s, initially in relation to the '[[conflict diamonds]]' that were financing rebellions in Angola and [[Sierra Leone]]. (The media often called these '[[blood diamonds]]'.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/808608.stm
|title=  'Blood diamonds' crackdown deal
|publisher= BBC News |quote=''[[Peter Hain]]'': without blood diamonds, the war in Sierra Leone could not be financed... In the face of enormous suffering caused by the diamond-fuelled wars in Sierra Leone, Angola and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], we have a duty to ensure that we are doing as much as we can
|accessdate=2010-06-05 |date= 2000-06-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then 'conflict timber' financed hostilities in Cambodia and [[Liberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/press-releases/liberian-conflict-timber-faces-trade-ban

|accessdate=2010-06-05 |date= 2003-05-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conventions ===
The concept was first officially discussed by the [[UN General Assembly]] in the context of 'conflict diamonds':&lt;ref&gt;[http://mmsd1.mms.nrcan.gc.ca/kimberleyprocess/UN_Resolution_e.pdf UNGA Resolution 55/56 (2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108001135/http://mmsd1.mms.nrcan.gc.ca/kimberleyprocess/UN_resolution_e.pdf |date=2006-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UN Security Council]] has since referred to conflict resources in several resolutions.{{which|date=May 2016}}

[[Global Witness]] has called for an international standardized definition to facilitate a more systematic application of UN resolutions, the prevention of complicity in abuses during hostilities by commercial entities exploiting or trading in conflict resources, and the prosecution of [[war profiteer]]s suspected of supporting or abetting war criminals.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071010161842/http://www.humansecuritybulletin.info/page434.htm]"
{{quote |text= ''...natural resources whose systematic exploitation and trade in a context of conflict contribute to, benefit from or result in the commission of serious violations of human rights, violations of international humanitarian law or violations amounting to crimes under international law.'' |sign= Global Witness |source= proposed '''Definition of conflict resources'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/pages/en/definition_of_conflict_resources.html |title=definition of conflict resources – natural resources in conflict – global witness |publisher=www.globalwitness.org |accessdate=2010-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602192048/http://www.globalwitness.org/pages/en/definition_of_conflict_resources.html |archivedate=June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Since 1996 the [[Bonn International Center for Conversion]] has tracked ''resource governance'' and ''conflict intensity'' by country.&lt;ref&gt;Accessible through
{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from [[fossil fuel]]s, metals, diamonds, and timber it tracks the [[governance]] of other [[Raw material|primary goods]] that might fund conflicts, including: [[poppy seed]]s and [[talc]] (Afghanistan), [[rubber]] (Côte d'Ivoire), [[cotton]] (Zambia), and [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] (Indonesia).

== Conflict minerals ==

The four most prominent conflict minerals, for example codified in the U.S. Conflict Minerals Law, are:

*'''Columbite-tantalite''' (or ''[[coltan]]'', the colloquial African term) is the metal ore from which the element [[tantalum]] is extracted.  Tantalum is used primarily for the production of [[tantalum capacitor]]s, particularly for applications requiring high performance, a small compact format and high reliability, from [[hearing aid]]s and [[pacemaker]]s, to [[airbag]]s, [[GPS]], ignition systems and anti-lock braking systems in automobiles, through to laptop computers, mobile phones, video game consoles, video cameras and digital cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tantalum – Raw Materials and Processing |url=http://tanb.org/tantalum |publisher=Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1BooEpq?url=http://tanb.org/tantalum |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its carbide form, tantalum possesses significant hardness and wear resistance properties. As a result, it is used in jet engine/turbine blades, drill bits, end mills and other tools.
*'''Cassiterite''' is the chief ore needed to produce [[tin]], essential for the production of tin cans and the [[solder]] on the circuit boards of electronic equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tin |url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/phototin.html |publisher=Mineral Information Institute |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1C3xwLJ?url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/phototin.html |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tin is also commonly a component of biocides, fungicides and as tetrabutyl tin/tetraoctyl tin, an intermediate in [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) and high performance paint manufacturing.
*'''[[Wolframite]]''' is an important source of the element [[tungsten]]. Tungsten is a very dense metal and is frequently used for this property, such as in fishing weights, dart tips and golf club heads. Like [[tantalum carbide]], [[tungsten carbide]] possesses hardness and wear resistance properties and is frequently used in applications like metalworking tools, drill bits and milling. Smaller amounts are used to substitute lead in "green ammunition".&lt;ref name="production"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tungsten |first=Kim B. |last=Shedd |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tungsten/680400.pdf |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |year=2000 |accessdate=June 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1CK1wyQ?url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tungsten/680400.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minimal amounts are used in electronic devices, including the vibration mechanism of cell phones.
*'''Gold''' is used in jewelry, electronics, and dental products. It is also present in some chemical compounds used in certain semiconductor manufacturing processes.

These are sometimes referred to as "''the 3T's and gold''", ''3TG'', or even simply the "''3T's''".  Under the US Conflict Minerals Law, additional minerals may be added to this list in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010-26.htm |title=Remarks on not adding niobium to the list |publisher=Sec.gov |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed conflict and mineral resource looting by the [[Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese National Army]] and various armed rebel groups, including the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR) and the [[National Congress for the Defense of the People]] (CNDP), a proxy Rwandan militia group, has occurred throughout the late 20th century and the early 21st century. Additionally, the looting of the Congo's natural resources is not limited to domestic actors. During the Congo Wars ([[First Congo War]] (1996–1997) and [[Second Congo War]] (1998–2003)), Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi particularly profited from the Congo's resources. These governments continued to smuggle resources out of the Congo to this day.{{Citation needed|reason=likely true, but a serious charge that requires proof|date=May 2016}}

The profits from the sale of these minerals have financed fighting in the Second Congo War and ongoing follow-on conflicts. Control of lucrative mines has also itself become a military objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Witness Report: 'Faced with a gun, what can you do?' |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/report_en_final_0.pdf |publisher=[[Global Witness]] |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1AhKWsY?url=http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/report_en_final_0.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mines ===
Mines, in eastern Congo, are often located far from populated areas in remote and dangerous regions. A recent study by International Peace Information Service (IPIS) indicates that armed groups are present at more than 50% of mining sites. At many sites, armed groups illegally tax, extort, and coerce civilians to work.  Miners, including children, work up to 48-hour shifts amidst mudslides and tunnel collapses that kill many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Congo's Riches, Looted by Renegade Troops |first = Lydia |last = Polgreen |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/world/africa/16congo.html?&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |publisher = [[The New York Times Company]] |date = November 15, 2008 |accessdate = December 16, 2010 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5v1BQBTW8?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/world/africa/16congo.html?_r=1&amp;&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate = December 16, 2010 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups are often affiliated with rebel groups, or with the Congolese National Army, but both use rape and violence to control the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape Crisis in East Congo Tied to Mining Activity |first=Dominique |last=Soguel |url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/090601/rape-crisis-in-east-congo-tied-mining-activity |work=[[Women's eNews]] |date=June 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1Bd15JZ?url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/090601/rape-crisis-in-east-congo-tied-mining-activity |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States law ==
In April 2009, Senator [[Sam Brownback]] (R-KS) introduced the Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009 (S. 891)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/senate-bill/891|title=S.891 - 111th Congress (2009-2010): Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009|first=Brownback,|last=Sam|date=23 April 2009|website=www.congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; to require electronics companies to verify and disclose their sources of cassiterite, wolframite, and tantalum. This legislation died in committee. However, Brownback added similar language as Section 1502 of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], which passed Congress and was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on July 21, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.steptoe.com/publications-7050.html New Corporate Social Responsibility Mandate Related to Conflict Materials in the New Financial Reform Bill Could Affect Many Companies]" (July 20, 2010). Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) draft regulations to implement the Conflict Mineral Law, published in the [[Federal Register]] of December 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80948 – 80975&lt;/ref&gt; would have required U.S. and certain foreign companies to report and make public their use of so-called "conflict minerals" from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries in their products. Comments on this proposal were extended until March 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2011/34-63793.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The comments on the proposal were reviewable by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010.shtml |title=Comments on File No. s7-40-10 |publisher=Sec.gov |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One report on the proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com/2011/03/25/sec-provides-preview-of-april-15-final-rules-on-conflict-minerals-supply-chain-traceability/ |title=SEC Provides Preview of April 15 Final Rules on Conflict Minerals Supply Chain Traceability &amp;#124; Your EHS Connection |publisher=Elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com |date=March 25, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated the following statistics for the submitted comments:
* Slightly more than 700 comment letters were submitted to SEC on the proposal;
* Approximately 65% of those were form letters or basic letters from the general public supporting the rule's intent;
* The remaining 35% (roughly 270) represent views of businesses, trade/industry associations, the investment/financial community, professional auditing firms, and other relevant governmental entities; and
* Of those 270 comments, an estimated 200 contained substantive and/or technical comments.
That report also contained what it calls a "preview of the final SEC regulations" synthesized from their detailed research and analysis of a large body of documents, reports and other information on the law, proposed regulation and the current budget/political setting facing the SEC in the current administration.

The final rule went into effect 13 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67716.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC rule did not go unnoticed by the international community, including entities seeking to undermine traceability efforts.  A report published by a metals trading publication illustrated one DRC ore/mineral flow method that has apparently been devised to thwart detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agmetalminer.com/2011/02/24/loophole-in-conflict-minerals-law-creates-opportunity-for-scrap-dealers/ |title=Loophole in Conflict Minerals Law Creates Opportunity for Scrap Dealers |publisher=Agmetalminer.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2011, the US State Department issued a statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/e/eeb/diamonds/docs/168632.htm |title=Statement Concerning Implementation of Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Legislation Concerning Conflict Minerals Due Diligence |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject.  Section 1502(c) of the Law mandates that the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] work in conjunction with SEC on certain elements of conflict minerals policy development and support.

On October 23, 2012 U.S. State Dept Officials asserted that ultimately, it falls on the U.S. State Dept. to determine when this rule would no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Dept of State &amp; Intelleges Webinar |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8H947wuCNI|publisher=Intelleges|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down several parts of the SEC Rules as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/14/us-court-sec-conflictminerals-idUSBREA3D13U20140414|title=U.S. appeals court finds conflict-minerals rule violates free speech|first=Sarah N.|last=Lynch|date=|website=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditing and reporting requirements ===
US Conflict Minerals Law contains two requirements that are closely connected: 
*independent third party supply chain traceability audits
* reporting of audit information to the public and SEC.

Even companies not directly regulated by the SEC will be impacted by the audit requirements because they will be pushed down through entire supply chains, including privately held and foreign-owned companies.

SEC estimated that 1,199 "issuers" (i.e., companies subject to filing other SEC reports) will be required to submit full conflict mineral reports.  This estimate was developed by finding the amount of tantalum produced by the DRC in comparison to global production (15% – 20%).  The Commission selected the higher figure of 20% and multiplied that by 6,000 (the total number of "issuers" SEC will be required to do initial product/process evaluations).&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg 80966&lt;/ref&gt;  This estimate does not account for the companies who supply materials to the "issuers" (but are not themselves SEC-regulated) but who will almost certainly be required to conduct conflict minerals audits to meet the demands of those customers.  Other estimates indicate that the total number of US companies likely impacted may exceed 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agmetalminer.com/2011/02/25/conflict-minerals-law-supply-chain-due-diligence-and-impact-on-metal-buying-organizations-part-three/ |title=Conflict Minerals Law, Supply Chain Due Diligence and Impact on Metal Buying Organizations – Part Three |publisher=Agmetalminer.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the potential impact of the regulation in early 2011 by the ''[[IPC (electronics)|IPC – Association Connecting Electronic Industries]]'' trade association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipc.org/ |title=Association Connecting Electronics Industries |publisher=IPC |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was submitted with the association's comments to the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipc.org/3.0_Industry/3.3_Gov_Relations/2011/IPC-SEC-NPRM-Comments-030311.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The study states that the IPC survey respondents had a median of 163 direct suppliers.  Applying that number to the SEC's estimated number of impacted issuers results in the possibility of over 195,000 businesses that could be subject to some level of supply chain traceability effort.

==== Applicability in general ====
Under the law, companies have to submit an annual conflict minerals report to the SEC if: 
*(a) they are required to file reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act of 1934 
*(b) conflict minerals are ''necessary to the functionality or production of a product that they manufacture or contract to be manufactured.'' That statement contains two separate – but critical concepts: the purpose of the conflict mineral in the product/process, and the control that the company exerts over the manufacturing process/specifications.

A company would be deemed to contract an item to be manufactured if it:
*Exerts any influence over the manufacturing process; or,
*Offers a generic product under its own brand name or a separate brand name (regardless of whether the company has any influence over the manufacturing process) and the company contracted to have the product manufactured specifically for itself.

This language implied that some retailers who are not manufacturers might be subject to the audit and disclosure requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sandler, Travis  |author2=Rosenberg, P.A. |title=Client Advisory: Retailers May Be Subject to Proposed SEC Conflict Mineral Reporting Requirements |date=December 23, 2010 |accessdate=May 1, 2016|url=http://www.strtrade.com/advisory.aspx?id=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Contracting to manufacture" a product requires some actual influence over the manufacturing of process that product, a determination based on facts and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEC Adopts Rule for Disclosing Use of Conflict Minerals|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2012/2012-163.htm|publisher=SEC|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A company is not to be deemed to have influence over the manufacturing process if it merely:
* Affixes its brand, marks, logo, or label to a generic product manufactured by a third party.
* Services, maintains, or repairs a product manufactured by a third party.
* Specifies or negotiates contractual terms with a manufacturer that do not directly relate to the manufacturing of the product.

The proposed regulations attempted to clarify that tools used in assembly and manufacturing will not trigger the law.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80953&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent was to cover minerals/metals in the final product only. Nothing specifically addresses intermediate chemical processes that use chemicals that contain conflict minerals.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, some electronic components use chemical solutions containing gold at some point in the manufacturing processes.  Tin is used during the chemical processes for manufacturing PVC and certain high performance paints/coatings.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, neither the law nor the proposed regulation established a [[de minimis]] quantity or other form of materiality threshold that would preclude the applicability of the auditing/reporting requirements.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80963&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Supply chain traceability auditing ====

The law mandates the use of an "independent private sector auditor" to conduct the audits. SEC has proposed two different standards for the audits: the "reasonable inquiry" and the "[[due diligence]]".&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80956&lt;/ref&gt;  Should the final rule include this structure, the reasonable inquiry would be the first step to determine if the company can on its own, using reasonable efforts and trustworthy information, make a reliable determination as to the source/origin of its tin, tantalum, tungsten and/or gold.  Where companies are unable to make such a determination for any reason, they would then be required to take the next step of the "due diligence", which is the independent private sector audit.

The statute specified that the audits be "conducted in accordance with standards established by the [[Comptroller General of the United States]], in accordance with rules promulgated by the Commission." This means that the same auditing standards that apply to other SEC auditing requirements will apply to conflict minerals audits &lt;ref name="Section 1502b"&gt;Section 1502(b).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this language, SEC will have little discretion to allow companies to issue self-generated statements or certifications to satisfy the law.

Third party audits for conflict minerals supply chain traceability began in summer 2010 under the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), a US-based electronics manufacturing trade association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eicc.info/PDF/PR%20Extractives%20Smelter%20Audit%20Launch%20FINAL.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102203237/http://www.eicc.info/PDF/PR%20Extractives%20Smelter%20Audit%20Launch%20FINAL.pdf |date=November 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this program, EICC selected three audit firms to conduct the actual audits, with two of the three participating in the pilot audits in 2010. After concluding the pilot, one of the two firms involved in 2010 withdrew from the program specifically in response to the SEC's proposal and to reduce potential legal risks to the audited entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdcexec.com/web/online/Global-Focus-News/Conflict-Minerals-Sustainability-and-Audit-Services-to-Align-with-US-SEC-Audit-Standards/50$13230 |title=Find It: |publisher=Sdcexec.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the law nor the proposed regulations provide guidance on what will be considered an acceptable audit scope or process, preferring to allow companies the flexibility meeting the requirement in a manner that is responsive to their own individual business and supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80957&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the law contains a provision that preserves the government's rights to deem any report, audit or other due diligence processes as being unreliable, and in such cases, the report shall not satisfy the requirements of the regulations,&lt;ref&gt;Section 1502(b)&lt;/ref&gt; further emphasizing the need for such audits to conform to established SEC auditing standards. Comments on the proposed regulation pointed out that, should SEC not specify an applicable audit standard, it cannot also be silent or ambiguous on the auditor standards as well, or the Commission will violate the plain language of the Law mandating "standards established by the Comptroller General of the United States".&lt;ref name="sec.gov"&gt;See numerous comments filed at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally expected that SEC will provide specificity on both the audit standard and the auditor standard.  SEC's proposal attempted to clarify its position on auditor requirements.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80958&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/home/0,3675,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |doi=10.1787/factbook-2010-en |publisher=Oecd.org |date=November 3, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; published its Guidance on conflict minerals supply chain traceability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/36/0,3746,en_2649_34889_44307940_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas |publisher=Oecd.org |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This guidance is gaining much momentum as "the" standard within US policy.  However, a recent critical analysis of the standard in comparison to existing US auditing standards under SEC highlighted a number of significant inconsistencies and conflict with relevant US standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/oecd-to-sec-make-us-the-conflict-minerals-due-diligenceaudit-standard-for-the-us/ |title=OECD to SEC: Make us the Conflict Minerals Due Diligence/Audit Standard for the US &amp;#124; Your EHS Connection |publisher=Elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Companies subject to the US law who implement the OECD Guidance without regard for the SEC auditing standards may face legal compliance risks.

==== Reporting and disclosure ====
Companies subject to the SEC reporting requirement would be required to disclose whether the minerals used in their products originated in the DRC or adjoining countries (as defined above). The law mandates that this reporting be submitted/made available annually. Many comments to the proposed regulation asked SEC to clarify whether the report must be "furnished"—meaning it is made available to SEC but not directly incorporated within the company's formal financial report—or "submitted"—meaning the report is directly incorporated into the financial report.&lt;ref name="sec.gov" /&gt;  At first glance, this may appear to be a minor point; however, this difference is very important in determining the audit/auditor standards and related liabilities.

If it is determined that none of the minerals originated in the DRC or adjoining countries, the report must include a statement to that effect and provide an explanation of the country of origin analysis that was used to arrive at the ultimate conclusion. On the other hand, if conflict minerals originating in the DRC or adjoining countries were used (or if it is not possible to determine the country of origin of the conflict minerals used), companies would be required to state as such in the annual report. In either case, companies would also be required to make this information public by posting their annual conflict minerals report on their websites, and providing the SEC with the internet addresses where the reports may be found. Further, the proposed regulations would require companies to maintain records relating to the country of origin of conflict minerals used in their products.

Media outlets have reported that many companies required to file Specialized Disclosure Reports to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and any necessary conflict minerals reports for 2013 under the SEC’s conflict minerals rule are struggling to meet the June 2, 2014 report filing deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hills|first=Mark E.|title=Deadline Looms for Conflict Mineral Disclosure Requirements: Update for Suppliers of Reporting Companies|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/deadline-looms-conflict-mineral-disclosure-requirements-update-suppliers-reporting-c|accessdate=18 May 2014|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=16 May 2014|author2=Jacob A.

=== Criticism of the law ===
The law has been criticised for not addressing the root causes of the conflict, leaving to the Congolese government the responsibility for providing an environment in which companies can practice due diligence and legitimately purchase the minerals they need, when the reality is that mechanisms for transparency do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.undispatch.com/digging-deeper-into-the-dodd-frank-congo-blood-minerals-controversy | accessdate=Oct 17, 2011 | title=Digging Deeper Into the Dodd-Frank Congo ‘Blood Minerals’ Controversy | date=Aug 9, 2011 | work=UN Dispatch }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect has been to halt legitimate mining ventures that provided livelihoods for people, reducing the Congo's legal exports of tantalum by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/a-rule-aimed-at-warlords-upends-african-mines-08042011.html | accessdate=Oct 17, 2011 | title=A Rule Aimed at Warlords Upends African Mines | date=Aug 4, 2011 | work=Bloomberg Businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) found that most companies were unable to determine the source of their conflict minerals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/672051.pdf ''SEC CONFLICT MINERALS RULE: Initial Disclosures Indicate Most Companies Were Unable to Determine the Source of Their Conflict Minerals''], GAO-15-561: Published: Aug 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology manufacturers criticized a law which required them to label a product as not "DRC Conflict Free" as [[Government speech|compelled speech]], and in violation of the [[First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/D3B5DAF947A03F2785257CBA0053AEF8/$file/13-5252-1488184.pdf| accessdate=Nov 19, 2014 | title=National Association of Manufacturers v.

== Proposed law in Europe ==
The European Parliament passed legislation in 2015; negotiations are currently underway among member states as to specific wording details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20150513IPR55318/Conflict-minerals-MEPs-ask-for-mandatory-certification-of-EU-importers |title=Conflict minerals: MEPs ask for mandatory certification of EU importers |date=May 20, 2015 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |author=European Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 2016 the European Parliament confirmed that "mandatory due diligence" would be required for "all but the smallest EU firms importing tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold and their ores".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160615IPR32320/Conflict-minerals-MEPs-secure-mandatory-due-diligence-for-importers Conflict minerals: MEPs secure mandatory due diligence for importers], Press Release issued 16 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2017 the EU passed Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the Parliament and of the Council on the supply chain due diligence obligations for importers of tin, tantalum, tungsten, their ores, and gold from conflict-affected and high risk areas. The regulation will take effect in January 2021, and will directly apply to companies that import 3TG metals into the EU, no matter where they originate.&lt;ref&gt;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=CELEX:32017R0821&amp;qid=1542740800246 Content is copied from this source, which is (c) European Union, 1995-2018.

== Conflict resources in supply chains ==
Increases in business process outsourcing to globally dispersed production facilities means that social problems and human rights violations are no longer only an organization matter, but also often occur in companies’ supply chains, and challenge for supply chain managers.&lt;ref name="SCDD"&gt;Hannes Hofmann, Martin C. Schleper, Constantin Blome: ''Conflict Minerals and Supply Chain Due Diligence: An Exploratory Study of Multitier Supply Chains.'' In: ''Journal of Business Ethics.'' DOI 10.1007/s10551-015-2963-z&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the harm conflict minerals do where they are produced, human rights violations also raise an enormous risk to corporate reputations. Consumers, mass media and employees expect companies to behave responsibly and have become intolerant of those who don't.

Consequently, firms that are located downstream in the supply chain and that are more visible to stakeholders are particularly threatened by social supply chain problems. The recent debate concerning conflict minerals illustrates the importance of social and human rights issues in supply chain management practice as well as the emerging need to react to social conflicts. Conflict minerals are processed in many different components throughout various industries and hence have a high overall impact on business.
 
Initiatives like the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] or the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas&lt;ref name ="OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/GuidanceEdition2.pdf OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas]&lt;/ref&gt; demand that supply chain managers verify purchased goods as ‘‘conflict-free’’ or implement measures to better manage any inability to do so.

Minerals mined in Eastern Congo pass through the hands of numerous middlemen as they are shipped out of Congo, through neighboring countries such as [[Rwanda]] or [[Burundi]], to East Asian processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DR-CONGO: Firms Fuelling 'Conflict Minerals' Violence, Report Says |first=Marina |last=Litvinsky |url=http://www.ips.org/africa/2009/07/dr-congo-firms-fuelling-conflict-minerals-violence-report-says/ |agency=[[Inter Press Service]] |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1CoG37B?url=http://www.ips.org/africa/2009/07/dr-congo-firms-fuelling-conflict-minerals-violence-report-says/ |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, the US Conflict Minerals Law applies to materials originating (or claimed to originate) from the DRC as well as the nine adjoining countries: [[Angola]], [[Burundi]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Congo Republic]], [[Rwanda]], [[South Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zambia]].

Firms have begun to apply governance mechanisms to avoid adverse effects of conflict mineral sourcing. However, the mere transfer of responsibilities upstream in the supply chain apparently will not stop the trade with conflict minerals, notably due to two reasons: 
*On the one hand, globalization has created governance gaps in a sense that companies are able to abuse human rights without being sanctioned by independent third parties. This gap results in a non-allocation of responsibility that makes the problem of human rights abuses and social conflicts within dispersed supply chains very likely to endure, particularly without collaborative approaches to remedy these deficiencies. 
*On the other hand, conflict minerals usually originate from globally diverse deposits and are difficult to track within components and manufactured products. This is the case because they are mixed with minerals of different origin and added to metal alloys.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt; Consequently, although the share of these minerals in single end products may be negligible, they are prevalent in numerous products and commodities. Together, these circumstances leave downstream firms nearly incapable of detecting risks associated with conflict minerals. Hence, the topic of conflict minerals becomes one of supply chain management rather than of individual companies’ legal or compliance divisions alone. What is needed is effective and supply-chain wide-mechanisms of traceability and due diligence that allow firms to take individual and collective responsibility as parts of supply chains.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt;

In the context of mineral supply chains, due diligence represents a holistic concept that aims at providing a chain of custody tracking from mine to export at country level, regional tracking of mineral flows through the creation of a database on their purchases, independent audits on all actors in the supply chain, and a monitoring of the whole mineral chain by a mineral chain auditor. In this sense, due diligence transcends conventional risk management approaches that usually focus on the prevention of direct impacts on the core business activities of companies. Moreover, due diligence focuses on a maximum of transparency as an end itself while risk management is always directed towards the end of averting direct damages. However, besides the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] and the OECD Guidance, there is still a gap in due diligence practices as international norms are just emerging. Studies found that the motivation for supply chain due diligence as well as expected outcomes of these processes vary among firms.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt; Furthermore, different barriers, drivers, and implementation patterns of supply chain due diligence have been identified in scholarly research.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt;

Moreover, [[FairPhone]] Foundation raises awareness of conflict minerals in the mobile industry and is a company which tries to produce a smart phone with 'fair' conditions along the supply chain. Various industry and trade associations are also monitoring developments in conflict minerals laws and traceability frameworks.  Some of these represent electronics, retailers, jewelry, mining, electronics components, and general manufacturing sectors.  One organization – ITRI (a UK-based international non-profit organization  representing the tin industry and sponsored/supported by its members, principally miners and smelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itri.co.uk/bfora/systems/xmlviewer/default.asp?arg=DS_ITRI_ABOUTART_16/_firsttitle.xsl/4 |title=Tin Markets, Technology and Sustainability |publisher=ITRI |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) had spearheaded efforts for the development and implementation of a "bag and tag" scheme at the mine as a key element of credible traceability.&lt;ref&gt;An overview and timeline of ITRI's activities on conflict minerals can be seen here – {{cite web |url=http://www.itri.co.uk/POOLED/ARTICLES/BF_PARTART/VIEW.ASP?Q=BF_PARTART_310250 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206154403/http://www.itri.co.uk/POOLED/ARTICLES/BF_PARTART/VIEW.ASP?Q=BF_PARTART_310250 |archivedate=2010-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program and related efforts were initially not likely to extend beyond the pilot phase due to a variety of implementation and funding problems that occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itri.co.uk/pooled/articles/BF_NEWSART/view.asp?Q=BF_NEWSART_322557 |title=Tin Markets, Technology and Sustainability |publisher=ITRI |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end however, the device did enter the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairphone.com/#roadmap|title=Fairphone|author=|date=|website=Fairphone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 2011, the UK government launched an informational section on its Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office website dedicated to conflict minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foreign Office launches conflict minerals information for businesses |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=575312582 |date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929120441/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=575312582 |archivedate=September 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information resource is intended to assist British companies in understanding the issues and, specifically, the US requirements.

On Jan 6th 2014, the semiconductor giant Intel announced that it would distance itself from conflict minerals. As a result, all Intel microprocessors henceforth will be conflict-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartz|first=Ariel|title=Starting Now, All Intel Microprocessors Are Conflict-Free: Here's How The Company Did It|url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/3024292/starting-now-all-intel-microprocessors-are-conflict-free-heres-how-the-company-did-it|work=Co.Exist|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial reporting solutions ==

Manufacturers and supply chain partners needing to comply with the ever-increasing reporting regulations have a few commercial options available.

A major research report from November 2012 by the Southern Africa Resource Watch revealed that gold miners in the east of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] were being exploited by corrupt government officials, bureaucrats and security personnel, who all demand illegal tax, fees and levies from the miners without delivering any services in return. Despite the alleged gold rush in regions of the country, none of the population and workforce is benefiting from this highly lucrative industry.&lt;ref name="ALL" /&gt;

In [[biogeography]], a [[taxon]] is said to have a '''cosmopolitan distribution''' if its [[range (biology)|range]] extends across all or most of the world in appropriate [[habitat]]s. Such a taxon is said to exhibit cosmopolitanism or cosmopolitism. The opposite extreme is [[endemism]].

==Related terms and concepts==
The term '''pandemism''' also is in use, but not all authors are consistent in the sense in which they use the term; some speak of pandemism mainly in referring to diseases and [[pandemic]]s, and some as a term intermediate between endemism and cosmopolitanism, in effect regarding pandemism as '''subcosmopolitanism'''. This means near cosmopolitanism, but with major gaps in the [[species distribution|distribution]], say, complete absence from Australia.&lt;ref name="Simpson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael G.

==Aspects and degrees==
The term "cosmopolitan distribution" usually should not be taken literally, because it often is applied loosely in various contexts. Commonly the intention is not to include polar regions, extreme altitudes, oceans, deserts, or small, isolated islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ecology and Environmental Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKTeiqPBpM4C&amp;pg=PA164|date=15 July 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-1324-6|pages=164–}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[housefly]] is nearly as cosmopolitan as any animal species, but it is neither oceanic nor polar in its distribution.&lt;ref name="RussellOtranto2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard C.

Wall|title=The Encyclopedia of Medical and Veterinary Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9QfhF_wQSV4C&amp;pg=PA157|year=2013|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-78064-037-2|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the term "cosmopolitan weed" implies no more than that the plant in question occurs on all continents except [[Antarctica]]; it is not meant to suggest that the species is present in all regions of every continent.

==Oceanic and terrestrial==
Another concept in [[biogeography]] is that of [[Oceanography|oceanic]] cosmopolitanism and endemism. Although there is a temptation to regard the [[World Ocean]] as a medium without biological boundaries, this is far from reality; many physical and biological barriers interfere with either the spread or continued residence of many species. For example, temperature gradients prevent free migration of tropical species between the Atlantic and Indian-plus-Pacific oceans, even though there is open passage past continental masses such as the Americas and Africa/Eurasia. Again, as far as many species are concerned, the [[Southern Ocean]] and the Northern marine regions are completely isolated from each other by the intolerable temperatures of the tropical regions. In the light of such considerations, it is no surprise to find that endemism and cosmopolitanism are quite as marked in the oceans as on land.

==Ecological delimitation==
Another aspect of cosmopolitanism is that of ecological limitations. A species that is apparently cosmopolitan because it occurs in all oceans might in fact occupy only [[littoral zone|littoral zones]], or only particular ranges of depths, or only [[Estuary|estuaries]], for example. Analogously, [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] species might be present only in forests, or mountainous regions, or sandy [[arid]] regions or the like. Such distributions might be patchy, or extended, but narrow. Factors of such a nature are taken widely for granted, so they seldom are mentioned explicitly in mentioning cosmopolitan distributions.

==Regional and temporal variation in populations==
Cosmopolitanism of a particular species or variety should not be confused with cosmopolitanism of higher taxa.  For example, the family [[Antlion|Myrmeleontidae]] is cosmopolitan in the sense that every continent except Antarctica is home to some indigenous species within the Myrmeleontidae, but nonetheless no one species, nor even genus, of the Myrmeleontidae is cosmopolitan. Conversely, partly as a result of human introduction of unnatural [[Beekeeping|apiculture]] to the New World, ''[[western honey bee|Apis mellifera]]'' probably is the only cosmopolitan member of its family; the rest of the family [[Apidae]] have modest distributions.

Even where a cosmopolitan population is recognised as a single species, such as indeed ''Apis mellifera'', there generally will be variation between regional sub-populations. Such variation commonly is at the level of [[subspecies]], [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] or [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]], whereas some variation is too slight or inconsistent for formal recognition.

For an example of subspecific variation, consider the so-called "[[Africanized bee|African killer bee]]", which is the subspecies ''[[African bee|Apis mellifera scutellata]]'', and the [[African bee|Cape bee]], which is the subspecies ''[[African bee|Apis mellifera capensis]]''; both of them are in the same cosmopolitan species ''Apis mellifera'', but their ranges barely overlap.

Other cosmopolitan species, such as the [[osprey]] and [[house sparrow]], present similar examples, but in yet other species there are less familiar complications: some migratory birds such as the [[Arctic tern]] occur from the Arctic to the [[Southern Ocean]], but at any one season of the year they are likely to be largely in passage or concentrated at only one end of the range. Also, some such species breed only at one end of the range. Seen purely as an aspect of cosmopolitanism, such distributions could be seen as temporal, seasonal variations.

Other complications of cosmopolitanism on a planet too large for local populations to interbreed routinely with each other, lead to genetic effects such as [[ring species]], for example in the ''[[Larus]]'' gulls.&lt;ref name="Kunz2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Werner Kunz|title=Do Species Exist: Principles of Taxonomic Classification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQxwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT211|date=2 August 2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-3-527-66426-9|pages=211–}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also lead to the formation of [[Cline (biology)|clines]] such as in [[Drosophila]].&lt;ref name="KrimbasPowell1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Costas B. Krimbas|author2=Jeffrey R. Powell|title=Drosophila Inversion Polymorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PLSPhg3KPGgC&amp;pg=PA23|date=21 August 1992|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-6547-8|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient and modern==

Cosmopolitan distributions can be observed both in extinct and extant species. For example, ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'' was cosmopolitan in the Early Triassic after a mass extinction.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759.full.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M.

In the modern world, the [[killer whale]] has a cosmopolitan distribution, extending over most of the Earth's [[ocean]]s. The wasp ''[[Copidosoma floridanum]]'' is another example, as it is found around the world. Other examples include [[human]]s, [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, [[orchid]]s, the foliose [[lichen]] ''[[Parmelia sulcata]]'', and the [[Mollusca|mollusc]] genus ''[[Mytilus (bivalve)|Mytilus]]''.&lt;ref name="Spellerberg"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Ian F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15189">'''Democratic globalisation''' is a [[social movement]] towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]].  This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate [[oligopolies]], ideological [[Non-governmental organisation|NGO]]s, cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]].  In the last decade he published a dozen books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire world. For some, '''democratic [[mundialisation]]''' is a variant of democratic globalisation stressing the need for the direct election of world leaders and members of global institutions by citizens worldwide; for others, it is just another name for democratic globalisation.

These proponents state that democratic globalisation's purpose is to:
* Expand [[globalisation]] and make people closer and more united. This expansion should differ from economic globalization and "make people closer, more united and protected"; because of a variety of opinions and proposals it is still unclear what this would mean in practice and how it could be realized.
* Have it reach all fields of activity and knowledge, including governmental and economic, since the economic one is crucial to develop the well-being of world citizens; and
* Give [[world citizen]]s democratic access and a say in those global activities. For example, presidential voting for [[United Nations Secretary-General]] by citizens and [[direct election]] of members of a [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]].

Supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions.
Some proponents in the "anti-globalization movement" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies, and suggests a form of "world government."

== Background ==
Democratic globalization supports the extension of political democratization to economic and [[Global financial system|financial globalization]]. It is based upon an idea that free international transactions benefit the global society as a whole. They believe in financially
open economies, where the government and [[central bank]] must be transparent in order to retain the confidence of the markets, since transparency spells doom for [[autocratic regime]]s. They promote democracy that makes leaders more accountable to the citizenry through the removal of restrictions on such transactions.

== Social movements ==
The democratic globalization movement started to get public attention when New York Times reported its demonstration to contest a [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in Seattle, Washington, November 1999. This gathering was to criticize unfair trade and undemocratic globalization of the WTO, [[World Bank]], [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF), the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Its primary tactics were public rallies, street theater and [[civil disobedience]].

Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing [[international organization]]s (which are currently [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by world citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.

===Global democracy===
Thus, it supports the [[International Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, direct election of United Nations (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide.

==Difference to anti-globalization==
Some supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters although, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two camps.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions and direct vote for world presidents (see [[presidentialism]]).

Some supporters of the "[[anti-globalization movement]]" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies by citizens, and suggests a form of "[[federal world government]]".

==Procedure==
Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic [[global institution]]s and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by voting by the citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged [[democratic world government]].

They propose the creation of world services for citizens, like world [[civil protection]] and [[hazard prevention|prevention]] (from [[natural hazard]]s) services.

==Proponents==
The concept of democratic globalization has supporters from all fields. Many of the campaigns and initiatives for global democracy, such as the UNPA campaign, list quotes by and names of their supporters on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/quotes/index.php Quotes]" and "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php list of featured supporters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903154706/http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php |date=2010-09-03 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academics===
Some of the most prolific proponents are the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]] and the Italian political theorist [[Daniele Archibugi]].  In the last decade they published several books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire planet. [[Richard Falk]] has developed the idea from an international law perspective, [[Ulrich Beck]] from a sociological approach and [[Jürgen Habermas]] has elaborate the normative principles.

===Politicians===
*In 2003 Bob Brown, the leader of the Australian Green Party, has tabled a move for global democracy in the Australian Senate: "I move: That the Senate supports global democracy based on the principle of `one person, one vote, one value'; and supports the vision of a global parliament which empowers all the world's people equally to decide on matters of international significance."&lt;ref&gt;
The Senate of Australia "[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F2003-06-16%2F0073%22 GLOBAL DEMOCRACY AND GLOBAL PARLIAMENT]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The current President of Bolivia [[Evo Morales]] and the Bolivian UN Ambassador [[Pablo Solón Romero]] have demanded a democratisation of the UN on many occasions. For example, Evo Morales at the United Nations, May 7, 2010: “The response to global warming is global democracy for life and for the Mother Earth.. … we have two paths: to save capitalism, or to save life and Mother Earth.”&lt;ref&gt;
Evo Morales "[http://climateandcapitalism.com/2010/05/11/2438/ United, the developing countries can save the world]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Graham Watson]] (Former member of the European Parliament and former leader of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]]) and [[Jo Leinen]] (Member of the European Parliament) are strong supporter of global democracy. They were among those presenting the “Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy” on February 23, 2010, at an event inside the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;
KDUN "[http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606082234/http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ |date=2010-06-06 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The appeals of the campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly has already been endorsed by more than 700 parliamentarians from more than 90 countries.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/support/index.php Overview support]".&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of prominent figures===
:[[Garry Davis]] (Peace activist who created the first "World Passport)
:[[Albert Einstein]] ("The moral authority of the UN would be considerable enhanced if the delegates were elected directly by the people.")
:[[George Monbiot]] ("A world parliament allows the poor to speak for themselves")&lt;ref&gt;
George Monbiot "[http://www.monbiot.com/2007/04/24/no-more-ventriloquists/ No More Ventriloquists]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

:[[Peter Ustinov]] (President of the World Federalist Movement from 1991 to 2004)
:[[Abhay Kumar|Abhay K]] ( "The mass availability of internet-connected mobile phones paves the way for planetary consciousness and global democracy.") &lt;ref&gt;Abhay K "[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-21/edit-page/28367706_1_printing-press-number-of-mobile-phones-gutenberg/2 Birth Of Global Democracy]", [[The Times of India]], Jan 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grassroot movements===
Jim Stark has initiated a process for a Democratic World Parliament through a Global Referendum.  As of August 20, 2013, 22,126 people have voted. So far, the votes are 95.3% in favor of creating a democratic world parliament. Portable voting booths are available at http://voteworldparliament.org/shadowbox/getballot.html. Online voting at Mr. Stark's website is at voteworldparliament.org. Mr. Stark has published a companion book to the online referendum entitled "Rescue Plan for Planet Earth".

'''''Dispatches''''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] radio program, which aired on [[CBC Radio One]] from 2001 to 2012. The program, which was hosted by [[Rick MacInnes-Rae]], aired [[radio documentary|documentary]] reports on international news and feature topics.&lt;ref name=goodbye&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/rick-macinnes-rae-says-goodbye-1.2711684 "Rick MacInnes-Rae says goodbye"]. [[CBC News]], July 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Its opening music was an excerpt from [[Mark Knopfler]]'s song "[[What It Is (Mark Knopfler song)|What It Is]]." 

Originally a half-hour program, the program expanded to a one-hour format in April 2007, incorporating some features of CBC Radio's cancelled [[world music]] series ''[[Global Village (radio show)|Global Village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"CBC changes format of Radio Two". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', January 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2012, the CBC announced it would cancel the program as part of its budget cuts as a result of the [[2012 Canadian federal budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate = 2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last program aired on June 21, 2012 and was repeated June 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/dispatches/episode/2012/06/20/june-21-24/ | work=CBC News|title=June 21 &amp; 24: the last Dispatches|date=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duga''' ({{lang-rus|Дуга}}) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon]] (OTH) radar system used as part of the Soviet [[missile defense]] [[early-warning radar]] network. The system operated from July 1976 to December 1989. Two operational Duga radars were deployed, one near [[Chernobyl]] and [[Chernihiv]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]), the other in eastern [[Siberia]].

The Duga systems were extremely powerful, over 10&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] in some cases, and broadcast in the [[shortwave radio]] bands. They appeared without warning, sounding like a sharp, repetitive tapping noise at 10&amp;nbsp;Hz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The "Russian" (sic) Woodpecker...

Wilson | journal= Monitoring Times | date = Summer 1985 | url = http://www.brogers.dsl.pipex.com/Wpecker5.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to it being nicknamed by shortwave listeners the '''Russian Woodpecker'''. The random frequency hops disrupted legitimate broadcasts, [[amateur radio]] operations, oceanic commercial aviation communications, utility transmissions, and resulted in thousands of complaints by many countries worldwide. The signal became such a nuisance that some receivers such as amateur radios and televisions actually began including 'Woodpecker Blankers' in their circuit designs in an effort to filter out the interference.

The unclaimed signal was a source for much speculation, giving rise to theories such as Soviet [[mind control]] and [[weather control]] experiments. However, because of its distinctive transmission pattern, many experts and amateur radio hobbyists quickly realized it to be an over-the-horizon radar system.  [[NATO]] [[military intelligence]] had already given it the [[NATO reporting name|reporting name]] ''STEEL WORK'' or ''STEEL YARD''. While the amateur radio community was well aware of the system, this theory was not publicly confirmed until after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].

== History ==

===Genesis===
The Soviets had been working on [[early warning radar]] for their [[anti-ballistic missile]] systems through the 1960s, but most of these had been line-of-sight systems that were useful for raid analysis and interception only. None of these systems had the capability to provide early warning of a launch, within seconds or minutes of a launch, which would give the defences time to study the attack and plan a response. At the time, the Soviet early-warning [[satellite]] network was not well developed, and there were questions about their ability to operate in a hostile environment including anti-satellite efforts. An over-the-horizon radar sited in the USSR would not have any of these problems, and work on such a system for this associated role started in the late 1960s.

The first experimental system, Duga, was built outside [[Mykolaiv]] in [[Ukraine]], successfully detecting rocket launches from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] at 2,500 kilometers. This was followed by the prototype Duga, built on the same site, which was able to track launches from the far east and submarines in the Pacific Ocean as the missiles flew towards [[Novaya Zemlya]]. Both of these radar systems were aimed east and were fairly low power, but with the concept proven, work began on an operational system. The new Duga-1 systems used a transmitter and receiver separated by about 60&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="PodvigBook"&gt;{{Cite book

==="Russian Woodpecker"===
At some point in 1976, a new and powerful radio signal was detected simultaneously worldwide, and quickly dubbed 'the Woodpecker' by [[amateur radio]] operators. Transmission power on some Woodpecker transmitters was estimated to be as high as 10&amp;nbsp;MW [[equivalent isotropically radiated power]].&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;&lt;ref name=week/&gt; Even prior to 1976, a similar 'woodpecker' interference is remembered by radio amateurs occurring in the [[High frequency|high frequencies]]. As early as 1963, or before, radio amateurs were calling this "the Russian Woodpecker". Little is apparently known about the power levels or Russian designation but is probably a forerunner of the Duga radar systems. It was also speculated at that time, at least among radio amateurs, that this was an over-the-horizon radar.

[[Triangulation]] by both amateur radio hobbyists and NATO quickly revealed the signals came from a location in present day [[Ukraine]], at the time called [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (part of [[USSR]]). Confusion due to small differences in the reports being made from various sources led to the site being alternately located near [[Kiev]], [[Minsk]], [[Chernobyl]], [[Gomel]] or [[Chernihiv]]. All of these reports were describing the same deployment, with the transmitter only a few kilometers southwest of Chernobyl (south of Minsk, northwest of Kyiv) and the receiver about 50&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Chernobyl (just west of Chernihiv, south of Gomel). At one time there was speculation that several transmitters were in use.&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;

The radar system was given the code 5Н32-West by the Soviets, and was set up in two closed towns, Liubech-1 held the two transmitters and Chernobyl-2 the receivers.&lt;ref name=week&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newsweek.com/hunt-russian-woodpecker-246670 |title= The Massive Russian Radar Site in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone |first=Alexander |last=Nazaryan |date=18 April 2014 |journal=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to civilian observers at the time, [[NATO]] was aware of the new installation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} A second installation was built near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]], in Bolshya Kartel and Lian, but did not become active for some time.

===NATO Reporting Name===
The NATO Reporting Name for the Duga-1 is often quoted as STEEL YARD.  Many online and several print references use this name.  However some sources also use the term STEEL WORK (or STEEL WORKS).  As any "official" sources using NATO Reporting Names are likely to be classified, deconflicting this will be difficult.  The earliest found open source mention of a NATO Reporting Name for this system, a reference publication in print while the system was still active, unambiguously uses the term STEEL WORK.&lt;ref name="The International Countermeasures Handbook, 14th Edition"&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2016}}

===Civilian identification===
Even from the earliest reports it was suspected that the signals were tests of an [[over-the-horizon radar]],&lt;ref name=mystery&gt;{{Cite journal
 | title = Mystery Soviet over-the-horizon tests
 | journal= Wireless World
 | pages = 53

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this remained the most popular hypothesis during the [[Cold War]]. Several other theories were floated as well, including everything from jamming western broadcasts to [[Communication with submarines|submarine communications]]. The broadcast jamming theory was discarded early on when a monitoring survey showed that [[Radio Moscow]] and other pro-Soviet stations were just as badly affected by woodpecker interference as Western stations.

As more information about the signal became available, its purpose as a radar signal became increasingly obvious. In particular, its signal contained a clearly recognizable structure in each pulse, which was eventually identified as a 31-bit pseudo-random binary sequence, with a bit-width of 100 μs resulting in a 3.1 ms pulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | title = Letter from J. P. Martinez

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sequence is usable for a 100&amp;nbsp;μs chirped pulse amplification system, giving a resolution of 15&amp;nbsp;km (10&amp;nbsp;mi) (the distance light travels in 50&amp;nbsp;μs). When a second Woodpecker appeared, this one located in eastern Russia but also pointed toward the US and covering blank spots in the first system's pattern, this conclusion became inescapable.

In 1988, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) conducted a study on the Woodpecker signal. Data analysis showed an [[pulse repetition frequency|inter-pulse period]] of about 90&amp;nbsp;ms, a frequency range of 7 to 19&amp;nbsp;MHz, a bandwidth of 0.02 to 0.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, and typical transmission time of 7 minutes.
* The signal was observed using three repetition rates: 10&amp;nbsp;Hz, 16&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20&amp;nbsp;Hz.
* The most common rate was 10&amp;nbsp;Hz, while the 16&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20&amp;nbsp;Hz modes were rather rare.
* The pulses transmitted by the woodpecker had a wide bandwidth, typically 40&amp;nbsp;kHz.

===Jamming the Woodpecker===
[[File:Duga radar station within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ukraine (09).JPG|thumb|upright|Steel structure of Duga-1 from the bottom]]

To combat this interference, amateur radio operators attempted to [[radio jamming|jam]] the signal by transmitting synchronized unmodulated continuous wave signals at the same pulse rate as the offending signal. They formed a club called The Russian Woodpecker Hunting Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Radio hams do battle with 'Russian Woodpecker' | author = Dave Finley | journal= The Miami Herald | date = 7 July 1982 | url = http://www.qsl.net/n1irz/woodpeck.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Core group members would frame the "Official Practice Target" in their radio shacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = RUSSIAN WOODPECKER HUNTING CLUB OFFICIAL PRACTICE TARGET | author = Brian Rogers | url = http://www.brogers.dsl.pipex.com/Wpecker3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance===
Starting in the late 1980s, even as the FCC was publishing studies, the signals became less frequent, and in 1989, they disappeared altogether. Although the reasons for the eventual shutdown of the Duga systems have not been made public, the changing strategic balance with the end of the [[Cold War]] in the late 1980s likely had a major part to play. Another factor was the success of the [[US-KS (satellite)|US-KS]] early-warning satellites, which began entering service in the early 1980s, and by this time had grown into a complete network. The satellite system provides immediate, direct and highly secure warnings, whereas any radar-based system is subject to jamming, and the effectiveness of OTH systems is also subject to atmospheric conditions.

According to some reports, the [[Komsomolsk-na-Amure]] installation in the [[Russian Far East]] was taken off combat alert duty in November 1989, and some of its equipment was subsequently scrapped. The original Duga-1 site lies within the 30 kilometer [[Zone of alienation|Zone of Alienation]] around the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|Chernobyl power plant]]. It appears to have been permanently deactivated, since their continued maintenance did not figure in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine over the active [[Dnepr radar|Dnepr]] early warning radar systems at Mukachevo and Sevastopol. The antenna still stands, however, and has been used by amateurs as a transmission tower (using their own antennas) and has been extensively photographed.

The original Duga was the first experimental system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/steel-yard.htm|title=Steel Yard OTH|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|author=John Pike|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ABM AND SPACE DEFENSE|author=A. Karpenko Nevsky Bastion|volume=No. 4|year=1999|pages=2–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was built outside the Black Sea port of [[Mykolaiv]] in the southern [[Ukraine]], and successfully detected rocket launches from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] about 2,500 kilometers away. Duga is able to track launches from the Far East and from submarines in the [[Pacific Ocean]], as the missiles fly towards [[Novaya Zemlya]] in the Arctic Ocean. This huge radar complex was restored in 2002 after a fire which seriously damaged it. The transmitter is located at {{coord|46|48|26|N|32|13|12|E}} and the receiver at {{Coord|47|02|28.33|N|32|11|57.29|E|}}.

The original Duga was supplanted by a pair of installations: western, Duga-1, and eastern, Duga-2. Duga-1 was built in northern Ukraine, between [[Liubech]] and [[Chernobyl]]-2, with the receiver at {{Coord|51|18|19.06|N|30|03|57.35|E|}} located a few kilometers west-north-west of Chernobyl; the transmitter is located at {{Coord|51|38|15.98|N|30|42|10.41|E|}} about 50&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Chernobyl (just west of [[Chernihiv]], south of [[Gomel]]). The site is open for pre-arranged visits, for which a permit must be obtained in advance; it has been open since approximately 28 October 2013. Operators who provide tours of Chernobyl and the surrounding areas are able to obtain the relevant paperwork. 

Duga-2, the eastern system, is located near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] in [[Khabarovsk Krai]], with the receiver at {{Coord|50|23|07.98|N|137|19|41.87|E|}}, some 30&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the city, and the transmitter at {{Coord|50|53|34.66|N|136|50|12.38|E|}}, around 43&amp;nbsp;km north of the city.

== Appearances in media ==
The Ukrainian-developed computer game ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.]]'' has a plot focused on the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster|nuclear accident]] there. The game heavily features actual locations in the area, including the Duga-1 array. The array itself appears in ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky]]'' in the fictional city of Limansk-13. While the 'Brain Scorcher' from ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl]]'' was inspired by theories that Duga-1 was used for mind control, it does not take the form of the real array.

[[Markiyan Kamysh]]'s novel about [[Disaster tourism|illegal trips]] to the Duga, ''A Stroll to the Zone'', was praised by reviewers as the most interesting literature debut of 2015 in [[Ukraine]]. The novel has been translated into French (with the title ''La Zone''), and was published by French publishing house [[Groupe Flammarion|Arthaud (Groupe Flammarion)]].

In ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', the map "Grid" is placed in Pripyat near the DUGA-1 array.

In the movie ''[[Divergent (film)|Divergent]]'', the fence around Chicago is derived from photographs of the Duga-1 array.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.qrz.com/showthread.php?430504-The-quot-Woodpecker-quot-moves-to-fururistic-Chicago!

The 'Russian woodpecker' appears in Justin Scott's novel ''The Shipkiller''.

The Duga at Chernobyl was the focus of the 2015 documentary film, ''[[The Russian Woodpecker]]'', by Chad Gracia. The film includes interviews with the commander of the Duga, Vladimir Musiets, as well as the Vice-Commander, the Head of the Data Center, and others involved in building and operating the radar. The documentary, which won numerous awards, also includes drone video footage of the array and handheld video footage of the surroundings as well as a climb to the top by the cinematographer, Artem Ryzhykov. The film also proposes a [[conspiracy theory]] that the [[Chernobyl disaster]] was engineered to cover up failures in the radar's design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianwoodpecker.com/ The Russian Woodpecker documentary (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;  

A Duga radar is featured in the 2017 game ''[[Player Unknown's Battlegrounds]]'' in a map which portrays a fictional Russian Military base.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3408">'''GPoT Center''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Küresel Siyasal Eğilimler Merkezi'') officially the '''Global Political Trends Center''' is a [[research]] unit, which was established by [[Mensur Akgun]] and [[Sylvia Tiryaki]] at the [[Istanbul Kültür University]] in [[Turkey]] in 2008. The mission of the Center is to conduct research, projects, to produce innovative [[publication]]s analyzing the latest issues in the international relations, to formulate viable political recommendations and to boost the dialogue between [[civil society]], [[academia]] and [[Mass media|media]].

== Activities ==

GPoT Center, as one of the leading Turkish [[think tank]]s, runs [[project]]s in various areas and has organized numerous [[Meeting|conferences]], workshops and round-table meetings focused on: the EU - Turkey relations, the [[Cyprus question]], the Turkey - [[Armenia]] relations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-207740-us-meetings-reinvigorate-turkish-armenian-reconciliation.html US meetings reinvigorate Turkish-Armenian reconciliation]&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish - [[Arab]] dialogue, [[NATO]], second track [[diplomacy]] between [[Syria]] and [[Israel]], Arab-Israeli conflict and other issues related to the international agenda in general and the agenda of Turkish [[foreign policy]] in particular.

The projects implemented by GPoT Center often involve participation of [[high-level]] politicians and [[opinion]] makers, however the Center is also active in organization of second-track diplomacy meetings aiming at effective conflict solution. For the purposes of second-track diplomacy, GPoT Center brings together representatives of conflicting parties, i.e. [[civil society]] activists, opinion leaders, as well as academics to discuss issues pertaining to solution of the relevant problem. The meetings are usually conducted in friendly atmosphere and under Chatam House rules.

== Publications ==

The Center publishes various types of publications available in the electronic as well as printed form. It has published a number of [[policy]] briefs analyzing issues in [[international relations]] and shorter essays, i.e. GPoT Briefs focusing on one topic from the current global issues. GPoT Center published its first two books on Cyprus issue in the summer 2009 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brtk.cc/index.php/lang/en/cat/2/news/50924 BRT: Rauf Denktash and Michael Moran write a book]&lt;/ref&gt; and has since then published other books on developments in Cyprus, Israeli-Turkish relations, as well as [[democratization]] of the [[Middle East]].

== Partners and Networks ==

The Center cooperates with institutions from [[Sweden]] - SIIA, [[Lebanon]] - CAUS, [[Qatar]] - ADF, [[United Kingdom]] - LSE, [[Czech Republic]] - EUROPEUM, [[Slovak Republic]] - SFPA, [[Armenia]] - EPF, YPC and Internews, [[Egypt]] - Ibn-Khaldun Center, and [[France]] - ENS. GPoT Center is also part of larger research and academic networks such as the United Nations's [[Alliance of Civilizations]], International Research and Security Network, [[United Nations]]' Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures.

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9567">In most discussions, the '''global citizens movement''' is a socio-political process rather than a political organization or party structure. The term is often used synonymously with the [[anti-globalization movement]]  or the [[global justice movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan George, "Global Citizens Movement: A New Actor for a New Politics," Conference on Reshaping Globalisation: Multilateral Dialogues and New Policy Initiatives, Central European University, Budapest, October 18, 2001, http://www.tni.org/article/global-citizens-movement-new-actor-new-politics.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Global citizens movement" has been used by activists to refer to a number of organized and overlapping citizens groups who seek to influence public policy often with the hope of establishing global solidarity on an issue. Such efforts include advocacy on ecological [[sustainability]], corporate responsibility, social justice, and similar progressive issues.

In theoretical discussions of [[social movements]], global citizens movement refers to a complex and unprecedented phenomena made possible by the unique subjective and objective conditions of the [[planetary phase of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Orion Kriegman, ''Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement'' (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2006), http://www.tellus.org/pub/Dawn_of_the_Cosmopolitan.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used to distinguish the latent potential for a profound shift in values among an aware and engaged citizenry from existing transnational citizens movements which tend to focus on specific issues (such as the [[anti-war movement]] or the [[labor movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;J. Guidry, M. Kennedy, and M. Zald, eds., ''Globalizations and Social Movements: Culture, Power, and the Transnational Public Sphere'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2003; Daniel Jakopovich, "The Construction of a Trans-European Labour Movement," ''Capital &amp; Class'' 35, no. 1 (February 2011): 63-79, http://cnc.sagepub.com/content/35/1/63.short.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The concept of [[global citizenship]] first emerged among the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Greek Cynics]] in the 4th Century BCE, who coined the term “[[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]]” – meaning ''citizen of the world''. The [[Stoics]] later elaborated on the concept. The contemporary concept of [[cosmopolitanism]], which proposes that all individuals belong to a single moral community, has gained a new salience as scholars examine the ethical requirements of the [[planetary phase of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that today’s objective and subjective conditions have increased the latency for an emergent global civic identity has been argued by the authors of the [[Global Scenario Group]]’s final report ''Great Transition: the Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Raskin, Tariq Banuri, Gilberto Gallopín, Pablo Gutman, Al Hammond, Robert Kates, and Rob Swart, ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead'' (Boston: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2002), http://www.greattransition.org/gt-essay. See also the sequel to ''Great Transition'': Paul Raskin, ''Journey to Earthland: A Great Transition to Planetary Civilization'' (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2016), http://www.greattransition.org/publication/journey-to-earthland.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments for the existence of a latent pool of tens of millions of people ready to identify around new values of earth consciousness have been put forth by such authors as [[Paul Raskin]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Raskin, ''World Lines: Pathways, Pivots, and the Global Futures'' (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2006), http://www.tellus.org/pub/World%20lines-A%20framework%20for%20exploring%20global%20pathways.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul H. Ray]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson, ''The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People are Changing the World'' (New York: Three Rivers Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Korten]].&lt;ref&gt;David Korten, ''The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community'' (San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations, such as [[Oxfam International]] believe that a global citizens movement rooted in social and economic justice is emerging and is necessary for ending global poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam International, ''Towards Global Equity: Oxfam International's Strategic Plan, 2001 – 2006'' (Oxford, UK: Oxfam International, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
In the last chapter of his book ''Red Sky at Morning'', [[James Gustave Speth|Gus Speth]] describes the potential for a new type of social movement composed of "we the people, as citizens" rooted in the principles of the [[Earth Charter]] to lead the transition in consciousness and values necessary for the emergence of a new planetary civilization.&lt;ref&gt;James Gustave Speth, ''Red Sky at Morning: America and the Crisis of the Global Environment. A Citizen's Agenda for Action'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Orion Kriegman, author of [http://www.tellus.org/pub/Dawn_of_the_Cosmopolitan.pdf ''Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement''], states, “Transnational corporations, governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) remain powerful global actors, but all of these would be deeply influenced by a coherent, worldwide association of millions of people who call for priority to be placed on new values of quality of life, human solidarity, and environmental sustainability.”&lt;ref&gt;Kriegman, ''Dawn of the Cosmpolitan.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Kriegman distinguishes this "coherent, worldwide association of millions" from the existing fragmented social movements active in the [[World Social Forum]]. These movements tend to be issue-specific – focused on labor, environment, human rights, feminist issues, indigenous struggles, poverty, AIDS, and numerous other interrelated but "siloed" efforts. Coherence among these movements would require a reframing of their work under the rubric of the struggle for a socially just and ecologically sustainable global society and the establishment of an institutional structure to defend the rights of humanity, future generations, and the biosphere.

==Critiques==
The major critique of the notion of a global citizens movement centers on the potential for the emergence of solidarity on issues at the global level. Nationalism, racism, and the dominance of the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian state system]] are considered antithetical to the adoption of a global civic identity. However, some scholars point out that the historical emergence of nationalism must have felt just as improbable in a time of warring city-states,&lt;ref&gt;Benedict Anderson, ''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism'' (New York: Verso, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and yet in retrospect it appears inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Chella Rajan, ''Global Politics and Institutions'' (Boston: Tellus Institute, 2006), http://www.tellus.org/tellus/publication/global-politics-and-institutions-a-utopistic-view.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more radical critique stems from the arguments put forth by [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]] in their book ''[[Multitude]]'' and enshrines [[Michel Foucault]]'s notion of a “plurality of resistance”&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''The History of Sexuality'' (New York: Vintage Books, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; as the only legitimate path forward. This argument asserts that an organized movement among the vast multitude is both undesirable and impossible. Instead of leadership and organizational structures, Hardt and Negri put faith in the emergence of spontaneous coherence due to increasing self-organized networks among various autonomous resistance movements. They critique the notion that there could be legitimate leaders, democratically chosen through a formal network of grassroots structures, acting on behalf of a big-tent pluralistic association of global citizens to directly confront the entrenched power of transnational corporations and state governments. However, it remains unclear how a network of autonomous movements would differ in practice from the vision of an authentic global citizens movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50029">'''Global citizenship''' is the idea that all [[person|people]] have [[rights]] and [[civic duties|civic responsibilities]] that come with being a member of the [[world]], with whole-world philosophy and sensibilities, rather than as a citizen of a particular [[nation]] or place. The idea is that one’s identity transcends geography or political borders and that responsibilities or rights are derived from membership in a broader class: "humanity". This does not mean that such a person denounces or waives their nationality or other, more local identities, but such identities are given "second place" to their membership in a global community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-global-citizen  Israel, Ronald C. (Spring|Summer 2012). "What Does it Mean to be a Global Citizen?" ''Kosmos.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Extended, the idea leads to questions about the state of global society in the age of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/hafa3/global.htm | title=Global Society and International Relations: Sociological and Political Perspectives | publisher=Polity Press | author=Shaw, Martin | year=2000 | location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, the term may have much the same meaning as "[[#World citizen|world citizen]]" or [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]], but it also has additional, specialized meanings in differing contexts. Various organizations, such as the [[World Service Authority]], have advocated global citizenship.

==Usage==

===Education===

In education, the term is most often used to describe a [[worldview]] or a set of [[values]] toward which education is oriented (see, for example, the priorities of the ''Global Education First Initiative'' led by the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaleducationfirst.org/220.htm "Priority #3: Foster Global Citizenship." ''Global Education First Initiative,'' Secretary-General of the United Nations.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "global society" is sometimes used to indicate a [[global studies]] set of learning objectives for students to prepare them for global citizenship (see, for example, the Global Studies Center at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/global/node/483| title=Global Studies Center | publisher=University of Pittsburgh| accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global citizenship education ====
{{Main|Global Citizenship Education}}

Within the educational system, the concept of global citizenship education (GCED) is beginning to supersede or overarch movements such as [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] education, [[peace education]], [[human rights education]], [[Education for Sustainable Development]] and [[international education]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government (2008). ''Global Perspectives: A framework for global education in Australian schools''. Carlton South Victoria, Australia: Curriculum Corporation. {{ISBN|978 1 74200 075 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, GCED rapidly incorporates references to the aforementioned movements. The concept of global citizenship has been linked with awards offered for helping humanity.&lt;ref name="twsJun16gb"&gt;{{cite news

With GCED gaining attention, scholars are investigating the field and developing perspectives. The following are a few of the more common perspectives:
* ''Critical and transformative perspective''. Citizenship is defined by being a member with rights and responsibilities. Therefore, GCED must encourage active involvement. GCED can be taught from a [[Critical thinking|critical]] and [[Transformative learning|transformative]] perspective, whereby students are thinking, feeling, and doing. In this approach, GCED requires students to be politically critical and personally transformative. Teachers provide [[social issues]] in a neutral and grade-appropriate way for students to understand, grapple with, and do something about.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, M. (2008). "You can’t criticize what you don’t understand: Teachers as social change agents in neo liberal times."  Pp. 113-126 in O’Sullivan, Michael &amp; K. Pashby (eds.) ''Citizenship in the era of globalization: Canadian perspectives''. Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Sense Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Worldmindedness''. Graham Pike and David Selby view GCED as having two strands. Worldmindedness, the first strand, refers to understanding the world as one unified system and a responsibility to view the interests of individual nations with the overall needs of the planet in mind. The second strand, [[Student-centered learning|Child-centeredness]], is a pedagogical approach that encourages students to explore and discover on their own and addresses each learner as an individual with inimitable beliefs, experiences, and talents.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, G. &amp; D. Selby (2000). ''In the Global Classroom 2''. Toronto: Pippin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Holistic Understanding''. The Holistic Understanding perspective was founded by Merry Merryfield, focusing on understanding the self in relation to a global community. This perspective follows a curriculum that attends to human values and beliefs, global systems, issues, history, [[cross-cultural]] understandings, and the development of [[Analysis|analytical]] and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] skills.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Philosophy===

Global citizenship, in some contexts, may refer to a brand of [[ethics]] or political philosophy in which it is proposed that the core [[social]], [[political]], [[economic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] realities of the world today should be addressed at all levels—by individuals, civil society organizations, communities and nation states—through a global lens.  It refers to a broad, culturally- and environmentally-inclusive worldview that accepts the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Political, geographic borders become irrelevant and solutions to today's challenges are seen to be beyond the narrow vision of national interests. Proponents of this philosophy often point to [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.) as an example, given his reported declaration that "I am a citizen of the world (κοσμοπολίτης, ''cosmopolites'')" in response to a question about his place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Book VI, Chapter 2, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sanskrit]] term, ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]]'', has the meaning of "the world is one family".&lt;ref name="malhotra"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7TlAgAAQBAJ | title=Indra's Net | publisher=Harper Collins, India. | author=Malhotra, Rajiv.| isbn=9789351362487 | date=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest reference to this phrase is found in the Hitopadesha, a collection of parables. In the [[Mahopanishad]] VI.71-73, ślokas describe how one finds the Brahman (the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the phenomenal universe). The statement is not just about peace and harmony among the societies in the world, but also about a truth that somehow the whole world has to live together like a family.&lt;ref name="malhotra" /&gt;

===Psychological studies===
{{Missing|statistics reported by polls|date=October 2018}}
Global pollsters and psychologists have studied individual differences in the sense of global citizenship. Beginning in 2005, the [[World Values Survey]], administered across almost 100 countries, included the statement, “I see myself as a world citizen.”  For smaller studies, several multi-item scales have been developed, including Sam McFarland and colleagues’ Identification with All Humanity scale (e.g., “How much do you identify with (that is, feel a part of, feel love toward, have concern for) . . . all humans everywhere?”),&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; Anna Malsch and Alan Omoto’s Psychological Sense of Global Community (e.g., “I feel a sense of connection to people all over the world, even if I don’t know them personally”),&lt;ref&gt;Malsch, A. M., &amp; Omoto, A. M. (2007). Prosocial behavior beyond borders: Understanding a psychological sense of global community. Claremont, CA: Unpublished manuscript, Department of Psychology, Claremont Graduate University.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerhard Reese and colleagues’ Global Social Identity scale (e.g. “I feel strongly connected to the world community as a whole.”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reese | first1 = G. | last2 = Proch | first2 = J. | last3 = Cohrs | first3 = J.C. | year = 2014 | title = Individual differences in responses to global inequality | doi = 10.1080/00224545.2014.992850 | journal = Analyses of Social issues and Public Policy | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 217–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Reysen and Katzarska-Miller's global citizenship identification scale (e.g., “I strongly identify with global citizens.”).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reysen | first1 = S. | last2 = Katzarska-Miller | first2 = I. | year = 2013 | title = A model of global citizenship: Antecedents and outcomes | doi = 10.1080/00207594.2012.701749 | journal = International Journal of Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 858–870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are strongly related to one another, but they are not fully identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. | last2 = Hornsby | first2 = W. | year = 2015 | title = An analysis of five measures of global human identification | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2161 | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 806–817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the psychological roots of global citizenship have found that persons high in global citizenship are also high on the personality traits of openness to experience and agreeableness from the [[Big Five personality traits]] and high in empathy and caring. Oppositely, the [[authoritarian personality]], the [[social dominance orientation]] and [[psychopathy]] are all associated with less global human identification. Some of these traits are influenced by heredity as well as by early experiences, which, in turn, likely influence individuals' receptiveness to global human identification.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. Webb | last2 = Brown | first2 = D. | year = 2012 | title = All humanity is my ingroup: A measure and studies of Identification with All Humanity | doi = 10.1037/a0028724 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 830–853 | pmid=22708625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that those who are high in global human identification are less prejudiced toward many groups, care more about international human rights, worldwide inequality, global poverty and human suffering. They attend more actively to global concerns, value the lives of all human beings more equally, and give more in time and money to international humanitarian causes. They tend to be more politically liberal on both domestic and international issues.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; They want their countries to do more to alleviate global suffering.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;

Following a [[social identity approach]], Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org" /&gt; Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural environment in which one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected to others in the world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of [[prosocial behavior]]s and values, including: intergroup [[empathy]], valuing diversity, [[social justice]], environmental [[sustainability]], intergroup [[Helping behavior|helping]], and a felt responsibility to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Student Learning: Improving Practice |last=Reysen |first=Stephen |publisher=Nova |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-62618-938-6 |location=New York |pages=121–137 |last2=Katzarska-Miller |first2=Iva |editor-last=Boyle |editor-first=Christopher |chapter=Student pathways to global citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

===Geography, sovereignty, and citizenship===

At the same time that [[globalization]] is reducing the importance of [[nation-states]],&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of global citizenship may require a redefinition of ties between civic engagement and geography.  Face-to-face [[town hall meeting]]s seem increasingly supplanted by electronic "town halls" not limited by space and time.{{fact|date=October 2018}} [[Absentee ballot]]s opened the way for [[expatriate]]s to vote while living in another country; the Internet may carry this several steps further. Another interpretation given by several scholars of the changing configurations of citizenship due to globalization is the possibility that citizenship becomes a changed institution; even if situated within territorial boundaries that are national, if the meaning of the national itself has changed, then the meaning of being a citizen of that nation changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sassen|first=Saskia|title=Towards post-national and denationalized citizenship|year=2003|publisher=Sage|location=New York|pages=286|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sjs2/PDFs/Towards_Post-National_and_Denationalized_Citizenship.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
The lack of a universally recognized world body can put the initiative upon global citizens themselves to create rights and obligations. Rights and obligations as they arose at the formation of nation-states (e.g. the right to vote and obligation to serve in time of war) are being expanded. Thus, new concepts that accord certain "human rights" which arose in the 20th century are increasingly being universalized across nations and governments. This is the result of many factors, including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by the United Nations in 1948, the aftermath of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] and growing sentiments towards legitimizing marginalized peoples (e.g., pre-industrialized peoples found in the jungles of Brazil and Borneo). Couple this with growing awareness of our impact on the environment, and there is the rising feeling that citizen rights may extend to include the right to dignity and [[self-determination]]. If national citizenship does not foster these new rights, then global citizenship may seem more accessible.

Global citizenship advocates may confer specific rights and obligations of human beings trapped in conflicts, those incarcerated as part of [[ethnic cleansing]], and pre-industrialized tribes newly discovered by scientists living in the depths of dense jungle

Article 2 states that "Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 2|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{original research|date=November 2017}}
[[File:World Citizen Flag.svg|thumb| World Citizen flag by Garry Davis]]
[[File:World citizen badge.svg|thumb|World Citizen badge]]
In general, a world citizen is a person who places global citizenship above any nationalistic or local identities and relationships. An early expression of this value is found in [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.; mentioned above), the founding father of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic movement]] in Ancient Greece.  Of Diogenes it is said: "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Chapter VI, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a ground-breaking concept because the broadest basis of social identity in Greece at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet Kaniyan Poongundran wrote in ''[[Purananuru]]'', "To us all towns are one, all men our kin." In later years, political philosopher [[Thomas Paine]] would declare, "my country is the world, and my religion is to do good."&lt;ref name="Paine1792"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Paine|title=The Rights of Man|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rights_of_Man|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=1792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the increase in worldwide globalization has led to the formation of a "world citizen" [[social movement]] under a proposed [[world government]].&lt;ref name="worldservice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldservice.org/ | title=World Government of World Citizens | accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a non-political definition, it has been suggested that a world citizen may provide value to society by using knowledge acquired across cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="number"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/index.php/2007/03/22/the-utmost-global-citizen/  | title = the utmost global citizen| publisher = Global Culture}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also consider themselves world citizens, as they feel at home wherever they may go.

[[Albert Einstein]] described himself as a world citizen and supported the idea throughout his life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php Einstein - World Citizen, Erasing National Boundaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704235850/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php |date=4 July 2012 }}, [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;/ref&gt; famously saying "Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, George Sylvester (26 October 1929), "What Life Means to Einstein: An Interview by George Sylvester Viereck", The Saturday Evening Post: 117, http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/what_life_means_to_einstein.pdf retrieved on 7 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; World citizenship has been promoted by distinguished people including [[Garry Davis]], who lived for 60 years as a citizen of no nation, only the world.  Davis founded the [[World Service Authority]] in Washington, DC, which sells [[World Passport]]s, a [[Camouflage passport|fantasy passport]] to world citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MyCountryIsTheWorld.net My Country Is the World] By Garry Davis&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 [[Hugh J. Schonfield]] founded the [[Commonwealth of World Citizens]], later known by its [[Esperanto]] name "Mondcivitana Respubliko", which also issued a world passport; it declined after the 1980s.

The [[Bahá'í faith]] promotes the concept through its founder's proclamation (in the late 19th century) that "The Earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh |origyear = 1873-92 |year = 1994 |title = Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-174-4 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/ | page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term defined by the Bahá'í International Community in a concept paper shared at the 1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, New York, U.S.A. on 14–25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="bic"&gt;{{cite conference | title = World Citizenship: A Global Ethic for Sustainable Development | date = 1993-06-14 | location = New York, NY | author = Bahá'í International Community | booktitle =  1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; "World citizenship begins with an acceptance of the oneness of the human family and the interconnectedness of the nations of 'the earth, our home.' While it encourages a sane and legitimate patriotism, it also insists upon a wider loyalty, a love of humanity as a whole. It does not, however, imply abandonment of legitimate loyalties, the suppression of cultural diversity, the abolition of national autonomy, nor the imposition of uniformity. Its hallmark is 'unity in diversity.' World citizenship encompasses the principles of social and economic justice, both within and between nations; non-adversarial decision making at all levels of society; equality of the sexes; racial, ethnic, national and religious harmony; and the willingness to sacrifice for the common good. Other facets of world citizenship—including the promotion of human honour and dignity, understanding, amity, co-operation, trustworthiness, compassion and the desire to serve—can be deduced from those already mentioned."&lt;ref name="bic"/&gt;

===Mundialization===
Philosophically, mundialization (French, ''mondialisation'') is seen as a response to globalization’s "dehumanisation through [despatialised] planetarisation" (Teilhard de Chardin quoted in Capdepuy 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cybergeo.revues.org/24903 | title=Au prisme des mots | author=Capdepuy, Vincent | journal=Cybergeo: European Journal of Geography. | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early use of ''mondialisation'' was to refer to the act of a city or a local authority declaring itself a "world citizen" city, by voting a charter stating its awareness of global problems and its sense of shared responsibility. The concept was promoted by the self-declared World Citizen [[Garry Davis]] in 1949, as a logical extension of the idea of individuals declaring themselves world citizens, and promoted by Robert Sarrazac, a former leader of the [[French Resistance]] who created the Human Front of World Citizens in 1945.   The first city to be officially mundialised was the small French city of [[Cahors]] (only 20,000 in 2006), the capital city of the Département of [[Lot (department)|Lot]] in central [[France]], on 20 July 1949. Hundreds of cities mundialised themselves over a few years, most of them in France, and then it spread internationally, including to many German cities and to [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. In less than a year, 10 General Councils (the elected councils of the French "Départements"), and hundreds of cities in France covering 3.4 million inhabitants voted mundialisation charters. One of the goals was to elect one delegate per million inhabitants to a People's World Constitutional Convention given the already then historical failure of the [[United Nations]] in creating a global institution able to negotiate a final [[world peace]].  To date, more than 1000 cities and towns have declared themselves [[World cities]], including [[Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Minneapolis]], [[St. Louis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Toronto]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Tokyo]], [[Nivelles]], and [[Königswinter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldservice.org/mundcity.html|title=LIST OF MUNDIALIZED COMMUNITIES AND TOWNS|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a social movement, mundialization expresses the solidarity of populations of the globe and aims to establish institutions and [[supranational]] [[law]]s of a [[federation|federative]] structure common to them, while respecting the diversity of cultures and peoples. The movement advocates for a new political organization governing [[all humanity]], involving the transfer of certain parts of national [[sovereignty]] to a [[Federal World Authority]], [[Federal World Government]] and [[Federal World Court]]. Basing its authority on the will of the people, supporters hope it could develop new systems to draw on the highest and best wisdom of all humanity, and solve major planetary problems like [[hunger]], access to [[water]], [[war]], [[peace-keeping]], [[pollution]] and energy.  The mundialization movement includes the declaration of specified territory - a city, town, or state, for example - as world territory, with responsibilities and rights on a world scale. Currently the nation-state system and the United Nations offer no way for the people of the world to vote for world officials or participate in governing our world.  International [[treaties]] or agreements lack the [[force of law]]. Mundialization seeks to address this lack by presenting a way to build, one city at a time, such a system of true World Law based upon the sovereignty of the whole.

===Earth Anthem===
Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire [[planetary consciousness]] and global citizenship among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Not all interpretations of global citizenship are positive. For example, [[Bhikhu Parekh|Parekh]] advocates what he calls globally oriented citizenship, and states, "If global citizenship means being a citizen of the world, it is neither practicable nor desirable."&lt;ref name="Parekh1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parekh | first1 = B | year = 2003 | title = Cosmopolitanism and Global Citizenship | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 3–17 | doi=10.1017/s0260210503000019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community.&lt;ref name="Parekh1"/&gt; He also notes that such a world state would inevitably be "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh presents his alternative option with the statement: "Since the conditions of life of our fellow human beings in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become what I might call a globally oriented citizen."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt;

Michael Byers, a professor in Political Science at the [[University of British Columbia]], questions the assumption that there is one definition of global citizenship, and unpacks aspects of potential definitions. In the introduction to his public lecture, the UBC Internalization website states, "'Global citizenship' remains undefined. What, if anything, does it really mean? Is global citizenship just the latest buzzword?"&lt;ref name="Byers1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byers|first=Michael|title=The Meanings of Global Citizenship|year=2005|publisher=UBC Global Citizenship Speaker Series|url=http://www.internationalization.ubc.ca/gcss.htm#Meanings|accessdate=2009-10-28|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Neither criticism of global citizenship is anything new.  [[Gouverneur Morris]], a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)]], criticized "citizens of the world" while he was on the floor of the convention; August 9, 1787.  "As to those philosophical gentlemen, those Citizens of the World as they call themselves, He owned he did not wish to see any of them in our public Councils. He would not trust them. The men who can shake off their attachments to their own Country can never love any other. These attachments are the wholesome prejudices which uphold all Governments, Admit a Frenchman into your Senate, and he will study to increase the commerce of France: an Englishman, and he will feel an equal biass in favor of that of England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_809.asp | title= Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention | publisher=[[Yale University]] Avalon Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Governance}}
{{basic forms of government}}

'''Global governance''' or '''world governance''' is a movement towards political cooperation among [[transnationality|transnational]] actors, aimed at negotiating responses to problems that affect more than one state or region. Institutions of global [[governance]]—the [[United Nations]], the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[World Bank]], etc.—tend to have limited or demarcated [[Power in international relations|power]] to enforce compliance.  The modern question of world governance exists in the context of [[globalization]] and globalizing regimes of power: politically, economically and culturally.  In response to the acceleration of worldwide [[interdependence]], both between human societies and between humankind and the [[biosphere]], the term "global governance" may name the process of designating laws, rules, or regulations intended for a global scale.

Global governance is not a singular system. There is no "[[world government]]" but the many different regimes of global ''governance'' do have commonalities:
{{quote| While the contemporary system of global political relations is not integrated, the relation between the various regimes of global governance is not insignificant, and the system does have a common dominant organizational form. The dominant mode of organization today is bureaucratic rational—regularized, codified and rational. It is common to all modern regimes of political power and frames the transition from classical sovereignty to what David Held describes as the second regime of sovereignty—liberal international sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= Jmes | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Soguk | first2= Nevzat | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 1: Global Political and Legal Governance | url= https://www.academia.edu/7285675| publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition==

The term world governance is broadly used to designate all regulations intended for organization and centralization of human societies on a global scale. The Forum for a new World Governance defines world governance simply as "collective management of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001610/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique6&amp;lang=en Forum for a New World Governance ; ''Reasons for this Forum for a new World Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, ''[[government]]'' has been associated with "governing," or with political authority, institutions, and, ultimately, control. ''[[Governance]]'' denotes a process through which institutions coordinate and control independent social relations, and that have the ability to enforce, by force, their decisions. However, authors like [[James Rosenau]] have also used "governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority, such as in the international system.&lt;ref&gt;James Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance," ''in'' Martin Hewson and Timothy J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'' (Albany, NY: [[State University of New York]], 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some now speak of the development of "global public policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Diane |last=Stone |title=Global Public Policy, Transnational Policy Communities and their Networks |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=19–38 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2007.00251.x |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1800/1/WRAP_Stone_Global_Agora__Transnational_Public_Policy_JPS.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adil Najam]], a scholar on the subject at the [[Pardee School of Global Studies]], [[Boston University]] has defined global governance simply as "the management of global processes in the absence of global government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailybruin.com/article/2006/10/a-closer-look-professor-seeks- | title=A Closer Look: Professor Seeks Stronger U.N. | publisher=[[The Daily Bruin]] | date=October 18, 2006 | accessdate=October 17, 2012 | author=Riazati, Saba}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas G. Weiss]], director of the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at the Graduate Center ([[CUNY]]) and editor (2000–05) of the journal ''[[Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations]]'', "'Global governance'—which can be good, bad, or indifferent—refers to concrete cooperative problem-solving arrangements, many of which increasingly involve not only the United Nations of states but also 'other UNs,' namely international secretariats and other non-state actors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html The UN and Global Governance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821094009/http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html |date=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, global governance refers to the way in which global affairs are managed.

The definition is flexible in scope, applying to general subjects such as global security and order or to specific documents and agreements such as the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes|Code on the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes]]. The definition applies whether the participation is bilateral (e.g. an agreement to regulate usage of a river flowing in two countries), function-specific (e.g. a commodity agreement), regional (e.g. the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]]), or global (e.g. the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://maihold.org/mediapool/113/1132142/data/Finkelstein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These "cooperative problem-solving arrangements" may be formal, taking the shape of laws or formally constituted institutions for a variety of actors (such as state authorities, [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), [[private sector]] entities, other [[civil society]] actors, and individuals) to manage collective affairs.&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be informal (as in the case of practices or guidelines) or ad hoc entities (as in the case of coalitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=International Organizations: The Politics and Processes of Global Governance, 2nd ed | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | author=Margaret P.

However, a single organization may take the nominal lead on an issue, for example the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in world trade affairs. Therefore, global governance is thought to be an international process of consensus-forming which generates guidelines and agreements that affect national governments and international corporations. Examples of such consensus would include WHO policies on health issues.

In short, global governance may be defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, Duties, obligations and privileges are established, and differences are mediated through educated professionals."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Ramesh Thakur, ''The UN and Global Governance: An Idea and Its Prospects'', [[Indiana University Press]], forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus Alexander, author of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid, an Overview of World Politics'', has described the current institutions of global governance as a system of [[global apartheid]], with numerous parallels with minority rule in the formal and informal structures of South Africa before 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics | publisher=Polity Press | author=Alexander, Titus | year= 1996 | pages=320 | url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745613536 | isbn=978-0-7456-1353-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 marked the end of [[Westphalian sovereignty|a long period of international history]] based on a policy of [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]s. Since this historic event, the planet has entered a phase of geostrategic breakdown. The national-security model, for example, while still in place for most governments, is gradually giving way to an emerging collective conscience that extends beyond the restricted framework it represents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 Blin, Arnaud ; Marin, Gustavo ; "Rethinking Global Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530202243/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 |date=2012-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War world of the 1990s saw a new paradigm emerge based on a number of issues:

* The growing idea of globalization as a significant theme and the subsequent weakening of nation-states, points to a prospect of transferring to a global level of regulatory instruments. Upon the model that regulation was no longer working effectively at the national or regional levels.
* An intensification of environmental concerns, which received multilateral endorsement at the [[Earth Summit]]. The Summit issues, relating to the climate and [[biodiversity]], symbolized a new approach that was soon to be expressed conceptually by the term [[Global Commons]].
* The emergence of conflicts over standards: trade and the environment, trade and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]], trade and [[public health]]. These conflicts continued the traditional debate over the social effects of macroeconomic stabilization policies, and raised the question of arbitration among equally legitimate objectives in a compartmentalized governance system where the major areas of interdependence are each entrusted to a specialized international institution. Although often limited in scope, these conflicts are nevertheless symbolically powerful, as they raise the question of the principles and institutions of arbitration.
* An increased questioning of international standards and institutions by developing countries, which, having entered the global economy, find it hard to accept that industrialized countries hold onto power and give preference to their own interests. The challenge also comes from civil society, which considers that the international governance system has become the real seat of power and which rejects both its principles and procedures. Although these two lines of criticism often have conflicting beliefs and goals, they have been known to join in order to oppose the dominance of developed countries and major institutions, as demonstrated symbolically by the failure of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;For greater discussion, see: Andreani, Gilles; "Governance global : origines d'une idée"; ''Politique étrangère'', Nº 3, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;549–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

Global governance can be roughly divided into four stages:&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Agenda building|agenda-setting]]; 
# [[policy]]making, 
# [[implementation]] and [[enforcement]], and 
# [[evaluation]], [[wikt:monitoring|monitoring]], and [[adjudication]].

World authorities including international organizations and corporations achieve [[deference]] to their agenda through different means. Authority can derive from [[institution]]al status, [[expertise]], [[moral authority]], [[capacity building|capacity]], or perceived competence.&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 9–14. "If organizations like the United Nations (UN), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and Exxon are all (potentially) global governors, why are they in charge? Why does anyone pay attention to them? [...] We define authority as the ability to induce deference in others. [...] Deference to authority might take a variety of forms. Authority might cause actors to subordinate their own conscious preferences to the directives of the authority and thus, in Robert Dahl's (1957 and 1968) sense, get one actor to do what she would not otherwise do, but it might also have subtler effects. Authority might create new preferences in actors who were previously indifferent or at odds. It might change preferences in others who become persuaded to share the authority's views based on its moral standing or expertise."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James N. Rosenau]], "Global governance as disaggregated complexity"; in Ba &amp; Hoffmann (2005), pp. 140–41. "In other words, not only has the advent of network forms of organization undermined the authority of states, but in the context of our concern with GG, it has also had even more important consequences. Most notably, networks have contributed to the disaggregation of authority as well as the formation of new collectivities not founded on hierarchical principles. &lt;br&gt; If the notion that new rule systems can be founded on horizontal as well as vertical structures of authority seems awkward, it warrants reiterating that the core of effective authority lies in the compliance of those toward whom it is directed."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In its initial phase, world governance was able to draw on themes inherited from [[geopolitics]] and the theory of [[international relations]], such as peace, defense, [[geostrategy]], [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations, and [[International trade|trade relations]]. But as [[globalization]] progresses and the number of interdependences increases, the global level is also highly relevant to a far wider range of subjects. Following are a number of examples.

===Environmental governance and managing the planet===
"The crisis brought about by the accelerated pace and the probably irreversible character of the [[effect of human activity on the environment|effect of human activities on nature]] requires collective answers from governments and citizens. Nature ignores political and [[social barrier]]s, and the global dimension of the crisis cancels the effects of any action initiated unilaterally by state governments or sectoral institutions, however powerful they may be. [[Climate change]], [[ocean pollution|ocean]] and [[air pollution]], [[nuclear risk]]s and those related to [[genetic manipulation]], the reduction and [[extinction]] of resources and [[biodiversity]], and above all a development model that remains largely unquestioned globally are all among the various manifestations of this accelerated and probably irreversible effect.

This effect is the factor, in the framework of globalization, that most challenges a system of states competing with each other to the exclusion of all others: among the different fields of global governance, [[environmental management]] is the most wanting in urgent answers to the crisis in the form of collective actions by the whole of the human community. At the same time, these actions should help to model and strengthen the progressive building of this community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 Pelayo, G. (ed.) (2008, "Environmental Governance and Managing the Earth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143745/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals in this area have discussed the issue of how collective environmental action is possible. Many multilateral, environment-related agreements have been forged in the past 30 years, but their implementation remains difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Sustainable Development in a Global Context: A Success or a Nuisance?" New Global Studies 9.1 (2015): 27–56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some discussion on the possibility of setting up an international organization that would centralize all the issues related to international environmental protection, such as the proposed World Environment Organization (WEO). The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) could play this role, but it is a small-scale organization with a limited mandate. The question has given rise to two opposite views: the European Union, especially France and Germany, along with a number of NGOs, is in favor of creating a WEO; the United Kingdom, the USA, and most developing countries prefer opting for voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B. (2005), "International Environmental Governance: The next steps", in ''Synthèses'' N°02/2005. Iddri, 2005. 4 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Institute for Sustainable Development proposes a "reform agenda" for global environmental governance. The main argument is that there seems to exist an unspoken but powerful consensus on the essential objectives of a system of global [[environmental governance]]. These goals would require top-quality leadership, a strong environmental policy based on knowledge, effective cohesion and coordination, good management of the institutions constituting the environmental governance system, and spreading environmental concerns and actions to other areas of international policy and action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Global_Environmental_Governance:_Elements_of_a_Reform_Agenda Najam, A., M. Papa and N. Taiyab (2007), "Global Environmental Governance: Elements of a Reform Agenda"], in Cleveland, C.J. (eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Earth'', Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A World Environment Organisation ====

The focus of environmental issues shifted to [[climate change]] from 1992 onwards.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Due to the transboundary nature of climate change, various calls have been made for a World Environment Organisation (WEO) (sometimes referred to as a Global Environment Organisation)&lt;ref&gt;Biermann, F., and Simonis, U.E., 1998. Eine Weltorganisation für Umwelt und Ent-wicklung: Ein Vorschlag [A world organization for environment and development: A proposal]. Universitas. Zeitschrift für interdisziplinäre Wissenschaft 53 (627), pp. 822–31.&lt;/ref&gt; to tackle this global problem on a global scale. At present, a single worldwide governing body with the powers to develop and enforce environmental policy does not exist.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J.P., forthcoming 2012. Environmental Governance. Oxon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the creation of a WEO was discussed thirty years ago&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, S., and Biermann, F., 2005. The debate on a World Environment Organization: An introduction.  A World Environment Organization: Solution or Threat for Effective International Environmental Governance?, Aldershot: Ashgate, 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; but is receiving fresh attention in the light of arguably disappointing outcomes from recent, ‘environmental mega-conferences’&lt;ref&gt;Seyfang, G. and Jordan, A., 2002. “Mega” Environmental Conferences: vehicles for effective, long term environmental planning?, in: S. Stokke, and O. Thommesen, (eds) Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development, Earthscan: London: 19–26&lt;/ref&gt;(e.g.[[Rio Summit]] and [[Earth Summit 2002]]).

===== Current global environmental governance =====

International environmental organisations do exist. The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), created in 1972, coordinates the environmental activity of countries in the UN.  UNEP and similar international environmental organisations are seen as not up to the task. They are criticised as being institutionally weak, fragmented, lacking in standing and providing non-optimal environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, G., 1992. New Ways To Make International Environmental Law, American Journal of International Law, 86(2), pp. 259–83. and Voynet, D., 2000. Discours de la ministre sur les priorite´s de la pre´sidence franc¸aise dans le domaine de l’environnement devant la commission environnement—consommation—sante´du parlement europe´en, 6 juillet 2000, Strasbourg’, French Presidency of the EU [online] Available at: www.presidence-europe.fr [Accessed 03 November 2011]. and Kohl, H. et al., 1997. Global Initiative on Sustainable Development. Department of Foreign Affairs (South Africa, 23 June).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that the current decentralised, poorly funded and strictly intergovernmental regime for global environmental issues is sub-standard.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"&gt;Lodefalk, M., and Whalley, J., 2002. Reviewing Proposals for a World Environment Organization. The World Economy 25 (5) pp. 601–17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the creation of a WEO may threaten to undermine some of the more effective aspects of contemporary global environmental governance;&lt;ref&gt;Najam, A., 2003. The Case against a New International Environmental Organization. Global Governance 9 (3) pp. 367–84.&lt;/ref&gt; notably its fragmented nature, from which flexibility stems.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; This also allows responses to be more effective and links to be forged across different domains.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Even though the environment and climate change are framed as global issues, Levin states that ‘it is precisely at this level that government institutions are least effective and trust most delicate’&lt;ref&gt;Levin, S., 1998. Ecosystems and the biosphere as complex adaptive systems. Ecosystems 1 pp. 431–36&lt;/ref&gt; while Oberthur and Gehring argue that it would offer little more than institutional restructuring for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Oberthür, S. and Gehring, T., 2004. Reforming international environmental governance: an institutionalist critique of the proposal for a World Environmental Organisation. Politics, Law and Economics 4 pp. 359–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====A World Environment Organisation and the World Trade Organisation=====

Many proposals for the creation of a WEO have emerged from the trade and environment debate.&lt;ref name="Biermann"&gt;Biermann, F., 2001. The emerging debate on the need for a [[World Environmental Organization]]: a commentary. Global Environmental Politics, 1 pp. 45–55.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that instead of creating a WEO to safeguard the environment, environmental issues should be directly incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;von Moltke, K., 2001. The Organization of the Impossible. Global Environmental Politics 1 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO has “had success in integrating [[trade agreement]]s and opening up markets because it is able to apply legal pressure to nation states and resolve disputes”.&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; Greece and Germany are currently in discussion about the possibility of [[solar energy]] being used to repay some of Greece’s debt after their economy crashed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, H., 2011. Germany may buy Greeks’ sunshine. The Guardian, [online]6 October. Available at &lt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/06/greece-debt-germany-roessler-investment?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487&gt; [Accessed 2 November 2011],&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange of resources, if it is accepted, is an example of increased international cooperation and an instance where the WTO could embrace energy trade agreements. If the future holds similar trade agreements, then an environmental branch of the WTO would surely be necessary. However critics of a WTO/WEO arrangement say that this would neither concentrate on more directly addressing underlying market failures, nor greatly improve rule-making.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"/&gt;

The creation of a new agency, whether it be linked to the WTO or not, has now been endorsed by [[Renato Ruggiero]], the former head of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as by the new WTO director-designate, [[Supachai Panitchpakdi]].&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; The debate over a global institutional framework for environmental issues will undoubtedly rumble on but at present there is little support for any one proposal.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

===Governance of the economy and of globalisation===
The [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]] may have undermined faith that [[laissez-faire capitalism]] will correct all serious financial malfunctioning on its own, as well as belief in the presumed independence of the economy from politics. It has been stated that, lacking in transparency and far from democratic, international financial institutions may be incapable of handling financial collapses. There are many who believe free-market capitalism may be incapable of forming the economic policy of a stable society, as it has been theorised that it can exacerbate inequalities.

Nonetheless, the debate on the potential failings of the system has led the academic world to seek solutions. According to Tubiana and Severino, "refocusing the doctrine of international cooperation on the concept of public goods offers the possibility . . . of breaking the deadlock in international negotiations on development, with the perception of shared interests breathing new life into an international solidarity that is running out of steam."&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L. and J.-M. Severino (2002), "Biens publics globaux, gouvernance mondiale et aide publique au développement", ''in'' Jacquet P., J. Pisani Ferry and L. Tubiana, ''Gouvernance mondiale'', La Documentation française, Les Rapports du CAE, N°37, pp. 349–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that a number of global public goods should be produced and supplied to the populations, but are not, and that a number of global [[externality|externalities]] should be taken into consideration, but are not. On the other hand, he contends, the international stage is often used to find solutions to completely unrelated problems under the protection of opacity and secrecy, which would be impossible in a national democratic framework.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?" ''in'' Touffut, J.-Ph. (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Cournot Centre for Economic Studies, Paris, pp. 149/164.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of international trade, Susan George states that ". . . in a rational world, it would be possible to construct a trading system serving the needs of people in both North and South. . . . Under such a system, crushing third world debt and the devastating structural adjustment policies applied by the World Bank and the IMF would have been unthinkable, although the system would not have abolished capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 George, S. (2007), "Alternative finances", ''Le Monde Diplomatique'', January.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143817/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and institutional governance===
Building a responsible world governance that would make it possible to adapt the political organization of society to globalization implies establishing a democratic political legitimacy at every level: local, national, regional and global.

Obtaining this legitimacy requires rethinking and reforming, all at the same time:
* the fuzzy maze of various international organizations, instituted mostly in the wake of World War II; what is needed is a system of international organizations with greater resources and a greater intervention capacity, more transparent, fairer, and more democratic;
* the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian system]], the very nature of states along with the role they play with regard to the other institutions, and their relations to each other; states will have to share part of their sovereignty with institutions and bodies at other territorial levels, and all with have to begin a major process to deepen democracy and make their organization more responsible;
* the meaning of citizen sovereignty in the different government systems and the role of citizens as political protagonists; there is a need to rethink the meaning of political representation and participation and to sow the seeds of a radical change of consciousness that will make it possible to move in the direction of a situation in which citizens, in practice, will play the leading role at every scale.

The political aspect of world governance is discussed in greater detail in the section [[Global governance#Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance|Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance]]

===Governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution===
Armed conflicts have changed in form and intensity since the Berlin wall came down in 1989. The events of [[9/11]], the wars [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], and repeated terrorist attacks all show that conflicts can repercuss well beyond the belligerents directly involved. The major powers and especially the United States, have used war as a means of resolving conflicts and may well continue to do so. If many in the United States believe that fundamentalist Muslim networks are likely to continue to launch attacks, in Europe nationalist movements have proved to be the most persistent terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Girard|first=Quentin|title=En Europe les actes terroristes islamiques sont rares|journal=Libération|date=July 27, 2011|url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/01012351351-en-europe-les-actes-terroristes-islamistes-sont-rares}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global War on Terrorism]] arguably presents a form of emerging global governance in the sphere of security with the United States leading cooperation among the Western states, non-Western nations and international institutions. Beyer argues that participation in this form of 'hegemonic governance' is caused both by a shared identity and ideology with the US, as well as cost-benefit considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Anna Cornelia (2010), "Counterterrorism and International Power Relations", IB Tauris, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Pesawar school attack 2014 is a big challenge to us. Militants from the Pakistani Taliban have attacked an army-run school in Peshawar, killing 141 people, 132 of them children, the military say.

At the same time, civil wars continue to break out across the world, particularly in areas where civil and human rights are not respected, such as Central and Eastern Africa and the Middle East. These and other regions remain deeply entrenched in permanent crises, hampered by authoritarian regimes, many of them being supported by the United States, reducing entire swathes of the population to wretched living conditions. The wars and conflicts we are faced with have a variety of causes: economic inequality, social conflict, religious sectarianism, Western imperialism, colonial legacies, disputes over territory and over control of basic resources such as water or land. They are all illustrations a deep-rooted crisis of world governance.

The resulting bellicose climate imbues international relations with competitive nationalism and contributes, in rich and poor countries alike, to increasing military budgets, siphoning off huge sums of public money to the benefit of the arms industry and military-oriented scientific innovation, hence fueling global insecurity. Of these enormous sums, a fraction would be enough to provide a permanent solution for the basic needs of the planet's population hence practically eliminating the causes of war and terrorism.

Andrée Michel argues that the arms race is not only proceeding with greater vigor, it is the surest means for Western countries to maintain their hegemony over countries of the South. Following the break-up of the Eastern bloc countries, she maintains, a strategy for the manipulation of the masses was set up with a permanent invention of an enemy (currently incarnated by Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and North Korea) and by kindling fear and hate of others to justify perpetuating the [[Military–industrial complex]] and arms sales. The author also recalls that the "Big Five" at the UN who have the veto right are responsible for 85% of arms sales around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Andrée (1999), ''Surarmement, pouvoirs, démocratie''; L'Harmattan, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals for the governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution begin by addressing [[positive peace|prevention of the causes of conflicts]], whether economic, social, religious, political, or territorial. This requires assigning more resources to improving people's living conditions—health, accommodation, food, and work—and to education, including education in the values of [[peace]], [[social justice]], and unity and diversity as two sides of the same coin representing the global village.

Resources for peace could be obtained by regulating, or even reducing military budgets, which have done nothing but rise in the past recent years. This process could go hand in hand with plans for global disarmament and the conversion of arms industries, applied proportionally to all countries, including the major powers. Unfortunately, the warlike climate of the last decade has served to relegate all plans for global disarmament, even in civil-society debates, and to pigeonhole them as a long-term goal or even a Utopian vision. This is definitely a setback for the cause of peace and for humankind, but it is far from being a permanent obstacle.

International institutions also have a role to play in resolving armed conflicts. Small international rapid deployment units could intervene in these with an exclusive mandate granted by a reformed and democratic United Nations system or by relevant regional authorities such as the European Union. These units could be formed specifically for each conflict, using armies from several countries as was the case when the [[UNIFIL]] was reinforced during the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. On the other hand, no national army would be authorized to intervene unilaterally outside its territory without a UN or regional mandate.

Another issue that is worth addressing concerns the legitimate conditions for the use of force and conduct during war. Jean-Réné Bachelet offers an answer with the conceptualization of a military ethics corresponding to the need for a "principle of humanity." The author defines this principle as follows: "All human beings, whatever their race, nationality, gender, age, opinion, or religion, belong to one same humanity, and every individual has an inalienable right to respect for his life, integrity, and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 Bachelet, Jean-René; ''Military Ethics for a Better World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143947/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance of science, education, information, and communications===
The World Trade Organization's (WTO) agenda of liberalizing public goods and services are related to culture, science, education, health, living organisms, information, and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine HACKER, “ Cultiver la créativité, corollaire de la diversité culturelle européenne ”, Revue Géoéconomie : Cinéma: le déclin de l'empire américain?, numéro 58 – été 2011 : http://www.choiseul-editions.com/documents/BC-G58.pdf?PHPSESSID=cab73ffbe617a07900584f09d655e3d0&lt;/ref&gt; This plan has been only partially offset by the [[alter-globalization movement]], starting with [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|the events]] that took place at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999|1999 Seattle meeting]], and on a totally different and probably far more influential scale in the medium and long term, by the astounding explosion of collaborative practices on the [[Internet]]. However, lacking political and widespread citizen support as well as sufficient resources, [[civil society]] has not so far been able to develop and disseminate alternative plans for society as a whole on a global scale, even though plenty of proposals and initiatives have been developed, some more successful than others, to build a fairer, more responsible, and more solidarity-based world in all of these areas.

Above all, each country tries to impose their values and collective preferences within international institutions such like WTO or UNESCO, particularly in the Medias sector. This is an excellent opportunity to promote their soft power, for instance with the promotion of the cinema&lt;ref&gt;Economic warfare on the silver screen- Interview of Violaine Hacker, {{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Economic warfare on the silver screen |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= |date=1970-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as science is concerned, "[r]esearch increasingly bows to the needs of financial markets, turning competence and knowledge into commodities, making employment flexible and informal, and establishing contracts based on goals and profits for the benefit of private interests in compliance with the competition principle. The directions that research has taken in the past two decades and the changes it has undergone have drastically removed it from its initial mission (producing competence and knowledge, maintaining independence) with no questioning of its current and future missions. Despite the progress, or perhaps even as its consequence, humankind continues to face critical problems: poverty and hunger are yet to be vanquished, nuclear arms are proliferating, environmental disasters are on the rise, social injustice is growing, and so on.

Neoliberal commercialization of the commons favors the interests of pharmaceutical companies instead of the patients', of food-processing companies instead of the farmers' and consumers'. Public research policies have done nothing but support this process of economic profitability, where research results are increasingly judged by the financial markets. The system of systematically patenting knowledge and living organisms is thus being imposed throughout the planet through the 1994 WTO agreements on intellectual property. Research in many areas is now being directed by private companies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 "Atelier de la Fondation Sciences citoyennes au Forum social mondial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714091819/http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 |date=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the global level, "[i]nstitutions dominating a specific sector also, at every level, present the risk of reliance on technical bodies that use their own references and deliberate in an isolated environment. This process can be observed with the 'community of patents' that promotes the patenting of living organisms, as well as with authorities controlling nuclear energy. This inward-looking approach is all the more dangerous that communities of experts are, in all complex technical and legal spheres, increasingly dominated by the major economic organizations that finance research and development."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

On the other hand, several innovative experiments have emerged in the sphere of science, such as: [[conscience clauses]] and citizens' panels as a tool for democratizing the production system: [[science shop]]s and [[Citizen science|community-based research]]. Politically committed scientists are also increasingly organizing at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uvic.ca/ocbr/assets/pdfs/Global%20Alliance.pdf Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research; ''Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research'']{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as education is concerned, the effect of commoditization can be seen in the serious tightening of education budgets, which affects the quality of general education as a public service. The Global Future Online report reminds us that ". . . at the half-way point towards 2015 ''(author's note: the deadline for the [[Millennium Goals]])'', the gaps are daunting: 80 million children (44 million of them girls) are out of school, with marginalized groups (26 million disabled and 30 million conflict-affected children) continuing to be excluded. And while universal access is critical, it must be coupled with improved learning outcomes—in particular, children achieving the basic literacy, numeracy and life skills essential for poverty reduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfutureonline.org/PolicyAdvocacy/GlblFutr.nsf/issues/92F9DA0279CC03A28825738B0019CDEC?OpenDocument|title=globalfutureonline.org - This website is for sale! - Global Future world vision human development child rights poverty aids peace conflict global Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.globalfutureonline.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to making the current educational system available universally, there is also a call to improve the system and adapt it to the speed of changes in a complex and unpredictable world. On this point, Edgar Morin asserts that we must "[r]ethink our way of organizing knowledge. This means breaking down the traditional barriers between disciplines and designing new ways to reconnect that which has been torn apart." The UNESCO report drawn up by Morin contains "seven principles for education of the future": detecting the error and illusion that have always parasitized the human spirit and human behavior; making knowledge relevant, i.e. a way of thinking that makes distinctions and connections; teaching the human condition; teaching terrestrial identity; facing human and scientific uncertainties and teaching strategies to deal with them; teaching understanding of the self and of others, and an ethics for humankind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 Morin, Edgar; ''Seven Complex Lessons in Education for the Future''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144020/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exponential growth of new technologies, the Internet in particular, has gone hand in hand with the development over the last decade of a global community producing and exchanging goods. This development is permanently altering the shape of the entertainment, publishing, and music and media industries, among others. It is also influencing the social behavior of increasing numbers of people, along with the way in which institutions, businesses, and civil society are organized. [[Peer-to-peer]] communities and collective knowledge-building projects such as [[Wikipedia]] have involved millions of users around the world. There are even more innovative initiatives, such as alternatives to private copyright such as [[Creative Commons]], cyber democracy practices, and a real possibility of developing them on the sectoral, regional, and global levels.

==Regional views==
Regional players, whether regional conglomerates such as [[Mercosur]] and the European Union, or major countries seen as key regional players such as China, the United States, and India, are taking a growing interest in world governance.&lt;ref name="ORF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Governance|url=http://www.orfonline.org/programme/global-governance/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of discussion of this issue can be found in the works of: Martina Timmermann ''et al.'', ''Institutionalizing Northeast Asia: Regional Steps toward Global Governance'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/institutionalizing_Northeast_Asia_web.pdf Timmermann, M. and J.

Interdependence among countries and regions hardly being refutable today, regional integration is increasingly seen not only as a process in itself, but also in its relation to the rest of the world, sometimes turning questions like "What can the world bring to my country or region?" into "What can my country or region bring to the rest of the world?" Following are a few examples of how regional players are dealing with these questions.

===Africa===
Often seen as a problem to be solved rather than a people or region with an opinion to express on international policy, Africans and Africa draw on a philosophical tradition of community and social solidarity that can serve as inspiration to the rest of the world and contribute to building world governance. One example is given by Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni when he reminds us of the relevance of the Ubuntu concept, which stresses the interdependence of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni; ''Giving Africa Voice within Global Governance: Oral History, Human Rights and the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144623/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

African civil society has thus begun to draw up proposals for governance of the continent, which factor in all of the dimensions: local, African, and global. Examples include proposals by the network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique" for "the construction of a local legitimate governance," state reform "capable of meeting the continent's development challenges," and "effective regional governance to put an end to Africa's marginalization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-gouvernance.net/fiches/bipint/fiche-bipint-63.html Network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique"; ''Changeons l’Afrique, 15 propositions pour commencer...'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Foreign-policy proposals announced by President [[Barack Obama]] include restoring the [[Global Poverty Act]], which aims to contribute to meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the world population living on less than a dollar a day by 2015. Foreign aid is expected to double to 50 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24757.html "Record $49B foreign aid budget clears House" in ''Politico'', July 9, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The money will be used to help build educated and healthy communities, reduce poverty and improve the population's health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 "In Defense of Aid" in ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', July 17, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723092252/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 |date=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of international institutions, The White House Web site advocates reform of the World Bank and the IMF, without going into any detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point/|title="A Turning Point" April 2, 2009|author=|date=|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613174551/https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are further points in the Obama-Biden plan for foreign policy directly related to world governance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php "Foreign Policy" in ''Organizing for America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707091922/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php |date=2009-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty;
* global de-nuclearization in several stages including stepping up cooperation with Russia to significantly reduce stocks of nuclear arms in both countries;
* revision of the culture of secrecy: institution of a National Declassification Center to make declassification secure but routine, efficient, and cost-effective;
* increase in global funds for AIDS, TB and malaria. Eradication of malaria-related deaths by 2015 by making medicines and mosquito nets far more widely available;
* increase in aid for children and maternal health as well as access to reproductive health-care programs;
* creation of a 2-billion-dollar global fund for education. Increased funds for providing access to drinking water and sanitation;
* other similarly large-scale measures covering agriculture, small- and medium-sized enterprises and support for a model of international trade that fosters job creation and improves the quality of life in poor countries;
* in terms of energy and global warming, Obama advocates a) an 80% reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 b) investing 150 billion dollars in alternative energies over the next 10 years and c) creating a Global Energy Forum capable of initiating a new generation of climate protocols.

===Latin America===
The 21st century has seen the arrival of a new and diverse generation of left-wing governments in Latin America. This has opened the door to initiatives to launch political and governance renewal. A number of these initiatives are significant for the way they redefine the role of the state by drawing on citizen participation, and can thus serve as a model for a future world governance built first and foremost on the voice of the people. The constituent assemblies in Ecuador and Bolivia are fundamental examples of this phenomenon.

In Ecuador, social and indigenous movements were behind the discussions that began in 1990 on setting up a constituent assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml Servicio Informativo "Alai-amlatina"; Asamblea Constituyente (Ecuador)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305040740/http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml |date=2010-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Rafael Correa's arrival at the head of the country in November 2006, widespread popular action with the slogan "''que se vayan todos''" (let them all go away) succeeded in getting all the political parties of congress to accept a convocation for a referendum on setting up the assembly.

In April 2007, Rafael Correa's government organized a consultation with the people to approve setting up a constituent assembly. Once it was approved, 130 members of the assembly were elected in September, including 100 provincial members, 24 national members and 6 for migrants in Europe, Latin America and the USA. The assembly was officially established in November. Assembly members belonged to traditional political parties as well as the [[new social movements]]. In July 2008, the assembly completed the text for the new constitution and in September 2008 there was a referendum to approve it. Approval for the new text won out, with 63.9% of votes for compared to 28.1% of votes against and a 24.3% abstention rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asambleaecuador.org Asamblea Constituyente Ecuador 2008; ''Nueva Constitución del Ecuador'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The new constitution establishes the rule of law on economic, social, cultural and environmental rights (ESCER). It transforms the legal model of the social state subject to the rule of law into a "constitution of guaranteed well-being" (''Constitución del bienestar garantizado'') inspired by the ancestral community ideology of "good living" propounded by the Quechuas of the past, as well as by 21st century socialist ideology. The constitution promotes the concept of food sovereignty by establishing a protectionist system that favors domestic production and trade. It also develops a model of public aid for education, health, infrastructures and other services.

In addition, it adds to the three traditional powers, a fourth power called the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control, made up of former constitutional control bodies and social movements, and mandated to assess whether public policies are constitutional or not.

The new Bolivian constitution was approved on 25 January 2009 by referendum, with 61.4% votes in favor, 38.6% against and a 90.2% turnout. The proposed constitution was prepared by a constituent assembly that did not only reflect the interests of political parties and the elite, but also represented the indigenous peoples and social movements. As in Ecuador, the proclamation of a constituent assembly was demanded by the people, starting in 1990 at a gathering of indigenous peoples from the entire country, continuing with the indigenous marches in the early 2000s and then with the Program Unity Pact (''Pacto de Unidad Programático'') established by family farmers and indigenous people in September 2004 in Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedib.org/dac ''Hacia una Asamblea Constituyente soberana y participativa''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050125005025/http://www.cedib.org/dac/ |date=2005-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution recognizes the autonomy of indigenous peoples, the existence of a specific indigenous legal system, exclusive ownership of forest resources by each community and a quota of indigenous members of parliament. It grants autonomy to counties, which have the right to manage their natural resources and elect their representatives directly. The ''latifundio'' system has been outlawed, with maximum ownership of 5,000 hectares allowed per person. Access to water and sanitation are covered by the constitution as human rights that the state has to guarantee, as well as other basic services such as electricity, gas, postal services, and telecommunications that can be provided by either the state or contracting companies. The new constitution also establishes a social and community economic model made up of public, private, and social organizations, and cooperatives. It guarantees private initiative and freedom of enterprise, and assigns public organizations the task of managing natural resources and related processes as well as developing public services covered by the constitution. National and cooperative investment is favored over private and international investment.
The "unitary plurinational" state of Bolivia has 36 official indigenous languages along with Spanish. Natural resources belong to the people and are administered by the state. The form of democracy in place is no longer considered as exclusively representative and/or based on parties. Thus, "the people deliberate and exercise government via their representatives and the constituent assembly, the citizen legislative initiative and the referendum . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 4. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and "popular representation is exercised via the political parties, citizen groups, and indigenous peoples."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 222&lt;/ref&gt; This way, "political parties, and/or citizen groups and/or indigenous peoples can present candidates directly for the offices of president, vice-president, senator, house representative, constituent-assembly member, councilor, mayor, and municipal agent. The same conditions apply legally to all. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Latin America: "[[Amazon basin|Amazonia]] . . . is an enormous biodiversity reservoir and a major climate-regulation agent for the planet but is being ravaged and deteriorated at an accelerated pace; it is a territory almost entirely devoid of governance, but also a breeding place of grassroots organization initiatives.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; ''What Amazonia Does the World Need?'', Rio de Janeiro, 2008, p. 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Amazonia can be the fertile field of a true school of 'good' governance if it is looked after as a common and valuable good, first by Brazilians (65% of Amazonia is within Brazilian borders) and the people of the South American countries surrounding it, but also by all the Earth's inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. p. 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, "[f]rom a world-governance perspective, [Amazonia] is in a way an enormous laboratory. Among other things, Amazonia enables a detailed examination of the negative effects of productivism and of the different forms of environmental packaging it can hide behind, including 'sustainable development.' Galloping urbanization, Human Rights violations, the many different types of conflicts (14 different types of conflicts have been identified within the hundreds of cases observed in Amazonia), protection of indigenous populations and their active participation in local governance: these are among the many Amazonian challenges also affecting the planet as a whole, not to mention the environment. The hosts of local initiatives, including among the indigenous populations, are however what may be most interesting in Amazonia in that they testify to the real, concrete possibility of a different form of organization that combines a healthy local economy, good social cohesion, and a true model of sustainable development—this time not disguised as something else. All of this makes Amazonia 'a territory of solutions.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. pp. 34–41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arnaud Blin, the Amazonian problem helps to define certain fundamental questions on the future of humankind. First, there is the question of social justice: "[H]ow do we build a new model of civilization that promotes social justice? How do we set up a new social architecture that allows us to live together?" The author goes on to refer to concepts such as the concept of "people's territory " or even "life territory" rooted in the indigenous tradition and serving to challenge private property and social injustice. He then suggests that the emerging concept of the "responsibility to protect," following up on the "right of humanitarian intervention" and until now used to try to protect populations endangered by civil wars, could also be applied to populations threatened by economic predation and to environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The growing interest in world governance in Asia represents an alternative approach to official messages, dominated by states' nationalist visions. An initiative to develop proposals for world governance took place in Shanghai in 2006, attended by young people from every continent. The initiative produced ideas and projects that can be classified as two types: the first and more traditional type, covering the creation of a number of new institutions such as an International Emissions Organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 Expanding and Reinforcing the Objectives of the Kyoto Protocol: Inciting International Stakeholders to Engage in Greenhouse-gas Transparency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second more innovative type based on organizing network-based systems. For example, a system of cooperative control on a worldwide level among states&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Conference for Climate Change''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810043211/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-organization of civil society into networks using new technologies, a process that should serve to set up a ''Global Calling-for-Help Center'' or a new model based on citizens who communicate freely, share information, hold discussions, and seek consensus-based solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 Global Calling-for-Help Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144601/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They would use the Internet and the media, working within several types of organizations: universities, NGOs, local volunteers and civil-society groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 World Team E. Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Greenhouse-gas Emissions and Global Mitigation Efforts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144206/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the demographic importance of the continent, the development of discussion on governance and practices in Asia at the regional level, as well as global-level proposals, will be decisive in the years ahead in the strengthening of global dialog among all sorts of stakeholders, a dialog that should produce a fairer world order.(See [[Kishore Mahbubani]]).

===Europe===
According to [[Michel Rocard]], Europe does not have a shared vision, but a collective history that allows Europeans to opt for projects for gradual political construction such as the European Union. Drawing on this observation, Rocard conceives of a European perspective that supports the development of three strategies for constructing world governance: reforming the UN, drawing up international treaties to serve as the main source of global regulations, and "the progressive penetration of the international scene by justice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel ; ''World Governance. A Personal European View''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocard considers that there are a number of "great questions of the present days" including recognition by all nations of the [[International Criminal Court]], the option of an international police force authorized to arrest international criminals, and the institution of judicial procedures to deal with tax havens, massively polluting activities, and states supporting terrorist activities. He also outlines "new problems" that should foster debate in the years to come on questions such as a project for a Declaration of Interdependence, how to re-equilibrate world trade and WTO activities, and how to create world regulations for managing collective goods (air, drinking water, oil, etc.) and services (education, health, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel; ''Ibid.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ortega similarly suggests that the European Union should make a more substantial contribution to global governance, particularly through concerted action in international bodies. European states, for instance, should reach an agreement on the reform of the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ortega, Building the future: the EU's contribution to global governance, ISS, Paris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[European Strategy and Policy Analysis System]] (ESPAS), an inter-institutional pilot project of the European Union which aims to assist EU policy formulation through the identification and critical analysis of long-term global trends, highlighted the importance of expanding global governance over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name="The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System"&gt;{{cite web|last=ESPAS|title=The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System|url=http://www.espas.europa.eu/home/|publisher=EUISS|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders' views==
It is too soon to give a general account of the view of world-governance stakeholders, although interest in world governance is on the rise on the regional level, and we will certainly see different types of stakeholders and social sectors working to varying degrees at the international level and taking a stand on the issue in the years to come.

===Institutional and state stakeholders===

===Members of parliament===
The World Parliamentary Forum, open to members of parliament from all nations and held every year at the same time as the [[World Social Forum]], drew up a declaration at the sixth forum in Caracas in 2006. The declaration contains a series of proposals that express participants' opinion on the changes referred to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 World Parliamentary Forum, "Final Declaration of the Sixth World Parliamentary Forum - Caracas 2006"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144303/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional organizations===
The European Commission referred to global governance in its White Paper on European Governance. It contends that the search for better global governance draws on the same set of shared challenges humanity is currently facing. These challenges can be summed up by a series of goals: [[sustainable development]], [[security]], [[peace]] and equity (in the sense of "fairness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225182328/http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }} "Global governance: contribution of the European Union"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-state stakeholders===
The freedom of thought enjoyed by non-state stakeholders enables them to formulate truly alternative ideas on world-governance issues, but they have taken little or no advantage of this opportunity.

Pierre Calame believes that "[n]on-state actors have always played an essential role in global regulation, but their role will grow considerably in this, the beginning of the twenty-first Century . . . Non-state actors play a key role in world governance in different domains . . . To better understand and develop the non-state actors' role, it should be studied in conjunction with the general principles of governance." "Non-state actors, due to their vocation, size, flexibility, methods of organization and action, interact with states in an equal manner; however this does not mean that their action is better adapted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en Calame, Pierre ; "Non-state Actors and World Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144347/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative idea encapsulated by many not-for-profit organisations relates to ideas in the '[[Human Potential Movement]]' and might be summarised as a mission statement along these lines: 'To create an accepted framework for all humankind, that is self-regulating and which enables every person to achieve their fullest potential in harmony with the world and its place in existence.'

Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, references to the universal collective of humanity have begun using the term 'humankind' rather than 'mankind', given the gender neutral quality of the former.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2682&amp;context=facpub Weiss, E.B. 2012. "The Coming Water Crisis: A Common Concern of Humankind"]. Transnational Environmental Law 1(1) 153-168, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Self-regulation' is meant to invoke the concept of [[regulation]] which includes [[rule-making]] such as laws, and related ideas e.g. [[legal doctrine]] as well as other frameworks. However its scope is wider than this and intended to encompass [[cybernetics]] which allows for the study of regulation in as many varied contexts as possible from the [[regulation of gene expression]] to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] for example.

===World Religious Leaders===
Since 2005, religious leaders from a diverse array of faith traditions have engaged in dialogue with G8 leaders around issues of global governance and world risk. Drawing on the cultural capital of diverse religious traditions, they seek to strengthen democratic norms by influencing political leaders to include the interests of the most vulnerable when they make their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/3/4/2158244013511830.full|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Sage Open|volume=3|issue=4|pages=215824401351183|doi=10.1177/2158244013511830|year=2013|last1=Steiner|first1=Sherrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that religion is a key to transforming or fixing global governance.&lt;ref&gt;Page, J. 2015. [http://e-publications.une.edu.au/1959.11/18560 ''Fixing global governance''], Online Opinion, 29 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals==
Several stakeholders have produced lists of proposals for a new world governance that is fairer, more responsible, solidarity-based, interconnected and respectful of the planet's diversity. Some examples are given below.

Joseph E. Stiglitz proposes a list of reforms related to the internal organization of international institutions and their external role in the framework of global-governance architecture. He also deals with global taxation, the management of global resources and the environment, the production and protection of global knowledge, and the need for a global legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2004), "The Future of Global Governance", in ''Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD)'', IPD Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other proposals are contained in the World Governance Proposal Paper: giving concrete expression to the principle of responsibility; granting civil society greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; granting national parliaments greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; re-equilibrating trade mechanisms and adopting regulations to benefit the southern hemisphere; speeding up the institution of regional bodies; extending and specifying the concept of the commons; redefining proposal and decision-making powers in order to reform the United Nations; developing independent observation, early-warning, and assessment systems; diversifying and stabilizing the basis for financing international collective action; and engaging in a wide-reaching process of consultation, a new Bretton Woods for the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article455.html|title=Redefining Global Governance to Meet the Challenges of (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list provides more examples of proposals:
* the security of societies and its correlation with the need for global reforms——a controlled legally-based economy focused on stability, growth, full employment, and North-South convergence;
* equal rights for all, implying the institution of a global redistribution process;
* eradication of poverty in all countries;
* sustainable development on a global scale as an absolute imperative in political action at all levels;
* fight against the roots of terrorism and crime;
* consistent, effective, and fully democratic international institutions;
* Europe sharing its experience in meeting the challenges of globalization and adopting genuine partnership strategies to build a new form of multilateralism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 Groupe de réflexion "Europe-Mondialisation"; ''For Global Reform, a Social Democratic Approach to Globalization''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144357/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Rajesh Tandon, president of the FIM (Montreal International Forum) and of PRIA (Participatory Research in Asia), prepared a framework document entitled "Democratization of Global Governance for Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) conference." He used the document to present five principles that could provide a basis for civil society actions: "Global institutions and agenda should be subjected to democratic political accountability."
* Democratic policy at the global level requires legitimacy of popular control through representative and direct mechanisms.
* Citizen participation in decision making at global levels requires equality of opportunity to all citizens of the world.
* Multiple spheres of governance, from local to provincial to national to regional and global, should mutually support democratization of decision making at all levels.
* Global democracy must guarantee that global public goods are equitably accessible to all citizens of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 Montréal International Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144412/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 |date=2011-10-04 }} ''Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) Conference Report''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Blockchain]] and decentralized platforms can be considered as hyper-political and Global governance tools, capable to manage social interactions on large scale and dismiss traditional central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=083008085091002109121009065100004023014014073092023027101003105086026068106093094125028029021119038017111106028120127023006025122075014092018092000116116089077006022040064023094030088126123026089120094115011009112098106023016006031019067125067008114064&amp;EXT=pdf] ''Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Governance: Is the State Still Necessary?

Vijaya Ramachandran, Enrique Rueda-Sabater and Robin Kraft also define principles for representation of nations and populations in the system of global governance.  They propose a "Two Percent Club" that would provide for direct representation of nations with at least two percent of global population or global GDP; other nations would be represented within international fora through regional blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122466878/abstract|title=Rethinking Fundamental Principles of Global Governance: How to Represent States and Populations in Multilateral Institutions|first1=VIJAYA|last1=RAMACHANDRAN|first2=ENRIQUE J.|last2=RUEDA-SABATER|first3=ROBIN|last3=KRAFT|date=1 July 2009|journal=Governance|volume=22|issue=3|pages=341–351|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01442.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic tool or discipline==
In the light of the unclear meaning of the term "global governance" as a concept in international politics,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2014), "Rethinking Global Governance? Complexity, Authority, Power and Change", International Studies Quarterly, 58: 1, pp. 207-215&lt;/ref&gt; some authors have proposed defining it not in substantive, but in disciplinary and methodological terms. For these authors, global governance is better understood as an analytical concept or optic that provides a specific perspective on world politics different from that of conventional [[international relations]]&lt;ref&gt;K.Dingwerth and P.Pattberg, "Global Governance as a Perspective on World Politics", (2006) Global Governance vol. 12:198.&lt;/ref&gt; theory. [[Thomas G. Weiss]] and [[Rorden Wilkinson]] have even argued that global governance has the capacity to overcome some of the fragmentation of [[international relations]] as a discipline&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson 920140, "Global Governance to the Rescue: Saving International Relations?", Global Governance, 20: 1, pp. 19-36&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when understood as a set of questions about the governance of world orders.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2019), Rethinking Global Governance, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|9781509527243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities, including those offering courses in [[international relations]], have begun to establish degree programmes in global governance.

==Context==
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}
There are those who believe that world architecture depends on establishing a system of world governance. However, the equation is currently becoming far more complicated: Whereas the process used to be about regulating and limiting the individual power of states to avoid disturbing or overturning the status quo, the issue for today's world governance is to have a collective influence on the world's destiny by establishing a system for regulating the many interactions that lie beyond the province of state action. The political homogenization of the planet that has followed the advent of what is known as liberal democracy in its many forms should make it easier to establish a world governance system that goes beyond market laissez-faire and the democratic peace originally formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]], which constitutes a sort of geopolitical laissez-faire.

Another view regarding the establishment of global governance is based on the difficulties to achieve equitable development at the world scale. "To secure for all human beings in all parts of the world the conditions allowing a decent and meaningful life requires enormous human energies and far-reaching changes in policies. The task is all the more demanding as the world faces numerous other problems, each related to or even part of the development challenge, each similarly pressing, and each calling for the same urgent attention. But, as [[Arnold Toynbee]] has said, 'Our age is the first generation since the dawn of history in which mankind dares to believe it practical to make the benefits of civilization available to the whole human race'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001055/105586e.pdf UNESCO (1996), ''Our Creative Diversity: Report of the World Commission on Culture and Development'', Summary Version, UNESCO, Paris.].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need===
Because of the heterogeneity of preferences, which are enduring despite globalization, are often perceived as an implacable homogenization process. Americans and Europeans provide a good example of this point: on some issues they have differing common grounds in which the division between the public and private spheres still exist. Tolerance for inequalities and the growing demand for redistribution, attitudes toward risk, and over property rights vs human rights, set the stage. In certain cases, globalization even serves to accentuate differences rather than as a force for homogenization. Responsibility must play its part with respect to regional and International governments, when balancing the needs of its citizenry.

With the growing emergence of a global civic awareness, comes opposition to globalization and its effects. A rapidly growing number of movements and organizations have taken the debate to the international level. Although it may have limitations, this trend is one response to the increasing importance of world issues, that effect the planet.

=== Crisis of purpose ===
Pierre Jacquet, Jean Pisani-Ferry, and [[Laurence Tubiana]] argue that "[t]o ensure that decisions taken for international integration are sustainable, it is important that populations see the benefits, that states agree on their goals and that the institutions governing the process are seen as legitimate. These three conditions are only partially being met. Taklya"

The authors refer to a "crisis of purpose" and international institutions suffering from "imbalance" and inadequacy. They believe that for these institutions, "a gap has been created between the nature of the problems that need tackling and an institutional architecture which does not reflect the hierarchy of today's problems. For example, the environment has become a subject of major concern and central negotiation, but it does not have the institutional support that is compatible with its importance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf Pierre Jacquet; Jean Pisani-Ferry; Laurence Tubiana; ''À la recherche de la gouvernance mondiale''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905000313/http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World government===
Global governance is not [[world government]], and even less [[democratic globalization]]. In fact, global governance would not be necessary, were there a world government. Domestic governments have monopolies on the use of force—the power of enforcement. Global governance refers to the political interaction that is required to solve problems that affect more than one state or region when there is no power to enforce compliance.  Problems arise, and networks of actors are constructed to deal with them in the absence of an international analogue to a domestic [[government]]. This system has been termed [[disaggregated sovereignty]].

===Consensus example===
Improved global problem solving need not involve the establishment of additional powerful formal global institutions. It does involve building consensus on norms and practices. One such area, currently under construction, is the development and improvement of accountability mechanisms. For example, the [[UN Global Compact]] brings together companies, UN agencies, labor organizations, and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles. Participation is entirely voluntary, and there is no enforcement of the principles by an outside regulatory body. Companies adhere to these practices both because they make economic sense, and because [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], especially [[shareholders]], can monitor their compliance easily. Mechanisms such as the Global Compact can improve the ability of affected individuals and populations to hold companies accountable. However, corporations participating in the UN Global Compact have been criticized for their merely minimal standards, the absence of sanction-and-control measures, their lack of commitment to social and ecological standards, minimal acceptance among corporations around the world, and the high cost involved in reporting annually to small and medium-sized business&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global-ethic-now.de/gen-eng/0d_weltethos-und-wirtschaft/0d-03-neue-art/0d-03-106-global-com-kritik.php A Global Ethic Now!; ''UN Global Compact Under Criticism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bitcoin]] &amp; Beyond: [[Blockchain]]s, Globalization, and Global Governance workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to examine the implications that blockchains pose for globalization and global governance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.balsillieschool.ca/event/bitcoin-beyond-blockchains-globalization-and-global-governance. Balsillie School&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Expansion of normative mechanisms and globalization of institutions===
One effect of globalization is the increasing regulation of businesses in the global marketplace. Jan Aart Scholte asserts, however, that these changes are inadequate to meet the needs: "Along with the general intensified globalization of social relations in contemporary history has come an unprecedented expansion of regulatory apparatuses that cover planetary jurisdictions and constituencies. On the whole, however, this global governance remains weak relative to pressing current needs for global public policy. Shortfalls in moral standing, legal foundations, material delivery, democratic credentials and charismatic leadership have together generated large legitimacy deficits in existing global regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, J.A. (2007), "Civil Society and the Legitimation of Global Governance", CSGR Working Paper No. 223/07&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals and initiatives have been developed by various sources to set up networks and institutions operating on a global scale: political parties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 Sehm-Patömaki, K. and M. Ulvila (2006), "Dialogues on Party Systems and Global Democratization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143624/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; unions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 Howard, S. (2006), "Organising Globally"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; regional authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 Forum de réseaux de régions du monde (2007), "Déclaration des régions sur leur participation à la gouvernance de la mondialisation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143711/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and members of parliament in sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipietz.net/spip.php?article1431|title=A quoi sert le Forum Parlementaire Mondial ?- Alain Lipietz|author=|date=|website=lipietz.net|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation and objectives===
One of the conditions for building a world democratic governance should be the development of platforms for citizen dialogue on the legal formulation of world governance and the harmonization of objectives.

This legal formulation could take the form of a Global Constitution. According to Pierre Calame and Gustavo Marin, "[a] Global Constitution resulting from a process for the institution of a global community will act as the common reference for establishing the order of rights and duties applicable to United Nations agencies and to the other multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article.php3?id_article=670|title=Main Points for the Discussion with the United Nations (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for formulating objectives, the necessary but insufficient ambition of the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]], which aim to safeguard humankind and the planet, and the huge difficulties in implementing them, illustrates the inadequacy of institutional initiatives that do not have popular support for having failed to invite citizens to take part in the elaboration process.

Furthermore, the Global Constitution "must clearly express a limited number of overall objectives that are to be the basis of global governance and are to guide the common action of the U.N. agencies and the multilateral institutions, where the specific role of each of these is subordinated to the pursuit of these common objectives."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Calame proposes the following objectives:
# instituting the conditions for sustainable development
# reducing inequalities
# establishing lasting peace while respecting diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Calame, P. (2003), ''La démocratie en miettes. Pour une révolution de la gouvernance'', Ed. Charles Léopold Mayer, Ed. Descartes et cie. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforming international institutions===
Is the UN capable of taking on the heavy responsibility of managing the planet's serious problems? More specifically, can the UN reform itself in such a way as to be able to meet this challenge? At a time when the financial crisis of 2008 is raising the same questions posed by the climate disasters of previous years regarding the unpredictable consequences of disastrous human management, can international financial institutions be reformed in such a way as to go back to their original task, which was to provide financial help to countries in need?

Lack of political will and citizen involvement at the international level has also brought about the submission of international institutions to the "[[neoliberal]]" agenda, particularly financial institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Rorden (2014), What's Wrong with the WTO and How to Fix it, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|978-0-745-67245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Calame gives an account of this development,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 Calame, Pierre; "Pour une gouvernance mondiale légitime, efficace et démocratique"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144903/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Joseph E. Stiglitz points out that the need for international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO has never been so great, but people's trust in them has never been so low.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?", ''in'' Jean-Philippe Touffut, (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Paris, pp. 149/164&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key aspects of the United Nations reform is the problem of the representativeness of the General Assembly. The Assembly operates on the principle of "one state, one vote," so that states of hugely varying sizes have the same effect on the vote, which distorts representativeness and results in a major loss of credibility. Accordingly, "the General Assembly has lost any real capacity to influence. This means that the mechanisms for action and consultation organized by rich countries have the leading role."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Gustave Massiah advocates defining and implementing a radical reform of the UN. The author proposes building new foundations that can provide the basis for global democracy and the creation of a Global Social Contract, rooted in the respect and protection of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, as well as in the recognition of the strategic role of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadtm.org/spip.php?article1187|title=La réforme de l'ONU et le mouvement altermondialiste|author=|date=|website=www.cadtm.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The three ‘gaps’ in global governance===
There is the jurisdictional gap, between the increasing need for global governance in many areas - such as health - and the lack of an authority with the power, or jurisdiction, to take action.
Moreover, the gap of incentive between the need for international cooperation and the motivation to undertake it. The incentive gap is said to be closing as globalization provides increasing impetus for countries to cooperate. However, there are concerns that, as Africa lags further behind economically, its influence on global governance processes will diminish. At last, the participation gap, which refers to the fact that international cooperation remains primarily the affair of governments, leaving civil society groups on the fringes of policy-making. On the other hand, globalization of communication is facilitating the development of global civil society movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225190757/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2005|title=WHO - Global Governance|author=|date=25 February 2005|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Globalization''' [[-ise vs -ize|or]] '''[[wiktionary:globalisation#English|globalisation]]''' is the process  of [[foreign relations|interaction]] and integration between people, companies, and governments [[world]]wide. Globalization has grown due to advances in [[transportation]] and [[communication]] technology. With increased global interactions comes the growth of international [[trade]], [[idea]]s, and [[culture]]. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, [[wiktionary:conflict|conflicts]] and [[diplomacy]] are also large parts of the [[history of globalization]], and modern globalization.

Economically, globalization involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology, and data.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;Albrow, Martin and Elizabeth King (eds.) (1990).

In 2000, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: [[trade]] and [[Financial transaction|transactions]], [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[investment]] movements, [[Human migration|migration]] and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"&gt;International Monetary Fund .

==Etymology and usage==
The term ''globalization'' derives from the word ''globalize'', which refers to the emergence of an international network of economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=globalization|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest known usages of the term as a noun was in a 1930 publication entitled ''Towards New Education'', where it denoted a holistic view of human experience in education.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50297775?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Globalization&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|date=September 2009|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'globalization' had been used in its economic sense at least as early as 1981, and in other senses since at least as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/06levitt.html | title=Theodore Levitt, 81, Who Coined the Term 'Globalization', Is Dead | date=6 July 2006 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=Feder, Barnaby J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Levitt is credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later half of the 1980s. Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations. Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and [[empire]] across [[Asia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] from the 15th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G. (ed.). (2004). ''Globalization in World History.'' London: Norton, pp. 4–8. {{ISBN|978-0393979428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakari13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakari|first=Mohamed El-Kamel|title=Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?|journal=New Global Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=23–56|issn=1940-0004|doi=10.1515/ngs-2013-021|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the complexity of the concept, various research projects, articles, and discussions often stay focused on a single aspect of globalization.&lt;ref name="GCSP"&gt;Al-Rodhan, R.F. Nayef and Gérard Stoudmann. (2006). [http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf Definitions of the Globalization: A Comprehensive Overview and a Proposed Definition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119215401/http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] [[Martin Albrow]] and Elizabeth King define globalization as "all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society."&lt;ref name="Albrow" /&gt; In ''The Consequences of Modernity'', [[Anthony Giddens]] writes: "Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide [[social relation]]s which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony. (1991). ''The Consequences of Modernity'' Cambridge: Polity Press. p. 64. {{ISBN|9780745609232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Roland Robertson]], professor of sociology at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and an early writer in the field, described globalization as "the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization : social theory and global culture|last=Robertson|first=Roland|publisher=Sage|year=1992|isbn=0803981872|edition= Reprint.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Global Transformations'', [[David Held]] and his co-writers state:
{{quote|text=Although in its simplistic sense globalization refers to the widening, deepening and speeding up of global interconnection, such a definition begs further elaboration. ... Globalization can be on a continuum with the local, national and regional. At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions. Globalization can refer to those spatial-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents. Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term. ... A satisfactory definition of globalization must capture each of these elements: extensity (stretching), intensity, velocity and impact.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David; Goldblatt, David; McGrew, Anthony; Perraton, Jonathan (1999). ''Global Transformations'' Cambridge: Polity Press. {{ISBN|9780745614984}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=|}}

Held and his co-writers' definition of globalization in that same book as "transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions—assessed in terms of their extensity, intensity, velocity and impact—generating transcontinental or inter-regional flows" was called "probably the most widely-cited definition" in the 2014 [[Pankaj Ghemawat|DHL Global Connectiveness Index]].&lt;ref name="DHL"/&gt;

Swedish journalist Thomas Larsson, in his book ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'', states that globalization:
{{quote|is the process of world shrinkage, of distances getting shorter, things moving closer. It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact, to mutual benefit, with somebody on the other side of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Thomas. (2001). ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'' Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute. p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1930865150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines globalization with a more direct and historically contextualized emphasis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Globalization is the extension of social relations across world-space, defining that world-space in terms of the historically variable ways that it has been practiced and socially understood through changing world-time.&lt;ref name=James2005&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2005 | last=James |first=Paul | title=  ‘Arguing Globalizations: Propositions Towards an Investigation of Global Formation’ | url= https://www.academia.edu/5246805/Arguing_Globalizations_Propositions_Towards_an_Investigation_of_Global_Formation | journal= Globalizations | volume= 2 | issue=  2 | pages=193–209 | doi=10.1080/14747730500202206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Manfred Steger]], professor of [[global studies]] and research leader in the [[Global Cities Institute]] at [[RMIT University]], identifies four main empirical [[dimensions of globalization]]: economic, political, cultural, and [[Ecology|ecological]]. A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four. The ideological dimension, according to Steger, is filled with a range of [[Norm (social)|norms]], claims, beliefs, and narratives about the phenomenon itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last=Steger|first=Manfred|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955226-9|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Steger stated that the concept of globalization "emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of '[[Community of practice|communities of practice]]' ([[Étienne Wenger|Wenger]], 1998): academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians."&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;{{Rp|424}} They note the term was used "in education to describe the global life of the mind"; in [[international relations]] to describe the extension of the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]]; and in journalism to describe how the "American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt; They have also argued that four different forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions.&lt;ref name=James2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=‘Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies’|url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113/Levels_of_Subjective_Globalization_Ideologies_Imaginaries_Ontologies|journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|volume=12|issue=1–2|author1=Manfred B. Steger|author2=Paul James}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people. A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and [[Polity|polities]], including [[Imperialism|imperial]] agents. Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of [[Commodity|commodities]] and other objects of exchange. He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization. James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how, today, the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of [[refugee]]s and [[Immigration|migrants]] are increasingly restricted, while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most [[Deregulation|deregulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|title=‘Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens’|url=https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens|journal=Citizenship Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=208–23|doi=10.1080/13621025.2014.886440|pmid=|access-date=|via=|last1=James|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] popularized the term [[The World Is Flat|"flat world"]], arguing that [[Global trade|globalized trade]], [[outsourcing]], [[supply chain|supply-chaining]], and political forces had permanently changed the world, for better and worse. He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. "The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention". ''Emerging: A Reader.'' Ed. Barclay Barrios. Boston: Bedford, St. Martins, 2008. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] defined "economic globalization" as the opening and deregulation of [[Commodity market|commodity]], [[Capital market|capital]], and [[Labour economics|labor markets]] that led toward present [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization. He used "political globalization" to refer to the emergence of a transnational [[élite]] and a phasing out of the [[nation-state]]. Meanwhile, he used "cultural globalization" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture. Other of his usages included "[[Ideology|ideological]] globalization", "[[Technology|technological]] globalization", and "social globalization".&lt;ref&gt;Fotopoulos, Takis. (2001). "Globalization, the reformist Left and the Anti-Globalization 'Movement.'" [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/dn/vol7/takis_globalisation.htm ''Democracy &amp; Nature: The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', 7:(2) (July 2001).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lechner and Boli (2012) define globalization as more people across large distances becoming connected in more and different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner,  Frank J. and John Boli (eds.) (2011). ''The Globalization Reader.'' New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Globophobia" is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the [[balloon phobia|fear of balloons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henwood|first1=Doug|title=Beyond Globophobia|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/beyond-globophobia|work=[[The Nation]]|date=1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Ross|title=Globophobia|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/12049/globophobia-17/|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=20 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor=George Ritzer|editorlink=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XKnmvRATtfAC|page=16}}|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of globalization}}
{{See also|Timeline of international trade}}

There are both [[Proximate and ultimate causation|distal and proximate causes]] which can be traced in the historical factors affecting globalization. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Rourke |first=Kevin H. |first2=Jeffrey G. |last2=Williamson |year=2002 |title=When Did Globalization Begin? |journal=European Review of Economic History |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=23–50 |doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaic===
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The 13th century world-system, as described by [[Janet Abu-Lughod]]]]
{{Main|Archaic globalization}}

Archaic globalization conventionally refers to a phase in the history of globalization including globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly the 1600s. This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and [[State (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.&lt;ref name="M 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how [[Western world|Western states]] have adapted and implemented learned principles from the [[Eastern world|East]].&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and certain parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own [[Production (economics)|production]] and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt;

Also posited is a "multi-polar" nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, where [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of [[industrial production]] and [[Output (economics)|economic output]], archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal [[China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans Köchler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], 17th-century Japanese [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]]]]

The German [[Economic history|historical economist]] and sociologist [[Andre Gunder Frank]] argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the third millennium [[Common Era|B.C.E.]]  This archaic globalization existed during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]], when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture that reached from [[India]] to [[Spain]], including [[Alexandria]] and the other [[Alexander the Great|Alexandrine]] cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of [[import]]ing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade. Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09"&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. (1998). ''ReOrient: Global economy in the Asian age.''

Trade on the [[Silk Road]] was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China, [[South Asian history|Indian subcontinent]], [[Persia]], Europe, and [[Arabia]], opening long-distance political and economic interactions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and [[religion]]s, [[syncretic]] philosophies, and various technologies, as well as [[disease]]s, also traveled along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people, such as refugees, artists, craftsmen, [[Missionary|missionaries]], robbers, and envoys, resulted in the exchange of religions, art, [[language]]s, and new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/legacy-silk-road | title = The Legacy of the Silk Road | publisher = Yale Global | date = 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
{{Main|Proto-globalization}}

"[[Early modern period|Early modern]]-" or "proto-globalization" covers a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800. The concept of "proto-globalization" was first introduced by [[historian]]s [[A. G. Hopkins]] and [[Christopher Bayly]]. The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high "modern globalization" in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G., ed., 2003. Globalization in World History. New York City, NY: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-97942-3}} pp. 4–5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s, and later the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire]]s. In the 17th century, world trade developed further when [[Chartered company|chartered companies]] like the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602, often described as the first [[multinational corporation]] in which [[stock]] was offered) were established.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, K.N. (1965\1999). ''The English East India Company: The Study of an Early Joint-stock Company 1600–1640 (Vol. 4).'' London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of [[expansionism]], the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the rise of newfound commodities—most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s concept of the [[Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process. European, [[Muslim]], Indian, [[Southeast Asia]]n, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.

===Modern===
According to economic historians Kevin H. O'Rourke, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, and Guillaume Daudin, several factors promoted globalization in the period 1815-1870:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-economic-history-of-modern-europe/trade-and-empire/BE789F27408634F4749D61F013897C04|title=Trade and empire (Chapter 4) - The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|pages=100–101|language=en|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars brought in an era of relative peace in Europe.
* Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.
* New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States, and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires.
* A gradual move towards greater liberalization in European countries.
During the 19th century, globalization approached its form as a direct result of the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] allowed [[standardization|standardized]] production of household items using [[economies of scale]] while rapid [[population growth]] created sustained [[demand]] for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transport significantly and [[railroads]] made inland transportation cheaper. The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; More nations embraced [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] such as in [[Scramble for Africa|Africa]] and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]]. The invention of [[shipping container]]s in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/how-the-invention-of-a-box-changed-our-world/2006/06/11/1149964409162.html%0A|title=How the invention of a box changed our world – Business – smh.com.au|last=Gittins|first=Ross|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], work by politicians led to the agreements of the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], in which major governments laid down the framework for [[International monetary systems|international monetary policy]], commerce, and finance, and the founding of several [[international institution]]s intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering [[trade barrier]]s. Initially, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process. Exports nearly doubled from 8.5% of total gross world product in 1970 to 16.2% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | title = World Exports as Percentage of Gross World Product | publisher=[[Global Policy Forum]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712023541/http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | archivedate = 12 July 2008 | accessdate =11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the [[Doha Development Round]] of trade negotiation. Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 [[South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement]].

Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to [[middle class]]es in [[developed countries]]. [[Open skies]] policies and [[low-cost carrier]]s have helped to bring [[Competition (economics)|competition]] to the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between different countries. More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location. This included accounting, software development, and engineering design.

[[Student exchange program]]s became popular after [[World War II]], and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.&lt;ref name=varghese/&gt;

''Globalization: The Essentials.''  NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[revolutions of 1989]] and subsequent [[liberalization]] in many parts of the world resulted in a significant expansion of global interconnectedness. The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process. In the period between 1965 and 1990, the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled. Most migration occurred between the [[Developing country|developing countries]] and [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs).&lt;ref name =Saggi2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saggi | first1 = Kamal | year = 2002 | title = Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and International Technology Transfer: A Survey | url = | journal = World Bank Research Observer | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 191–235 | doi = 10.1093/wbro/17.2.191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy.  The collapse of the Soviet Union not only ended the Cold War's division of the world- it also left the United States its sole policeman and an unfettered advocate of free market.

Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-[[border]] movement of goods, services, technology, and capital.&lt;ref name="Joshi, Rakesh Mohan 2009"&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2009) International Business, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-568909-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as [[tariff]]s, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing [[economic integration]] between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, T: "Year 12 Economics", p. 9. Tim Riley Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality. Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace. Economic globalization also includes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864808614|title=International business: competing in the global marketplace|last=Hill|first=Charles W.

Current globalization trends can be largely accounted for by developed economies integrating with less developed economies by means of [[foreign direct investment]], the reduction of trade barriers as well as other economic reforms, and, in many cases, [[immigration]].

[[International standard]]s have made trade in goods and services more efficient. An example of such standard is the [[intermodal container]]. [[Containerization]] dramatically reduced transport of its costs, supported the post-war boom in [[international trade]], and was a major element in globalization.&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|title=Sample Chapter for Levinson, M.: The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger.|last=Levinson|first=Marc|work=[[The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=17 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122131825/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Organization for Standardization]] is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national [[standards organizations]].

A [[free-trade area]] is the region encompassing a [[trade bloc]] whose member countries have signed a [[Free trade|free-trade]] agreement (FTA).

If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an [[open border]].
Arguably the most significant free-trade area in the world is the [[European Union]], a [[Political union|politico]]-[[economic union]] of [[Member state of the European Union|{{EUnum}} member states]] that are primarily located in [[Europe]]. The EU has developed [[European Single Market]] through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states.

[[Trade facilitation]] looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximise efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives.

Global trade in services is also significant. For example, in [[India]], [[business process outsourcing]] has been described as the "primary engine of the country's development over the next few decades, contributing broadly to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth, employment growth, and poverty alleviation".&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuruvilla |first=Sarosh |last2=Ranganathan |first2=Aruna |title=Economic Development Strategies And Macro- And Micro-Level Human Resource Policies: The Case Of India's "Outsourcing" Industry|journal=Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review|date=October 2008|volume=62|issue=1|pages=39–72|ref=harv |doi=10.1177/001979390806200103|url=http://ilr.sagepub.com/content/62/1/39.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15777592?story_id=E1_TVSSSVJN|accessdate=16 April 2011|title=Outsourcing to Africa: The world economy calls &amp;#124; The Economist|date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William I. Robinson]]'s theoretical approach to globalization is a critique of Wallerstein's World Systems Theory.  He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s.  Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|journal=International Sociology|volume=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One important aspect of Robinson's globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global.  This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six different countries, each contributing to a part of the production process.

{{Main|Cultural globalization}}

Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Paul|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, [[popular culture]] media, and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B. Steger, eds, [https://uws.academia.edu/PaulJames Globalization and Culture: Vol. 4, Ideologies of Globalism], Sage Publications, London, 2010.  {{Cite book|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|last1=Inda|first1=Jonathan|last2=Rosaldo|first2=Renato|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|chapter=Introduction: A World in Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-cultural communication]] is a field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavour to communicate across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.

[[Cultural diffusion]] is the spread of [[culture|cultural]] items—such as [[idea]]s, [[fashion|styles]], [[religion]]s, [[technology|technologies]], [[contact linguistics|languages]] etc.
Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities. For example, [[sushi]] is available in Germany as well as Japan, but [[Disneyland Paris|Euro-Disney]] outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for "authentic" French pastry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v25n3/globalization.pdf |title=Globalization and Culture |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |last2=Barber |first2=Benjamin |journal=Cato Policy Report |date=May–June 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India].

Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture, particularly via the Internet and satellite television.

Religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, [[evangelism|evangelists]], imperialists, and traders. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and more recently sects such as [[Mormonism]] are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins.&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Elizabeth. 2005.

The term globalization implies transformation. Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments. Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Thomas. 2004.

Music has an important role in economic and cultural development during globalization. Music genres such as [[jazz]] and [[reggae]] began locally and later became international phenomena. Globalization gave support to the [[world music]] phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. (2002.)

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, David and Keneth Gloag. 2005. Musicology: The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 [[UNESCO]] report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/cscl/IntlFlows_EN.pdf |title=International Flows of Selected Goods and Services |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the [[European Union]]'s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.

Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to [[Westernization]] or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/04/11/why-do-we-need-religion-in-a-globalized-world/|title=Why do we need religion in a globalized world?|date=11 April 2018|work=Aleteia — Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture|access-date=12 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization is a diverse phenomenon which relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries. The Indian experience particularly reveals the [[Cultural pluralism|plurality]] of the impact of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Biswajit (2011).

==Political globalization==
{{Main|Political globalization}}
[[File:67º Período de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|The [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York City]]]]

In general, globalization may ultimately reduce the importance of [[nation state]]s. [[Supranational]] institutions such as the [[European Union]], the [[WTO]], the [[G8]] or the [[International Criminal Court]] replace or extend national functions to facilitate international agreement.&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could ultimately lead to a [[global union]], based on the [[European Union]] model.&lt;ref name="mcclintock1"&gt;John McClintock (2010). "The Uniting of Nations: An Essay on Global Governance (3rd ed. revised and updated)". Publisher: P.I.E. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intergovernmentalism]] is a term in [[political science]] with two meanings. The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by [[Stanley Hoffmann]]; the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Multi-level governance]] is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy.  It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.

Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states. [[Multiple citizenship]], also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or  dual nationality, is a person's [[citizenship]] status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one [[Sovereign state|state]] under the laws of those states.

Increasingly, [[non-governmental organization]]s influence public policy across national boundaries, including [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian aid]] and [[International development|developmental efforts]].&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Accion International]], the Acumen Fund (now [[Acumen Fund|Acumen]]) and the [[Echoing Green]] have combined the [[business model]] with [[philanthropy]], giving rise to business organizations such as the [[Global Philanthropy Group]] and new associations of philanthropists such as the [[Global Philanthropy Forum]].  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Vaccine-Delivery|title=Vaccine Delivery|work=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hudson Institute]] estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at [[US$]]59 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/2012IndexofGlobalPhilanthropyandRemittances.pdf ''The Index of Global Philanthropy and Remittances 2012''.

As a response to globalization, some countries have embraced [[isolationism|isolationist]] policies. For example, the [[North Korea]]n government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.&lt;ref name=nkr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/2008-exodus.htm |title=North Korean Refugees NGO |publisher=Northkoreanrefugees.com |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhcr&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,PRK,4562d8cf2,487ca236c0,0.html |title=UNHCR Freedom in the World 2008 – North Korea |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dimensions==
Scholars also occasionally discuss other, less common dimensions of globalization, such as [[environmental globalization]] (the internationally coordinated practices and regulations, often in the form of international treaties, regarding environmental protection)&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"&gt;{{cite book|first=Karl S. |last=Zimmerer|title=Globalization &amp; New Geographies of Conservation|url={{google books|id=UdLK-UGj7YkC|page=1|plainurl=yes}}|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-98344-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[military globalization]] (growth in global extent and scope of security relationships).&lt;ref name="Krishnan2016"&gt;{{cite book|first=Armin |last=Krishnan|title=War as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting|url={{google books|id=1ymrCwAAQBAJ|page=PA157|plainurl=yes}}|date=3 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00049-5|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: [[economic globalization]], [[cultural globalization]] and [[political globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"/&gt;

===Movement of people===
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Scheduled [[airline]] traffic in 2009]]
An essential aspect of globalization is movement of people, and state-boundary limits on that movement have changed across history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James| first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens | url= https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens | journal= Citizenship Studies | volume=  18 | issue=  2 | pages= 208–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. For example, travel across the [[Atlantic ocean]] used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Boustan, Adain May . "Fertility and Immigration." UCLA. 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable.

[[Tourism]] is travel for pleasure. The developments in technology and transport infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.&lt;ref name="Barom2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]] |journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |date=January 2013 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228162347/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Travel visa|visa]] is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country. Some countries – such as those in the [[Schengen Area]] – have agreements with other countries allowing each other's citizens to travel between them without visas. The [[World Tourism Organization]] announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/travel/visa-requirements-for-tourism-eased-around-the-world-says-un-agency-365446391.html Visa requirements for tourism eased around the world, says UN agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |title=Visa Openness Report 2015 January 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123123959/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immigration]] is the international movement of people into a destination [[country]] of which they are not natives or where they do not possess [[citizenship]] in order to settle or reside there, especially as [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] or [[Naturalization|naturalized]] citizens, or to take-up [[employment]] as a [[migrant worker]] or temporarily as a [[foreign worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/immigration|title=immigration|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigration| title=immigrate|publisher=Merriam-Webster, In.|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCUK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's who: Definitions|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy_research/the_truth_about_asylum/the_facts_about_asylum|first=|last=|publisher=Refugee Council|location=London, England|year=2016|access-date= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[International Labour Organization]], {{as of|2014|lc=y}} there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside their country of origin for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development. For example, [[freedom of movement for workers in the European Union]] means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.

''[[Financial Times]]''. 1 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in [[international education]].  More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many [[international student]]s now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.&lt;ref name="gribble"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gribble | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Policy options for managing international student migration: the sending country's perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 25–39 | doi=10.1080/13600800701457830}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contributions that [[foreign student]]s make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to [[immigration]] and visa policies and procedures.&lt;ref name="varghese"&gt;Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[transnational marriage]] is a [[marriage]] between two people from different countries. A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to [[citizenship]] and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships.
In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.

===Movement of information===
{{See also|Internet}}
{{Internet users by region}}
Before electronic communications, long-distance communications relied on [[mail]]. Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century. The [[electric telegraph]] was the first method of instant long-distance communication. For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean. The first [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866. The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.

The [[Internet]] has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries. For example, [[Facebook]] is a [[social networking service]] which has more than [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|1.65 billion monthly active users]] {{as of|2016|3|31|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Facebook-Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Info – Facebook Newsroom|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization can be spread by Global journalism which provides massive information and relies on the internet to interact,  "makes it into an everyday routine to investigate how people and their actions, practices, problems, life conditions etc. in different parts of the world are interrelated. possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Berglez |date=2008 |title=WHAT IS GLOBAL JOURNALISM? |journal=Journalism Studies |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=845–858 &lt;!--was originally "5" but that's confusing--&gt; |doi=10.1080/14616700802337727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{See also|List of globalization-related indices}}

One index of globalization is the ''KOF Index of Globalization'', which measures three important dimensions of globalization:  economic, social, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch/ | title=KOF Index of Globalization | publisher=The KOF Swiss Economic Institute | work=ethz.ch | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[A.T.

Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as [[trade]], [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI), [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[portfolio investment]], and [[income]].  However, newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms, including variables related to political, social, cultural, and even environmental aspects of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vujakovic | first1 = Petra | year = 2010 | title = How to Measure Globalization?

==Support and criticism==
{{See also|Criticisms of globalization}}
Reactions to processes contributing to globalization have varied widely with a history as long as extraterritorial contact and trade. [[philosophy|Philosophical]] differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[social movements]].  Proponents of [[economic growth]], [[economic expansion|expansion]] and [[economic development|development]], in general, view globalizing processes as desirable or necessary to the well-being of human [[society]].&lt;ref name=Sen1970&gt;Sen, Amartya K. (1970).  ''Collective choice and social welfare.'' San Francisco, CA: Holden-Day.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonists view one or more globalizing processes as detrimental to social well-being on a global or local scale;&lt;ref name=Sen1970 /&gt; this includes those who social or [[natural environment|natural]] [[sustainability]] of long-term and continuous economic expansion, the social [[structural inequality]] caused by these processes, and the [[Colonialism|colonial]], [[Imperialism|imperialistic]], or [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[ethnocentrism]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[cultural appropriation]] that underlie such processes.

Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures. [[Xenophobia]] is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia|title=Definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia|title=Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]], including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs. They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the [[Gini coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20238991~menuPK:492138~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html|title=Poverty Analysis – Measuring Inequality|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Happy Planet Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happyplanetindex.org/ |title=The Happy Planet Index |publisher=Neweconomics.org |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to a "multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation"&lt;ref name="The Hidden Connections"&gt;{{cite book | last = Capra | first = Fritjof | year = 2002 | title = The Hidden Connections | publisher=Random House | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-385-49471-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they claim are the [[unintended consequences]] of globalization. Others point out that, while the forces of globalization have led to the spread of western-style democracy, this has been accompanied by an increase in inter-ethnic tension and violence as free market economic policies combine with democratic processes of universal suffrage as well as an escalation in militarization to impose democratic principles and as a means to conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorrells, Kathryn. Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion on globalization===

A 2005 study by Peer Fiss and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior. In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"&gt;Fiss, Peer and Hirsch, Pal: "The Discourse of Globalization: Framing and Sensemaking of an Emerging Concept.

A number of international polls have shown that residents of Africa and Asia tend to view globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America. In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably.&lt;ref&gt;"Africans and Asians Tend to View Globalization Favorably. Europeans and Americans are More Skeptical".

In 2004, Philip Gordon stated that "a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects." The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Philip. 2004.

Fiss, ''et al.'', surveyed US opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis of 2007]]. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.&lt;ref name="ip08"&gt;Greg Ip: "The Declining Value Of Your College Degree", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, {{as of|1998|lc=y}} there was a perception in Japan that the economy was "Small and Frail". However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as ''[[internationalization]]'' and ''globalization'' to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi. 1998.

Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"/&gt; Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism.

In the book ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government [[Political corruption|corruption]]; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as [[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; [[protectionism]]; and geographic barriers.&lt;ref name="The End of Poverty"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sachs | first = Jeffrey | year = 2005 | title = The End of Poverty | publisher=The Penguin Press | location = New York, New York | isbn = 1-59420-045-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bhagwati | first = Jagdish | title = In Defense of Globalization | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | location = Oxford, New York | url =| isbn =978-0195330939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist.

The flow of migrants to advanced economic countries has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge. An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"/&gt; Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization. Technological innovations (or technological transfer) is conjectured to benefit most the developing and least developing countries (LDCs), as for example in the adoption of [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref name="Saggi2002" /&gt;

There has been a rapid economic growth in Asia after embracing [[market orientation]]-based economic policies that encourage private [[property rights]], free enterprise and competition. In particular, in East Asian developing countries, [[GDP]] per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url= http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2003|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist [[Martin Wolf]] says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]] in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.&lt;ref name="Wolf2004"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|author= Martin Wolf|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0300102529|accessdate= 6 April 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510120230/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|archivedate= 10 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]]. Thus, despite seemingly unequal [[distribution of income]] within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth among post-1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.&lt;ref name="DDollar"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dollar, David|author2=Kraay, Aart|title=Trade, Growth, and Poverty|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|work=Finance and Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic [[interdependence]] promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web |title=Globalisation promotes peace

Globalization allows corporations to [[outsource]] manufacturing and service jobs from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits.&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"/&gt; Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually [[agricultural production]]s. Larger countries often subsidize their [[Agricultural subsidy|farmers]] (e.g., the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.&lt;ref name="Hurst E.

===Global democracy===
{{Main|Democratic globalization}}

'''Democratic globalization''' is a movement towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]] that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO), political cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker [[David Held]]. Advocates of [[democratic globalization]] argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building [[International political economy|global political institutions]]. Dr. [[Francesco Stipo]], Director of the United States Association of the [[Club of Rome]], advocates unifying nations under a [[world government]], suggesting that it "should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations. A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacor.org/archive/index.html |title=USACOR.org |publisher=USACOR.org |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a [[direct election|directly elected]] [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche|first=Douglas|title=The Case for a United Nations  Parliamentary Assembly|url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|publisher=The World Federalist Movement–Institute for Global Policy|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531054746/http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global civics===
{{Main|Global civics|Multiculturalism}}
{{See also|Global citizenship}}

Global civics suggests that [[civics]] can be understood, in a global sense, as a [[social contract]] between [[Global citizenship|global citizens]] in the age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World citizen]] has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional [[geopolitical]] divisions derived from national [[citizenship]]. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in [[Socrates]], whom [[Plutarch]] quoted as saying: "I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcitizens.org.au|title=World Citizens Association Australia|work=World Citizens Association Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and [[nuclear proliferation]].&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary?

Baha'i-inspired author Meyjes, while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness, warns of globalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Language and Universalization: a ‘Linguistic Ecology’ Reading of Bahá’í Writ | first = Gregory Paul | last = Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes) | title = The Journal of Bahá’í Studies | publisher = Association for Bahá’í Studies | series = | volume =Volume IX (1) | year =1999 | location = Ottawa | pages = 51–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cloak for an expeditious economic, social, and cultural Anglo-dominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization. He proposes a process of "[[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalization]]" as an alternative.

[[Cosmopolitanism]] is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single [[community]] based on a shared [[morality]]. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmopolitan|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmopolitan?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect. For instance, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, "Cosmopolitan Patriots," Critical Inquiry 23, no. 3 (Spring, 1997): 617–639.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International cooperation===
'''Military cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– Past examples of international cooperation exist. One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see [[START I]], [[START II]], [[START III]], and [[New START]]) and the establishment of [[NATO]]'s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the [[G8]] Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/brookings-audit/international-cooperation-stepping-stone-world-government |title=International cooperation as a stepping-stone to a world government &amp;#124; Global Policy Journal – Practitioner, Academic, Global Governance, International Law, Economics, Security, Institutions, Comment &amp; Opinion, Media, Events, Journal |publisher=Global Policy Journal |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the [[Montreal Protocol]], in order to stop ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"/&gt;

(2011). Social movements (Rev. ed.). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The diverse subgroups that make up this movement include some of the following: trade unionists, environmentalists, anarchists, land rights and indigenous rights activists, organizations promoting human rights and sustainable development, opponents of privatization, and [[anti-sweatshop movement|anti-sweatshop]] campaigners.&lt;ref name="stwr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stwr.org/the-un-people-politics/the-anti-globalization-movement-defined.htm|title=The Anti-Globalization Movement Defined Share The World's Resources|last=Engler|first=M.|date=30 May 2007|accessdate=14 March 2013}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}l&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy'', [[Christopher Lasch]] analyzes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html |title=The treachery of the lites Elite sense of irresponsibility |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-03-10 |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.
Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The de-nationalisation of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as "world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of  national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have "withdrawn from common life".
Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. 
However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

D.A. Snow et al. contend that the [[anti-globalization movement]] is an example of a [[new social movement]], which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D. A., Soule, S. A., &amp; Kriesi, H. (2004). The Blackwell companion to social movements. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the [[Battle of Seattle (1999)|Battle of Seattle]] in 1999, where there were protests against the World Trade Organization's Third Ministerial Meeting. All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8).&lt;ref name="stwr.org"/&gt; Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.

===Opposition to capital market integration===
{{Main|Anti-capitalist movements}}
[[File:Worldbank protest jakarta.jpg|thumb|World Bank Protester, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]

Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises.  Increasing integration of these [[financial market]]s between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invested Interests: The Politics of National Economic Policies in a World of  Global Finance|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry A.|journal=[[International Organization]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|issn=1531-5088|volume=45|issue=4|year=1991|pages=425–51|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033178|jstor=2706944|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of [[human rights]] issues  are especially disturbed by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South").{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Anti-corporatism and anti-consumerism===
{{Main|Anti-corporatism|Anti-consumerism}}

[[Corporatism|Corporatist]] ideology, which privileges the rights of corporations ([[Legal personality|artificial or juridical persons]]) over those of [[natural person]]s, is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2001/09/01/corporatism-goes-global | title=Corporatism Goes Global | author=Ottaway, Marina | journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations | volume=7 | issue=3 | date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books ([[Naomi Klein]]'s 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'', for example) and films (''e.g. [[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' &amp; ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus]]'') popularizing an [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] [[ideology]] to the public.

A related contemporary ideology, [[consumerism]], which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lived effects of the Contemporary Economy: Globalization, Inequality, and Consumer Society. | author=Storper Michael | journal=Public Culture | year=2000 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=375–409 | doi=10.1215/08992363-12-2-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of [[consumer education]] into school [[curriculum|curricula]]. Social activists hold materialism is connected to [[Big-box store|global retail merchandizing]] and [[supplier convergence]], [[war]], greed, [[anomie]], [[crime]], environmental degradation, and general social [[malaise]] and discontent. One variation on this topic is activism by ''postconsumers'', with the strategic emphasis on moving ''beyond'' addictive consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Collective dissonance and the transition to post-consumerism | author=Cohen,  Maurie J. | journal=Futures |date=July 2013  | volume=52 | pages=42–51 | doi=10.1016/j.futures.2013.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global justice and inequality===

[[File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Differences in national income equality around the world as measured by the national [[Gini coefficient]], 2014]]

The global justice movement is the loose collection of individuals and groups—often referred to as a "[[movement of movements]]"—who advocate [[fair trade]] rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, "A Movement of Movements", New York: Verso, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement is often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are [[anti-globalization]], insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power.&lt;ref&gt;della Porta, D. 2005. "The Social Bases of the Global Justice Movement: Some Theoretical Reflections and Empirical Evidence from the First European Social Forum." Civil Society and Social Movements Programme Paper No. 21.Geneva: UNRISD (United Nations Research Institute for Social Development).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is based in the idea of [[social justice]], desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and [[solidarity]], the values of human rights, and the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Education and Social Justice By J.

Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) include: [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], [[Red Cross]], [[Free The Children]] and [[CARE International]]. They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.

====Social inequality====
{{Main|Social inequality|International inequality}}

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally.  Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name="WEF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak [[trade union|labor unions]]: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever-growing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in high-cost areas. Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline.&lt;ref name="Hurst E. Charles P.41"/&gt; They also cite an increase in the exploitation of [[child labour|child labor]]: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them. Examples include [[quarry]]ing, salvage, and farm work as well as trafficking, bondage, forced labor, prostitution and pornography.&lt;ref name="Edmonds_Pavcni"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pavcnik | first = Nina |date=September 2005 | title = Child Labor in the Global Economy | journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–220 | doi = 10.1257/0895330053147895 | last2 = Pavcnik | first2 = Nina | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often participate in the workforce in [[precarious work]], including [[export-oriented employment]].  Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women's access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]] remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state's role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seguino|first1=Stephanie|last2=Grown|first2=Caren|date=November 2006|title=Gender equity and globalization: macroeconomic policy for developing countries|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1081–104|doi=10.1002/jid.1295|ref=harv|author-link1=Stephanie Seguino|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.4614}} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf Pdf version – via the World Bank.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the intersectionality of gender, race, class, and more remain overlooked when assessing the impact of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|last=Lourdes|first=Benería|others=Berik, Günseli,, Floro, Maria|isbn=9780415537483|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=903247621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study published by the IMF posited that [[neoliberalism]], the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has been "oversold", with the benefits of neoliberal policies being "fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries" and the costs, most significantly higher income inequality within nations, "hurt the level and sustainability of growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foroohar |first=Rana |date=June 3, 2016 |title=Globalization's True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts|url=http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/|work=TIME|location= |access-date=July 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-global governance===
{{Main|Global governance}}

Beginning in the 1930s, opposition arose to the idea of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the [[World Federalist Movement]] (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul. (2006.) ''The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations.'' New York: Harper Collins. {{ISBN|978-0375501654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the [[League of Nations]] and, later, the [[United Nations]].

===Environmentalist opposition===
[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation]] of the [[Madagascar]] Highland Plateau has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western [[river]]s.]]
{{Main|Environmentalism}}
{{See also|Global warming|Climate change|Deforestation}}

[[Environmentalism]] is a broad philosophy, ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ideology.html |title=Ideology and Sustainability |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald Bailey from the February 2002 issue |url=http://reason.com/archives/2002/02/01/debunking-green-myths |title=Debunking Green Myths |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Gibson. Environmentalism: Ideology and Power. Nova Science Pub Inc. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and social movement regarding concerns for environmental [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as [[global warming]], [[climate change]], global [[water supply]] and [[Water crisis|water crises]], inequity in [[energy consumption]] and [[energy conservation]], transnational [[air pollution]] and pollution of the [[world ocean]], [[overpopulation]], world [[habitat]] [[sustainability]], [[deforestation]], [[biodiversity]] and [[species extinction]].

One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Nicholas. (2002). ''Global Ethics and Environment''. Routledge Science. {{ISBN|978-0415197359}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of" environmental [[apartheid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J., and John Boli. 2012. ''The Globalization Reader'', 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0470655634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], the director and founder of Local Futures/[[International Society for Ecology and Culture]], criticizes globalization in many ways. In her book ''[[Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh|Ancient Futures]]'', Norberg-Hodge claims that "centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization." She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norberg-Hodge|first=Helena|title=Ancient futures : learning from Ladakh|year=1992|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0871566435|edition= Sierra Club Books paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related area of concern is the [[pollution haven hypothesis]], which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see [[Race to the bottom]]).&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

== Food security ==
{{Main|Food security}}
The globalization of food production is associated with a more efficient system of food production. This is because crops are grown in countries with optimum growing conditions. This improvement causes an increase in the world's food supply which encourages improved food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5160e.pdf|title=Food Security and International Trade Unpacking disputed narratives|last=Clapp|first=J|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway's limited crop range advocates globalization of food production and availability. The northern-most country in Europe requires trade with other countries to ensure population food demands are met. The degree of self-sufficiency in food production is around 50% in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Flaten and Hisano, 2007. Food Security Policy in a Food Importing Country: The Case of Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies''''' (also titled '''''Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years''''') is a 1997 [[transdisciplinary]] non-fiction book by [[Jared Diamond]], professor of [[geography]] and [[physiology]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). In 1998, ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction|general nonfiction]] and the [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books|Aventis Prize for Best Science Book]]. A documentary based on the book, and produced by the [[National Geographic Society]], was broadcast on PBS in July 2005.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;{{cite web | last = Lovgren

The book attempts to explain why [[Eurasia]]n and [[North Africa]]n civilizations have survived and conquered others, while arguing against the idea that Eurasian [[hegemony]] is due to any form of Eurasian [[Heritability of IQ|intellectual]], [[morality|moral]], or [[Heritability|inherent genetic]] [[Race and intelligence|superiority]]. Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental differences, which are amplified by various [[positive feedback|positive feedback loops]]. When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, [[written language]] or the development among Eurasians of resistance to [[endemic disease]]s), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian [[genome]]s.

== Synopsis ==

The prologue opens with an account of Diamond's conversation with [[Yali (politician)|Yali]], a [[Papua New Guinea|New Guinean]] politician. The conversation turned to the obvious differences in power and technology between Yali's people and the [[Europeans]] who dominated the land for 200 years, differences that neither of them considered due to any genetic superiority of Europeans. Yali asked, using the local term "[[Cargo cult|cargo]]" for inventions and manufactured goods, "Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?" (p.&amp;nbsp;14)

Diamond realized the same question seemed to apply elsewhere: "People of Eurasian origin ... dominate ... the world in wealth and power." Other peoples, after having thrown off colonial domination, still lag in wealth and power. Still others, he says, "have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists." (p.&amp;nbsp;15)

The peoples of other continents ([[sub-Saharan Africans]], [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[New Guineans]], and the original inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia) have been largely conquered, displaced and in some extreme cases – referring to Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, and South Africa's indigenous [[Khoisan]] peoples – largely exterminated by farm-based societies such as Eurasians and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]. He believes this is due to these societies' technologic and immunologic advantages, stemming from the early rise of agriculture after the last [[Ice Age]].

=== Title ===

The book's title is a reference to the means by which farm-based societies conquered populations of other areas and maintained dominance, despite sometimes being vastly outnumbered – superior weapons provided immediate military superiority ([[guns]]); Eurasian diseases weakened and reduced local populations, who had no immunity, making it easier to maintain control over them ([[Microorganism|germs]]); and durable means of transport ([[Infrastructure|steel]]) enabled imperialism.

Diamond argues geographic, climatic and environmental characteristics which favored early development of stable [[Agrarian society|agricultural societies]] ultimately led to immunity to diseases endemic in agricultural animals and the development of powerful, organized [[State (polity)|states]] capable of dominating others.

=== Outline of theory ===
Diamond argues that Eurasian [[civilization]] is not so much a product of ingenuity, but of opportunity and necessity. That is, civilization is not created out of superior intelligence, but is the result of a chain of developments, each made possible by certain preconditions.

The first step towards civilization is the move from [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]] to rooted [[agrarian society]]. Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: access to high-carbohydrate vegetation that endures storage; a [[climate]] dry enough to allow storage; and access to animals docile enough for [[domestication]] and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of [[crops]] and livestock leads to food [[Excess supply|surpluses]]. Surpluses free people to specialize in activities other than sustenance and support population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technologic innovations which build on each other. Large societies develop [[ruling class]]es and supporting [[bureaucracies]], which in turn lead to the organization of [[nation-state]]s and empires.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=978-0-393-03891-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although agriculture arose in several parts of the world, Eurasia gained an early advantage due to the greater availability of suitable plant and animal species for domestication. In particular, Eurasia has [[barley]], two varieties of wheat, and three protein-rich [[pulse (legume)|pulses]] for food; [[flax]] for textiles; and goats, sheep, and cattle. Eurasian grains were richer in protein, easier to sow, and easier to store than American maize or tropical bananas.

As early Western Asian civilizations began to trade, they found additional useful animals in adjacent territories, most notably horses and [[donkey]]s for use in transport. Diamond identifies 13 species of large animals over {{convert|100|lb}} domesticated in Eurasia, compared with just one in South America (counting the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] as breeds within the same species) and none at all in the rest of the world. Australia and North America suffered from a lack of useful animals due to [[extinction]], probably by human hunting, shortly after the end of the [[Pleistocene]], whilst the only [[Domestication of animals|domesticated animals]] in [[New Guinea]] came from the East Asian mainland during the [[Austronesian]] settlement some 4,000–5,000 years ago. Sub-Saharan biological relatives of the horse including [[zebra]]s and [[onager]]s proved untameable; and although [[African elephant]]s can be tamed, it is very difficult to breed them in captivity;&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond" /&gt; Diamond describes the small number of domesticated species (14 out of 148 "candidates") as an instance of the [[Anna Karenina principle]]: many promising species have just one of several significant difficulties that prevent domestication. He also makes the intriguing argument that all large mammals that could be domesticated, have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=978-0-393-03891-0 | pages=168–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurasians domesticated goats and sheep for hides, clothing, and cheese; cows for milk; [[ox|bullock]]s for [[tillage]] of fields and transport; and benign animals such as pigs and chickens. Large domestic animals such as horses and camels offered the considerable military and economic advantages of mobile transport.

[[File:Continental axes by Jared Diamond.png|thumb|[[Continent]]al axes according to [[Jared Diamond]] in ''Guns, Germs, and Steel''.]]

Eurasia's large landmass and long east-west distance increased these advantages. Its large area provided it with more plant and animal species suitable for domestication, and allowed its people to exchange both innovations and diseases. Its east-west orientation allowed breeds domesticated in one part of the continent to be used elsewhere through similarities in climate and the cycle of seasons. The Americas had difficulty adapting crops domesticated at one [[latitude]] for use at other latitudes (and, in North America, adapting crops from one side of the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the other). Similarly, Africa was fragmented by its extreme variations in climate from north to south: crops and animals that flourished in one area never reached other areas where they could have flourished, because they could not survive the intervening environment. Europe was the ultimate beneficiary of Eurasia's east-west orientation: in the [[first millennium BCE]], the [[Mediterranean]] areas of Europe adopted Southwestern Asia's animals, plants, and agricultural techniques; in the [[first millennium]] CE, the rest of Europe followed suit.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond" /&gt;

The plentiful supply of food and the dense populations that it supported made [[division of labor]] possible. The rise of nonfarming specialists such as craftsmen and [[scribe]]s accelerated economic growth and technological progress. These economic and technological advantages eventually enabled Europeans to conquer the peoples of the other continents in recent centuries by using the guns and steel of the book's title.

Eurasia's dense populations, high levels of trade, and living in close proximity to livestock resulted in widespread transmission of diseases, including from animals to humans. [[Smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[influenza]] were the result of close proximity between dense populations of animals and humans.  [[Natural selection]] forced Eurasians to develop [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to a wide range of [[pathogen]]s. When Europeans made contact with the Americas, European diseases (to which Americans had no immunity) ravaged the indigenous American population, rather than the other way around (the "trade" in diseases was a little more balanced in Africa and southern Asia: endemic malaria and [[yellow fever]] made these regions notorious as the "white man's grave";&lt;ref name="RossMacGregor1903 offightAgainstMalaria"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Fight against Malaria: An Industrial Necessity for Our African Colonies |author1=Ross, R. |author2=MacGregor, W. | journal=Journal of the Royal African Society | volume=2 | issue=6 | date=January 1903| pages=149–160 |jstor=714548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[syphilis]] may have originated in the Americas).&lt;ref name="OriginOfSyphilis"&gt;The origin of syphilis is still debated. Some researchers think it was known to [[Hippocrates]]: {{cite web |url = http://news.independent.co.uk/health/article266422.ece |title = English syphilis epidemic pre-dated European outbreaks by 150 years |author = Keys, David |accessdate = 2007-09-22 |publisher = Independent News and Media Limited |year = 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015045621/http://news.independent.co.uk/health/article266422.ece |archivedate = October 15, 2007 |df = mdy-all }} Others think it was brought from the Americas by [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and his successors: {{cite web | title=Columbus blamed for spread of syphilis | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13186-columbus-blamed-for-spread-of-syphilis-.html | date=January 2008 | publisher=NewScientist.com news service | author=MacKenzie, D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European diseases&amp;nbsp;– the [[Germ (microorganism)|germ]]s of the book's title&amp;nbsp;– decimated indigenous populations so that relatively small numbers of Europeans could maintain their dominance.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond" /&gt;

Diamond also proposes geographical explanations for why western European societies, rather than other Eurasian powers such as China, have been the dominant colonizers,&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diamond1999HowToGetRich"&gt;{{cite web | title=How to get rich | url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/diamond_rich/rich_p1.html | author=Diamond, J. |date=July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming Europe's geography favored [[balkanization]] into smaller, closer, nation-states, bordered by natural barriers of mountains, rivers, and coastline. Threats posed by immediate neighbours ensured governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were outcompeted relatively quickly, whilst the region's leading powers changed over time. Other advanced cultures developed in areas whose geography was conducive to large, monolithic, isolated empires, without competitors that might have forced the nation to reverse mistaken policies such as China [[Haijin|banning the building of ocean-going ships]]. Western Europe also benefited from a more temperate climate than Southwestern Asia where intense agriculture ultimately damaged the environment, encouraged [[desertification]], and hurt [[soil fertility]].

=== Agriculture ===
''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' argues that [[urbanization|cities]] require an ample supply of food, and thus are dependent on agriculture. As farmers do the work of providing food, [[division of labor]] allows others freedom to pursue other functions, such as mining and literacy.

The crucial trap for the development of agriculture is the availability of wild edible plant species suitable for domestication. Farming arose early in the [[Fertile Crescent]] since the area had an abundance of wild wheat and [[pulse (legume)|pulse]] species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate. In contrast, American farmers had to struggle to develop corn as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, [[teosinte]].

Also important to the transition from hunter-gatherer to city-dwelling agrarian societies was the presence of 'large' [[domestication|domesticable]] animals, raised for meat, work, and long-distance communication. Diamond identifies a mere 14 domesticated large mammal species worldwide. The five most useful (cow, horse, sheep, goat, and pig) are all descendants of species [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to [[Eurasia]]. Of the remaining nine, only two (the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] both of South America) are indigenous to a land outside the temperate region of Eurasia.

Due to the [[Anna Karenina principle]], surprisingly few animals are suitable for domestication. Diamond identifies six criteria including the animal being sufficiently docile, gregarious, willing to breed in captivity and having a social dominance hierarchy. Therefore, none of the many African mammals such as the [[zebra]], [[antelope]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[African elephant]] were ever domesticated (although some can be tamed, they are not easily bred in captivity). The [[Holocene extinction event]] eliminated many of the [[megafauna]] that, had they survived, might have become candidate species, and [[Holocene extinction event#North America|Diamond argues]] that the pattern of extinction is more severe on continents where animals that had no prior experience of humans were exposed to humans who already possessed advanced hunting techniques (e.g. the Americas and Australia).

Smaller domesticable animals such as dogs, cats, chickens, and [[guinea pig]]s may be valuable in various ways to an agricultural society, but will not be adequate in themselves to sustain large-scale agrarian society. An important example is the use of larger animals such as cattle and horses in plowing land, allowing for much greater crop productivity and the ability to farm a much wider variety of land and soil types than would be possible solely by human muscle power. Large domestic animals also have an important role in the transportation of goods and people over long distances, giving the societies that possess them considerable military and economic advantages.

=== Geography ===
Diamond also argues that geography shaped [[Migration (human)|human migration]], not simply by making travel difficult (particularly by latitude), but by how climates affect where domesticable animals can easily travel and where crops can ideally grow easily due to the sun.

The dominant [[Out of Africa theory]] holds that modern humans developed east of the [[Great Rift Valley]] of the African continent at one time or another. The [[Sahara]] kept people from migrating north to the [[Fertile Crescent]], until later when the [[Nile River]] valley became accommodating.

Diamond continues to describe the story of human development up to the modern era, through the rapid development of technology, and its dire consequences on hunter-gathering cultures around the world.

Diamond touches on why the dominant powers of the last 500 years have been West European rather than East Asian (especially Chinese). The Asian areas in which big civilizations arose had geographical features conducive to the formation of large, stable, isolated empires which faced no external pressure to change which led to stagnation. Europe's many [[natural barrier]]s allowed the development of competing [[nation-state]]s. Such competition forced the European nations to encourage innovation and avoid technological stagnation.

=== Germs ===
In the later context of the [[European colonization of the Americas]], 95% of the indigenous populations are believed to have been [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|killed off by diseases]] brought by the Europeans. Many were killed by infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. Similar circumstances were observed in the [[History of Australia (1788-1850)]] and in [[History of South Africa]]. Aboriginal Australians and the Khoikhoi population were decimated by smallpox, measles, influenza and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blainey|first1=Geoffrey|title=A short history of the world|date=2002|publisher=Dee|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1566635073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smallpox Epidemic Strikes at the Cape|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/smallpox-epidemic-strikes-cape|website=South Africa History Online|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How was it then that diseases native to the American continents did not kill off Europeans? Diamond posits that the most of these diseases were only developed and sustained in large dense populations in villages and cities; he also states most epidemic diseases evolve from similar diseases of domestic animals. The combined effect of the increased population densities supported by agriculture, and of close human proximity to domesticated animals leading to animal diseases infecting humans, resulted in European societies acquiring a much richer collection of dangerous pathogens to which European people had acquired immunity through [[natural selection]] (see the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics) during a longer time than was the case for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[hunter-gatherers]] and farmers. 

He mentions the tropical diseases (mainly [[malaria]]) that limited European penetration into Africa as an exception. Endemic infectious diseases were also barriers to European colonisation of Southeast Asia and New Guinea.

=== Success and failure ===
''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' focuses on why some populations succeeded. His later book, ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', focuses on environmental and other factors that have caused some populations to fail.

== Intellectual background ==
In the 1930s, the [[Annales School]] in France undertook the study of [[Longue durée|long-term historical structures]] by using a synthesis of geography, history, and sociology. Scholars examined the impact of geography, climate, and land use. Although geography had been nearly eliminated as an academic discipline in the United States after the 1960s, several geography-based historical theories were published in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Cohen1998GeographyRedux"&gt;{{cite news| title= Geography Redux: Where You Live Is What You Are | publisher = The New York Times | date=March 21, 1998 | author=Cohen, P. | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D81738F932A15750C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Jared Diamond already considered the question of "why is it that the Eurasians came to dominate other cultures?" in ''[[The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal]]'' (part four).

== Reception ==
''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' won the 1997 [[Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_Infoview.aspx?t=&amp;id=57 | title=1997 Phi Beta Kappa Science Book Award | publisher=Phi Beta Kappa | accessdate=February 16, 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5DBVfgGvk?url=http://www.geeky.net/images/webbadge.gif | archivedate=January 24, 2006 | deadurl=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, it won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]], in recognition of its powerful synthesis of many disciplines, and the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books|Rhône-Poulenc Prize]] for Science Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1998 | title=The Pulitzer Prizes for 1998 | publisher=Columbia University | accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://royalsociety.org/awards/science-books/ | title=Prizes for Science Books previous winners and shortlists | publisher=The [[Royal Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Geographic Society]] produced a documentary of the same title based on the book that was broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in July 2005.&lt;ref name=natgeo/&gt;

=== Academic reviews ===
In a review of ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' that ultimately commended the book, historian Tom Tomlinson wrote, "Given the magnitude of the task he has set himself, it is inevitable that Professor Diamond uses very broad brush-strokes to fill in his argument."&lt;ref name="Tomlinson1998GGSreview"&gt;{{cite web |date=May 1998|url = http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/diamond.html|title = Review:Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies|publisher = Institute of Historical Research | accessdate = 2008-03-14 | last=Tom Tomlinson |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another historian, professor [[J. R. McNeill]], was on the whole complimentary, but thought Diamond oversold geography as an explanation for history and underemphasized cultural autonomy.&lt;ref name="McNeill2001WorldAccordingToDiamond"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The World According to Jared Diamond |url=http://videosdigitals.uab.cat/cr-vet/www/40300/1_2_McNeil01_ht34_world%20according%20to%20Diamond.pdf |author=McNeill, J.R. |journal=The History Teacher |volume=34 |issue=2 |date=February 2001 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |volume=44 |issue=11 |date=June 26, 1997 |author=Jared Diamond; Reply by William H.

In his last book published in 2000, the anthropologist and geographer [[James Morris Blaut]] criticized ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'', among other reasons, for reviving the theory of [[environmental determinism]], and described Diamond as an example of a modern [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] historian.&lt;ref name="Blaut2000EightEurocentricHistorians"&gt;{{cite book | last = James M.

[[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] economist [[J.

John Brätland, an [[Austrian school]] economist of the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]], complained in a ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'' article that ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' entirely neglects individual action, concentrating solely on the centralized state; fails to understand how societies form (assessing that societies do not exist or form without a strong government); and ignores various economical institutions, such as monetary exchange that would allow societies to "rationally reckon scarcities and the value of actions required to replace what is depleted through human use". Instead, the author concludes that because there was no sophisticated division of labor, private property rights, and monetary exchange, societies like that on Easter Island could never progress from the nomadic stage to a complex society. Those factors, according to Brätland, are crucial, and at the same time neglected by Diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/system/tdf/22_1_5.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document |title=An Austrian Reexamination of Recent Thoughts on the Rise and Collapse of Societies |author=John Brätland |date= |website=mises.org |publisher= |access-date=January 9, 2017 |quote=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropologist Jason Antrosio described  ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' as a form of "academic porn," writing, "Diamond's account makes all the factors of European domination a product of a distant and accidental history" and "has almost no role for human agency–the ability people have to make decisions and influence outcomes. Europeans become inadvertent, accidental conquerors. Natives succumb passively to their fate." He added, "Jared Diamond has done a huge disservice to the telling of human history. He has tremendously distorted the role of domestication and agriculture in that history. Unfortunately his story-telling abilities are so compelling that he has seduced a generation of college-educated readers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livinganthropologically.com/archaeology/guns-germs-and-steel-jared-diamond/|title=''Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond: Against History''|website=''Living Anthropologically''|first=Jason|last=Antrosio|date=July 7, 2011|access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' was first published by W. W. Norton in March 1997. It was subsequently published in Great Britain under the title ''Guns, Germs, and Steel: A Short History of Everybody for the Last 13,000 Years'' by Vintage in 1998 ({{ISBN|978-0099302780}}).&lt;ref&gt;Jared Diamond, ''Guns, Germs, and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years'', London: Vintage, 2005 [1997], {{ISBN|0-09-930278-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a selection of [[Book of the Month Club]], History Book Club, Quality Paperback Book Club, and Newbridge Book Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | newspaper = Publishers Weekly | date = December 30, 1998 | url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-393-03891-0 | accessdate = October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">'''Health systems strengthening''' (also '''health system strengthening''', abbreviated '''HSS''') is a term used in [[global health]] that roughly means to improve the health care system of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/hss_glossary/en/index5.html |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |title=Health Systems Strengthening Glossary |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this general definition, it can mean increasing funding for health infrastructure, improving health policy, trying to achieve [[universal healthcare]],&lt;ref name="glassman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Amanda%20Glassman%208-27-13.pdf |title=Conversation with Amanda Glassman on August 27, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |last=Glassman |first=Amanda |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any number of other health measures.

There has been some effort to use a [[systems thinking]] approach to health systems strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hfgproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-Perspectives-in-Health-Systems-Strengthening-Executive-Summary.pdf |publisher=USAID |title=New Perspectives in Health Systems Strengthening}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="systems-thinking-book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44204/1/9789241563895_eng.pdf |title=Systems Thinking for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that use health systems strengthening==

Various health organizations have claimed to use health systems strengthening (while not necessarily agreeing on the definition). Some of these are:

* [[World Health Organization]]
* [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID, uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report);&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt; USAID states that HSS has been "at the core of [its] mission in health for the last 20 years", and defines HSS as "initiating activities in the six internationally accepted core HSS functions – human resources for health; health finance; health governance; health information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; and service delivery".&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/HSS-Vision.pdf |title=USAID's Vision for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=USAID |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GAVI Alliance]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* The [[Global Fund]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[PEPFAR]] (though less developed)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Stop TB Partnership]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Roll Back Malaria]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;

==Reception==

Both the idea of health systems strengthening and the term itself have received attention.

Even advocates of health systems strengthening admit that it can often seem like a "distant, even abstract aim".&lt;ref name=systems-thinking-book/&gt;

Marchal et al., writing in 2009, called the term "vague" and argued that "most current HSS strategies are selective (i.e., they target a specific disease), and their effects may undermine progress towards the long-term goal of effective, high-quality, and inclusive health systems."&lt;ref name="marchal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000059#s2 |title=Global Health Actors Claim To Support Health System Strengthening—Is This Reality or Rhetoric? |authors=Marchal B, Cavalli A, Kegels G |date=April 28, 2009 |publisher=''[[PLOS Medicine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://karengrepin.com/2009/04/are-health-system-strengthening-efforts.html |title=Are health system strengthening efforts just hype? |date=April 29, 2009 |author=Karen Grepin |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Berman]], who was the lead health economist at the [[World Bank]], has pointed out that "Almost any support to health interventions can be considered HSS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTHSD/Resources/376278-1114111154043/1011834-1246449110524/062509BermanUnpackingHealthSystemStrengthening.pdf |author=Peter Berman |date=June 2009 |publisher=World Bank |title=Unpacking Health System Strengthening |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60302">[[File:Americas satellite map.jpg|thumb|280px|A true-color image of the [[Americas]]. Much of the information in the image come from a single remote-sensing modevice—[[NASA]]'s Moderate Resolution Imaging [[Spectroradiometer]], or MODIS, flying over 700 km above the Earth on board the [[Terra satellite]] in 2001.]]

The [[prehistory of the Americas]] ([[North America|North]], [[South America|South]], and [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]]) begins with people migrating to these areas from Asia during the height of an [[Ice Age]]. These groups are generally believed to have been isolated from peoples of the "[[Old World]]" until the coming of Europeans in the 10th century from Norway and with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] in 1492.

The ancestors of today's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indigenous peoples]] were the [[Paleo-Indians]]; they were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who migrated into North America. The most popular theory asserts that migrants came to the [[Americas]] via [[Beringia]], the land mass now covered by the ocean waters of the [[Bering Strait]]. Small [[lithic stage]] peoples followed [[megafauna]] like bison, mammoth (now extinct), and caribou, thus gaining the modern nickname "big-game hunters." Groups of people may also have traveled into North America on shelf or sheet ice along the northern Pacific coast.

Cultural traits brought by the first immigrants later evolved and spawned such cultures as [[Iroquois]] on North America and [[Pirahã people|Pirahã]] of South America. These cultures later developed into [[civilization]]s. In many cases, these cultures expanded at a later date than their Old World counterparts. Cultures that may be considered{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} advanced or civilized include [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], [[Cahokia]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Toltec]], [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Chimor]], [[Mixtec]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]], [[Puebloan]], [[Totonac]], [[Teotihuacan]], [[Huastec people]], [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]], [[Izapa]], [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]], [[Muisca people|Muisca]], and the [[Inca]].{{Human history}}After the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and later [[British Empire|English]], [[French Colonial Empire|French]] and [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] colonial expeditions arrived in the New World, conquering and settling the discovered lands, which led to a transformation of the cultural and physical landscape in the Americas. Spain colonized most of the Americas from present-day [[Southwestern United States]], [[Florida]] and the [[Caribbean]] to the southern tip of South America. Portugal settled in what is mostly present-day [[Brazil]] while England established colonies on the [[Thirteen Colonies|Eastern coast of the United States]], as well as the [[Northwestern United States|North Pacific coast]] and in most of [[Canada]]. France settled in [[Quebec]] and other parts of Eastern [[Canada]] and claimed an area in what is today the central United States. The Netherlands settled New Netherland (administrative centre New Amsterdam - now New York), some Caribbean islands and parts of Northern South America.

European colonization of the Americas led to the rise of new cultures, civilizations and eventually states, which resulted from the fusion of Native American and European traditions, peoples and institutions. The transformation of American cultures through colonization is evident in architecture, religion, gastronomy, the arts and particularly languages, the most widespread being [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (376 million speakers), [[English language|English]] (348 million) and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (201 million). The colonial period lasted approximately three centuries, from the early 16th to the early 19th centuries, when [[Brazil]] and the larger [[Hispanic America]]n nations declared independence. The [[United States]] obtained independence from England much earlier, in 1776, while Canada formed a federal dominion in 1867. Others remained attached to their European parent state until the end of the 19th century, such as [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] which were linked to Spain until 1898. Smaller territories such as [[Guyana]] obtained independence in the mid-20th century, while certain Caribbean islands and [[French Guiana]] remain part of a European power to this day.

&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the [[Beringia|Beringia land bridge]] between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 40,000 – 17,000 years ago, when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the [[Quaternary glaciation]].&lt;ref name="national"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|first1=Drs.

New studies shed light on the founding population of indigenous Americans, suggesting that their ancestry traced to both east Asian and western Eurasians who migrated to North America directly from Siberia. A 2013 study in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] reported that DNA found in the 24,000-year-old remains of a young boy in Mal’ta Siberia suggest that up to one-third of the indigenous Americans may have ancestry that can be traced back to western Eurasians, who may have "had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought"&lt;ref name=Raghavan&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/nature12736 |last1= Raghavan |first1= Maanasa |author2=Pontus Skoglund, Kelly E.

First, it shows that Upper Paleolithic Siberians came from a cosmopolitan population of early modern humans that spread out of Africa to Europe and Central and South Asia. Second, Paleoindian skeletons with phenotypic traits atypical of modern-day Native Americans can be explained as having a direct historical connection to Upper Paleolithic Siberia."

The [[Lithic stage]] or ''[[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian period]]'', is the earliest classification term referring to the first stage of human habitation in the Americas, covering the [[Late Pleistocene]] epoch. The time period derives its name from the appearance of "[[Lithic flake]]d" stone tools. [[Stone tool]]s, particularly [[projectile point]]s and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], are the primary evidence of the earliest well known human activity in the [[Americas]]. [[Lithic reduction]] stone tools are used by [[archaeologists]] and [[anthropologist]]s to classify cultural periods.

===Archaic stage (8000 BCE – 1000 BCE)===
{{see also|Pre-Columbian era|History of Mesoamerica (Paleo-Indian)}}
Several thousand years after the first migrations, the first complex civilizations arose as hunter-gatherers settled into semi-agricultural communities. Identifiable sedentary settlements began to emerge in the so-called Middle [[Archaic stage|Archaic period]] around 6000 BCE. Particular [[archaeological culture]]s can be identified and easily classified throughout the Archaic period.

In the late Archaic, on the north-central coastal region of Peru, a complex civilization arose which has been termed the [[Norte Chico civilization]], also known as Caral-Supe. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of the [[Cradle of civilization|five sites]] where civilization originated independently and indigenously in the ancient world, flourishing between the 30th and 18th centuries BC. It pre-dated the Mesoamerican [[Olmec]] civilization by nearly two millennia. It was contemporaneous with the Egypt following the unification of its kingdom under [[Narmer]] and the emergence of the first [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]].

Monumental architecture, including earthwork platform mounds and sunken plazas have been identified as part of the civilization. Archaeological evidence points to the use of textile technology and the worship of common god symbols. Government, possibly in the form of theocracy, is assumed to have been required to manage the region. However, numerous questions remain about its organization. In archaeological nomenclature, the culture was pre-ceramic culture of the pre-Columbian Late Archaic period. It appears to have lacked ceramics and art.

Ongoing scholarly debate persists over the extent to which the flourishing of Norte Chico resulted from its abundant maritime food resources, and the relationship that these resources would suggest between coastal and inland sites.

The role of seafood in the Norte Chico diet has been a subject of scholarly debate. In 1973, examining the Aspero region of Norte Chico, [[Michael E. Moseley]] contended that a maritime subsistence (seafood) economy had been the basis of society and its early flourishing. This theory, later termed "maritime foundation of Andean Civilization" was at odds with the general scholarly consensus that civilization arose as a result of intensive grain-based agriculture, as had been the case in the emergence of civilizations in northeast Africa (Egypt) and southwest Asia (Mesopotamia).

While earlier research pointed to edible domestic plants such as [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[beans]], [[lucuma]], [[guava]], [[pacay]], and [[camote]] at Caral, publications by Haas and colleagues have added [[avocado]], [[Canna (plant)|achira]], and [[corn]] (Zea Mays) to the list of foods consumed in the region. In 2013, Haas and colleagues reported that maize was a primary component of the diet throughout the period of 3000 to 1800 BC.&lt;ref name=HaasPNAS2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Haas | first1= Jonathan | author2= Winifred Creamer, Luis Huamán Mesía, David Goldstein, Karl Reinhard, and Cindy Vergel Rodríguez | year = 2013 | title = Evidence for maize (Zea mays) in the Late Archaic (3000–1800 B.C.) in the Norte Chico region of Peru |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 13 |pages = 4945–4949 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.1219425110 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1219425110 |accessdate = 2013-11-20 | publisher = National Academy of Sciences of the United States |quote=New data drawn from coprolites, pollen records, and stone tool residues, combined with 126 radiocarbon dates, demonstrate that maize was widely grown, intensively processed, and constituted a primary component of the diet throughout the period from 3000 to 1800 B.C. | pmid=23440194 | pmc=3612639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cotton]] was another widespread crop in Norte Chico, essential to the production of fishing nets and textiles. Jonathan Haas noted a mutual dependency, whereby "The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their protein and the fishermen needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish."

In the 2005 book ''[[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]]'', journalist Charles C. Mann surveyed the literature at the time, reporting a date "sometime before 3200 BC, and possibly before 3500 BC" as the beginning date for the formation of Norte Chico. He notes that the earliest date securely associated with a city is 3500 BC, at [[Huaricanga]] in the (inland) Fortaleza area.

The Norte Chico civilization began to decline around 1800 BC as more powerful centers appeared to the south and north along its coast, and to the east within the Andes Mountains.

After the decline of the Norte Chico civilization, several large, centralized civilizations developed in the Western Hemisphere: [[Chavín culture|Chavin]], [[Nazca]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], [[Huari culture|Huari]], [[Quitus]], [[Cañari]]s, [[Chimu]], [[Pachacamac]], [[Tiahuanaco]], [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Inca]] in the Central [[Andes]] (Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia); [[Muisca people|Muisca]] in Colombia ; [[Taínos]] in Dominican Republic (Hispaniola, Española) and part of Caribbean; and the [[Olmec]]s, [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Toltec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], [[Aztec]]s and [[Purépecha people|Purepecha]] in southern North America (Mexico, Guatemala).

The [[Olmec]] civilization was the first Mesoamerican civilization, beginning around 1600-1400 BC and ending around 400 BC. Mesoamerica is considered one of the [[Cradle of civilization|six sites]] around the globe in which civilization developed independently and indigenously. This civilization is considered the mother culture of the Mesoamerican civilizations. The Mesoamerican calendar, numeral system, writing, and much of the Mesoamerican pantheon seem to have begun with the Olmec.

Some elements of agriculture seem to have been practiced in Mesoamerica quite early. The [[Maize#Origin|domestication of maize]] is thought to have begun around 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. The earliest record of lowland maize cultivation dates to around 5100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/I/20035654.html |title=Agriculture's origin may be hidden in 'invisible' clues |publisher=Scienceblog.com |date=2003-02-14 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture continued to be mixed with a hunting-gathering-fishing lifestyle until quite late compared to other regions, but by 2700 BC, Mesoamericans were relying on maize, and living mostly in villages. Temple mounds and classes started to appear. By 1300/ 1200 BC, small centres coalesced into the Olmec civilization, which seems to have been a set of city-states, united in religious and commercial concerns. The Olmec cities had ceremonial complexes with earth/clay pyramids, palaces, stone monuments, aqueducts and walled plazas. The first of these centers was at San Lorenzo (until 900 bc). La Venta was the last great Olmec centre. Olmec artisans sculpted jade and clay figurines of Jaguars and humans. Their iconic giant heads - believed to be of Olmec rulers - stood in every major city.

The Olmec civilization ended in 400 BC, with the defacing and destruction of San Lorenzo and La Venta, two of the major cities. It nevertheless spawned many other states, most notably the Mayan civilization, whose first cities began appearing around 700-600 BC. Olmec influences continued to appear in many later Mesoamerican civilizations.

Cities of the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas were as large and organized as the largest in the Old World, with an estimated population of 200,000 to 350,000 in [[Tenochtitlan]], the capital of the [[Aztec empire]]. The market established in the city was said to have been the largest ever seen by the [[conquistador]]s when they arrived. The capital of the Cahokians, [[Cahokia]], located near modern [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], may have reached a population of over 20,000. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia may have been the most populous city in North America. [[Monk's Mound]], the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric New World.

These civilizations developed agriculture as well, breeding [[maize]] (corn) from having ears 2–5&amp;nbsp;cm in length to perhaps 10–15&amp;nbsp;cm in length. [[Potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[pumpkin]]s, [[bean]]s, [[avocado]]s, and [[chocolate]] are now the most popular of the pre-Columbian agricultural products. The civilizations did not develop extensive livestock as there were few suitable species, although [[alpaca]]s and [[llama]]s were domesticated for use as beasts of burden and sources of wool and meat in the [[Andes]]. By the 15th century, maize was being farmed in the [[Mississippi River]] Valley after introduction from [[Mexico]]. The course of further agricultural development was greatly altered by the arrival of [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]].

{{main|Iroquois}}
The [[Iroquois|Iroquois League of Nations]] or "People of the Long House", based in present-day upstate and western [[New York (state)|New York]], had a [[Confederation|confederacy]] model from the mid-15th&amp;nbsp;century.  It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the later United States government. Their system of affiliation was a kind of federation, different from the strong, centralized European monarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=33 questions about American history you're not supposed to ask |first=Thomas E |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCMcnBRKR-0C&amp;pg=PA62 |last= Woods |page=62|publisher=Crown Forum |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-307-34668-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=R |year=2005 |title=Stolen Continents: 500 Years of Conquest and Resistance in the Americas |publisher=Mariner Books |isbn=0-618-49240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tooker"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Clifton JA |title=The Invented Indian: Cultural Fictions and Government Policies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ARbVmr941TsC&amp;pg=PA107|publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, N.J. |year=1990 |pages=107–128 |chapter=The United States Constitution and the Iroquois League |isbn=1-56000-745-1|author=Tooker E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership was restricted to a group of 50 [[sachem]] [[Tribal chief|chief]]s, each representing one [[clan]] within a tribe; the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] and [[Mohawk people]] had nine seats each; the [[Onondaga people|Onondagas]] held fourteen; the [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] had ten seats; and the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] had eight. Representation was not based on population numbers, as the Seneca tribe greatly outnumbered the others. When a sachem chief died, his successor was chosen by the senior woman of his tribe in consultation with other female members of the clan; property and hereditary leadership were passed [[matrilineality|matrilineally]]. Decisions were not made through voting but through consensus decision making, with each sachem chief holding theoretical [[Veto|veto power]]. The Onondaga were the "[[firekeeper]]s", responsible for raising topics to be discussed. They occupied one side of a three-sided fire (the Mohawk and Seneca sat on one side of the fire, the Oneida and Cayuga sat on the third side.)&lt;ref name="Tooker"/&gt;

Elizabeth Tooker, an [[anthropologist]], has said that it was unlikely the US founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy, as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the United States. For example, it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership, selected by female members of the tribes, consensus decision-making regardless of population size of the tribes, and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body.&lt;ref name="Tooker"/&gt;

Long-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds. Historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, or in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century [[Beaver Wars]].&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS001.html |title=Osage |publisher=Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture |accessdate=2010-11-29 |last=Burns |first=LF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102050914/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OS001.html |archivedate=2011-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through warfare, the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River. Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Kaw people|Kaw]], [[Ponca]] and [[Omaha people]]. By the mid-17th century, they had resettled in their historical lands in present-day [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. The Osage warred with [[Caddo]]-speaking Native Americans, displacing them in turn by the mid-18th century and dominating their new historical territories.&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt;

Chichimeca was the name that the [[Aztec|Mexica]] (Aztecs) generically applied to a wide range of semi-[[nomad]]ic peoples who inhabited the north of modern-day [[Mexico]], and carried the same sense as the European term "[[barbarian]]". The name was adopted with a pejorative tone by the Spaniards when referring especially to the semi-nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples of northern Mexico.

====Mesoamerica====
{{main|Mesoamerica}}

;Zapotec
The [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] emerged around 1500 years BCE. Their writing system influenced the later Olmec. They left behind the great city [[Monte Alban]].

;Olmec
The [[Olmec]] civilization emerged around 1200 BCE in [[Mesoamerica]] and ended around 400 BCE. Olmec art and concepts influenced surrounding cultures after their downfall. This civilization was thought to be the first in America to develop a writing system. After the Olmecs abandoned their cities for unknown reasons, the Maya, Zapotec and Teotihuacan arose.

;Purepecha
The [[Purépecha people|Purepecha]] civilization emerged around 1000 CE in [[Mesoamerica]] . They flourished from 1100 CE to 1530 CE. They continue to live on in the state of [[Michoacán]]. Fierce warriors, they were never conquered and in their glory years, successfully sealed off huge areas from Aztec domination.

;Maya
{{main|History of the Maya civilization}}
[[Maya civilization|Maya]] history spans 3,000 years. The [[Classic Maya collapse|Classic Maya]] may have collapsed due to changing climate in the end of the 10th century.

;Toltec
The [[Toltec]] were a nomadic people, dating from the 10th - 12th century, whose language was also spoken by the Aztecs.

;Teotihuacan
[[Teotihuacan]] (4th century BCE - 7/8th century CE) was both a city, and an empire of the same name, which, at its zenith between 150 and the 5th century, covered most of Mesoamerica.

;Aztec
The [[Aztec]] having started to build their empire around 14th century found their civilization abruptly ended by the Spanish conquistadors. They lived in Mesoamerica, and surrounding lands. Their capital city Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities of all time.

;Norte Chico
The oldest known civilization of the Americas was established in the [[Norte Chico (Peruvian region)|Norte Chico]] region of modern Peru. Complex society emerged in the group of coastal valleys, between 3000 and 1800 BCE. The [[Quipu]], a distinctive recording device among Andean civilizations, apparently dates from the era of Norte Chico's prominence.

;Chavín
The [[Chavín]] established a trade network and developed agriculture by as early as (or late compared to the Old World) 900 BCE according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín in modern [[Peru]] at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavín civilization spanned from 900 BCE to 300 BCE.

;[[Inca]]
Holding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533.
Known as ''Tahuantinsuyu'', or "the land of the four regions", in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the Inca culture was highly distinct and developed. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful [[Trepanning|trepanation]] of the skull in Inca civilization.

Around 1000, the [[Vikings]] established a short-lived settlement in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], now known as [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]. Speculations exist about other Old World discoveries of the New World, but none of these are generally or completely accepted by most scholars.

Spain sponsored a major exploration led by Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492; it quickly led to extensive [[European colonization of the Americas]]. The Europeans brought Old World diseases which are thought to have caused catastrophic epidemics and a huge decrease of the native population. Columbus came at a time in which many technical developments in sailing techniques and communication made it possible to report his voyages easily and to spread word of them throughout Europe. It was also a time of growing religious, imperial and economic rivalries that led to a competition for the establishment of colonies.

===Colonial period===

===Decolonization===
{{details|Decolonization of the Americas}}
The formation of sovereign states in the New World began with the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776. The [[American Revolutionary War]] lasted through the period of the [[Siege of Yorktown]] — its last major campaign — in the early autumn of 1781, with peace being achieved [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|in 1783]].
 
The Spanish colonies won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century, in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]]. [[Simón Bolívar]] and [[José de San Martín]], among others, led their independence struggle. Although Bolivar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of Latin America politically allied, they rapidly became independent of one another as well, and several further wars were fought, such as the [[Paraguayan War]] and the [[War of the Pacific]]. (See [[Latin American integration]].) In the Portuguese colony [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese [[monarch|king]] [[Dom João VI]], proclaimed the country's independence in 1822 and became Brazil's first [[Emperor]]. This was peacefully accepted by the crown in Portugal, upon compensation.

As a part of the [[British Empire]], Canada immediately entered World War I when it broke out in 1914. Canada bore the brunt of several major battles during the early stages of the war, including the use of [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] attacks at [[Second Battle of Ypres|Ypres]]. Losses became grave, and the government eventually brought in [[conscription]], despite the fact this was against the wishes of the majority of [[French Canadians]]. In the ensuing [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]], riots broke out on the streets of [[Montreal]]. In neighboring Newfoundland, the new dominion suffered a devastating loss on July 1, 1916, the [[First day on the Somme]].

The United States stayed out of the conflict [[American entry into World War I|until 1917]], when it joined the Entente powers. The United States was then able to play a crucial role at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]] that shaped [[interwar]] Europe. Mexico was not part of the war, as the country was embroiled in the Mexican Revolution at the time.

{{further|Roaring Twenties|Great Depression|Cristero War}}

The 1920s brought an age of great prosperity in the United States, and to a lesser degree Canada. But the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] combined with [[dust bowl|drought]] ushered in a period of economic hardship in the United States and [[Great Depression in Canada|Canada]]. From 1936 to 1949, there was a popular uprising against the anti-Catholic Mexican government of the time, set off specifically by the anti-clerical provisions of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1917]].

Once again, Canada found itself at war before its neighbors, however even Canadian contributions were slight before the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The entry of the United States into the war helped to tip the balance in favour of the [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. Two Mexican tankers, transporting oil to the United States, were attacked and sunk by the Germans in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] waters, in 1942. The incident happened in spite of Mexico's neutrality at that time. This led Mexico to enter the conflict with a declaration of war on the Axis nations. The destruction of Europe wrought by the war vaulted all North American countries to more important roles in world affairs, especially the United States, which emerged as a "[[superpower]]".

{{further|History of the United States (1945–64)|History of Canada (1945–60)|Civil rights movement}}

The early Cold War era saw the United States as the most powerful nation in a Western coalition of which Mexico and Canada were also a part. In Canada, Quebec was transformed by the [[Quiet Revolution]] and the emergence of [[Quebec nationalism]]. Mexico experienced an era of huge economic growth after World War II, a heavy industrialization process and a growth of its middle class, a period known in Mexican history as ''"El Milagro Mexicano"'' (the Mexican miracle). The Caribbean saw the beginnings of [[decolonization]], while on the largest island the [[Cuban Revolution]] introduced Cold War rivalries into Latin America.

{{further|History of the United States (1964–80)|History of Canada (1960–81)}}

The [[civil rights movement]] in the U.S. ended [[Jim Crow]] and empowered black voters in the 1960s, which allowed black citizens to move into high government offices for the first time since Reconstruction. However, the dominant [[New Deal coalition]] collapsed in the mid 1960s in disputes over race and the [[Vietnam War]], and the conservative movement began its rise to power, as [[Modern liberalism in the United States|the once dominant liberalism weakened and collapsed]]. Canada during this era was dominated by the leadership of [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]]. In 1982, at the end of his tenure, Canada enshrined a new constitution.

{{further|History of the United States (1980–91)|History of Canada (1982–92)}}

Canada's [[Brian Mulroney]] not only ran on a similar platform but also favored closer trade ties with the United States. This led to the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] in January 1989. Mexican presidents [[Miguel de la Madrid]], in the early 1980s and [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president [[Ronald Reagan]] attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw as an attempt to assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community. Domestically, Reagan attempted to bring in a package of [[privatization]] and [[regulation]] to stimulate the economy.

{{further|History of the United States (1991–present)|History of Canada (1992–present)}}

The end of the Cold War and the beginning of the era of sustained economic expansion coincided during the 1990s. On January 1, 1994, Canada, Mexico and the United States signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], creating the world's largest free trade area. In 2000, [[Vicente Fox]] became the first non-[[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] candidate to win the Mexican presidency in over 70 years. The optimism of the 1990s was shattered by the [[9/11]] attacks of 2001 on the United States, which prompted military intervention in [[Afghanistan]], which also involved Canada. Canada did not support the United States' later move to [[Iraq War|invade Iraq]], however.

In the U.S. the [[Reagan Era]] of conservative national policies, deregulation and tax cuts took control with the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980. By 2010, political scientists were debating whether the election of [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 represented an end of the Reagan Era, or was only a reaction against the bubble economy of the 2000s (decade), which burst in 2008 and became the [[Late-2000s recession]] with prolonged unemployment.

{{main|History of Central America}}
{{see also|History of Belize|History of Costa Rica|History of El Salvador|History of Guatemala|History of Honduras|History of Nicaragua|History of Panama}}
Despite the failure of a lasting political union, the concept of Central American reunification, though lacking enthusiasm from the leaders of the individual countries, rises from time to time. In 1856&amp;ndash;1857 the region successfully established a military coalition to repel an invasion by United States adventurer [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. Today, all five nations fly [[flag]]s that retain the old federal motif of two outer blue bands bounding an inner white stripe. (Costa Rica, traditionally the least committed of the five to regional integration, modified its flag significantly in 1848 by darkening the blue and adding a double-wide inner red band, in honor of the French tricolor).

In 1907, a [[Central American Court of Justice]] was created. On December 13, 1960, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua established the [[Central American Common Market]] ("CACM"). Costa Rica, because of its relative economic prosperity and political stability, chose not to participate in the CACM. The goals for the CACM were to create greater political unification and success of [[import substitution industrialization]] policies. The project was an immediate economic success, but was abandoned after the 1969 "[[Football War]]" between El Salvador and Honduras. A [[Central American Parliament]] has operated, as a purely advisory body, since 1991. Costa Rica has repeatedly declined invitations to join the regional parliament, which seats deputies from the four other former members of the Union, as well as from [[Panama]] and the [[Dominican Republic]].

===South America===
{{see also|History of South America}}
In the 1960s and 1970s, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.-aligned military dictatorships. These dictatorships detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed (on inter-state collaboration, see [[Operation Condor]]). Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the United States [[Cold War]] doctrine of "National Security" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an [[Internal conflict in Peru|internal conflict]] (see [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] and [[Shining Path]]). Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships have been common, but starting in the 1980s a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now. Allegations of corruption remain common, and several nations have seen crises which have forced the resignation of their presidents, although normal civilian succession has continued.

[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] became a notable problem, as most recently illustrated by [[Argentina]]'s [[Argentine economic crisis (1999&amp;ndash;2002)|default]] in the early 21st century. In recent years, South American governments have drifted to the left, with [[socialist]] leaders being elected in Chile, [[Bolivia]], Brazil, [[Venezuela]], and a leftist president in Argentina and [[Uruguay]]. Despite the move to the left, South America is still largely capitalist. With the founding of the [[Union of South American Nations]], South America has started down the road of economic integration, with plans for political integration in the [[European Union]] style.

The '''IU School of Public Health-Bloomington''' is an undergraduate and graduate school at [[Indiana University Bloomington]]. Until 2012, it was the School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation (HPER). Now, the School of Public Health on IU's Bloomington campus is the largest school of public health in the [[Big Ten Conference|Big 10]]. With 2,790 [[undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] students, it offers 34 different degrees. It has five academic departments.

The mission of the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington is to promote health among individuals and communities in Indiana, the nation, and the world through integrated multidisciplinary approaches to research and creative activities, teaching, and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealth.indiana.edu/about/profile.shtml|title=Mission, Goals, and Objectives: About Us: School of Public Health: Indiana University Bloomington|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The precursor to the '''School of Public Health-Bloomington''', the School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, was founded in 1946. In 2012, the school became the School of Public Health-Bloomington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news-archive/23199.html|title=IU School of Public Health-Bloomington formally named, celebrated: IU News Room: Indiana University|website=newsinfo.iu.edu|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school earned accreditation from the [[Council on Education for Public Health]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publichealth.indiana.edu/about/accreditation/|title=The newly named Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington, has a long, proud history of outstanding achievements across an array of academic fields related health, wellness, and disease-prevention.|website=www.publichealth.indiana.edu|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the oldest Master of Public Health program, established in 1969, in the state of Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publichealth.indiana.edu/about/history.shtml|title=The newly named Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington, has a long, proud history of outstanding achievements across an array of academic fields related health, wellness, and disease-prevention.|website=www.publichealth.indiana.edu|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A history book, titled "A Legacy Transformed", about the school's origins and transformation into the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington, was published in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://info.publichealth.indiana.edu/releases/iub/sph/2016/05/new_sph_history_book.shtml|title=New book details the history of the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington: News: School of Public Health: Indiana University Bloomington|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13731">[[Integer factorization]] is the process of determining which [[prime number]]s divide a given positive [[integer]]. Doing this quickly has applications in [[cryptography]]. The difficulty depends on both the size and form of the number and its [[prime factor]]s; it is currently very difficult to factorize large [[semiprimes]] (and, indeed, most numbers which have no small factors).

== Numbers of a general form ==

The first very large distributed factorisation was RSA129, a challenge number described in the Scientific American article of 1977 which first popularised the RSA cryptosystem. It was factorised between September 1993 and April 1994, using [[quadratic sieve|MPQS]], with relations contributed by about 600 people from all over the Internet, and the final stages of the calculation performed on a [[MasPar]] supercomputer at Bell Labs.

Between January and August 1999, [[RSA-155]], a challenge number prepared by the RSA company, was factorised using [[number field sieve|GNFS]] with relations again contributed by a large group, and the final stages of the calculation performed in just over nine days on the [[Cray]] [[Cray C90|C916]] supercomputer at the SARA Amsterdam Academic Computer Center.

In January 2002, Franke et al. announced the factorisation of a 158-digit cofactor of 2&lt;sup&gt;953&lt;/sup&gt;+1, using a couple of months on about 25 PCs at the [[University of Bonn]], with the final stages done using a cluster of six Pentium-III PCs.

In April 2003, the same team factored [[RSA-160]] using about a hundred CPUs at [[Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik|BSI]], with the final stages of the calculation done using 25 processors of an [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] [[SGI Origin 200|Origin]] supercomputer.

The 174-digit [[RSA-576]] was factored by Franke, Kleinjung and members of the [[NFSNET]] collaboration in December 2003, using resources at BSI and the University of Bonn; soon afterwards, Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama, Sonoda and Ueda announced that they had factored a 164-digit cofactor of 2&lt;sup&gt;1826&lt;/sup&gt;+1.

A 176-digit cofactor of 11&lt;sup&gt;281&lt;/sup&gt;+1 was factored by Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama and Ueda between February and May 2005 using machines at [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] and [[Rikkyo University]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/records/11_281+ |accessdate=2007-05-23 |title=Factorization of 176-digit number|author1=K. Aoki |author2=Y. Kida |author3=T. Shimoyama |author4=H. Ueda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[RSA-200]] challenge number was factored by Franke, Kleinjung et al. between December 2003 and May 2005, using a cluster of 80 Opteron processors at BSI in Germany; the announcement was made on 9 May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/records/rsa200|accessdate=2007-05-23 |title=RSA200|author1=F. Bahr |author2=M. Boehm |author3=J. Franke |author4=T. Kleinjung }}&lt;/ref&gt; They later (November 2005) factored the slightly smaller [[RSA-640]] challenge number.

On December 12, 2009, a team including researchers from the [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|CWI]], the [[EPFL]], [[INRIA]] and NTT in addition to the authors of the previous record factored [[RSA-768]], a 232-digit semiprime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/006.pdf|accessdate=2013-04-11 |title=Factorization of a 768-bit RSA modulus|author1=T.

years of computing on a single core 2.2&amp;nbsp;GHz [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Opteron]].

12&lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 542 bits (163 digits), was factored between April and July 1993 by a team at [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|CWI]] and [[Oregon State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krum.rz.uni-mannheim.de/cabench/sieve-record.html|accessdate=2007-11-23|title=Record Number Field Sieve Factorisations|author=P.

2&lt;sup&gt;773&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, of 774 bits (233 digits), was factored between April and November 2000 by 'The Cabal', with the matrix step done over 250 hours on the Cray also used for RSA-155.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.cwi.nl/herman/SNFSrecords/SNFS-233|accessdate=2007-11-23|title=233-digit SNFS factorization|author='The Cabal'|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128061126/http://ftp.cwi.nl/herman/SNFSrecords/SNFS-233|archivedate=2007-11-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2&lt;sup&gt;809&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 809 bits (244 digits), had its factorisation announced at the start of January 2003. Sieving was done at the CWI, at the Scientific Computing Institute and the Pure Mathematics Department at Bonn University, and using private resources of J. Franke, T. Kleinjung and the family of F. Bahr. The linear algebra step was done by P. Montgomery at SARA in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.cwi.nl/herman/SNFSrecords/SNFS-244|accessdate=2007-11-23|title=M809|author=J.

6&lt;sup&gt;353&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 911 bits (275 digits), was factored by Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama and Ueda between September 2005 and January 2006 using [[special number field sieve|SNFS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/records/6353|accessdate=2007-05-23 |title=SNFS274|author1=K.

2&lt;sup&gt;1039&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 1039 bits (313 digits) (though a factor of 23 bits was already known) was factored between September 2006 and May 2007 by a group including K. Aoki, J. Franke, T. Kleinjung, [[A. K. Lenstra]] and D. A. Osvik, using computers at [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]], [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]] and the [[University of Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0705&amp;L=nmbrthry&amp;T=0&amp;P=1019  |accessdate=2007-05-23 | title=Factorization of the 1039th Mersenne number |author1=K.

2&lt;sup&gt;1061&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 1061 bits (320 digits) was factored between early 2011 and 4 August 2012 by a group headed by Greg Childers at CSU Fullerton, using the nfs@home [[BOINC]] project for about 300 CPU-years of sieving; the linear algebra was run at the Trestles cluster at SDSC and the Lonestar cluster at TACC and needed additional 35 CPU-years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/444 |title=Factorization of a 1061-bit number by the Special Number Field Sieve |author=Greg Childers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleinjung, J. Bos and [[A. K. Lenstra]], starting in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/653 | title=Mersenne Factorization Factory |author1=Thorsten Kleinjung |author2=Joppe W Bos |author3=Arjen K Lenstra | accessdate=2015-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be precise, n=1081 was completed on 11 March 2013; n=1111 on 13 June 2013; n=1129 on 20 September 2013; n=1153 on 28 October 2013; n=1159 on 9 February 2014; 1177 on May 29, 2014, n=1193 on 22 August 2014, and n=1199 on December 11, 2014; the first detailed announcement was made in late August 2014.  The total effort for the project is of the order of 7500 CPU-years on 2.2&amp;nbsp;GHz Opterons, with roughly 5700 years spent sieving and 1800 years on linear algebra.

==Comparison to efforts by individuals==

As of the end of 2007, thanks to the constant decline in memory prices, the ready availability of multi-core 64-bit computers, and the availability of the efficient sieving code (developed by Thorsten Kleinjung of the Bonn group) via ggnfs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=140917 |title=GGNFS suite -  Browse Files at SourceForge.net |website=sourceforge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of robust open-source software such as msieve&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boo.net/~jasonp/qs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213020640/http://www.boo.net/~jasonp/qs.html |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the finishing stages, special-form numbers of up to 750 bits and general-form numbers of up to about 520 bits can be factored in a few months on a few PCs by a single person without any special mathematical experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=124079&amp;postcount=97 |title=mersenneforum.org - View Single Post -  2LM Table |website=www.mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These bounds increase to about 950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=201624&amp;postcount=106 |title=mersenneforum.org - View Single Post -  A computation worthy of the name |website=www.mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 600&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=149332&amp;postcount=114 |title=mersenneforum.org - View Single Post -  5^421-1 sieving (reservations closed) |website=www.mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; if it were possible to secure the collaboration of a few dozen PCs for sieving; currently the amount of memory and the CPU power of a single machine for the finishing stage are equal barriers to progress.

In 2009, Benjamin Moody factored a 512-bit RSA key used to sign the [[TI-83 series|TI-83]] graphing calculator using software found on the internet; this eventually led to the [[Texas Instruments signing key controversy]].

In September 2013, the 696-bit [[RSA numbers#RSA-210|RSA-210]] was factored by Ryan Propper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=18626 |title=RSA-210 factored - mersenneforum.org |website=mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; using institutional resources; between March 2013 and October 2014, another 210-digit number (the 117th term in the 'home prime sequence' starting with 49) was completed by a user known as WraithX,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=389048&amp;postcount=98 |title=mersenneforum.org - View Single Post -  HP49(119)... |website=www.mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; using $7600 worth of processing time on Amazon EC2 machines for the sieving, and four months on a dual Xeon E5-2687W v1 for the linear algebra.

'''Inter Press Service''' ('''IPS''') is a global [[news agency]]. Its main focus is the production of news and analysis about events and processes affecting economic, social and political [[international development|development]]. The agency largely covers news on the [[Global South]], [[civil society]], and [[globalization]].

==History==
Inter Press Service was set up in 1964 as a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] international [[cooperative]] of journalists. Its founders were the Italian journalist [[Roberto Savio]] and the Argentine political scientist Pablo Piacentini. Initially, the primary objective of IPS was to fill the information gap between Europe and Latin America after the political turbulence following the [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959 (Giffard in Salwen and Garrison, 1991).&lt;ref name=history&gt;IPS, [http://www.ips.org/institutional/get-to-know-us-2/our-history/ Our history]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the network expanded to include all continents, beginning with a Latin American base in Costa Rica in 1982,&lt;ref name=history/&gt; and extended its editorial focus. In 1994, IPS changed its legal status to that of a "public-benefit organization for development cooperation".

In 1996 IPS had permanent offices and correspondents in 41 countries, covering 108 nations. It had as subscribers over 600 print media, around 80 news agencies and database services, and 65 broadcast media, in addition to over 500 NGOs and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Giffard, C. Anthony (1998) "[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6dNtpqQa1zoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA194 Alternative News Agencies]" In: Boyd-Barrett, O. and Rantanen, T.; eds. (1998) ''The Globalization of News''. London: Sage Publications, p194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==
[[File:Talk Nation Radio - 2011-02-28 Dahr Jamail, Uprisings and Oil in the Middle East.vorb.oga|thumb|Dahr Jamail, on his Al Jazeera and Inter Press Service News reports]]
IPS’s stated aims are to give prominence to the voices of [[marginalization|marginalized]] and vulnerable people and groups, report from the perspectives of [[developing country|developing countries]], and to reflect the views of [[civil society]]. The mainstreaming of [[gender]] in reporting and the assessment of the impacts of [[globalization]] are a priority.

IPS may be unique in its concentration on [[developing country|developing countries]] and the strong relationships with [[civil society]]. For this reason, IPS has even been termed the probably "largest and most credible of all 'alternatives' in the world of news agencies" (Boyd-Barrett and Rantanen, 1998: 174/5),&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett, Oliver and Rantanen, Terhi; eds. (1998) ''The Globalization of News'' London: Sage Publication&lt;/ref&gt; being the "first and only independent and professional news agency which provides on a daily basis information with a Third World focus and point of view" (Boyd-Barrett and Thussu, 1992: 94; cf. Giffard, 1998: 191; Fenby, 1986).

Despite all the laudable aims, it is, however, important to see that IPS has never possessed the resources to be a major player in the international media landscape. Because of its focus on longer background pieces focusses on development issues impacting the lives of people in the South instead of concise news, it is yet to be a news provider for mainstream media in developed countries. In fairness to IPS, mainstream media often rely on their own fly in and out journalists from where IPS reports.

==Legal status==
IPS is registered as an international [[non-profit organization|not-for-profit association]]. It has 'general' NGO consultative status with [[ECOSOC]] at the [[United Nations]], and the [[OECD]] status of [[Official Development Assistance|"ODA eligible international organization"]].

==Organizational structure==
Five editorial desks coordinate the network of journalists around the world: Montevideo (regional bureau for Latin America), Berlin-London (Europe and the Mediterranean), Bangkok (Asia and the Pacific), New York (North America and the Caribbean) and Johannesburg (Africa). Most of IPS's journalists and editors are native to the country or region in which they are working.

IPS receives funding from various sources: through its subscribers and media clients, as beneficiary of multilateral and national development cooperation programmes, and as recipient of project financing from [[Foundation (charity)|foundations]]. It is not, as most other agencies, financed by a country or a group of newspapers. Hence, the agency’s budget is comparatively small. Still it manages to be "roughly the sixth largest international news-gathering organization" (Rauch, 2003: 89).

==IPS's role in the mediascape==
The actual role of IPS in the international [[mediascape]] is hard to assess. Clipping services are expensive, and do not exist in many countries where IPS is strong. Additionally, in some countries news agencies are not credited in bylines. One study by the UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] for media coverage of the FAO in 1991 found that of the nearly 3000 clippings with news agency bylines, 13% credited IPS, making it the third-most cited agency. IPS reports were collected from 138 different publications in 39 countries - more countries than any other agency. IPS was particularly strong in Latin America - 72% of clippings from Latin America with news agency bylines came from IPS.&lt;ref&gt;Giffard (1998:195)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Vaccine Institute''' (IVI) is an independent, nonprofit, international organization that was founded on the belief that the health of children in developing countries can be dramatically improved by the use of new and improved [[vaccines]]. Working in collaboration with the international scientific community, public health organizations, governments, and industry, IVI is involved in all areas of the vaccine spectrum – from new vaccine design in the laboratory to vaccine development and evaluation in the field to facilitating sustainable introduction of vaccines in countries where they are most needed.

Created initially as an initiative of the [[United Nations Development Programme|UN Development Programme]] (UNDP), IVI began formal operations as an independent international organization in 1997 in [[Seoul]], [[Republic of Korea]]. Currently, IVI has 35 countries and the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]] as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. The Institute has a unique mandate to work exclusively on vaccine development and introduction specifically for people in developing countries, with a focus on neglected diseases affecting these regions.

== History ==

=== Background ===
In 1992, Dr. Seung-Il Shin, then Senior Health Advisor for the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]], initiated a study to explore the feasibility of establishing an international institute devoted to vaccine research and development within the framework of the Children’s Vaccine Initiative (CVI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/seung-il-shin|title=Seung Il Shin - Founder &amp;amp; Board Director @ Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on the results of Dr. Shin’s feasibility study, in 1993 the UNDP adopted a formal proposal to establish the International Vaccine Institute (IVI). In 1994, following a call for proposals to host IVI in the Asia Pacific region, the UNDP and the Republic of Korea reached an agreement to host the center in Seoul. In 1995, UNDP opened an interim IVI office on the campus of Seoul National University and the Institute began its initial work and organizational development.

[[File:Establishment Agreement Signing.jpg|thumb|330x330px|Signing of the IVI Establishment Agreement]]

=== Foundation ===
In 1995 and 1996, the UNDP and the South Korean government jointly developed the basic framework and Constitution of IVI. In order to establish IVI as an independent international organization, the UNDP and Korean government elected to establish the institute through an intergovernmental agreement of UN member states, as sanctioned in the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties of 1969]].

On October 28, 1996, the IVI Establishment Agreement opened for signatures at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN headquarters]] in New York City. Representatives of [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Panama]], [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Romania]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Uzbekistan]], and the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] were the first to sign the agreement, followed shortly thereafter by [[Senegal]] and [[Philippines|the Philippines]].

In 1997 more countries followed, with [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Jamaica]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Peru]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sweden]], [[Tajikistan]], and Turkey signing the Agreement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IX-3&amp;chapter=9&amp;clang=_en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 1997, The IVI Establishment Agreement entered into force following the submission of instruments of ratification by South Korea, Sweden, and Uzbekistan. The IVI Establishment Agreement entered the [[Treaty series#United Nations|United Nations Depository of Treaties]] under Chapter IX. HEALTH, section 3.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On September 24, 1998 the IVI Headquarters Agreement was signed at a formal ceremony at [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP headquarters]] by South Korea’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon. [[Hong Soon-young|Hong Soon-Young]] and IVI Board Chairman, [[Barry Bloom|Dr. Barry Bloom]]. The Headquarters Agreement established IVI as a legal entity with diplomatic immunity in South Korea,, becoming the first international organization to be headquartered in South Korea. In accordance with IVI’s independent status, the Institute formally separated from the UNDP in 1998. 
[[File:IVI Building (1).jpg|thumb|290x290px|IVI Headquarters]]

=== Headquarters building ===
The IVI headquarters building, located in [[Seoul National University]]’s Research Park in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], was designed by a consortium consisting of [[Samoo Architects &amp; Engineers|Samwoo Architects]] of South Korea and [https://www.payette.com/ Payette Associates] of Boston, USA. Construction began in 1998 and was completed in 2003. The building houses laboratories, animal facilities, offices, an auditorium, and a library. A separate 1,300m² pilot plant facility, intended for the production of test lots of vaccines for training and evaluation purposes, was constructed but never completed due to a lack of funding.

== Previous activities ==

=== Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) 2000-2006 ===

IVI’s first major initiative, Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) was a program of research and technical assistance to accelerate the introduction of new vaccines against [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]], and [[shigellosis]] into public health programs for the poor in developing countries. From 2000 to 2006, IVI’s DOMI program carried out vaccination campaigns, disease surveillance, and research studies in [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mozambique]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. &amp;nbsp;At the conclusion of the DOMI program, IVI synthesized the diverse epidemiological, clinical, economic, and behavioral findings of these studies in order to facilitate informed decision-making by policymakers at the national level on the use of vaccines against the diseases targeted by DOMI. The [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] was the primary funder of the DOMI program with a US$40 million contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2003-2004|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2005|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea.|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DOMI typhoid ====

The DOMI Typhoid program was initiated to address the barriers of access to [[Typhoid vaccine|typhoid vaccines]] in the developing world and to accelerate the introduction of modern typhoid vaccines in countries where they were needed. DOMI Typhoid utilized the Vi-[[Polysaccharide]] (Vi-PS) vaccine because it is easily and inexpensively produced by manufacturers in developing countries, it is given in a single dose, and it is relatively thermostable. DOMI Typhoid operated in five study sites: [[Hechi|Heichi]], China; [[Kolkata]], India; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Karachi]], Pakistan; and [[Huế|Hue]], Vietnam. From these sites, IVI experts conducted disease surveillance, disease burden studies, cost-of-illness studies, socio-behavioral studies, and vaccine demonstration projects. IVI presented the accumulated evidence from DOMI Typhoid in case studies to officials in each host country. As a result, policymakers in Pakistan, Indonesia, and Vietnam agreed to introduce school-based typhoid vaccination campaigns on a pilot basis. Results from China uncovered a previously unknown growing incidence rate of [[Paratyphoid fever|paratyphoid A]] infections in China’s [[Guangxi|Guangxi province]], which led to IVI launching its Paratyphoid in China project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DOMI cholera ====

The DOMI Cholera program sought to develop and accelerate the use of an affordable [[cholera vaccine]] in [[cholera]]-endemic countries. DOMI Cholera operated from five study sites: [[Matlab (Bangladesh)|Matlab]], Bangladesh; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Kolkata]], India; [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], Mozambique; and [[Huế|Hue]], Vietnam. From these sites, IVI conducted disease burden, economic, and socio-behavioral studies and cholera vaccination campaigns. The studies found a high demand for cholera vaccine and high incidence rates (3-9/1,000) in children 5 years old and younger. IVI’s vaccination campaign in Beira saw more than 44,000 children and adults receive the internationally-licensed Dukoral vaccine. In Kolkata, IVI vaccinated more than 67,000 children and adults using an oral cholera vaccine produced by Vietnam’s [http://www.vabiotech.com.vn/?lang=en VaBiotech.] At the onset of DOMI Cholera, the only internationally licensed cholera vaccine available was Dukoral, but at $90 for the two-dose series, this vaccine was too expensive for public use in many of the poorest developing countries. VaBiotech’s cholera vaccine, originally developed by Vietnam’s [http://nihe.org.vn/en/home-c10902.htm National Institute of Health and Epidemiology] following a technology transfer from the [[University of Gothenburg]] in [[Sweden]], was not licensed for international use but showed great promise as a low-cost vaccine for the developing world. As a result, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]] provided IVI with additional funding to establish the Cholera Vaccine Initiative (CVI) with the goal of reformulating the VaBiotech vaccine for international use. 

==== DOMI shigellosis ====
IVI established the DOMI [[Shigellosis]] program with the ultimate goal of accelerating the development and introduction of a safe and protective shigella vaccine to control epidemic and endemic disease. Between 2000 and 2004, the DOMI Shigella program ran disease surveillance sites in 6 locations across Southeast Asia: [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh; [[Hebei]], China; [[Karachi]], Pakistan and neighboring villages; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Nha Trang]], Vietnam; and [[Saraburi Province]], Thailand. The program enhanced understanding of what an effective shigella vaccine will need and established an accurate disease burden in the countries where it operated. The program first evaluated an oral shigella vaccine (SC602) in Bangladesh, but it failed to elicit an immune response. The high disease burden, serotype diversity, and high levels AMR discovered at IVI's surveillance sites underscored the need for a vaccine that protects against all common strains of the disease. As a result, IVI’s Division of Laboratory Sciences initiated a multiyear program to sequence the Shigella genome and identify common proteins in different Shigella species that could be used to develop a vaccine against all common strains of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=22-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rotavirus Diarrhea Program 1999-2010 ===
IVI initiated the Rotavirus Diarrhea Program to provide policymakers in developing countries with the disease burden evidence and economic data needed to ensure the inclusion of [[Rotavirus vaccine|rotavirus vaccines]] in their [[Vaccination schedule|national immunization programs]]. Running from 1999 to 2010, the program conducted disease surveillance and economic studies in [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Mongolia]], [[South Korea]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Vietnam]]. In 2007, in collaboration with Vietnam’s National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE), IVI conducted a Phase II trial of [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK’s]] RotaRix rotavirus vaccine in [[Khánh Hòa Province|Khanh Hoa]], Vietnam. &amp;nbsp;In 2009, in collaboration with NIHE, [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]], and [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]], IVI completed a phase III trial of Merck’s RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine in [[Nha Trang]] Vietnam, where it vaccinated 900 infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2009|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2010|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=24-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; 

=== Dengue Vaccine Programs 2002-2016 ===

==== The Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative (PDVI''')''' ====
The Pediatric [[Dengue fever|Dengue]] Vaccine Initiative was a product development partnership launched by IVI to accelerate the introduction of safe and effective [[dengue vaccine]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s for children in dengue-endemic countries. From 2002 to 2010, PDVI operated in [[Brazil]], [[Cambodia]], [[Colombia]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]]. PDVI made many contributions to dengue vaccine development, including:

* Development of a dengue vaccine partnership and global research network to develop, evaluate, and introduce dengue vaccines. Working with Brazil’s [[Instituto Butantan|Butantan Institute]], the [[National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institute of Health]], and [[Sanofi Pasteur]], PDVI provided technical advice and support for the efficacy and clinical trials of their respective dengue vaccine candidates and established a consortium of field sites in dengue-endemic countries across Asia and the Americas.
* Establishment of two regional Dengue Prevention Boards in the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas to disseminate information and make recommendations regarding the control of dengue through immunization.
* Collaboration with the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] to develop a free user-friendly software, [http://www.denguevaccine.org/resource-search/?types%5B%5D=2 DenguEcon], which can be used by policymakers to determine the economic impact of dengue.

In 2010, PDVI transitioned into the Dengue Vaccine Initiative (DVI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2010|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2011|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=22-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dengue Vaccine Initiative (DVI) ====
The successor to PDVI, the Dengue Vaccine Initiative was an IVI-led consortium with the [[World Health Organization]], [[Sabin Vaccine Institute|the Sabin Vaccine Institute]], the Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR), and the [http://ivac.jhu.edu/ International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. DVI continued the work of PDVI and focused on laying the groundwork for dengue vaccine decision-making and vaccine introduction in endemic areas. Each consortium member was responsible for a specific component: WHO – information and guidance documents, and regulatory training activities; Johns Hopkins – dengue vaccine financing and strategic demand forecasting; and Sabin – communications and advocacy. Besides leading the consortium, IVI generated evidence for decision-making such as disease burden, country vaccine introduction cases and a global investment case. From 2010 to 2016, DVI operated in [[Brazil]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cambodia]], [[Colombia]], [[Gabon]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. From 2013-2015, with funding from [[Germany]]’s [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education &amp; Research (BMBF)]], IVI continued support for preclinical development of dengue vaccines by Brazil’s [[Instituto Butantan|Butantan Institute]] and Vietnam’s VaBiotech. After the 2016 licensure of [[Sanofi|Sanofi Pasteur’s]] Dengvaxia vaccine, the DVI project came to a close and its IVI staff transitioned to a new project, the Global Dengue &amp; [[Aedes]]-Transmitted Disease Consortium (GDAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ivi.int/wp-content/uploads/kboard_attached/11/201610/IVI%20Annual%20Report%202015.pdf|title=IVI 2015 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ivi.int|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6/15/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signatory Countries of the IVI ===
As of January 2011, IVI includes 40 countries and the '''World Health Organization (WHO)''' as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. To be more specific, there are 33 signatory countries, which are the states that express their consent to be bound by a treaty by signing the treaty without the need for ratification, acceptance of approval. These states may definitively sign a treaty only when the treaty so permits. In addition, there are 16 parties which involve '''Liberia, Republic of Korea, Brazil, Mongolia, China, Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Sweden, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Peru, Philippines''', and the '''World Health Organization (WHO)'''. A major difference between a signatory and a party is that a party to a treaty is a state or other entity with treaty-making capacity that has expressed its consent to be bound by that treaty by an act of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession etc. where that treaty has entered into force for that particular State.

In short, in addition to the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]], 40 countries include [[Bangladesh]], [[Liberia]]**, [[Republic of Korea]]**, [[Bhutan]], [[Malta]], [[Romania]], [[Brazil]]**, [[Mongolia]]**, [[Senegal]], [[China]]**, [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]]**, [[Ecuador]]**, [[Nepal]], [[Sweden]]**, [[Egypt]], [[Netherlands]]**, [[Tajikistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Oman]]**, [[Thailand]], [[Israel]], [[Pakistan]]**, [[Turkey]], [[Jamaica]], [[Panama]], [[Uzbekistan]]**, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Vietnam]]**, [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Peru]]**, [[Lebanon]], [[Philippines]]**, [[Cote d'Ivoire]], [[India]], [[Kuwait]], [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], and [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivi.int/about_us/signatory_countries.html Governance. 'Signatory Countries.']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==

Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, the term malnutrition refers to undernutrition for the remainder of this article. Malnutrition can be divided into two different types, SAM and MAM. SAM refers to children with severe acute malnutrition. MAM refers to moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sathish Subramanian |author2=Sayeeda Huq |author3=Tanya Yatsunenko |author4=Rashidul Haque |author5=Mustafa Mahfuz |author6=Mohammed A.

===Undernutrition and overnutrition===
Malnutrition is caused by eating a diet in which [[nutrient]]s are ''not enough'' or is ''too much'' such that it causes health problems.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a category of diseases that includes undernutrition and [[overnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO, nutrition experts take action on malnutrition |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/pressnote_action_on_malnutrition/en/|work=World Health Organization |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overnutrition can result in [[obesity]] and being [[overweight]]. In some [[developing countries]], overnutrition in the form of [[obesity]] is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress For Children: A Report Card On Nutrition|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Progress_for_Children_-_No._4.pdf|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term malnutrition is commonly used to refer to undernutrition only.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies particularly to the context of development cooperation. Therefore, "malnutrition" in documents by the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], [[Save the Children]] or other international [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) usually is equated to undernutrition.

===Protein-energy malnutrition===

Undernutrition is sometimes used as a synonym of [[protein–energy malnutrition]] (PEM).&lt;ref name="Young2012" /&gt; While other include both [[micronutrient deficiencies]] and protein energy malnutrition in its definition.&lt;ref name="Jones2011" /&gt; It differs from [[calorie restriction]] in that calorie restriction may not result in negative health effects. The term hypoalimentation means underfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000051473|hypoalimentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "severe malnutrition" or "severe undernutrition" is often used to refer specifically to [[protein–energy malnutrition|PEM]].&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last3=Walker |editor-first3=W. Allan |editor-first=Christopher |editor-last=Duggan |editor-first2=John B. |editor-last2=Watkins |title=Nutrition in pediatrics: basic science, clinical application|year=2008|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton|isbn=978-1-55009-361-2|pages=127–141|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wSTISCdSIosC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nutrition+in+pediatrics+:+basic+science,+clinical+application#v=onepage&amp;q=Nutrition%20in%20pediatrics%20%3A%20basic%20science%2C%20clinical%20application&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEM is often associated with micronutrient deficiency.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; Two forms of PEM are [[kwashiorkor]] and [[marasmus]], and they commonly coexist.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt;

==== Kwashiorkor ====
[[Kwashiorkor]] is mainly caused by inadequate protein intake.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; The main symptoms are [[edema]], wasting, liver enlargement, hypoalbuminaemia, steatosis, and possibly depigmentation of skin and hair.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Kwashiorkor is further identified by swelling of the belly, which is deceiving of actual nutritional status.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt; The term means ‘displaced child’ and is derived from a Ghana language of West Africa, means "the sickness the older one gets when the next baby is born," as this is when the older child is deprived of breast feeding and weaned to a diet composed largely of carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="listeningga"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Listening to the Ga: Cicely Williams' Discovery of Kwashiorkor on the Gold Coast|author=Stanton J|year=2001|journal=Clio Medica: Studies in the History of Medicine and Health|volume=61|pages=149–71|pmid=11603151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marasmus====
[[Marasmus]] (‘to waste away’) is caused by an inadequate intake of protein and energy. The main symptoms are severe wasting, leaving little or no edema, minimal subcutaneous fat, severe muscle wasting, and non-normal serum albumin levels.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Marasmus can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein, and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; It is traditionally seen in famine, significant food restriction, or more severe cases of [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]].&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt;

===Undernutrition, hunger===
Undernutrition encompasses [[stunted growth]] (stunting), wasting, and deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals (collectively referred to as micronutrients). The term [[hunger]], which describes a feeling of discomfort from not eating, has been used to describe undernutrition, especially in reference to food insecurity.&lt;ref name="Black2008" /&gt;

===Definition by Gomez===
In 1956, Gómez and Galvan studied factors associated with death in a group of malnourished (undernourished) children in a hospital in Mexico City, Mexico and defined categories of malnutrition: first, second, and third degree.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=R. D.|author2=Conaway, M. R.|title=Weight and Mortality Rates: "Gomez Classification" for Children With Cerebral Palsy?|journal=Pediatrics|date=August 2011|volume=128|issue=2|pages=e436–e437|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-1472|pmid=21768321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degrees were based on weight below a specified percentage of median weight for age.&lt;ref name="Grover 2009" /&gt; The risk of death increases with increasing degree of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011" /&gt; An adaptation of Gomez's original classification is still used today. While it provides a way to compare malnutrition within and between populations, the classification has been criticized for being "arbitrary" and for not considering overweight as a form of malnutrition. Also, height alone may not be the best indicator of malnutrition; children who are born prematurely may be considered short for their age even if they have good nutrition.&lt;ref name="Gueri 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gueri |first1=M.|author2=J.

===Definition by Waterlow===
[[John Waterlow|John Conrad Waterlow]] established a new classification for malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt; Instead of using just weight for age measurements, the classification established by Waterlow combines weight-for-height (indicating acute episodes of malnutrition) with height-for-age to show the stunting that results from chronic malnutrition.&lt;ref name="J. C. Waterlow"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watts|first=Geoff|title=John Conrad Waterlow|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2010|volume=376|issue=9757|pages=1982|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62252-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage of the Waterlow classification over the Gomez classification is that weight for height can be examined even if ages are not known.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt;

[[Avitaminosis|Vitamin-deficiency-related diseases]] (such as [[scurvy]] and [[rickets]]).

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can result from a child not eating for 4 to 6 hours. Hypoglycemia should be considered if there is lethargy, limpness, convulsion, or loss of consciousness. If blood sugar can be measured immediately and quickly, perform a finger or heel stick.

==Causes==

[[File:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Union Army]] soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]], 1865]]
Major causes of malnutrition include poverty and food prices, dietary practices and agricultural productivity, with many individual cases being a mixture of several factors.  [[Clinical malnutrition]], such as [[cachexia]], is a major burden also in [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Various scales of analysis also have to be considered in order to determine the sociopolitical causes of malnutrition. For example, the population of a community that is within poor governments, may be at risk if the area lacks health-related services, but on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at an even higher risk due to differences in income levels, access to land, or levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fotso | first1 = J.

===Dietary practices===

==== Undernutrition ====
A lack of adequate breastfeeding leads to malnutrition in infants and children, associated with the deaths of an estimated one million children annually. Illegal advertising of breast milk substitutes contributed to malnutrition and continued three decades after its 1981 prohibition under the ''WHO International Code of Marketing Breast Milk Substitutes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |date=June 2012 |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=529–32 |title=Marketing breast milk substitutes: problems and perils throughout the world |author=Brady JP |pmid=22419779 |pmc=3371222 |doi=10.1136/archdischild-2011-301299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal malnutrition can also factor into the poor health or death of a baby. Over 800,000 [[neonatal death]] have occurred because of deficient growth of the fetus in the mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/261533.php|title=Malnutrition Kills Over 3 Million Children Annually Worldwide|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deriving too much of one's diet from a single source, such as eating almost exclusively corn or rice, can cause malnutrition. This may either be from a lack of education about proper nutrition, or from only having access to a single food source.&lt;ref name=Burchi&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Int J Environ Res Public Health |date=February 2011 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=358–73 |title=The role of food and nutrition system approaches in tackling hidden hunger |vauthors=Burchi F, Fanzo J, Frison E |pmid=21556191 |pmc=3084466 |doi=10.3390/ijerph8020358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not just the total amount of calories that matters but specific nutritional deficiencies such as [[vitamin A deficiency]], [[iron deficiency]] or [[zinc deficiency]] can also increase risk of death.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNICEF (2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2148 Improving Child Nutrition - The achievable imperative for global progress]. UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Overnutrition ====
Overnutrition caused by [[overeating]] is also a form of malnutrition. In the United States, more than half of all adults are now overweight — a condition that, like hunger, increases susceptibility to disease and disability, reduces worker productivity, and lowers life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is much more common in the United States, where for the majority of people, access to food is not an issue. Many parts of the world have access to a surplus of non-nutritious food, in addition to increased sedentary lifestyles. Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a "[[toxic food environment]]" where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

The issue in these developed countries is choosing the right kind of food. More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Often fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Gary|last2=Halweil|first2=Brian|year=2000|title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488|journal=World Watch|volume=13|issue=4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does obesity occur in developed countries, problems are also occurring in developing countries in areas where income is on the rise.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is also a problem in countries where hunger and poverty persist. In China, consumption of high-fat foods has increased while consumption of rice and other goods has decreased.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

Overeating leads to many diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, that may result in death.

===Poverty and food prices===
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A child with extreme malnutrition]]

In Bangladesh, poor socioeconomic position was associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk, meat, poultry, and fruits.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=MM|author2=Kraemer, A|title=Factors associated with being underweight, overweight and obese among ever-married non-pregnant urban women in Bangladesh|journal=Singapore Medical Journal|date=August 2009|volume=50|issue=8|pages=804–13|pmid=19710981}}&lt;/ref&gt; As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology, the [[FAO]] (Food and Agriculture Organization) has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living in the developing world live in countries that produce food surpluses.&lt;ref name=Gardner00&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Gary |last2=Halweil |first2=Brian |title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess |journal=World Watch |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=24 |year=2000 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Amartya Sen]] observed that, in recent decades, famine has always been a problem of food distribution and/or poverty, as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world. He states that malnutrition and [[famine]] were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power.&lt;ref name=Sen81&gt;{{cite book |first=Amartya Kumar |last=Sen |title=Poverty and famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BzU_AwAAQBAJ |year=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-828463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that commodity speculators are increasing the cost of food. As the real estate bubble in the United States was collapsing, it is said that trillions of dollars moved to invest in food and primary commodities, causing the 2007–2008 [[food price crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The role of speculators in the global food crisis |agency= |work= |newspaper=Spiegel Online |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,549187,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[biofuel]]s as a replacement for traditional fuels raises the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuel use increasing poverty |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= June 25, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7472532.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] special rapporteur on the right to food, [[Jean Ziegler]] proposes that agricultural waste, such as corn cobs and banana leaves, rather than crops themselves be used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuels 'crime against humanity' |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= October 27, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7065061.stm |first=Grant |last=Ferrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural productivity===
Local food shortages can be caused by a lack of arable land, adverse weather, lower farming skills such as [[crop rotation]], or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern [[agriculture]], such as fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and storage facilities. As a result of widespread poverty, farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the resources necessary to improve local yields. The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[free market]] policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zambia: fertile but hungry |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= February 6, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm |first=Peter |last=Biles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many, if not most, farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices, leading to low agricultural production and wages and high, unaffordable food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;
Reasons for the unavailability of fertilizer include moves to stop supplying fertilizer on [[environmental movement|environmental]] grounds, cited as the obstacle to feeding Africa by the [[Green Revolution]] pioneers [[Norman Borlaug]] and Keith Rosenberg.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news |title=Forgotten benefactor of humanity |agency= |work= |newspaper=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future threats===
There are a number of potential disruptions to global food supply that could cause widespread malnutrition.

[[Global warming]] is of importance to food security, with 95 percent of all malnourished peoples living in the relatively stable climate region of the sub-tropics and tropics. According to the latest [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] reports, temperature increases in these regions are "very likely."&lt;ref name=ipcc&gt;{{cite web |title= Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report |date=November 12–17, 2007 |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf |accessdate=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even small changes in temperatures can lead to increased frequency of extreme weather conditions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt; Many of these have great impact on agricultural production and hence nutrition. For example, the 1998–2001 central Asian drought brought about an 80 percent livestock loss and 50 percent reduction in wheat and barley crops in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Battisti, David S. "Climate Change in Developing Countries." University of Washington. Seattle. October 27, 2008.{{vn|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar figures were present in other nations. An increase in extreme weather such as drought in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa would have even greater consequences in terms of malnutrition. Even without an increase of extreme weather events, a simple increase in temperature reduces the productivity of many crop species, also decreasing food security in these regions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Black, Richard |title=Rice yields falling under global warming |agency= |newspaper=BBC News; Science &amp; Environment |date=August 9, 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10918591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colony collapse disorder]] is a phenomenon where bees die in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aginfo.psu.edu/news/2007/1/HoneyBees.htm Honey Bee Die-Off Alarms Beekeepers, Crop growers and researchers]&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[list of crop plants pollinated by bees|many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by bees]], this represents a threat to the supply of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vanishing bees threaten US crops |newspaper=BBC News |date= March 11, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6438373.stm |first=Matt |last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===

{{Main|Food security}}
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the West, such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides, to Asia, called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in increased [[food production]] and corresponding decreases in prices and malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing infrastructure and institutions that are in short supply in Africa, such as a system of roads or public seed companies that made seeds available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Africa, prosperity from seeds falls short |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date= October 10, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investments in agriculture, such as subsidized fertilizers and seeds, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barclay, Eliza |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |agency= |work= |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=June 18, 2008 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the case of Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid. However, after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced against World Bank strictures, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests as production leaped to 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005, making Malawi a major food exporter.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; This lowered food prices and increased wages for farm workers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; Such investments in agriculture are still needed in other African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country has one of the highest  prevalence of malnutrition even though it is blessed with great agricultural potential John Ulimwengu explains in his article for D+C.&lt;ref&gt;

In Nigeria, the use of imported Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) has been used to treat malnutrition in the North. ''Soy Kunu'', a locally sourced and prepared blend consisting of peanut, millet and soya beans may also be used.&lt;ref name=Soykunu&gt;{{cite news |title=Severe Malnutrition, A Disturbance in Nigerian Health Sector |agency= |work= Public Health Nigeria|newspaper= |date=October 12, 2018 |url=https://publichealthng.com/severe-malnutrition-a-disturbance-in-nigerian-health-sector/ |first1=Obasi |last1=Chinedu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technology in agricultural production also has great potential to combat undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Jiming, Yeyun Xin and Longping Yuan. (2010). Pushing the Yield Frontier: Hybrid rice in China. In MillionsFed: Proved Success in Agriculture Development. Washington, DC: International Policy Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; By improving agricultural yields, farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income as well as open up area for diversification of crops for household use. The World Bank itself claims to be part of the solution to malnutrition, asserting that the best way for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build export-led economies that will give them the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market.

===Economics===
There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html|title=UN aid debate: give cash not food?|date=June 4, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's [[World Food Program]], the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wfp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|title=Cash roll-out to help hunger hot spots|date=December 8, 2008|publisher=World Food Programme|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|archivedate=February 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;

However, for people in a drought living a long way from and with limited access to markets, delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt; [[Fred Cuny]] stated that "the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Natsios (Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development)&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. law, which requires buying food at home rather than where the hungry live, is inefficient because approximately half of what is spent goes for transport.&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients" /&gt; Cuny further pointed out "studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country — though not always in the immediate food deficit area" and "even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum to former Representative Steve Solarz (United States, Democratic Party, New York), July 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]
[[Food bank]]s and [[soup kitchen]]s address malnutrition in places where people lack money to buy food.  A [[basic income]] has been proposed as a way to ensure that everyone has enough money to buy food and other basic needs; it is a form of [[social security]] in which all citizens or residents of a country regularly receive an unconditional sum of money, either from a government or some other public institution, in addition to any income received from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm |title = Improving Social Security in Canada Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper |publisher = Government of Canada |year = 1994 |accessdate = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2|title=A model of African food aid is now in trouble|date=May 6, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5" /&gt;

===World population===

Restricting population size is a proposed solution. [[Thomas Malthus]] argued that population growth could be controlled by natural disasters and voluntary limits through "moral restraint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Thomas Robert |last1=Malthus |authorlink=Thomas Malthus |first2=Philip |last2= Appleman |title=An essay on the principle of population: text, sources and background, criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raGGQgAACAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-09202-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Chapman suggests that an intervention through government policies is a necessary ingredient of curtailing global population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = R. | title = No room at the inn, or why population problems are not all economic | journal = Population and Environment | volume = 21 | pages = 81–97 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/BF02436122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdependence and complementarity of population growth with poverty and malnutrition (as well as the environment) is also recognised by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/environment/index.shtml|title=Environment - United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 million women worldwide do not have adequate access to family planning services. According to the World Health Organisation, "Family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and regional development efforts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/family-planning-contraception|title=Family planning/Contraception|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many who believe that the world has more than enough resources to sustain its population. Instead, these theorists point to unequal distribution of resources and under- or unutilized arable land as the cause for malnutrition problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlin, G. (1967). Population control and economic development. Paris: Dev Centers, OECD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielson, K. (1992). Global Justice, Capitalism and the Third World. (R. A. Wilkons, Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Amartya Sen advocates that, "no matter how a famine is caused, methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the [[Public Distribution System|public distribution system]]. This applies not only to organizing rationing and control, but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation."&lt;ref name="Sen81" /&gt; 

===Food sovereignty===

{{Main|Food sovereignty}}
One suggested policy framework to resolve access issues is termed [[food sovereignty]]—the right of peoples to define their own food, agriculture, livestock, and fisheries systems, in contrast to having food largely subjected to international market forces. Food First is one of the primary think tanks working to build support for food sovereignty. Neoliberals advocate for an increasing role of the free market.

===Health facilities===

Another possible long term solution would be to increase access to health facilities to rural parts of the world. These facilities could monitor undernourished children, act as supplemental food distribution centers, and provide education on dietary needs. These types of facilities have already proven very successful in countries such as Peru and Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = H. R. | last2 = Penny | first2 = M.

===Breastfeeding===

As of 2016 is estimated that about 821,000 deaths of children less than five years old could be prevented globally per year through more widespread breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Lancet2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Victora|first1=CG|last2=Bahl|first2=R|last3=Barros|first3=AJ|last4=França|first4=GV|last5=Horton|first5=S|last6=Krasevec|first6=J|last7=Murch|first7=S|last8=Sankar|first8=MJ|last9=Walker|first9=N|date=January 30, 2016|title=Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect.|journal=Lancet|volume=387|issue=10017|pages=475–90|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01024-7|pmid=26869575|last10=Rollins|first10=NC|last11=Lancet Breastfeeding Series|first11=Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to reducing infant death, breast milk feeding provides an important source of micronutrients, clinically proven to bolster the immune system of children, and provide long-term defenses against non-communicable and allergic diseases.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lessen|first=Rachelle|last2=Kavanagh|first2=Katherine|date=2015-03-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Promoting and Supporting Breastfeeding|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(14)01876-0/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=115|issue=3|pages=444–449|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2014.12.014|pmid=25721389|issn=2212-2672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breastfeeding has also been shown to improve cognitive abilities in children, with a strong correlation to individual educational achievements.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi Omobolanle|last2=Dagvadorj|first2=Amarjagal|last3=Anigo|first3=Kola Mathew|last4=Ota|first4=Erika|last5=Sasaki|first5=Satoshi|date=2015-10-01|title=Factors influencing breastfeeding exclusivity during the first 6 months of life in developing countries: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review|journal=Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=433–451|doi=10.1111/mcn.12180|pmid=25857205|issn=1740-8709}}&lt;/ref&gt; As previously noted, lack of proper breastfeeding is a major factor in child mortality rates, and a primary determinant of disease development for children. The medical community recommends exclusively breastfeeding infants for 6 months, with nutritional whole food supplementation and continued breastfeeding up to 2 years or older for overall optimal health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Linda C.|last2=Milligan|first2=Renee A.|last3=Frick|first3=Kevin D.|last4=Spatz|first4=Diane|last5=Bronner|first5=Yvonne|date=2002-06-01|title=Breastfeeding Duration, Costs, and Benefits of a Support Program for Low-Income Breastfeeding Women|journal=Birth|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=95–100|doi=10.1046/j.1523-536X.2002.00169.x|pmid=12000411|issn=1523-536X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cai|first=Xiaodong|last2=Wardlaw|first2=Tessa|last3=Brown|first3=David W.|date=2012-09-28|title=Global trends in exclusive breastfeeding|journal=International Breastfeeding Journal|volume=7|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/1746-4358-7-12|pmid=23020813|pmc=3512504|issn=1746-4358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as only giving an infant breast milk for six months as a source of food and nutrition.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; This means no other liquids, including water or semi-solid foods.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

==== Barriers to breastfeeding ====

Breastfeeding is noted as one of the most cost effective medical interventions for providing beneficial child health.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; While there are considerable differences within developed and developing countries: income, employment, social norms, and access to healthcare were found to be universal determinants of whether a mother breast or formula fed their children.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Community based healthcare workers have helped alleviate financial barriers faced by newly made mothers, and provided a viable alternative to traditional and expensive hospital based medical care.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Recent studies based upon surveys conducted from 1995-2010 shows exclusive breastfeeding rates have gone up globally, from 33% to 39%.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Despite the growth rates, medical professionals acknowledge the need for improvement given the importance of exclusive breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===Global initiatives===
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger campaign|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.

Food security and global malnutrition has long been a topic of international concern, with one of the first official global documents addressing it being the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]](UDHR). Within this document it stated that access to food was part of an adequate right to a standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24|date=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Right to food]] was asserted in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], a [[treaty]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 16, 1966. The Right to food is a [[human rights|human right]] for people to feed themselves in dignity, be free from hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.righttofood.org/work-of-jean-ziegler-at-the-un/what-is-the-right-to-food/|title=What is the Right to Food? {{!}} Right to food|website=www.righttofood.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the treaty has been signed by 166 countries, by signing states agreed to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve the right to adequate food.

However, after the 1966 International Covenant the global concern for the access to sufficient food only became more present, leading to the first ever World Food Conference that was held in 1974 in Rome, Italy. The [[Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition]] was a UN resolution adopted November 16, 1974 by all 135 countries that attended the 1974 World Food Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-legally binding document set forth certain aspirations for countries to follow to sufficiently take action on the global food problem. Ultimately this document outline and provided guidance as to how the international community as one could work towards fighting and solving the growing global issue of malnutrition and hunger.

Adoption of the right to food was included in the [[American Convention on Human Rights#Additional Protocols|Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]], this 1978 document was adopted by many countries in the Americas, the purpose of the document is, "to consolidate in this hemisphere, within the framework of democratic institutions, a system of personal liberty and [[social justice]] based on respect for the essential rights of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrcr.org/docs/American_Convention/oashr.html|title=American Convention on Human Rights|website=www.hrcr.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next document in the timeline of global inititaves for malnutrition was the 1996 [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security]], organized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]. This document reaffirmed the right to have access to safe and nutritous food by everyone, also considering that everyone gets sufficient food, and set the goals for all nations to improve their commitment to food security by halfing their amount of undernourished people by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3613e/w3613e00.htm|title=Rome Declaration and Plan of Action|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Food and Agriculture Organization adopted the  [[Right to Food Guidelines]], which offered states a framework of how to increase the right to food on a national basis.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx Outcome of the 2012 Copenhagen Consensus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], approved through the UN in 2015. In particular Goal 2: Zero hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/ Description and targets for Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership Compact2025, led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition. 2015.

In June 2015, the [[European Union]] and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] have launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children. The program will initiatilly be implemented in Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Laos and Niger and will help these countries to improve information and analysis about nutrition so they can develop effective national nutrition policies.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Press release.

Accessed on 1 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the UN has created a partnership that will act through the [[African Union]]'s CAADP framework aiming to end hunger in Africa by 2025. It includes different interventions including support for improved food production, a strengthening of social protection and integration of the right to food into national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015.

In response to child malnutrition, the [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi government]] recommends ten steps for treating severe malnutrition. They are to prevent or treat [[dehydration]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[hypothermia|low body temperature]], infection, correct electrolyte imbalances and micronutrient deficiencies, start feeding cautiously, achieve catch-up growth, provide psychological support, and prepare for discharge and follow-up after recovery.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

Among those who are hospitalized, nutritional support improves protein, calorie intake and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bally|first1=MR|last2=Blaser Yildirim|first2=PZ|last3=Bounoure|first3=L|last4=Gloy|first4=VL|last5=Mueller|first5=B|last6=Briel|first6=M|last7=Schuetz|first7=P|date=January 1, 2016|title=Nutritional Support and Outcomes in Malnourished Medical Inpatients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=176|issue=1|pages=43–53|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.6587|pmid=26720894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
The evidence for benefit of supplementary feeding is poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sguassero|first1=Y|last2=de Onis|first2=M|last3=Bonotti|first3=AM|last4=Carroli|first4=G|date=Jun 13, 2012|title=Community-based supplementary feeding for promoting the growth of children under five years of age in low and middle income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD005039|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005039.pub3|pmid=22696347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the small amount of research done on this treatment.

Specially formulated foods do however appear useful in those from the developing world with moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Lazzer2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazzerini|first1=M|last2=Rubert|first2=L|last3=Pani|first3=P|date=Jun 21, 2013|title=Specially formulated foods for treating children with moderate acute malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD009584|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009584.pub2|pmid=23794237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In young children with severe acute malnutrition it is unclear if [[ready-to-use therapeutic food]] differs from a normal diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoonees|first1=A|last2=Lombard|first2=M|last3=Musekiwa|first3=A|last4=Nel|first4=E|last5=Volmink|first5=J|date=Jun 6, 2013|title=Ready-to-use therapeutic food for home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children from six months to five years of age.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD009000|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009000.pub2|pmid=23744450}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have some benefits in humanitarian emergencies as they can be eaten directly from the packet, do not require refrigeration or mixing with clean water, and can be stored for years.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8114750.stm|title=Firms target nutrition for the poor|last=Anderson|first=Tatum|date=June 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=BBC News|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers are trying to fortify everyday foods with micronutrients that can be sold to consumers such as wheat flour for Beladi bread in Egypt or fish sauce in Vietnam and the iodization of salt.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

For example, flour has been fortified with iron, zinc, folic acid and other B vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin B12.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Micronutrients===
Treating malnutrition, mostly through [[food fortification|fortifying]] foods with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), improves lives at a lower cost and shorter time than other forms of [[aid]], according to the World Bank.&lt;ref name="IQ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/opinion/04kristof.html|title=Raising the world's IQ|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=December 4, 2008|work=The New York Times|newspaper=|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which look at a variety of development proposals, ranked micronutrient supplements as number one.&lt;ref name="hiddenhunger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/opinion/24kristof.html|title=The Hidden Hunger|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=May 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=New York Times|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/160075|title=Let them eat micronutrients|work=|newspaper=Newsweek|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those with diarrhea, once an initial four-hour rehydration period is completed, zinc supplementation is recommended. Daily zinc increases the chances of reducing the severity and duration of the diarrhea, and continuing with daily zinc for ten to fourteen days makes diarrhea less likely recur in the next two to three months.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)"&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], World Health Organization, 2005.

In addition, malnourished children need both potassium and magnesium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh], Institute of Public Health Nutrition, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, May 2008, page 18 (19 in PDF) and following pages.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be obtained by following the above recommendations for the dehydrated child to continue eating within two to three hours of starting rehydration,&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; and including foods rich in potassium as above. [[Hypokalemia|Low blood potassium]] is worsened when base (as in Ringer's/Hartmann's) is given to treat acidosis without simultaneously providing potassium.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; As above, available home products such as salted and unsalted cereal water, salted and unsalted vegetable broth can be given early during the course of a child's diarrhea along with continued eating.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;  Vitamin A, potassium, magnesium, and zinc should be added with other vitamins and minerals if available.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

For a malnourished child with diarrhea from any cause, this should include foods rich in potassium such as bananas, green coconut water, and unsweetened fresh fruit juice.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;

===Diarrhea===
[[File:ORT saches.JPG|thumb|Examples of commercially available oral rehydration salts (Nepal on left, Peru on right).]]
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rehydrating a severely undernourished child who has diarrhea relatively slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called [[oral rehydration solution]] (ORS).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The oral rehydration solution is both slightly [[sweet]] and slightly [[salt]]y and the one recommended in those with severe undernutrition should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; Fluids by [[nasogastric tube]] may be use in those who do not drink.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; [[Intravenous]] fluids are recommended only in those who have [[Shock (circulatory)|significant dehydration]] due to their potential complications.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; These complications include [[congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Over time, ORS developed into [[Oral rehydration therapy|ORT]], or [[oral rehydration therapy]], which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts, carbohydrates, and water. This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Victora|first=Cesar|last2=Bryce|first2=Jennifer|date=Jan 2000|title=Reducing deaths from diarrhoea through oral rehydration therapy|url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000001000010&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=e|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1246–1255|doi=10.1590/S0042-96862000001000010|pmid=|access-date=|doi-broken-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast feeding and eating should resume as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Drinks such as soft drinks, fruit juices, or sweetened teas are not recommended as they contain too much sugar and may worsen diarrhea.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf|title=The Treatment of diarrhoea : a manual for physicians and other senior health  workers.|date=2005|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=924159318 0|edition=4|location=Geneva|pages=8–16|chapter=4. Management of acute diarrhoea without blood}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broad spectrum antibiotic]]s are recommended in all severely undernourished children with diarrhea requiring admission to hospital.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

To prevent dehydration readily available fluids, preferably with a modest amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water, may be used.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Once dehydration develops oral rehydration solutions are preferred.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given, unless there are signs of swelling.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarting more slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Vomiting rarely prevents rehydration as fluid are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4" /&gt; A severely malnourished child with what appears to be dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated as if they have an infection.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

For babies a dropper or syringe without the needle can be used to put small amounts of fluid into the mouth; for children under 2, a teaspoon every one to two minutes; and for older children and adults, frequent sips directly from a cup.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; After the first two hours, rehydration should be continued at the same or slower rate, determined by how much fluid the child wants and any ongoing diarrheal loses. After the first two hours of rehydration it is recommended that to alternate between rehydration and food.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

In 2003, WHO and UNICEF recommended a reduced-[[osmolarity]] ORS which still treats dehydration but also reduced stool volume and vomiting. Reduced-osmolarity ORS is the current standard ORS with reasonably wide availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4950e/2.4.html WHO Drug Information Vol. 16, No. 2, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rehydrate.org/ors/low-osmolarity-ors.htm Low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS)], Rehydrate Project, updated: April 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For general use, one packet of ORS (glucose sugar, salt, potassium chloride, and trisodium citrate) is added to one liter of water; however, for malnourished children it is recommended that one packet of ORS be added to two liters of water along with an extra 50 grams of sucrose sugar and some stock potassium solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], WHO, 2005.  Specifically, 45 milliliters of potassium chloride solution from a stock solution containing 100g KCl per liter, along with one packet of ORS, ''&lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt;'' liters of water, and 50 grams of sucrose.  And please remember, sucrose has approximately twice the molecular weight of glucose, with one mole of glucose weighing 180 g and one mole of sucrose weighing 342 g.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malnourished children have an excess of body sodium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;  Recommendations for home remedies agree with one liter of water (34 oz.) and 6 teaspoons sugar and disagree regarding whether it is then one teaspoon of salt added or only 1/2, with perhaps most sources recommending 1/2 teaspoon of added salt to one liter water.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241592330.pdf "Guidelines for the control of shigellosis, including epidemics due to Shigella dysenteriae type 1".] World Health Organization, 2005, Annex 12 - Preparation of Home Made Oral Rehydration Solution, page 51 (57 in PDF): "Ingredients: Half a teaspoon of salt (2.5 grams), six level teaspoons of sugar (30 grams) and one litre of safe drinking water".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/basics/treatment/con-20030056 "Dehydration, treatments and drugs."] Mayo Clinic January 7, 2011.

===Low blood sugar===
[[Hypoglycemia]], whether known or suspected, can be treated with a mixture of sugar and water. If the child is conscious, the initial dose of sugar and water can be given by mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh] recommends, for initial hypoglycemia, a 50 milliliter bolus of 10% glucose or sucrose.  This can also be achieved by added 1 rounded teaspoon of sugar to 10.5 teaspoons of water (which is 3.5 tablespoons of water).&lt;/ref&gt; If the child is unconscious, give glucose by [[intravenous]] or [[nasogastric tube]]. If seizures occur after despite glucose, rectal [[diazepam]] is recommended. Blood sugar levels should be re-checked on two hour intervals.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

===Hypothermia===
[[Hypothermia]] can occur. To prevent or treat this, the child can be kept warm with covering including of the head or by direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother or father and then covering both parent and child. Prolonged bathing or prolonged medical exams should be avoided. Warming methods are usually most important at night.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

The figures provided in this section on epidemiology all refer to ''undernutrition'' even if the term malnutrition is used which, by definition, could also apply to too much nutrition.

The [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI) is a multidimensional statistical tool used to describe the state of countries’ hunger situation. The GHI measures progress and failures in the global fight against hunger.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8306556.stm |title= Global hunger worsening, warns UN |publisher= BBC (Europe) |date= 14 October 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GHI is updated once a year. The data from the 2015 report shows that Hunger levels have dropped 27% since 2000. Fifty two countries remain at serious or alarming levels. In addition to the latest statistics on Hunger and Food Security, the GHI also features different special topics each year. The 2015 report include an article on conflict and food security.&lt;ref&gt;K. von Grebmer, J. Bernstein, A. de Waal, N. Prasai, S. Yin, Y.

Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of [[vitamin A]] or [[zinc]], for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition in the first two years is irreversible. Malnourished children grow up with worse health and lower education achievement. Their own children tend to be smaller. Malnutrition was previously{{when|date=September 2016}} seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, but malnutrition actually causes diseases, and can be fatal in its own right.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

==History ==
Throughout history, portions of the world's population have often experienced sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, this resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. For the first few decades after [[World War II]], technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2000 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world's people. According to the WFP some statistics are that, "Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life. That's about one in nine people on earth. The vast majority of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished."&lt;ref name="wfp.org Hunger Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunger Statistics|url=https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats|website=World Food Programme|publisher=wfp.org|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2006, the average international price of food had been largely stable for several decades. In the closing months of 2006, however, prices began to [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|rise rapidly]]. By 2008, rice had tripled in price in some regions, and this severely affected [[developing countries]]. Food prices fell in early 2009, but rose to another record high in 2011, and have since decreased slightly. The [[financial crisis of 2007–2012|2008 worldwide financial crisis]] further increased the number of people suffering from hunger, including dramatic increases even in advanced economies such as [[Great Britain]], the [[Eurozone]] and the [[United States]].

The [[Millennium Development Goals]] included a commitment to a further 50% reduction in the proportion of the world's population who have extreme hunger by 2015. As of 2012, this target appeared difficult to achieve, due in part to persistent inflation in food prices. However, in late 2012 the UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) stated it is still possible to hit the target with sufficient effort. In 2013, the ''FAO'' estimated that 842 million people are undernourished (12% of the global population). Malnutrition is a cause of death for more than 3.1 million children under 5 every year. [[UNICEF]] estimates 300 million children go to bed hungry each night; and that 8000 children under the age of 5 are estimated to die of malnutrition every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/364_617.htm|author=Ernest C. Madu|title=Investment and Development Will Secure the Rights of the Child}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century and earlier===
Throughout history, the need to aid those suffering from hunger has been commonly, though not universally,&lt;ref&gt;As an example of historical opposition to food aid, during the [[Hungry Forties]], English [[Laissez-faire]] advocates were largely successful in preventing it being deployed by Great Britain to relief the Irish famine; see for example the section on "Ideology and relief"' in Chpt. 2 of ''The Great Irish Famine'' by [[Cormac Ó Gráda]].

For a detailed description of how views opposed to hunger relief became dominant within Great Britain's policy making circles during the 19th century, and also their subsequent displacement, see ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007) by James Vernon, esp. Chpts. 1–3. In 2012, advocates of small government spoke out against the US food stamp programme, saying it discourages people from fending for themselves, in the same way as it is not always a good idea to feed hungry wild animals. ( See [http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/07/14/4099922/food-stamp-debate-brings-out-the.html Food stamp debate brings out the haters] published by the ''Star Telegram''. )&lt;/ref&gt; recognized.

The philosopher [[Simone Weil]] wrote that feeding the hungry when you have resources to do so is the most obvious of all human [[Moral obligation|obligations]]. She says that as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]], many believed that people had to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife. Weil writes that [[Social progress]] is commonly held to be first of all, "...a transition to a state of human society in which people will not suffer from hunger." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simone Weil]]|title=The Need for Roots|page = 6|year=2002 |orig-year= 1942|isbn=978-0-415-27102-8|publisher = [[Routledge]]|title-link=The Need for Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social historian [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organization in the 19th century, most human societies would either starve all together or not at all, because communities would invariably share their food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Karl Polanyi]] | title = The Great Transformation | year = 2002 |orig-year=1942 | chapter = chpt. 4  | isbn = 978-0-8070-5643-1  | publisher=Beacon Press | title-link = The Great Transformation (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first age of globalization, which began in the 19th century, it became more common for people to consider problems like hunger in global terms. However, as early globalization largely coincided with the high peak of influence for [[classical liberalism]], there was relatively little call for politicians to address world hunger.&lt;ref&gt;For further info see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom#Attitudes towards hunger relief]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There were many exceptions. For example, in ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007), James Vernon describes dozens of 18th and 19th century campaigners who spoke in favor of hunger relief.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the view that politicians ought not to intervene against hunger was increasingly challenged by campaigning journalists, with some academics and politicians also calling for or organizing intervention against world hunger, such as U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"&gt;{{cite book |author = James Vernon|title=Hunger: A Modern History |chapter = Chpts. 1-3|year= 2007|isbn=978-0674026780 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"&gt;{{cite journal|author = David Grigg|title=The historiography of hunger: changing views on the world food problem 1945–1980|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year= 1981

===Great Depression===
[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|210px|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in Chicago, 1931|upright=1.15]]
Hunger as an academic and social topic came to prominence during the [[Great Depression]]. As many individuals struggled for food, the same agricultural industries were suddenly producing large surpluses as means of increased production to counter the drop in demand from the European markets. This increased output was meant to ease the growing debt levels, however domestic demand could not keep up with prices. Instead, what is often called "the paradox of want amid plenty," agricultural surpluses and large demand simply did not fit together, causing the Hoover administration to buy large amounts of product, such as grain, to stabilize prices. Initially refusing to further compromise the distressed price levels, political pressure from starving families across the country forced Congress to reconsider. With large deposits of grain already wasting away in government possession, the only political move left was to begin a process of donations to the hungry from the Farm Board, a federal oversight created in 1929 to promote the sale and stabilization of agricultural products. Instead of hunger being a reason for the allocation of large grain surpluses, waste became the eventual driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Janet Poppendieck | title = Eating Agendas | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-202-30508-0 | publisher=Aldine Transaction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Martin Luther King]] (center), one of many twentieth century political figures who considered it important to fight hunger: "When I die, don't build a monument to me. Don't bestow me degrees from great universities. Just clothe the naked. Say that I tried to house the homeless. Let people say that I tried to feed the hungry." &lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;]]
After World War II, a new international politico-economic order came into being, which was later described as [[Embedded liberalism]].

For at least the first decade after the war, the United States, by far the period's most dominant national actor, was strongly supportive of efforts to tackle world hunger and to promote international development. It heavily funded the United Nation's development programmes, and later the efforts of other multilateral organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB).&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"&gt;{{cite book |author = John R. Butterly and Jack Shepherd |title=Hunger: The Biology and Politics of Starvation|year= 2010|isbn=978-1584659266 |publisher= Dartmouth College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly established United Nations became a leading player in co-ordinating the global fight against hunger. The UN has three agencies that work to promote food security and agricultural development: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD). FAO is the world's agricultural knowledge agency, providing policy and technical assistance to developing countries to promote food security, nutrition and sustainable agricultural production, particularly in rural areas.

WFP's key mission is to deliver food into the hands of the hungry poor. The agency steps in during [[emergencies]] and uses food to aid recovery after emergencies. Its longer term approaches to hunger helps the transition from recovery to development. IFAD, with its knowledge of rural poverty and exclusive focus on poor rural people, designs and implements programmes to help those people access the assets, services and opportunities they need to overcome poverty.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

Following successful post WWII reconstruction of Germany and Japan, the IMF and WB began to turn their attention to the developing world. A great many [[NGO|civil society actors]] were also active in trying to combat hunger, especially after the late 1970s when global media began to bring the plight of starving people in places like [[Ethiopia]] to wider attention.  Most significant of all, especially in the late 1960s and 70s, the [[Green revolution]] helped improved agricultural technology propagate throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

The United States began to change its approach to the problem of world hunger from about the mid 1950s. Influential members of the administration became less enthusiastic about methods they saw as promoting an over reliance on the state, as they feared that might assist the spread of communism. Despite this view, during the 1960s postwar era hunger within the United States was overshadowed by hunger in Europe and Asia. John F. Kennedy did in fact use Executive Order to double the amount of commodities available from the surplus commodity program as well as initiated the pilot Food Stamp Program which later became permanent in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Donna|last2=Poppendieck|first2=Janet|title=Eating agendas : food and nutrition as social problems|date=1995|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=9780202305073|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
By the 1980s, the previous consensus in favour of moderate government intervention had been [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displaced across the western world.]] The IMF and World Bank in particular began to promote market-based solutions. In cases where countries became dependent on the IMF, they sometimes forced national governments to prioritize debt repayments and sharply cut public services. This sometimes had a negative effect on efforts to combat hunger.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"/&gt;
[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|left|Increased use of irrigation played a major role in the [[Green Revolution]].]]
Organizations such as [[Food First]] raised the issue of [[food sovereignty]] and claimed that every country on earth (with the possible minor exceptions of some city-states) has sufficient agricultural capacity to feed its own people, but that the "[[free trade]]" economic order, which from the late 1970s to about 2008 had been associated with such institutions as the IMF and World Bank, had prevented this from happening.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The World Bank itself claimed it was part of the solution to hunger, asserting that the best way for countries to break the cycle of poverty and hunger was to build export-led economies that provide the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market. However, in the early 21st century the World Bank and IMF became less dogmatic about promoting [[free market]] reforms. They increasingly returned to the view that government intervention does have a role to play, and that it can be advisable for governments to support food security with policies favourable to domestic agriculture, even for countries that do not have a [[Comparative advantage]] in that area. As of 2012, the World Bank remains active in helping governments to intervene against hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/07/30/food-price-volatility-growing-concern-world-bank-stands-ready-respond|title=Food Price Volatility a Growing Concern, World Bank Stands Ready to Respond|publisher= [[World Bank]]|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until at least the 1980s—and, to an extent, the 1990s—the dominant academic view concerning world hunger was that it was a problem of demand exceeding supply. Proposed solutions often focused on boosting food production, and sometimes on birth control. There were exceptions to this, even as early as the 1940s, [[John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr|Lord Boyd-Orr]], the first head of the UN's FAO, had perceived hunger as largely a problem of distribution, and drew up comprehensive plans to correct this. Few agreed with him at the time, however, and he resigned after failing to secure support for his plans from the US and Great Britain. In 1998, [[Amartya Sen]] won a [[Nobel Prize]] in part for demonstrating that hunger in modern times is not typically the product of a lack of food. Rather, hunger usually arises from food distribution problems, or from governmental policies in the developed and developing world. It has since been broadly accepted that world hunger results from issues with the distribution as well as the production of food.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"&gt;[[Harry Magdoff#Death|Fred Magdoff]], [https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs - Accumulation by Agricultural Dispossession], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', 2013, Volume 65, Issue 06 (November)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"&gt;Rahul Goswami, [http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2012/goswami041212.html For Whom Do the FAO and Its Director-General Work?], ''[[Monthly Review|Monthly Review Magazine]]'', 2012.12.04&lt;/ref&gt;  Sen's 1981 essay ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' played a prominent part in forging the new consensus.&lt;ref name="foodAndFamine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= John Baylis, Steve Smith and Patricia Owens |author = Caroline Thomas and Tony Evans|title=The Globalization of World Politics|chapter = "Poverty, development and hunger"|year= 2010|isbn=978-0199569090 |publisher= [[Oxford University press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2007 and 2008, rapidly increasing food prices caused a ''global food crisis'', increasing the numbers suffering from hunger by over a hundred million. [[Food riot]]s erupted in several dozen countries; in at least two cases, [[Haiti]] and [[Madagascar]], this led to the toppling of governments. A second ''global food crisis'' unfolded due to the spike in food prices of late 2010 and early 2011. Fewer food riots occurred, due in part to greater availability of food stock piles for relief. However, several analysts argue the food crisis was one of the causes of the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name="Politics of hunger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G202012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"&gt;{{cite news|

As of 2008 roughly $300 million of aid went to basic nutrition each year, less than $2 for each child below two in the 20 worst affected countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In contrast, at that time [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], which caused fewer deaths than child malnutrition, received $2.2 billion—$67 per person with HIV in all countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In 2008 UN estimated that ending world hunger could cost about 30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/news/04iht-04food.13446176.html|title=UN says solving food crisis could cost $30 billion|first=Elisabeth Rosenthal and Andrew|last=Martin|date=2008-06-04|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]), a member of the [[CGIAR]] consortium, partners with farmers, governments, researchers and NGOs to help farmers grow nutritious crops, such as [[chickpea]], [[groundnut]], [[pigeonpea]], [[millet]] and [[sorghum]]. This helps their communities have more balanced diets and become more resilient to pests and drought. The Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement of Sorghum and Millets in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian-Subcontinent (HOPE) project, for example, is increasing yields of [[eleusine coracana|finger millet]] in [[Tanzania]] by encouraging farmers to grow improved varieties. Finger millet is very high in calcium, rich in iron and fiber, and has a better energy content than other cereals. These characteristics make it ideal for feeding to infants and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Alina Paul Bossuet, ''Nourishing Communities Through Holistic Farming'' {{cite web|url=http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}.

Some organizations have begun working with teachers, policymakers, and managed food service contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to university-level institutions. Health and nutrition have been proven to have close links with overall educational success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/wbro/11.1.23|jstor=3986477|title=The Impact of Health and Nutrition on Education|author=Jere R.

In the early 21st century, there was relatively little awareness of hunger from leaders of advanced nations such as those that form the [[G8]].&lt;ref name="G202012"/&gt; Prior to 2009, efforts to fight hunger were mainly undertaken by governments of the worst affected countries, by civil society actors, and by multilateral and regional organizations. In 2009, Pope Benedict published his third encyclical, [[Caritas in Veritate]], which emphasised the importance of fighting against hunger. The encyclical was intentionally published immediately before the [[35th G8 summit|July 2009 G8 Summit]] to maximise its influence on that event. At the Summit, which took place at [[L'Aquila]] in central Italy, the ''L'Aquila Food Security Initiative'' was launched, with a total of US$22 billion committed to combat hunger.&lt;ref&gt;

Food prices did fall sharply in 2009 and early 2010, though analysts credit this much more to farmers increasing production in response to the 2008 spike in prices, than to the fruits of enhanced government action. However, since the 2009 G8 summit, the fight against hunger has remained a high-profile issue among the leaders of the worlds major nations, and was a prominent part of the agenda for the [[2012 G-20 Mexico summit|2012 G-20 summit]].&lt;ref name="G202012"&gt;

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome - Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May 2012, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] launched a "new alliance for food security and nutrition"—a broad partnership between private sector, governmental and civil society actors—that aimed to "...achieve sustained and inclusive agricultural growth and raise 50 million people out of poverty over the next 10 years."&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2343978/uk_aid_is_financing_a_corporate_scramble_for_africa.html UK 'aid' is financing a corporate scramble for Africa], Miriam Ross, ''[[The Ecologist]]'', 2014.04.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "2012G8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/globalfoodsecurity/190282.htm G8 Action on Food Security and Nutrition] 2012 statement hosted by the US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/18/remarks-president-symposium-global-agriculture-and-food-security Remarks by President concerning the launch of the ''new alliance for food security and nutrition'']&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's prime minister [[David Cameron]] held a [[2012 Olympic hunger summit|hunger summit]] on 12 August, the last day of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="2012G8"/&gt;

The fight against hunger has also been joined by an increased number of regular people. While folk throughout the world had long contributed to efforts to alleviate hunger in the developing world, there has recently been a rapid increase in the numbers involved in tackling domestic hunger even within the economically advanced nations of the [[Global North]].

This had happened much earlier in North America than it did in Europe. In the US, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration scaled back welfare the early 1980s, leading to a vast increase of charity sector efforts to help Americans unable to buy enough to eat. According to a 1992 survey of 1000 randomly selected US voters, 77% of Americans had contributed to efforts to feed the hungry, either by volunteering for various hunger relief agencies such as [[food banks]] and [[soup kitchen]]s, or by donating cash or food.&lt;ref&gt;

Europe, with its more generous welfare system, had little awareness of domestic hunger until the food price inflation that began in late 2006, and especially as austerity-imposed welfare cuts began to take effect in 2010. Various surveys reported that upwards of 10% of Europe's population had begun to suffer from food insecurity.

By July 2012, the [[2012 US drought]] had already caused a rapid increase in the price of grain and soy, with a knock on effect on the price of meat. As well as affecting hungry people in the US, this caused prices to rise on the global markets; the US is the world's biggest exporter of food. This led to much talk of a possible third 21st century global food crisis. The ''Financial Times'' reported that the [[BRICS]] may not be as badly affected as they were in the earlier crises of 2008 and 2011. However, smaller developing countries that must import a substantial portion of their food could be hard hit. The UN and [[G20]] has begun contingency planning so as to be ready to intervene if a third global crisis breaks out.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US drought"&gt;

Undernutrition is an important determinant of maternal and child health, accounting for more than a third of child deaths and more than 10 percent of the total global [[disease burden]] according to 2008 studies.&lt;ref name="Black2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Black | first1 = R.

World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

As underweight children are more vulnerable to almost all infectious diseases, the ''indirect'' disease burden of malnutrition is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher than the disease burden of the ''direct'' effects of malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The combination of direct and indirect deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene ([[WASH]]) practices is estimated to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{main article|Food security#Gender and food security}}
[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|''[[Migrant Mother]]'' by [[Dorothea Lange]] (1936).]]
Older sources sometimes claim this phenomenon is unique to developing countries, due to greater sexual inequality. More recent findings suggested that mothers often miss meals in advanced economies too. For example, a 2012 study undertaken by [[Netmums]] in the UK found that one in five mothers sometimes misses out on food to save their children from hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-and-hunger/555-million-women-go-hungry-worldwide

In several periods and regions, gender has also been an important factor determining whether or not victims of hunger would make suitable examples for generating enthusiasm for hunger relief efforts. James Vernon, in his ''Hunger: A Modern History'', wrote that in Britain before the 20th century, it was generally only women and children suffering from hunger who could arouse compassion. Men who failed to provide for themselves and their families were often regarded with contempt. This changed after [[World War I]], where thousands of men who had proved their manliness in combat found themselves unable to secure employment. Similarly, female gender could be advantageous for those wishing to advocate for hunger relief, with Vernon writing that being a woman helped [[Emily Hobhouse]] draw the plight of hungry people to wider attention during the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"/&gt;
[[File:Starved_girl.jpg|thumb|183x183px|Starved girl]]

Researchers from the Centre for World Food Studies in 2003 found that the gap between levels of undernutrition in men and women is generally small, but that the gap varies from region to region and from country to country.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; These small-scale studies showed that female undernutrition prevalence rates exceeded male undernutrition prevalence rates in South/Southeast Asia and Latin America and were lower in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Datasets for Ethiopia and Zimbabwe reported undernutrition rates between 1.5 and 2 times higher in men than in women; however, in India and Pakistan, datasets rates of undernutrition were 1.5-2 times higher in women than in men. Intra-country variation also occurs, with frequent high gaps between regional undernutrition rates.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nubé | first1 = M. | last2 = Van Den Boom | first2 = G.

Studies on nutrition concerning gender bias within households look at patterns of food allocation, and one study from 2003 suggested that women often receive a lower share of food requirements than men.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Gender discrimination, gender roles, and social norms affecting women can lead to early marriage and childbearing, close birth spacing, and undernutrition, all of which contribute to malnourished mothers.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh" /&gt;

Within the household, there may be differences in levels of malnutrition between men and women, and these differences have been shown to vary significantly from one region to another, with problem areas showing relative deprivation of women.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Samples of 1000 women in India in 2008 demonstrated that malnutrition in women is associated with poverty, lack of development and awareness, and illiteracy.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; The same study showed that gender discrimination in households can prevent a woman's access to sufficient food and healthcare.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; How socialization affects the health of women in Bangladesh, Najma Rivzi explains in an article about a research program on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Najma Rizvi |publisher=dandc.eu |title=Enduring misery |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/bangladesh-does-not-guarantee-food-security-demanded-its-constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as in parts of Kenya in 2006, rates of malnutrition in pregnant women were even higher than rates in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Rachel Bonham|title=Survey Reveals High Malnutrition Rates Among Pregnant Women in Kenya|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/kenya_33782.html|publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in some societies are traditionally given less food than men since men are perceived to have heavier workloads.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;  Household chores and agricultural tasks can in fact be very arduous and require additional energy and nutrients; however, physical activity, which largely determines energy requirements, is difficult to estimate.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Physiology====
Women have unique nutritional requirements, and in some cases need more nutrients than men; for example, women need twice as much calcium as men.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Nutrition 2001|url=https://www.uthfa.com/gender-nutrition-2001/|publisher=Food and Agriculture of the United Nations |accessdate=August 22, 2016|date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pregnancy and breastfeeding====
During pregnancy and breastfeeding, women must ingest enough nutrients for themselves and their child, so they need significantly more protein and calories during these periods, as well as more vitamins and minerals (especially iron, iodine, calcium, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and K).&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; In 2001 the FAO of the UN reported that iron deficiency afflicted 43 percent of women in [[developing countries]] and increased the risk of death during childbirth.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; A 2008 review of interventions estimated that universal supplementation with calcium, iron, and folic acid during pregnancy could prevent 105,000 maternal deaths (23.6 percent of all maternal deaths).&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhutta | first1 = Z.

Frequent pregnancies with short intervals between them and long periods of breastfeeding add an additional nutritional burden.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Educating children====
According to the FAO, women are often responsible for preparing food and have the chance to educate their children about beneficial food and health habits, giving mothers another chance to improve the nutrition of their children.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;

'''Media Network''' was the name of a weekly [[radio]] programme broadcast on [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] from 7 May 1981 until 26 October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/about About Media Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430184725/http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/about |date=30 April 2010 }}, Radio Netherlands Worldwide blog&lt;/ref&gt; When the programme began the station was known as Radio Nederland, but was renamed Radio Netherlands shortly thereafter.  The programme concentrated on [[communications]] topics with particular reference to international [[shortwave]] [[broadcasting]], but also went on to cover [[mediumwave]] and [[longwave]], [[television]], [[satellite]], [[internet]], reviews of shortwave receivers and other electronic devices. It was produced and presented by Jonathan Marks. In the course of 1994, he was joined by colleague Diana Janssen, who was working as a media researcher at the station, who co-hosted the show until shortly before its end. Media Network ran for over 1000 editions.

==Early history==
[http://www.jonathanmarks.com Jonathan Marks], a British radio producer arrived in the [[Netherlands]] in August 1980. He had previously freelanced for [[Radio Austria International]] in the period 1976-1980 and briefly for the World Radio Club programme running on the [[BBC World Service]]. He was hired as the fifth host of the Radio Nederland "DX Jukebox" programme, a technical show that had been running on the English service since the 1958. His first show was broadcast on 7 August 1980. The content of "DX Jukebox" also revolved around shortwave broadcasting, giving information on schedules for various other stations as well as a variety of details on improving reception. As the name suggested, a portion of the show was devoted to [[music]].

Marks decided that the show needed to be updated to reflect a new era. Fewer listeners were building their own radios. The music was shortened and a name change was also planned for the middle of 1981, with Media Network being the name suggested by Roger Broadbent, a colleague producer. Audience reactions suggested a demand for a new style of programme to be not just about when and on what frequency one could listen to a given station on shortwave, but also about ''why'' one should listen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.omroep.nl/rnw/medianetwork/jonathanwindows500.wmv Jonathan Marks on the history of Media Network] 25th Anniversary vodcast (Copyright Critical Distance B.V.)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1980s, a time when international [[telephony]] was still of a potentially mediocre sound quality (making it unsuitable for shortwave broadcasts), Media Network went against the established wisdom and made extensive use of the telephone. Calls were made to the show's various contributors. On many occasions where telephone quality was deemed too poor for broadcast, a [[Magnetic tape|tape recording]] was made at both ends of the line, then the person with whom Marks was speaking would post the tape to the Netherlands. The two recordings were subsequently edited together resulting in a conversation with much better sound quality.

Over the years the show had many regular contributors who provided valuable information on stations that went on or off the air, [[radio propagation]] conditions, new communications technology and the development of digital formats such as DAT, CD and DVD. Listeners were also encouraged to [[telephone]] an answer line and leave their comments and questions. These messages became an integral part of the programme.

The show prided itself on being less predictable than its predecessor by reporting from international conferences, compiling thematic documentaries and organising its own research surveys into radio related publications and receivers. On some occasions, the reviews of receivers conducted by the show had an influence on the manufacturers who later contacted Media Network for advice on improving their products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.libsyn.com/media/jonathanmarks/MN.04.05.2000.insiders.mp3 Jonathan and Diana discuss the show's history]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Specials covered historic events as conveyed by the media, such as the first [[Gulf War]], the [[Falklands War]] and [[propaganda]] during [[World War II]] and in more recent conflicts. There were also many [[DXpedition]]s or media safari documentaries to profile stations in different parts of the world (e.g. South Africa, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Bonaire).

==Radio Programme Becomes Weblog==
After Diana Janssen left the show in September, 2000 to pursue another career with Forrester Research, Jonathan Marks (who was also employed as Radio Netherlands' Director of Programmes) made the decision to end the show. He cited the increasingly demanding task of fulfilling a corporate role at Radio Netherlands combined with producing a show of a "high standard that we strive for and you deserve".&lt;ref&gt;Media Network edition broadcast 21 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The four editions that followed were replays of popular specials with a finale on 26 October 2000. The editorship of the program was handed over to Andy Sennitt (a frequent contributor also working at Radio Netherlands) who continued the brand as a [[weblog]] until 24 March 2012, shortly before Sennitt retired. The Media Network blog has now been removed from the Radio Netherlands Worldwide site. A copy is available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20130117071721/http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/ archive.org]. No new material or comments will be published there. The Media News aspects of that site have been transferred to the [http://criticaldistance.blogspot.nl/ Critical Distance blog], edited by Jonathan Marks. This is a non-commercial venture.

In February, 2010, Jonathan Marks, now an independent media strategist, launched a project called the '''Media Network Vintage Vault''' which allows the general public to download studio quality editions in [[Mp3]] format. As of July 2015, over 460 editions have been [[digitizing|digitized]] and made available free of charge. Some other programmes made by Jonathan Marks have also been uploaded to the same website, such as "Marks on Mechanics" and "The Hitchhiker's Guide to [[DXing]]", a comedic spoof of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] which had shortwave radio as its basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonathanmarks.libsyn.com/index.php?post_category=Media%20Network%20Archives Media Network Vintage Vault] The vault for complete Media Network shows taken from the collection 1981-2000&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ course assignment | course = Education Program:University of Pennsylvania/HSOC 59 Medical Missionaries and Community Partners (Fall 2013) | term = 2013 Q3 }}

Today, '''Medical Service Ministries''' (since 1992) is a trust organization that provides support via grants to [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian mission]] affiliated applicants who are looking to further their specializations in courses such as [[community health]] and [[tropical medicine]].&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_b"&gt;''Medical service ministries.'' [http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk] (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to 1992, Medical Service Ministries was known as the Missionary School of Medicine (1903-1992) and provided homeopathic training to Christian missionaries who found that they were ill-equipped to help themselves and others in a tropical climate.&lt;ref&gt;The papers of the Medical Service Ministries including minutes, student records, student fellowship files, publications and photographs are held by [https://www.soas.ac.uk/library/archives/collections/a-z/m/ SOAS Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; MSM was formed through the collaborative efforts of the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] and the [[British Homeopathic Association]] in 1903. 
While class size was always relatively small, the 1990s showed particularly small class size. This spurred the Missionary School of Medicine to be renamed Medical Service Ministries in 1992. The implications behind the word “[[missionary]]” were thought to be driving students away.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries"&gt;Davies, A. E. (2007). The history of MSM—homeopathy and natural medicines. [http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/download/The%20History%20of%20MSM.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increasing cost of running the school coupled with the demands brought on by qualifications required by many developing countries at this time caused MSM to close the school portion of the organization (1996) in order to become strictly a [[trust fund]] for funding applicants supported by [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian communities/organizations]].&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;

== Background ==

During the 19th century, many [[missionary|missionaries]] sought to expand trade and spread the Christian gospel in the developing [[British colonies]]. However, many found that they were ill-equipped in the tropical climate; many missionaries and their families became ill. Due to this lack of medical knowledge, many missionaries returned to England to receive [[first aid]] training at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a"&gt;Price, P. (2003). In Cousins A. J. (Ed.), ''Touching the ends of the earth: The story of medical service ministries.'' {{cite web |url=http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/resources/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528022605/http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/resources/ |archivedate=2014-05-28 |df= }} United Kingdom: Medical Service Ministries.&lt;/ref&gt;
As a supporter of the newly formed [[British Homeopathic Association]], the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] was one such place that offered to train missionaries in first aid. The [[British Homeopathic Association|British Homeopathic Association’s]] Educational Committee ran these trainings in partnership with the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]]. Lectures were offered in both basic medicine and surgery.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt;
Finding increased interest from returning missionaries, in the autumn of 1903, the Missionary School of Medicine was opened at the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] to accommodate the training. Upon its opening, Dr. Edwin A. Neatby became the first Dean of the Missionary School of Medicine, presiding over the 24 students enrolled in the school’s first class.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;

== Mission and Work ==

=== Organization===

The Missionary School of Medicine was organized   with a President, and  a general council.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; There were additionally a treasurer and a warden, responsible for both running the school day-to-day and teaching nursing procedures,

Presidents of the school include Edwin A. Neatby (beginning in 1903), H. Dodd (beginning in 1952), and Kathleen Priestman (serving from 1981-1991).&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt;

[[John Weir (physician)|John Weir]] was a notable treasurer for the Missionary School of Medicine due to his contributions to the formation of the school’s [[financial endowment|endowment fund]].&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; Wardens that served at the school include:&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt;
* Miss Goodwin (1903-1934)
* Miss Elizabeth Bargh (1934-1965)
* Miss Lyle Bottom (1965-1980)
* Mrs. Jean Hayward-Lynch (1980-1996)

The teaching staff included homeopathic physicians  experienced in [[tropical medicine]] and other specialties. M  Some of the teaching staff and their subjects include:&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;
* Children’s diseases: Donald Foubister and Kathleen Priestman
* Skin diseases: Alva Benjamin
* General medicine: Charles Wheeler, John MacKillop, [[Queenie Muriel Francis Adams|Muriel Adams]]
* Surgery: W Eldon Tucker and P Cutner
* Dentistry: N E Gillham
* Podiatry: J N LeRossignol

=== Teaching Program&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

The teaching program was delivered over the course of three terms. Early course offerings included lectures in basic medicine and surgery, and later expanded to the other medical areas, as well as to   Homeopathic pharmacy
The goal of the curriculum was to enable missionaries to care for themselves, their families, and others when abroad and when there was no additional medical aid available.

Lectures were held at [[Wellcome Collection|The Wellcome Museum]] as well as at the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]]. The [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] also allowed students at their clinics and to study there. Further, [[St. John Ambulance|St. John’s Ambulance Association]] taught first aid at the school.

Upon graduation from the school, graduates received both homeopathic remedies and certificates. The remedies were donated by homeopathic pharmacies that were involved in teaching at the school, and were given to the graduates to take with them on their missions.

=== Finances&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

In the early 1900s, the “Scholarship Fund” was formed by Reverend Omri Jenkins. It was hoped that an endowment fund could be created from this to cover costs of running the school. The treasurer was responsible for overseeing this fund. Treasurer [[John Weir (physician)|John Weir]] was particularly successful in gathering donations for the fund, attracting funds through private connections.

In addition to these funds, student fees were used to help cover the cost of running the school. Since student fees were kept low, they never could fully cover the cost of running the school. Here is a progression of the student fees at the school:&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt;
* 1909-1926: full-time course cost six guineas per student
* 1950s: one term cost 30 guineas per student
* 1978: one term cost £50 per student
* 1979-1980: one term cost £400 per student (only 15 students enrolled)

=== Students&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

Most students were sponsored by the [[Mission (Christianity)|Missionary Societies]] that sent them abroad. MSM students were supported by 115 different Societies.

Many different countries were represented in MSM. From the 1960s to the 1970s, students came from England, Japan, Norway, Germany, and Korea. In the 1980s, students also came from Angola, the Netherlands, Indonesia, South America, Finland, India, Kenya, Spain, Sri Lanka, and Switzerland.

In the first 50 years of the school, class sizes ranged from 20-30 students. In later years, class sizes were much less, averaging to about 10 students or less per class.

=== Graduates&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

Upon graduating from the school, many graduates went abroad to serve in places including Africa, Japan, South America, India, and Iceland. Supported by home churches and [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] organizations, many graduates set up clinics in the places where they served. Often, the clinics and Mission hospitals in which MSM graduates worked formed the basic network for the development of healthcare in many countries.

=== Homeopathy and Natural Medicines&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

''Main articles: [[Homeopathy]]

[[Homeopathy]] and natural medicine were the focus of the studies of the students at MSM.

Two main principles guide the use of medicine in homeopathy: the Similia Principle and the Dose. The Similia Principle states that a substance that can cause a symptom complex in a healthy person can be used to treat similar symptoms in a sick person. The Dose states that the quantity of medicine used should be the smallest possible to affect a cure and should not be repeated as long as improvement lasts. 
In addition, MSM focused on the use of natural medicine. Natural medicine seeks to combine the advantages of both [[traditional medicine|traditional]] and [[modern medicine]]. [[Traditional medicine]] refers to the use of knowledge of the use of locally grown plants coupled with an understanding of the language and culture of local villages. [[Modern medicine]] refers to the use of drugs that are regulated and produced to a high standard. Through combining these two types of medicine, natural medicine seeks to develop a new culturally appropriate and cost effective health service.

=== MSM Moves&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

In 1925, the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] found that it needed the study room it lent to MSM as a place for it to train its own nurses. As a result, the school moved from [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] to 2 Powis Place, where it remained until it closed in 1996.

=== Aims of the School&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

In 1936, [[John Weir (physician)|John Weir]] (treasurer), stated the aims of the Missionary School of Medicine:
# To enable missionaries to look after their own health.
# To enable missionaries to nurse and treat one another on the mission field when ill or miles away from medical aid.
# To enable missionaries to start dispensaries for the local people and so open the door for the gospel tidings.

=== A New Name for MSM&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

While class size was always relatively small, the 1990s showed particularly small class size. Leaders in the school assumed that lack of interest could be attributed to the implications of the word “[[missionary]]” in modern day culture. As a result, the Missionary School of Medicine was renamed Medical Service Ministries in 1992. One goal of the renaming was to attract more students to take their 10-week summer courses. However, as class size did not show a significant improvement, the school closed in 1996.

== Closing of the School and Conversion to a Trust ==

=== From School to Trust&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

The 1990s showed a major development in the health ministries of emerging nations, like Africa. As a result, these developing nations requested that those offering medical treatment have required registered qualifications. In order to provide academically recognized qualifications, Medical Service Ministries found that it would have to merge with a university. However, since class sizes were so small and the cost to run the school was only increasing, Medical Service Ministries decided to discontinue training in 1996.

When the school closed, investment income was transferred to the Scholarship Fund, reducing administration costs. As a result, with the work of the Administrator of Trust, Mrs. Glennis Powling, Medical Service Ministries was able to make its financial resources available to fund applicants traveling elsewhere.

=== MSM Today&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

As a grant-making trust, Medical Service Ministries provides grants to candidates undertaking specialist training in these areas:
* Child health
* [[Community health]]care
* Disaster relief
* [[Midwifery]]
* [[Palliative care]]
* Travel and [[tropical medicine]]

In addition, MSM generally considers funding applicants who are primary healthcare trainers or workers in impoverished areas of underdeveloped countries. Further, applicants must show evidence of sponsorship or support of a [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian mission]] or local community.

One example of a [[trust fund]] applicant success story can be found in Tamara Filmer, a [[missionary]] working in rural, undeveloped Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Filmer, T. "Training to forecast!" {{cite web |url=http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/2013/02/training-to-forecast/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528025417/http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/2013/02/training-to-forecast/ |archivedate=2014-05-28 |df= }} (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Filmer writes:

''“With MSM’s assistance I was able to attend training in logistics and management regarding pharmaceuticals.  In December 2012, I travelled from the mid-west of Nepal to India’s capital, Delhi, to attend a two-week course entitled “International Procurement and Supply Chain Management”.  I walked away with a suitcase of information and resources! ... I want to thank Medical Service Ministries and their supporters for the funding that enabled me to attend this course.  On our missionary living allowance, it just wouldn’t have been possible to afford the course, so I am grateful for this opportunity.”''

=== Mission Statement&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

The current mission statement of Medical Service Ministries is as follows:

''“To encourage full-time Christian workers in the UK and elsewhere to prepare for Personal and Community Healthcare work in the developing world, in association with Christian organizations, and to witness to their faith in obedience to Christ’s command to preach and heal. Funding is available for approved healthcare candidates.”''

Recently retired treasurer, Brian Weller, shows that this mission statement is alive in the everyday actions of MSM and its leadership when he states:&lt;ref&gt;Weller, B. "MSM's third treasurer in 107 years stands down." {{cite web |url=http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/2013/05/msms-third-treasurer-in-107-years-stands-down/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528022746/http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/2013/05/msms-third-treasurer-in-107-years-stands-down/ |archivedate=2014-05-28 |df= }} (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
''“It is my belief that overseas Christian service in response to Our Lord’s commission to preach and heal calls for continued effort and support, and will not lack His supply as we rise to the challenge.  Our vision is to make healthcare accessible and to raise standards.  It will continue to be achieved through individuals called by God to play their part here at home and overseas.”''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38147">The '''Official Women's Squash World Ranking''' is the official world ranking for women's [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. The ranking is to rate the performance level of female professional squash player. It is also a merit-based method used for determining entry and seeding in women's squash tournaments. The rankings are produced monthly.&lt;ref name="rank&amp;divisor"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://psaworldtour.com/squash/guides/20161005113420_PSATourRuleBook20162017.pdf |title=PSA Tour Rule Book |publisher=PSA |page=41 |accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current world number one is [[Nour El Sherbini]] of Egypt, who replaced [[Laura Massaro]] in May 2016.

==PSA Ranking Policy==
Players competing in PSA tournaments earn ranking points according to how far they get in the draw. The points available depend on the prize money and the draw size. The monthly rankings (issued on the 1st of the month) are used in selecting entries to tournaments and in determining the seeds.

The total number of points a player earns in a year (52 weeks) is divided by the number of tournaments played (a minimum of eight are required) to give a ranking average. Where a player has played more than 8 tournaments the best scores may be selected (i.e., the lowest are not included).

For example, a player who has competed in 13 events will have selected her best 10 scores, which will be accumulated and divided by 10.

Players competing in [[Professional Squash Association|PSA World Tour]] Events earn ranking points according to the prize money, classification of the event, and the final position in the draw the player reaches.

==Areas of research==
The Oxford Brookes Centre for Nutrition and Health has the goal of providing scientific information about food and health to consumers, government and the food industry.&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes/&gt; It tests popular claims about food, for example that [[genetically modified crops]] will feed the world, that substances such as [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] in [[fish oil]] will make children more intelligent, or that [[antioxidant]]s can reduce cancer by removing [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; It develops new food products  such as low [[glycemic index]] bread, which reduces [[cholesterol]] and [[blood sugar]] levels and help weight loss.&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes/&gt; It researches lesser-known foods such as [[breadfruit]], [[cassava]], [[sorghum]] and [[millet]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; The health issues that are its research priorities are [[diabetes]], [[obesity]] and the impact of food on age-related problems.&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes/&gt;

'''''Poa pratensis''''', commonly known as '''Kentucky bluegrass''' (or '''blue grass'''), '''smooth meadow-grass''', or '''common meadow-grass''', is a [[perennial]] species of [[Poaceae|grass]] native to practically all of Europe, northern Asia and the mountains of Algeria and Morocco. Although the species is spread over all of the cool, humid parts of the U.S., it is not native to North America. The Spanish brought the seeds of Kentucky bluegrass to the New World in mixtures with other grasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/archives/parsons/turf/publications/Bluegrass.html|title=Kentucky Bluegrass |publisher=Aggie Horticulture|author=Martin Anderson, Texas AgriLife Extension Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Poa pratensis'' forms a valuable pasture plant, characteristic of well-drained, fertile soil. It is also used for making [[lawn]]s in parks and gardens and is common in cool moist climates like the northeastern United States. When found on native grasslands in Canada, however, it is considered an unwelcome exotic plant, and is indicative of a disturbed and degraded landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ksenija Vujnovic |author2=Ross W.

==Taxonomy==
''Poa pratensis'' was one of the many species described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his landmark work ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753. ''Poa'' is [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] for [[fodder]] and ''pratensis'' is derived from ''pratum'', the [[Latin]] for [[meadow]]. The name Kentucky bluegrass derives from its flower heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of {{convert|2|to|3|ft|cm|-1|abbr=in|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dag Ryen (letter to the editor) |date=June 3, 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/opinion/l-what-makes-kentucky-s-bluegrass-blue-528593.html |title=What Makes Kentucky's Bluegrass Blue |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=22 |accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Poa pratensis'' is the [[type (botany)|type species]] of the grass family [[Poaceae]].

There are two ill-defined subspecies:
*''Poa pratensis'' [[ssp.]] ''pratensis'' – temperate regions
*''Poa pratensis'' ssp. ''colpodea'' – Arctic

==Description==
''Poa pratensis'' is a [[herbaceous]] perennial plant {{convert|30|–|70|cm}} tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] have boat-shaped tips, narrowly linear, up to {{convert|20|cm|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|3|–|5|mm}} broad, smooth or slightly roughened, with a rounded to truncate ligule {{convert|1|–|2|mm}} long. The conical [[panicle]] is {{convert|5|–|20|cm|sigfig=1}} long, with 3 to 5 branches in the basal whorls; the oval [[spikelet]]s are {{convert|3|–|6|mm}} long with 2 to 5 [[floret]]s, and are purplish-green or grey. They are in flower from May to July, compared to annual meadowgrass (''[[Poa annua]]'') which is in flower for eight months of the year. ''Poa pratensis'' has a fairly prominent mid-vein (center of the blade).

The [[ligule]] is extremely short and square ended, making a contrast with annual meadowgrass (''[[Poa annua]]'') and rough meadowgrass (''[[Poa trivialis]]'') in which it is silvery and pointed. The Kentucky bluegrass is a dark green/blue compared to the apple-green color of ''Poa annua'' and ''Poa trivialis''.

The [[rootstock]] is creeping, with runners ([[rhizome]]s). The broad, blunt leaves tend to spread at the base, forming close mats.

==Ecology==
[[File:PP Na Popovickem kopci 007 cf Myrmus miriformis.jpg|thumb|''[[Myrmus miriformis]]'' in the [[Olomouc Region]]]]
This species is among the food plants of the caterpillars of the [[meadow brown]] (''Maniola jurtina'') and [[Gatekeeper (butterfly)|gatekeeper]] (''Pyronia tithonus'') butterflies; the common sun beetle (''[[Amara aenea]]'') (adults feed on the developing seeds), ''Eupelix cuspidata'' of the [[leafhopper]] family, and ''[[Myrmus miriformis]]'', a grassbug (feeds on young blades and developing seeds).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantpress.com/wildlife/o1084-roughmeadowgrass.php Natural England description on website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223215305/http://www.plantpress.com/wildlife/o1084-roughmeadowgrass.php |date=2009-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation and production==
Since the 1950s and early 1960s, 90% of Kentucky bluegrass seed in the United States has been produced on specialist farms in [[Idaho]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

During the 1990s botanists began experimenting with hybrids of ''Poa pratensis'' and Texas bluegrass (''[[Poa arachnifera|P. arachnifera]]''), with the goal of creating a [[drought]] and heat-resistant lawn grass.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10221">'''Political globalization''' refers to the growth of the worldwide [[political system]], both in size and complexity. That system includes [[Government|national government]]s, their [[governmental organizations|governmental]] and [[intergovernmental organizations]] as well as government-independent elements of [[global civil society]] such as [[international non-governmental organizations]] and [[social movement organization]]s. One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the [[nation-state]] and the rise of other actors on the political scene. The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.

Political globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being [[economic globalization]] and [[cultural globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA146|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William R. Thompson]] has defined it as "the expansion of a global political system, and its institutions, in which inter-regional transactions (including, but certainly not limited to trade) are managed".&lt;ref name="ModelskiDevezas2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Modelski|author2=Tessaleno Devezas|author3=William R.

Moghadam defined it as "an increasing trend toward [[multilateralism]] (in which the [[United Nations]] plays a key role), toward an emerging 'transnational state apparatus,' and toward the emergence of national and [[international nongovernmental organizations]] that act as watchdogs over governments and have increased their activities and influence".&lt;ref name="Moghadam2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valentine M.

But it also refers to the spread and influence of [[international non-governmental organization]]s, [[social movement organization]]s and transnational advocacy networks operating across borders and constituting a kind of [[global civil society]]."&lt;ref name="AmentaNash2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Crouch|chapter=Democracy and Capitalism in the Wake of the Financial Crisis|editor1=Edwin Amenta|editor2=Kate Nash|editor3=Alan Scott|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz8gk5-a5CUC&amp;pg=PT487|date=2 February 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5507-9|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Gerard Delanty]] and [[Chris Rumford]] define it as "a tension between three processes which interact to produce the complex field of [[global politics]]: global [[geopolitics]], global [[normative culture]] and [[polycentric networks]]."&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
[[Salvatore Babones]] discussing sources used by scholars for studying political globalizations noted the usefulness of [[Europa World Year Book]] for data on diplomatic relationships between countries, publications of [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] such as ''The Military Balance'' for matters of military, and US government publication ''Patterns of Global Terrorism'' for matters of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-152"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political globalization is measured by aggregating and weighting data on the number of embassies and high commissioners in a country, the number of the country's membership in international organization, its participation in the UN peacekeeping missions, and the number of international treaties signed by said country. This measure has been used by [[Axel Dreher]], [[Noel Gaston]], [[Pim Martens]] [[Jeffrey Haynes]] and is available from the [[KOF institute]] at [[ETH Zurich]]&lt;ref name="Haynes2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Haynes|title=Religion and Political Change in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z-DCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64|date=7 September 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69699-5|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welfens2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J.J.

==Aspects==
[[Dimensions of globalization|Like globalization itself]], political globalization has several dimensions and lends itself to a number of interpretations. It has been discussed in the context of new emancipatory possibilities, as well as in the context of loss of autonomy and fragmentation of the social world.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"/&gt; Political globalization can be seen in changes such as [[democratization]] of the world, creation of the global [[civil society]],&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-426"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moving beyond the centrality of the [[nation-state]], particularly as the sole actor in the field of politics.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt; Some of the questions central to the discussion of the political globalization are related to the future of the nation-state, whether its importance is diminishing and what are the causes for those changes; and understanding the emergence of the concept of [[global governance]].&lt;ref name="Steger2003-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA57|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annabelle Mooney|author2=Betsy Evans|title=Globalization: The Key Concepts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCV-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194|date=12 March 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-20472-4|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political actions by non-governmental organizations and social movements, concerned about various topics such as [[environmental protection]], is another example.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt;

[[David Held]] has proposed that continuing political globalization may lead to the creation of a [[world government]]-like [[cosmopolitan democracy]], though this vision has also been criticized as too idealistic.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-68"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA68|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Globalization and Nation State==
There is a heated debate over Political Globalization and Nation State. The question arises whether or not political globalization signifies the decline of the nation-state. Hyper globalists argue that globalization has engulfed today's world in such a way that state boundaries are beginning to lose significance. However, skeptics disregard this as naiveté, believing that the nation-state remains the supreme actor in international relations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://internationalaffairsbd.com/political-globalization-nation-state/|title=Contemporary Debate on Political Globalization and Nation StateYeg=PA68|author=|first=|last2=|date=2017|publisher=International Affairs, UK|year=|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|location=|page=68|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An industry involved in the extraction and collection of natural resources, such as copper and timber, as well as by activities such as farming and fishing. A company in a primary industry can also be involved in turning natural resources into products.
Primary industry tends to make up a larger portion of the economy of developing countries than they do for developed countries. See also service industry, secondary industry.
The '''primary sector''' is concerned with the extraction of raw materials. It includes fishing, farming and mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary sector of the economy|url=https://www.economicshelp.org/concepts/primary-sector/|website=Economics Help|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary industry is a larger sector in [[developing country|developing countries]]; for instance, [[animal husbandry]] is more common in countries in [[Africa]] than in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2554153|title=Review of The Primary Sector in Economic Development|first=C. D.|last=Scott|date=2 July 1986|publisher=|journal=Economica|volume=53|issue=211|pages=414–416|doi=10.2307/2554153}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mining in 19th-century [[South Wales]] provides a case study of how an economy can come to rely on one form of activity.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://business.virgin.net/wales.watch/country/farm2.htm Mining: it's only a word] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123191936/http://business.virgin.net/wales.watch/country/farm2.htm |date=2007-01-23 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[developed country|developed countries]] the primary industry has become more technologically advanced, for instance the mechanization of farming as opposed to hand picking and planting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS/countries/1W-US-C5?display=graph|title=Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate) - Data|author=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more developed countries, additional capital is invested in primary means of production.  As an example, in the United States' [[corn belt]], [[combine harvester]]s pick the corn, and sprayers spray large amounts of [[insecticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s and [[fungicide]]s, producing a higher yield than is possible using less capital-intensive techniques.  These technological advances and investment allow the primary sector to require less workforce and, this way, developed countries tend to have a smaller percentage of their workforce involved in primary activities, instead having a higher percentage involved in the secondary and tertiary sectors.&lt;ref&gt;H Dwight H. Perkins: Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science, Vol. 31, No. 1, China's Developmental Experience (Mar., 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed countries are allowed to maintain and develop their primary industries even further due to the excess wealth. For instance, European Union [[Agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] provide buffers for the fluctuating inflation rates and prices of agricultural [[produce]]. This allows developed countries to be able to export their agricultural products at extraordinarily low prices.  This makes them extremely competitive against those of poor or underdeveloped countries that maintain free market policies and low or non-existent tariffs to counter them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/twninfo339.htm WTO MINISTERIAL OUTCOME IMBALANCED AGAINST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823085546/http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/twninfo339.htm |date=2006-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/gtrends6.htm Third World Farmers Hit by Unfair Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909232153/http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/gtrends6.htm |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalcall.com/international/farmers10-08-2002.htm|title=U.S. subsidies help big business, but crush farmers from developing  countries|author=|date=|website=www.finalcall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such differences also come about due to more efficient production in developed economies, given farm machinery, better information available to farmers, and often larger scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21967">In [[global health]], '''priority-setting''' is a term used for the process and strategy of deciding which health interventions to carry out. Priority-setting can be conducted at the disease level (i.e. deciding which disease to alleviate), the overall strategy level (i.e. [[selective primary healthcare]] versus [[primary healthcare]] versus more general [[health systems strengthening]]), research level (i.e. which health research to carry out),&lt;ref name=rudan2007/&gt; or other levels.&lt;ref name=durand /&gt;{{rp|5}}

==Definitions==

Priority-setting is the act of deciding which health interventions to carry out, and can occur at several levels of granularity. Priority-setting can occur at the following levels:&lt;ref name=rudan2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=durand /&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name="pmac2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/CallForAbstract.pdf |title=Call for Abstracts: Priority Setting for Universal Health Coverage |accessdate=June 23, 2016 |publisher=Prince Mahidol Award Conference 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* health budget level (i.e. deciding how much to spend on health overall)
* overall strategy level (i.e. [[selective primary healthcare]] versus [[primary healthcare]] versus more general [[health systems strengthening]])
* disease level (i.e. deciding which disease to alleviate)
* intervention level within each disease (i.e. restricting to a specific disease and prioritizing among interventions for that disease)
* drug level
* research level (i.e. which health research to carry out)

Synonymous terms include "prioritization in health care and health research", "priority determination", "health priorities",&lt;ref name=rudan2010/&gt; and "agenda-setting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 370| issue = 9595| pages = 1370–1379| last1 = Shiffman| first1 = Jeremy| last2 = Smith| first2 = Stephanie| title = Generation of political priority for global health initiatives: a framework and case study of maternal mortality| journal = The Lancet| accessdate = 2016-07-26| date = 2007| url = http://www.who.int/pmnch/topics/advocacy/JShiffman-globalsmarticle-Lancet.pdf| doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(07)61579-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metrics==

Various metrics have been used to compare interventions. These include:

* [[Disability-adjusted life year]] per unit cost (used by e.g. [[Disease Control Priorities Project]]),&lt;ref name=rudan2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="glassman2012"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.gheart.2012.01.007| issn = 2211-8160| volume = 7| issue = 1| pages = 13–34| last1 = Glassman| first1 = Amanda| last2 = Chalkidou| first2 = Kalipso| last3 = Giedion| first3 = Ursula| last4 = Teerawattananon| first4 = Yot| last5 = Tunis| first5 = Sean| last6 = Bump| first6 = Jesse B.| last7 = Pichon-Riviere| first7 = Andres| title = Priority-Setting Institutions in Health| journal = Global Heart| accessdate = 2016-06-23| date = March 2012| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211816012000105}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quality-adjusted life year]], and other forms of [[cost-effectiveness analysis]]

* Adequacy of funding&lt;ref name=dcp2_ch4 /&gt;

==Who sets the priorities?==

Priority-setting can be done by various actors. These include:

* Governments: "In most countries, health spending by governments vastly outpaces international health aid, so governments set most health priorities."&lt;ref name="glassman2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Glassman%2011-13-13%20(public).pdf |title=A conversation with Amanda Glassman on November 13, 2013 |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=June 21, 2016 |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Non-profits and companies that assist governments
* If a country is using a [[Health in All Policy]] (HiAP) approach, then priority-setting is done by stakeholders who do not directly deal with health.&lt;ref name=pmac2016/&gt;
* International organizations
* Foundations
* Private donors (including [[high-net-worth individual]]s and ultra-high-net-worth individuals): "A common outcome is a negotiated set of priorities that reflect some domestic needs and some technical, political, and economic considerations defined largely by the interests of donors."&lt;ref name=glassman2012/&gt; In some highly aid-dependent countries, donors "have huge influence on health priorities".&lt;ref name=glassman2013/&gt;

According to Devi Sridhar, professor of global health at the [[University of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cphs.mvm.ed.ac.uk/people/staffProfile.php?profile=dsridhar |date=September 30, 2015 |title=Centre for Population Health Sciences - People |accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the priorities of funding bodies largely dictate what health issues and diseases are studied".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001312| issn = 1549-1676| volume = 9| issue = 9| pages = –1001312| last = Sridhar| first = Devi| title = Who Sets the Global Health Research Agenda?

==History of organizations and programs working on priority-setting==

According to [[Amanda Glassman]] et al., global-level priority-setting has occurred since at least the 1980s, though these efforts have only focused on a few aspects.&lt;ref name=glassman2012 /&gt;

The following table is a timeline of organizations and programs working on priority-setting.

&lt;!-- Merge info from [[University_of_Toronto_Joint_Centre_for_Bioethics#Priority_Setting]]:

Priority setting, or resource allocation, is an important health policy issue that occurs at all levels of health care. The Joint Centre for Bioethics shares its research platform on priority setting with the Canadian Priority Setting Research Network, which aims to improve the politics and processes of health care priority setting and enhance the research capacity for priority setting. The centre takes an innovative approach to priority setting research in that the focus is placed on enhancing the priority setting processes, capturing and sharing actual priority setting experiences, and taking a bottom-up approach to improve priority setting.

==Reception==

{{cquote|text=The result of a myriad of actors championing a kaleidoscope of "priorities" is confusion. Advocates, researchers, and policy makers have labeled almost every disease, condition, medication, or intervention a "health priority."|author=Glassman et al.&lt;ref name=glassman2012/&gt;}}

Rudan et al. says that priority-setting efforts have relied on "consensus reached by panels of experts" and as a result have not been systematic enough, and that this has "often made it difficult to present the identified priorities to wider audiences as legitimate and fair".&lt;ref name=rudan2007/&gt;

[[Amanda Glassman|Glassman]] et al. notes that criticisms of priority-setting include "the weak data on which estimates of burden, cost, and effectiveness relied; the value judgments implicit in disability-adjusted life year age weighting and discounting decisions; and treatment of equity issues, as well as the political difficulties associated with translating a ground zero package into a public budget based on historical inputs"; and the consideration of only health maximization at the expense of other objectives such as fairness.&lt;ref name=glassman2012 /&gt;{{rp|16}}

Glassman et al. also notes how there are more cost-effectiveness studies for LMICs (in the thousands), but that these are unlikely to be actually applied to priority-setting processes.&lt;ref name=glassman2012 /&gt;{{rp|16}}

[[Jeremy Shiffman]] has said that some bodies such as the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] and ''[[The Lancet]]'' are prominent in priority-setting due to their dominion rather than data and analysis, and also notes that the process of creating the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] was not sufficiently transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.15171/ijhpm.2015.51| issn = 2322-5939| volume = 4| issue = 5| pages = 315–317| last = Levine| first = Ruth E.| title = Power in global health agenda-setting: the role of private funding| journal = International Journal of Health Policy and Management| date = 2015-03-04| pmid = 25905483| pmc = 4417636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5151">A '''reception report''' is a means by which radio stations (usually [[shortwave|short-]] and [[Medium frequency|medium-wave]] broadcasters) receive detailed feedback from their listeners about the quality and content of their broadcasts. A reception report consists of several pieces of information which help the station verify that the report confirms coverage of their transmission, and usually include the following information:

*Date, time and frequency (in [[Hertz|kHz]]) of the transmission
*Station name
*Description of the [[interval signal]], if heard
*Programme details
*Name of announcers or programme host, if heard
*Details of the overall signal quality (normally using the [[SINPO]] code)

The listener's location relative to the station is also useful; this indicates how well the station's [[transmitter]] is performing and in which direction(s) its antenna is beaming the signal. The station also evaluates a reception report in light of the listener's [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] and antenna. Upon receipt of a correct report, a broadcaster sometimes issues a letter or [[postcard]] (known as a [[QSL card]]) to the sender, thanking them and confirming that the details are correct.  "QSL" is part of the [[amateur radio]] [[Q code]], meaning "I acknowledge receipt". One aspect of [[DXing]] is collecting QSL cards and letters from stations heard (similar to a [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher's]] "life list"). QSLing a radio station involves writing an accurate reception report, mailing it to the station and awaiting a reply. Since QSLing is a voluntary act on the station's part, several techniques are used to improve a listener's success rate.

Station engineers and other personnel are primarily interested in whether or not their station is heard, and how well; therefore, a complete and accurate reception report (whether by postal or e-mail) is generally appreciated. To begin, report the frequency, date and time the station was heard. For medium-wave (AM) stations, the time should be that of the [[time zone]] in which the station is located. Thus, if a listener hears stations from the [[Eastern time zone]] of North America (such as Ontario and New York), [[Standard time|EST]] or [[Daylight saving time|EDT]] should be given (depending on the time of year). Stations in the [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central time zone]] (such as [[Chicago]]) use CST or CDT, which is one hour earlier than Eastern time. If a listener is uncertain of the time zone, they should clearly indicate their local time or even better use [[UTC]]

It is helpful to jot down programming as it is heard. Useful details include:

*[[Station identification]]
*Program name
*Names of station announcers (such as a [[talk show]] host)
*Commercials (good indicators, because the station keeps a [[logbook]] of commercials
*Names of [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|network programs]], such as "[[CNN]] News" or "[[The Sports Network|TSN Sports]]"

The purpose of providing this information is to prove to the station that you heard their program and not that of another station. The more detail a listener can provide, the better the chance of eliciting a QSL. Include information, also, about how well the signal was received. For medium-wave reports, an indication of signal strength and any interference ([[Co-channel interference|co-]] or [[adjacent-channel interference]], with identity of interfering station if possible) is usually sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-guide-reception-reports-quick.html Quick Guide to Reception Reports]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531172957/http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-guide-reception-reports-quick.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International shortwave broadcasters are familiar with the [[SINPO]] code:

*'''S'''ignal strength
*'''I'''nterference (includes human-generated noise—for example, power-line hum)
*'''N'''oise ("white [[Noise (radio)|noise"]], or thunderstorm static)
*'''P'''ropagation disturbance ([[fading]])
*'''O'''verall reception quality

Each letter receives a value between 5 and 1, where 5 is the best and 1 the worst. Many shortwave listeners (known as "program listeners") desire nothing more than music and news from a broadcaster; however, for DXers a QSL collection is tangible proof of what they have heard. Some listeners use pre-printed forms if they are unfamiliar with the language spoken by station personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Writing Useful Reception Reports http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531154511/http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While major international broadcasters have not required return postage for a QSL, the growing popularity of e-mailed reception reports and e-QSLs has largely eliminated the necessity for [[international reply coupon]]s (IRCs), [[mint stamp]]s from the verifying station's country or "green stamps" (US dollar bills).

The '''Revolutions of 1917–1923''' were a period of political unrest and revolts around the world inspired by the success of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the disorder created by the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The uprisings were mainly [[socialist]] or [[anti-colonial]] in nature and were mostly short-lived, failing to have a long-term impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historytoday.com/david-motadel/waves-revolution |title=Waves of Revolution |last1=Motadel |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=April 4, 2011 |website=History Today |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the revolutionary activity of the era, the [[revolutionary wave]] of 1917–1923 mainly refers to the unrest caused by [[World War I]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnLI8ooHHPgC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=1917%E2%80%9323+wave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3tb3I4H5ZA&amp;sig=j8d0sgDCa3o0D0fK8fPGymAhdlM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW0Mr-q8TMAhULKh4KHfsFDlAQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=1917%E2%80%9323%20wave&amp;f=false |title=Neutral Europe Between War and Revolution, 1917-23 |last1=Schmitt |first1=Hans |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist revolutions in Europe==
===Russia===
{{Main|Russian Revolution|Russian Civil War}}
[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] but before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]], and [[Peace of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]]]

In war-torn [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], the liberal [[February Revolution]] toppled the monarchy. It was unstable and the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power in the [[October Revolution]]. The ascendant [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|communist party]] soon withdrew from the war with some territorial concessions by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].  It then battled its political rivals in the [[Russian Civil War]], including [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|invading forces from the Allied Powers]]. In response to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], the Bolshevik Party and the emerging [[Soviet Union]], [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] from a broad assortment of ideological factions fought against them, particularly through the [[counter-revolutionary]] [[White movement]] and the peasant [[Green armies|Green Army]], the various nationalist movements in [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution]] and other would-be new states like those in Soviet [[Transcaucasia]] and [[Soviet Central Asia]], through the [[Anarchism|anarchist]]-inspired [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|Third Russian Revolution]] and [[Tambov Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Ascher, //The Russian Revolution: A Beginner's Guide'' (Oneworld Publications, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1921, due to exhaustion, the collapse of transportation and markets, and threats of starvation, even dissident elements of the [[Red Army]] itself were in revolt against the [[communist state]], as shown by the [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. However, the multiple anti-Bolshevik forces were uncoordinated and disorganized, and in every case operated on the periphery. The Red Army, operating at the center, defeated them one by one and regained control. The complete failure of Comintern-inspired revolutions was a sobering experience in Moscow, and the Bolsheviks moved from world revolution to the theme of socialism in one country, Russia. Lenin moved to open trade relations with Britain, Germany, and other major countries. Most dramatically, in 1921, Lenin introduced a sort of small-scale capitalism with his [[New Economic Policy]] (or NEP). In this process of revolution and counter-revolution the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) was officially born in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Rex A. Wade, "The Revolution at One Hundred: Issues and Trends in the English Language Historiography of the Russian Revolution of 1917." ''Journal of Modern Russian History and Historiography'' 9.1 (2016): 9-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===
{{Main|German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Biennio Rosso}}
[[File:Berlin.revolution1918.statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of a revolutionary soldier; memorial to the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] in [[Berlin]]]]

The [[Leninist]] victories also inspired a surge by the [[History of communism|world Communist movement]]: the larger [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] and its offspring, like the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], as well as the neighboring [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Hungarian Revolution]], and the [[Biennio Rosso]] in Italy in addition to various smaller uprisings, protests and strikes, all proved abortive.

The Bolsheviks sought to coordinate this new wave of revolution in the Soviet-led [[Communist International]], while new [[Communist party|communist parties]] separated from their former socialist organizations and the older, more moderate [[Second International]]. Despite ambitions for [[world revolution]], the far-flung Comintern movement had more setbacks than successes through the next generation, and it was abolished in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McDermott and Jeremy Agnew, ''The Comintern: A History of International Communism from Lenin to Stalin'' (Macmillan, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; After the Second World War when the [[Red Army]] occupied most of Eastern Europe, Communists would come to power in the Baltic states, [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Comrades!: A History of World Communism'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Communist revolutions==
===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], then part of the United Kingdom, the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 anticipated the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921) within the same historical period as this first wave of [[communist revolution]]. The [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] movement of the time was predominantly nationalist and [[Populism|populist]], and although it had left-wing positions and included socialists and communists, it was not Communist. The Irish and Soviet Russian Republics nevertheless found common ground in their opposition to [[British Empire|British interests]], and established a trading relationship.

===Mexico===
The same was true of the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1920), which had broken out in 1910 but had devolved into factional fighting among the rebels by 1915, as the more radical forces of [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Pancho Villa]] lost ground to the more conservative "Sonoran oligarchy" and its [[Constitutional Army]]. The [[Felicistas]], the last major group of counterrevolutionaries, abandoned their armed campaign in 1920, and the internecine power struggles abated for a time after revolutionary General [[Álvaro Obregón]] had bribed or slain his former allies and rivals alike, but the following decade witnessed the assassination of Obregon and several others, abortive [[Coup d'état|military coup]] attempts and a massive right-wing uprising, the [[Cristero War]], due to religious persecution of Roman Catholics.

===Malta===
The [[Sette Giugno|Sette Giugno of 1919]] was a revolt characterised by a series of riots and protests by the Maltese population, initially as a reaction to the rise in the cost of living in the aftermath of [[World War I]], and the sacking of hundreds of workers from the dockyard. This coincided with popular demands for [[Self-governance|self-government]], which resulted in a National Assembly being formed in Valletta at the same time of the riots. This dramatically boosted the uprising, as many people headed to Valletta to show their support for the Assembly. This led to the British forces firing into the crowd, killing four local men. The cost of living increased dramatically after the war. Imports were limited, and as food became scarce prices rose; this made the fortune of farmers and merchants with surpluses to trade.

===Egypt===
The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] was a countrywide [[revolution]] against the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. It was carried out by [[Egyptians]] and Sudanese from different walks of life in the wake of the British-ordered exile of revolutionary leader [[Saad Zaghloul]], and other members of the [[Wafd Party]] in 1919. The revolution led to Britain's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|recognition of Egyptian independence]] in 1922, and the implementation of a new [[Egyptian Constitution of 1923|constitution in 1923]]. Britain, however, continued in control of what was renamed the [[Kingdom of Egypt]]. British guided the king and retained control of the Canal Zone, [[Sudan]] and Egypt's external and military affairs. King Fuad died in 1936 and [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] when Italy invaded Ethiopia, he signed the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]], requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt by 1949, except at the Suez Canal. During World War II, British troops [[Military history of Egypt during World War II|used Egypt]] as a major base for its operations throughout the region. British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947, but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the war.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Vatikiotis, ''The History of Modern Egypt'' (4th ed., 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ricciocarpos natans''''' is the only species in the genus '''''Ricciocarpos''''', a genus of [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s in the family [[Ricciaceae]].&lt;ref name="Campbell 1918" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crandall-Stotler 2000" /&gt; It was formerly listed in 1759 as a species of ''[[Riccia]]'' by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], but then assigned to a new genus of its own in 1829 by [[August Carl Joseph Corda]].

Despite having many common features with the genus ''Riccia'',&lt;ref name="Campbell 1918" /&gt; its most obvious difference from that genus are the long sword-shaped purple scales that hang from the under surface of floating plants.&lt;ref name="Schuster VI" /&gt; The genus has occasionally appeared in the literature under the spelling '''''Ricciocarpus''''', but the spelling with an '''o''' is the original and accepted spelling.&lt;ref name="Grolle 1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crandall-Stotler 2000" /&gt; The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] "''natans''" comes from the Latin word for "swimming", because plants typically float freely in ponds or quiet waters.

Plants of ''R. natans'' have two very different forms, depending on the conditions under which the plant grows. One form develops in plants that grow on land (terrestrial), and another form develops when plants grow floating in the water (aquatic). The terrestrial form develops into [[rosette (botany)|rosette]]s 25–35 millimetres across,&lt;ref name="Howe 1923" /&gt; of short and narrow branches having almost parallel sides. The more usual form is aquatic, and develops as broader, heart-shaped [[thallus]] with fewer branchings and long slender purple scales hanging from the underside. The two forms are so physically different from each other that they were originally thought to be different species.&lt;ref name="Schuster VI" /&gt;

''Ricciocarpos'' is distributed globally, being found almost everywhere except the polar regions&lt;ref name="Schuster VI" /&gt; though it is rare in parts of the tropics.&lt;ref name="Wigginton 2004" /&gt; It may form extensive floating colonies in quiet waters,&lt;ref name="Schofield 1985" /&gt; and grows readily in laboratory cultures.&lt;ref name="Bold 1987" /&gt; Although fertile plants are not unknown, mature plants bearing spore capsules are rarely found. It is therefore assumed that ''Ricciocarpos'' spreads primarily through [[vegetative reproduction]] as the plants break apart.&lt;ref name="Allison 1975" /&gt; It has been suggested that the aquatic forms remain sterile and that sexual reproduction is largely limited to terrestrial forms,&lt;ref name="Kashyap 1929" /&gt; but other sources maintain that terrestrial forms are normally sterile as well.&lt;ref name="Bold 1987" /&gt;

'''Radio Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges Radio International}}) is [[Sweden]]'s official [[international broadcasting]] station. It is a non-commercial and politically independent public service broadcasting company.

==History==
SR International is part of [[Sveriges Radio]] (SR), Sweden's non-commercial public-radio broadcasting organization. The service was founded in 1938, at the approach of [[World War II]], as a way of keeping Swedes living abroad informed of happenings in Sweden and of Swedish opinion. Programming was at first in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] only, but in 1939 [[English language|English-]] and [[German-language]] broadcasts were added.

After the war, further language services were added: in [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. At the close of the [[Cold War]], the services in French, Portuguese, and Spanish were gradually phased out and replaced by new services in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. The latter services were withdrawn once [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] had developed their own independent media and joined the [[European Union]].

Radio Sweden also operated a service in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] between 2004 and 2009.

In the 1990s Radio Sweden was merged with SR's Immigrant Languages Department to form the SR International channel. For a while, immigrant language services, such as those in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], were additionally carried on [[shortwave]].

==Programming in other languages==
The Radio Sweden English Service seeks to provide a window on the diverse perspectives and issues in [[Sweden]] today.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Its programs and website offer a ”[[Smörgåsbord#Other use of the term in English|smörgåsbord]]” of news and current affairs, science and technology, lifestyle, and culture.

In the beginning of 2016, the international service underwent a major reorganization. English language news about Sweden for overseas listeners were moved to a 30 minutes-a-week show on P2 and to social media. Minority languages service was further focused on those minorities living in Sweden and integrated with Swedish language services. 

Service in languages of the oppressed nations, such as Somali, were moved to an independent organization. News for overseas listeners in foreign languages other than English, such as Russian and German, has been canceled.&lt;ref&gt;http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6249380&lt;/ref&gt;
There have been several foreign-leagugaes services in the history of Radio Sweden. The German Programm got disfunct after 76 years of service.&lt;ref&gt;https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2108&amp;artikel=6379933 German Service of SR&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former programs==

===''Sweden Calling DXers''===
One of the most popular programs on Radio Sweden was ''[[Sweden Calling DXers]]'', founded in 1948 by [[Arne skoog|Arne Skoog]]. He reasoned that [[shortwave listening]] or [[DXing]] was a very young hobby, and that by providing information in a weekly program for shortwave listeners about their hobby, Radio Sweden was teaching its own audience about how to listen better. While the first program was based solely on Arne's own listening, listeners were encouraged to write in with their own news, and soon virtually all of the program was based on listener's letters (an early example of interactvity).

The program was carried on Tuesdays in all of Radio Sweden's services except Swedish.

When Arne Skoog retired in connection with the program's 30th anniversary in 1978, the program was taken over by [[George Wood (Radio Sweden)|George Wood]], a member of the Radio Sweden English Service. After a number of years, as media changed, it began to cover less about shortwave, and more about satellite radio and television. Later coverage was extended to the Internet, the focus was shifted to concentrating on Swedish media, and the name of the English version of the program was changed to "MediaScan". "MediaScan" was the first English-language radio program in Europe (and the second overall in Europe) to post audio on the Internet (on the ftp sites [[funet|ftp.funet.fi]] and [[SUNET|ftp.sunet.se]], as well as via Internet Multicasting).

In 2001 the program was discontinued, but remains in a somewhat sporadic form on the Radio Sweden website.

===''The Saturday Show''===
Another popular Radio Sweden program was ''[[The Saturday Show (Radio Sweden)|The Saturday Show]]'', with [[Roger Wallis]] and Kim Loughran, which ran from 1967 to 1981. The program was launched to showcase Swedish rock and pop music in a world dominated by American and British rock. Using Radio Sweden's relatively high-powered medium wave transmitter on 1179&amp;nbsp;kHz, the entire program was 90 minutes in length, and featured many satirical sketches, often political and sometimes controversial. A 30-minute segment of the entire broadcast was the Radio Sweden shortwave program on Saturdays.

==End of radio broadcasting==
On October 20, 2010, Radio Sweden ceased broadcasts on shortwave and medium wave, as Swedish Radio's management decided that the Internet had matured enough to support international broadcasts. At the same time the English Service was extended to national broadcasts on FM, but programming on weekends was discontinued. Services in English also continue on satellite, both using Swedish Television's satellite and the [[World Radio Network]].

Based on the list in Dunn, Kawana, Brewer (2000).]]
{{International relations theory sidebar}}
In [[world-systems theory]], the '''semi-periphery countries''' (sometimes referred to as just '''the semi-periphery''') are the [[industrialization|industrializing]], mostly [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[country|countries]] which are positioned between [[periphery countries|the periphery]] and [[core countries]]. Semi-periphery countries have organizational characteristics of both core countries and periphery countries and are often geographically located between core and peripheral regions as well as between two or more competing core regions.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt; Semi-periphery regions play a major role in mediating economic, political, and social activities that link core and peripheral areas.&lt;ref name=chase&gt;Chase-Dunn and Thomas D. Hall.''The Seedbed of Change''.Chapter 5 of C.&lt;/ref&gt;

These regions allow for the possibility of innovative technology, reforms in social and organizational structure, and dominance over peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt; These changes can lead to a semi-periphery country being promoted to a core nation.&lt;ref name="chase"/&gt; Semi-periphery is, however, more than a description, as it also serves as a position within the world hierarchy in which social and economic change can be interpreted.&lt;ref name=terlouw&gt;Terlouw 1992 pg 136-145&lt;/ref&gt;

World-systems theory describes the semi-periphery as a key structural element in the world economy.&lt;ref name=waller&gt;Wallerstein 1976, pp. 229-233&lt;/ref&gt; The semi-periphery plays a vital role comparative to that of the role that Spain and Portugal played in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as intermediate trading groups within the European colonial empire.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt;

Today, the semi-periphery is generally industrialized.&lt;ref name=waller2&gt;Wallerstein 1974 Vol.3, No.4., pp 461-483&lt;/ref&gt; Semi-peripheral countries contribute to the manufacturing and exportation of a variety of goods.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; They are marked by above average land mass, as exemplified by Argentina, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, and [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; More land mass typically means an increased market size and share.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-peripheral nations are not all large though, as smaller countries such as [[Israel]], Poland, and Greece exist within the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

==Sociological theory==
Semi-peripheral countries offer their citizens relatively diverse economic opportunities but also have extreme gaps between the rich and poor. World-system theorists originally used only two categories: [[periphery countries]] and [[core countries]]. A need for an in between category became quickly apparent,&lt;ref name="Chirot"&gt;Chirot. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the establishment of the semi-periphery category for societies that have moved away from the periphery but have not become core. In other words, the category describes societies that remain dependent, and to some extent underdeveloped, despite having achieved significant levels of industrialization.&lt;ref name="Chirot"/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are tied into dynamic world systems that focus on the reliance of poor nations upon the wealthy, a concept known as the [[dependency theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Tausch A.&lt;/ref&gt; The term semi-periphery has been applied to countries that existed as early as in the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu&gt;Janet Abu-Lughod 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the creation of a semi-periphery category has added sociological and historical layers to previous developmental theories—yet it still has similar, inherently capitalist foundations.&lt;ref name="waller" /&gt;

===Function===
[[File:China fuels 1983.jpg|thumb|250px|Energy and mineral resources]]
The semi periphery is needed to stabilize the world system,&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; as it facilitates interaction and provides a connection between the low-income [[periphery countries|peripheral states]] and the high-income [[core countries|core states]] by adding another step in the world system hierarchy.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; As the middle ground, semi-peripheral countries display characteristics of both the [[Core countries|core]] and the [[Periphery countries|periphery]].&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; They also serve as a political buffer zone in that while they are exploited, they are also the exploiters.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; These areas have either been core regions in the past or formerly-peripheral areas that have since advanced in the world economy.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

Semi-peripheral nations are a necessary structural element in a world-trade system,&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; since such nations can serve to alleviate the political pressures that the core can exert upon the periphery and the political unrest that the periphery can direct back at the core.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; On the other hand, the semi-periphery can find itself excluded from the region's politics, as it lies just outside the bounds of political arena of the core states.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt;

The semi-periphery exists because it needs to divide the economic power between the core and the periphery. Semi-periphery, referred to as the middle class by Wallerstein, is what makes the capitalist world function because it is much like the sociological [[structural functionalism]] theory, where norms, customs, traditions, and institutions act as "organs" that work toward the proper functioning of the "body" as a whole. Without these industrializing countries, change will never reach the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Chirot, Daniel, and Thomas D. Hall. 1982. 8:81-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of their contribution to industry and economy, the contemporary semi-peripheral states are semi-industrialized.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are major exporters of minerals and agricultural goods. They are often focused in the manufacturing and exportation of industrial goods and commodities. While these advances separate the semi-periphery from the periphery, they lack the power and the economic dominance of core nations and still have a lot of un-managed poverty, placing them beneath the core.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are important contributors to the world economy because of the above reasons and because they tend to have above average land mass, meaning that they are host to an above average market.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; A primary example is China, a country with not only a large area but with a booming population.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt;

==History and development==

===13th century===
[[File:Silkroutes.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[silk road]] [[trade routes]] across [[Eurasia]]]]This era of human history found the semi-periphery concentrated in the area stretching from the Middle East to China, including India and the [[Mongol Empire]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; This was the first time in history that the peripheries and semi-peripheries of the world became connected and involved in the trade of the world, both with cores and with each other.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Through a lucrative trade system, including heavy taxing of goods traveling through their borders, they were able to maintain a steady stream of wealth, becoming the driving forces of economic change throughout this time period.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;  In addition, a heavy emphasis on defense and border security, particularly among the [[Mongols]], allowed them to be fairly impenetrable [[trade]] obstacles.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; [[Geography]] also played a role, as seen in India's development of an impressive [[maritime industry]].  Because of its position along a convenient route through the Indian Ocean, India established its role as a "hinge" between the [[East]] and [[West]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Through their positions within the world trade system, semi-peripheries in the Middle East became crucially important in connecting the cities of Chinese and Indian cores with the fledgling cities of Europe, as well as serving as key points between other, more major core cities in the region, such as [[Baghdad]], [[Cairo]], and [[Aden]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

===1300–1450===
[[File:Bubonic plague-en.svg|thumb|250px|The Black Death rapidly spread along the major European sea and land trade routes.]]

Following increases in population and commerce in Western Europe in the thirteenth century, the [[feudal system]] met severe economic difficulties in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.&lt;ref name=halsall&gt;Halsall 1997, pp.14-19&lt;/ref&gt; This decline in development was caused by a combination of the decline in agricultural production, the shrinking economy that had already hit its peak within the current feudal structure, and the devastating effects of the [[Black Plague]] epidemic.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; The regression of Western Europe into the semi-periphery and periphery allowed for the rise of the trading powers of Italy, most notably [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; These Italian city-states took advantage of their established trade connections with the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Far East]], the Middle East, and the other Mediterranean powers to maintain their growth despite the economic failures of their European trade partners.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa and Venice had influence beyond their trade channels. Both were instrumental in the [[Crusades]] through their provisions of troops, transport vessels, and naval ships.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa also assisted the [[Byzantine Empire]] when it helped recapture the capital, [[Constantinople]], in the late thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; The Byzantine Empire took advantage of its strategic position along various trade routes and the decline of Western Europe to rise to [[Core countries|core]] status until its fall in 1453.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

During this time period, Genoa and Venice developed forms of [[laissez-faire]] government and institutions that are viewed as precursors to modern [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Despite these advances in influence and entrepreneurship, Genoa and Venice suffered from the crippling effects of the Black Plague, as much of the rest of Europe had before them.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Venice was able to survive due to its connection with the Southern trade route, though her strength was much reduced by the middle of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa never fully recovered from the [[Black Death]] and its defeat at the hands of Venice in the late fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; The decline of Genoa and the shift in Venice's focus to the [[Red Sea]] trade route left the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic open to Portugal and Spain, who were already better positioned geographically to control Atlantic trade routes.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

===1450–1700===
[[File:Spanish Empire Anachronous 0.PNG|thumb|460px|The areas of the world that at one time were territories of the Spanish Empire.]]
  
In a push to ensure stable economic growth, Europe turned to a capitalistic economy in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries to replace the failed feudal system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Modern capitalism allowed for economies to extend beyond geographical and political boundaries, leading to the formation of the first worldwide economic system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; At the base of this world system was an [[international division of labor]] that determined countries' relationships and placement within the categories of the world system: core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The core regions, most notably the countries of Northwestern Europe like England, France, and the [[Netherlands]], gained the most from the world economy.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Their ascension from previous peripheral and semi-peripheral status to the core was driven by the development of strong central government and military power, the combination of which made possible control of international commerce and exploitation of colonial possessions.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

At the other end of the spectrum was the periphery, marked by lack of central government, exportation of raw materials to the core, and exploitive labor practices.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; In this time period, especially toward the end of the 17th century, South America and parts of North America stood out as peripheral zones under the control and capitalistic exploitation of core countries in Europe.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; [[Slaves]] and indigenous workers in these regions developed [[raw materials]] for export to Europe, a distinctive characteristic of the new capitalism, as goods were no longer produced solely for internal consumption.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The [[aristocracy]] of these regions controlled commerce and became wealthy through the new world economy, leading to their rise in power above the government.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Even in periods of upheaval, local aristocrats were able to rely on core European powers to assist in keeping control over the economic system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

In between the core and periphery was the semi-periphery, which constituted both previous core regions that had declined, like Italy, Spain and Portugal, and peripheries that had improved their position, like southern Germany and southern France.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Spain and Portugal had taken advantage of the opening to Atlantic control left by the decline of Italian powers like Genoa and Venice.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Much like the core European powers, Spain and Portugal had strong navies and expansive colonial domains, which they exploited for their natural resources and cheap labor.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Rather than using the increased wealth to develop strong domestic [[manufacturing]] sectors, as other Western European powers did, Spain and Portugal used imported gold and silver to obtain manufactured goods from the core countries, relegating them to semi-periphery instead of core status.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; So, while they had control over several peripheral regions and exploited them, a characteristic of a core region, these countries failed to develop the quality manufacturing industries and the access to international banking that further defined core countries, leaving them a step below in the world system at semi-periphery status.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

===1700–1875===
[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|300px|thumb|As the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged ahead of other economies]]
The development of trade between Europe, the Americas, and the East generated massive profits for a relatively small [[merchant]] elite in the European colonial powers.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; These merchants were able to utilize their profits to take control of [[agriculture]] and other industries.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The merchant class further consolidated its power by extending control over internal markets and the prices of finished goods.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The end result was the development of the necessary capital to [[industrialize]] the European core states.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

This era was defined by the transition from agriculture to [[industrialization]].&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The rapid development of industry triggered several reactions. Many European states explored new territories in addition to their original colonial holdings for new markets to exploit.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The European world system continued to expand and include more regions, as it absorbed the Indian Ocean economic system through the acquisition of colonies by Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, among others.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Previously isolated regions, like much of the American interior zone, joined newly independent South American countries in becoming part of the periphery.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; By the nineteenth century, Asia and Africa had also entered the world system as peripheral regions.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; This development of Africa and Asia as peripheral continents allowed for new cores like the United States and Germany to improve their core status, rising higher within the world system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

Throughout this time period was a constant shift within core regions from a combination of agriculture and industry to solely industrial enterprise.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; In this period, England was the leader in industrial and agricultural production, though by 1900, only ten percent of England's populace worked in agriculture, demonstrating the shift to industry not only in England but across the core stratum.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The dramatic shift to industry extended beyond the core by the end of this time period, as core regions encouraged the development of [[manufacturing]] in peripheral and semi-peripheral zones to further develop those markets and create demand for newly developed machines and other goods.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

===1875–1914===
[[File:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|thumb|A ration party of the Royal Irish Rifles in a communication trench.]] The [[West]] represented both the core and the semi-periphery, as Europe dominated 80% of the world's market share.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"&gt;Hobsbawn, Eric. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the rest of the world was a diverse periphery, though Japan was a notable exception.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; As expansionism continued, new core nations emerged, such as the Britain, Germany, and the United States, while old cores such as Spain and Portugal faded to the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; The growth of the power of the common man led to an expansion of thought concerning democracy, communism, and revolution, which pervaded the weaker semi-peripheral nations overcome with civil distress.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; In some cases, this led to the weakening of the nations, such as the violent revolution in France.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; This contributed to the adoption of totalitarian leaders, as seen in Germany and France.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; The major factors contributing to world war were the conflicts and power struggles taking place between the three classes of nations in the global system.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; Nations considered part of the semi-periphery felt oppressed by the stronger, larger core nations.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt;

===1914–today===

This trend known to continued throughout the century, with Germany, Russia, and Japan also taking seats at the core. At the end of World War II however, Germany quickly fell to the [[semi-periphery]] along with war-ravaged France. As the rest of Europe struggled to rebuild itself, it also fell to the [[semi-periphery]], with the exception of many [[Eastern European]] nations, who fell under the Soviet Union as bloc countries. Japan also fell back into semi-periphery, along with the industrializing China and India, until their recent upswing in influence. Change also came to North America, where [[American imperialism]] led to the rise of countries like [[Guatemala]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. On the other side of the Pacific, Australia was also developing, helping to secure an Allied Victory in World War II.

In today's global hierarchy, some states are transitioning upward while others are moving downward in terms of status and influence. Former colonial powers no longer exercise control over an international domain and are instead mostly relegated to their core; for example, former European world powers do not exert influence over colonial outposts in the [[Americas]], Africa, or Asia, but rather have consolidated their power in the form of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;Shaw, Timothy M.

Outside of these developed countries are countries (see list below) that are considered semi-periphery and are both dominant and dominated within economic, political, and social realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morales Ruvalcaba|first1=Daniel Efrén|title=INSIDE THE BRIC: ANALYSIS OF THE SEMIPERIPHERAL NATURE OF BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA|journal=Austral: Brazilian Journal of Strategy &amp; International Relations|date=11 September 2013|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://seer.ufrgs.br/index.php/austral/article/view/40942/26976|language=es|issn=2238-6912}}&lt;/ref&gt; These middle powers are a combination of nations that have emerged as a result of the fragmentation of the Soviet Union and nations that have risen because of their possession of resources in high demand, like oil in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; While these nations are by no means on the level of the stated world powers, they are able to exert influence over the weaker nations of the impoverished [[Fourth World]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

Other terms used to describe semi-periphery countries include sub-imperial and semi-industrial.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] identifies three ways by which countries can emerge from the periphery into the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Countries with a large market and room for industrial growth, like [[Brazil]], South Africa, and Mexico, and countries with valuable energy resources, like [[Iran]] and Saudi Arabia, can utilize the strategy of seizing the chance.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; The strategy of promotion by invitation can be utilized by countries willing to be open to foreign governmental and regional administrative centers.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Examples of past countries to utilize this strategy are the capitalist regimes in Africa like [[Egypt]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Zaire]], [[Senegal]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; These countries use [[dependency theory|dependent development]] to integrate into the world economy and establish local dominance.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Outside of these strategies is that of self-reliance, a basic theory that as some countries grow, others will decline.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Many countries in Africa and South America have exhibited the qualities of a sub-imperial or semi-industrial power.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

Wallerstein examines the role of semi-periphery countries during a period of economic downturn.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; To redefine core and periphery countries in an economic sense, core countries are characterized by advanced technology, high [[Profit (economics)|profits]], high wages, and diversified production while periphery countries have less technology, low profits, low wages, and less diversified production.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-periphery countries fall in the middle of these spectra, and their unique political and social structure place them in a position where they can best take advantage of economic downturns.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

These economic downturns occur because of increased [[supply (economics)|supply]] and decreased [[demand]], which combine to create a shift in surplus and power to the semi-periphery. Semi-periphery regions take advantage of the situation by expanding control of their home markets and the surrounding periphery countries at the expense of core countries.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; The underlying reason for this shift in power lies in the basic economic principle of [[scarcity]]. As long as core countries maintain scarcities of their goods, they can select customers from semi-periphery and periphery countries that are competing over them. When excess supply occurs, the core countries are the ones competing over a smaller market. This competition allows semi-peripheral nations to select from among core countries rather than vice versa when making decisions about commodity purchases, manufacturing investments, and sales of goods, shifting the balance of power to the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; While in general there is a power shift from core to semi-periphery in times of economic struggles, there are few examples of semi-peripheral countries transitioning to core status.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; To accomplish this, semi-peripheral nations must not only take advantage of weaker core countries but must also exploit any existing advantages over other semi-peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; How well they exploit these advantages determines their arrangement within the semi-periphery class.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

==Effects==
[[File:Election MG 3455.JPG|thumb|A ballot box]]
The semi-peripheral nations of the world have played an important role to world trade and interaction since early periods of globalized trade. This "middle ground" between the very powerful [[Core countries|cores]] and the backwaters of the far [[Periphery countries|periphery]] allowed those two zones to interact with greater ease. For example, during the [[Pax Mongolica|13th-century world system]], the semi-periphery areas around Europe's Mediterranean Coast facilitated trade between the peripheries of the more manufacturing based [[Flanders|Northern Europe]] and the cores of India and China.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; John Markoff, a [[sociology|sociologist]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], also notes that political developments, particularly in the advancement of [[democracy]], originate in the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="Markoff"/&gt; He notes that innovations in democracy came from the semi-periphery rather than the more established, stable [[First World|core nations]], where profit discourages great reform, or the extremely poor [[Third World|periphery]] where instability makes reform too dangerous to attempt.&lt;ref name="Markoff"/&gt; It has been within semi-peripheral nations where democratic reforms like the expansion of suffrage and the institution of the secret ballot have been implemented.&lt;ref name="Markoff"&gt;Markoff, John. 1999-1041:4&lt;/ref&gt;

==On society==
In July 2013, media critic [[Jay Rosen]] defined the Snowden effect as "Direct and indirect gains in public knowledge from the cascade of events and further reporting that followed Edward Snowden's leaks of classified information about the surveillance state in the U.S."&lt;ref name=RosenSnowdenEffect&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jay |title=The Snowden Effect: definition and examples |url=http://pressthink.org/2013/07/the-snowden-effect-definition-and-examples/ |work=Jay Rosen's PressThink |accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, ''[[The Nation]]'' wrote that Snowden had sparked an overdue debate about national security and individual privacy.&lt;ref name=NationSnowdenEffect&gt;{{cite web |last=Alterman |first=Eric |title=What the Press Should Learn From the 'Snowden Effect' |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/177686/what-press-should-learn-snowden-effect# |work=The Nation |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2014 [[World Economic Forum]], Internet experts saw news that [[Microsoft]] would let foreign customers store their personal data on servers outside America as a sign that Snowden's leaks were leading countries and companies to erect borders in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davos |first=L.S. |title=The Snowden effect |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2014/01/internet-governance |work=The Economist |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Forbes]]'', the effect was seen to have nearly united the U.S. Congress in opposition to the massive [[post-9/11]] domestic intelligence gathering system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watson |first=Tom |title=The Snowden Effect Hits Congress: Will Effective Crowdsourced Lobbying Follow? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomwatson/2013/07/18/the-snowden-effect-hits-congress-will-effective-crowdsourced-lobbying-follow/ |work=Forbes |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its Spring 2014 Global Attitudes Survey, the [[Pew Research Center]] found that Snowden's disclosures had tarnished the image of the United States, especially in Europe and Latin America.&lt;ref name=PewJuly2014&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/global-opposition-to-u-s-surveillance-and-drones-but-limited-harm-to-americas-image/ |title=Global Opposition to U.S. Surveillance and Drones, but Limited Harm to America's Image |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the Obama administration appointed [[William Evanina]], a former FBI special agent with a [[counter-terrorism]] specialty, as the new government-wide [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive|National Counterintelligence Executive]]. "Instead of getting carried away with the concept of leakers as heroes," Evanina said in August, "we need to get back to the basics of what it means to be loyal. Undifferentiated, unauthorized leaking is a criminal act." While dealing with insider threats had been an intelligence community priority since WikiLeaks published Chelsea Manning's disclosures in 2010, Evanina said that in the aftermath of Snowden's June 2013 revelations, the process "sped up from a regional railway to the [[Acela Express|Acela]] train." A year later, 100,000 fewer people had security clearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Charles S. |title=Meet the Man Who's Gauging the Damage From Snowden |url=http://www.govexec.com/management/2014/08/meet-man-whos-gauging-damage-snowden/91595/ |work=Government Executive |date=August 15, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James Clapper]] said Snowden's leaks created a [[perfect storm]], degrading the intelligence community's capabilities. Snowden's leaks, said Clapper, damaged relationships with foreign and corporate stakeholders, restrained budget resources, and caused the U.S. to discontinue collecting intelligence on certain targets, putting the United States at greater risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sink |first=Justin |title=Intelligence chief says Snowden leaks created 'perfect storm' |url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/218155-intelligence-chief-says-snowden-leaks-created-perfect-storm |work=The Hill |date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, former Director of the [[National Counterterrorism Center]] [[Matthew G. Olsen]] told [[CNN]] that Snowden's disclosures had made it easier for terrorist groups to evade U.S. surveillance by changing their encryption methods. Olsen said intelligence collection against some individuals of concern had been lost, preventing insight into their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Liptak |first=Kevin |title=Ex-counterterror chief: U.S. lost track of terrorists after Snowden |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/21/politics/olsen-nsa/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=October 21, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2015 [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] had studied Snowden's disclosures and, said U.S. officials, its leaders were using couriers or encrypted communications that Western analysts could not crack.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric P. Schmitt]] and Ben Hubbard (July 20, 2015) [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/world/middleeast/isis-strategies-include-lines-of-succession-and-deadly-ring-tones.html ISIS Leader Takes Steps to Ensure Group's Survival] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, [[National Counterterrorism Center]] director [[Nicholas Rasmussen]] told Congress that Snowden's disclosures had damaged U.S. intelligence capabilities. Rasmussen said the government knew of specific terrorists who, after learning from Snowden's leaks how the U.S. collected intelligence, had increased their security measures by using new types of encryption, changing email addresses, or abandoning prior methods of communicating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aftergood |first=Steven |title=Leaks Damaged U.S. Intelligence, Official Says |url=https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2015/02/leaks-damaged/ |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |date=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the effect of his leaks, Snowden himself wrote in February 2015 that "the biggest change has been in awareness. Before 2013, if you said the NSA was making records of everybody's phonecalls and the [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] was monitoring lawyers and journalists, people raised eyebrows and called you a conspiracy theorist. Those days are over."&lt;ref name=RedditAMA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn/ |title=We are Edward Snowden, Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald from the Oscar-winning documentary CITIZENFOUR |website=Reddit |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that the Snowden effect had hit ''[[The Guardian]]''. Journalist [[Michael Wolff (journalist)|Michael Wolff]], who wrote for ''The Guardian'' for many years, asserted that the recent selection of [[Katharine Viner]] as editor-in-chief "can be read as, in part, a deeply equivocal response on the part of the paper's staff, with its unusual power in the process of selecting a new editor, to the Snowden story." According to Wolff, there had developed "a sense of journalistic queasiness around Snowden, difficult to express at the party-line ''Guardian''. Questioning Snowden's retreat to Russia and his protection by Vladimir Putin was internally verboten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2015/03/20/new-editor-for-guardian-newspaper/25094233/ |title=Snowden effect hits 'Guardian' |work=USA Today |date=March 20, 2015 |accessdate=March 26, 2015 |first=Michael |last=Wolff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology industry==
In the technology industry, the Snowden effect had a profound impact after it was revealed that the NSA was tapping into the information held by some U.S. [[Cloud computing|cloud-based services]]. [[Google]], [[Cisco]], and [[AT&amp;T]] lost business internationally due to the public outcry over their roles in NSA spying. A study by the [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]] published in August 2013 estimated that the cloud-based computing industry could have lost up to $35 billion by 2016.&lt;ref name=HuffPoCisco&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Gerry |title='Snowden Effect' Threatens U.S. Tech Industry's Global Ambitions |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/24/edward-snowden-tech-industry_n_4596162.html |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Wall Street Journal'' named "the Snowden effect" as 2013's top tech story, saying Snowden's leaks "taught businesses that the convenience of the cloud cuts both ways."

After revelations that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile was being tapped, the tech industry rushed to create a secure cell phone.&lt;ref name=BloombergSnowdenEffect&gt;{{cite video |last=Kanji |first=Hussein |title=The Snowden Effect: Impact on the Tech Sector |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/the-snowden-effect-impact-on-the-tech-sector-mzOWYZYQQkumPGgmUxpE6w.html |publisher=[[Bloomberg TV]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105213946/http://www.bloomberg.com/video/the-snowden-effect-impact-on-the-tech-sector-mzOWYZYQQkumPGgmUxpE6w.html|archive-date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[TechRepublic]]'', revelations from the NSA leaks "rocked the IT world" and had a "chilling effect".

Since Snowden's disclosures, Americans used the Internet less for things like email, online shopping and banking, according to an April 2014 poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harris Poll: People Cutting Back Internet Use After Snowden |url=http://www.newsmax.com/US/Snowden-Internet-Harris-poll/2014/04/04/id/563768/ |accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Post Snowden, Some Internet Usage Is Contracting, Study Finds |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/04/03/post-snowden-some-internet-usage-is-contracting-study-finds/ |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in April 2014, former NSA deputy director Col. Cedric Leighton told the Bloomberg Enterprise Technology Summit in New York City that Snowden's leaks had performed a significant disservice to the worldwide health of the Internet by leading Brazil and other countries to reconsider the Internet's decentralized nature. Leighton suggested that nation states' efforts to create their own versions of the Internet were the beginning of the end for the Internet as we know it. "When you have a situation where all of a sudden, everyone goes into 'tribal' mode—a German cloud, a Swiss cloud, or any other separate Internet—they are significant nationalistic attempts," said Leighton. "What happened with Snowden, it's more of an excuse than a policy, it's more of an excuse to re-nationalize the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Former NSA deputy director: Snowden leaks caused 'significant disservice' to the Internet |url=http://www.zdnet.com/former-nsa-deputy-director-snowden-leaks-caused-significant-disservice-to-the-Internet-7000028746/ |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |work=ZDNet |date=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that economic fallout from Snowden's leaks had been a boon for foreign companies, to the detriment of U.S. firms. Daniel Castro, a senior analyst at the [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]], predicted that the United States cloud computing industry could lose $35 billion by 2016. Matthias Kunisch, a German software executive who switched from U.S. cloud computing providers to [[Deutsche Telekom]], said that due to Snowden his customers thought American companies had connections to the NSA. Security analysts estimated that U.S. tech companies had since Snowden collectively spent millions and possibly billions of dollars adding state-of-the-art encryption features to consumer services and to the cables that link data centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/22/business/fallout-from-snowden-hurting-bottom-line-of-tech-companies.html |title=Revelations of N.S.A. Spying Cost U.S. Tech Companies |date=March 21, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Claire Cain |last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the nonpartisan [[New America Foundation]] summarized the impact of Snowden's revelations on U.S. businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oti.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Surveillance_Costs_Short%20Version.pdf |title=Surveillance Costs: The NSA's Impact on the Economy, Internet Freedom &amp; Cybersecurity |website=newamerica.net |date=Summer 2014 |accessdate=September 30, 2014 |publisher=[[New America Foundation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912153658/http://oti.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Surveillance_Costs_Short%20Version.pdf |archivedate=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The erosion of trust, said the report, has had serious consequences for U.S. tech firms. [[Information technology|IT]] executives in France, Hong Kong, Germany, the UK, and the U.S. confirmed that Snowden's leaks directly impacted how companies around the world think about information and communication technologies, particularly cloud computing. A quarter of British and Canadian multinational companies surveyed were moving their data outside the U.S. Among U.S. companies attributing drops in revenue to, in part, fallout from Snowden's leaks were [[Cisco Systems]], [[Qualcomm]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Proposed laws in more than a dozen foreign countries, including Germany, Brazil, and India, would make it harder for U.S. firms to do business there. The European Union is considering stricter domestic privacy legislation that could result in fines and penalties costing U.S. firms billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/30/new-report-snowden-revelations-hurt-u-s-companies/ |title=New Report: Snowden Revelations Hurt U.S. Companies |date=July 30, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Elizabeth |last=Dwoskin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, [[Massachusetts]]-based [[web intelligence]] firm [[Recorded Future]] announced it had found a direct connection between Snowden's leaks and dramatic changes in how Islamist terrorists interacted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.recordedfuture.com/al-qaeda-encryption-technology-part-2/|title=How Al-Qaeda Uses Encryption Post-Snowden (Part 2)|date=August 1, 2014|website=Recorded Future|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPRchanged&gt;{{cite web |last=Temple-Raston |first=Dina |title=Big Data Firm Says It Can Link Snowden Data To Changed Terrorist Behavior |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/08/01/336958020/big-data-firm-says-it-can-link-snowden-data-to-changed-terrorist-behavior |publisher=NPR |date=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2010, the privately held Recorded Future received an investment from [[In-Q-Tel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IQT Portfolio |url=https://www.iqt.org/iqt_portfolio/recorded-future/ |publisher=In-Q-Tel |accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit [[venture capital]] firm whose primary partner is the [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About IQT |url=https://www.iqt.org/about-iqt/#partners |publisher=In-Q-Tel |accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Just months after Snowden's 2013 leaks, said Recorded Future, operatives of [[al-Qaeda]] and associated groups completely overhauled their 7-year-old encryption methods, which included "homebrewed" algorithms, adopting instead more sophisticated [[open-source software]] and newly available downloads that enabled encryption on [[Mobile phone|cellphones]], [[Android (operating system)|Android products]], and [[Macintosh|Macs]], to help disguise their communications.&lt;ref name=NPRchanged /&gt;

In September 2014, [[Seattle]]-based [[Deep Web (search indexing)|Deep Web]] and [[Dark web]] monitoring firm Flashpoint Global Partners published a report that found "very little open source information available via [[Jihadism|jihadi]] online [[social media]]" indicating that Snowden's leaks impelled al-Qaeda to develop more secure digital communications. "The underlying public encryption methods employed by online jihadists," the report concluded, "do not appear to have significantly changed since the emergence of Edward Snowden. Major recent technological advancements have focused primarily on expanding the use of encryption to instant messenger and mobile communications mediums."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Measuring the Impact of the Snowden Leaks on the Use of Encryption by Online Jihadists |url=https://fpjintel.com/public-reports/measuring-the-impact-of-the-snowden-leaks-on-the-use-of-encryption-by-online-jihadists/ |publisher=Flashpoint Partners |date=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, ''[[The Nation]]'' reported, "The fallout from the Edward Snowden fiasco wasn't just political—it was largely economic. Soon after the extent of the NSA's data collection became public, overseas customers (including the Brazilian government) started abandoning U.S.-based tech companies in droves over privacy concerns. The dust hasn't settled yet, but tech-research firm [[Forrester Research|Forrester]] estimated the losses may total 'as high as $180 billion,' or 25 percent of industry revenue."&lt;ref name=Capello01a&gt;{{cite web |last=Cappello |first=Lawrence |title=Privacy and the Profit Motive |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/205953/privacy-and-profit-motive |work=The Nation |date=May 4, 2015 |accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer products==
In September 2014, ''The New York Times'' credited [[Apple Inc.|Apple Inc.'s]] update of [[iOS 8]], which encrypts all data inside it, as demonstrating how Snowden's impact had begun to work its way into consumer products. His revelations, said ''The Times'', "not only killed recent efforts to expand the law, but also made nations around the world suspicious that every piece of American hardware and software—from phones to servers made by [[Cisco Systems]]—have 'back doors' for American intelligence and law enforcement." ''The Times'' situated this development within a "Post Snowden Era" in which Apple would no longer comply with NSA and law enforcement requests for user data, instead maintaining that Apple doesn't possess the key to unlock data on the [[iPhone]]. However, since the new security protects information stored on the device itself, but not data stored on Apple's [[iCloud]] service, Apple will still be able to obtain some customer information stored on iCloud in response to government requests. ''The Times'' added that [[Google|Google's]] [[Android (operating system)|Android]] would have encryption enabled by default in upcoming versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sanger |first1=David E. |last2=Chen |first2=Brian X. |title=Signaling Post-Snowden Era, New iPhone Locks Out N.S.A. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/technology/iphone-locks-out-the-nsa-signaling-a-post-snowden-era-.html |work=The New York Times |date=September 26, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''social forum''' is an open meeting place for [[civil society|civil society organizations]] and individuals opposed to [[neoliberalism]] and what its participants regard as the domination of the world by [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2|title=Charter of Principles|publisher=Fórum Social Mundial|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2ZvbQY?url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2|archivedate=2010-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first social forum was the [[World Social Forum]] (WSF) held in January 2001 in [[Porto Alegre]]. It was designed as a counter forum to the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) held in [[Davos]] at the same time. While the WSF regards the WEF as a meeting of the political and economic elite of the world, the WSF gathers social forces and aims to promotes [[democratization]] and [[social justice]].

After the first WSF, the social forum idea was replicated across the world in various transnational, national, and local social forums. Most, though not all, social forums adhere to the WSF Charter of Principles,&lt;ref name=charter/&gt; drawn up by the International Council of the WSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=3_2&amp;cd_language=2|title=Who organizes it|publisher=Fórum Social Mundial|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006125543/http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=3_2&amp;cd_language=2|archivedate=2010-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of participants in the social forums has reflected the diversity of the [[Global Justice Movement]] (or [[Anti-Globalization Movement]]).

[[File:Banksy, Hewlett Road, Cheltenham (1) (geograph 3944289) (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Spy Booth'' in 2014]]
'''''Spy Booth''''' was an artwork by [[Banksy]] in [[Cheltenham]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=BBCJun14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-28032154|title=Fears Banksy Cheltenham 'spies' artwork will be removed|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=26 June 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece has been seen as a critique of the [[global surveillance disclosures]] of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Morris|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/10/banksy-creator-spy-booth-wall-art-gchq|title=Banksy confirms he is creator of Spy Booth wall art near GCHQ |publisher=The Guardian|date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Robin Barton and [[Bankrobber London]] helped with the preservation of the artwork,&lt;ref name=BBCJun29_6_14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-28078938 |title=Cheltenham Banksy: Deal to save it 'close to agreement'|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=29 June 2014|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to broker the removal and sale of the piece.

'''Global communication''' is the term used to describe ways to connect, share, relate and mobilize across geographic, political, economic, social and cultural divides. It redefines soft and hard power as well as information power and diplomacy in ways not considered by traditional theories of [[International relations theory|international relations]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Global Communication implies a transfer of knowledge and ideas from centers of power to peripheries and the imposition of a new intercultural hegemony by means of the "[[soft power]]" of global news and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tehranian|first1=Maijd|title=Global Communication and international relations: changing paradigms and policies|journal=The International Journal of Peace Studies|url=http://www.gmu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''study of global communication''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies the continuous flows of information used in transferring values, opinions, knowledge, culture across boundaries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=="International" Or "Global"==
With the end of the twentieth century and the turn of a new millennium, the global arena and the field of international communication were undergoing significant changes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some authors started to use the term global communication because it goes beyond the bounds of individual states and emphasizes communication between and among peoples across borders and, importantly, the rise of transnational media corporations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[International communication]] traditionally refers to communication between and among nation-states and connotes issues of national sovereignty, control of national information resources, and the supremacy of national governments.

Nevertheless, earlier International communication theories have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The old theories only explain part of the global picture and the theories of modernization, dependency, and cultural imperialism have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The term "global", implies a declining role of the state and state sovereignty. As a term, "international" has within it notions of bilateral or multilateral decisions. "Global" could be seen as an aspiration, also as a fear, of the weakening of the state. In addition, global may imply something more pervasive, more geographically inclusive than international. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==

The study of global communication increased dramatically after World War II due to military considerations coupled with their economic and political implications. Earlier attempts at theorizing have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

More global communication research was written in the decade from 1945–1955; most of the research of the 1950s dealt with propaganda and the cold war. By 1970, global communication research had grown to include a great variety of subjects, especially comparative mass communication systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |edition=1st |title=The Handbook of Comparative Communication Research |url= |publisher=Routledge |date=2012-03-21 |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-415-80275-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; communication and national development and propaganda and public opinion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frederick |first1=Howard H. |title=Global communication and international relations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RBsQAQAAMAAJ|isbn=9780534193447 |date=1993-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of global communication scholars, previous theories of [[Modernization theory|modernization]], dependency, and [[cultural imperialism]] have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication. The old theories only explain part of the global picture.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mcphail |first1=Thomas L. |title=Global Communication Theories, stakeholders, and Trends |date=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Communication.html?id=MAco-KZGZNIC|isbn=9781444358100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological development===
The emergence of global communication technologies may be considered the origin of the field of global communication in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Numerous technical advances such as the creation of a new major global communication phenomenon, [[Telecommunication convergence|convergence]], digital environments and the internet are some of the major engines driving the change from [[international communication]] to global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Global power shifts===
With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union's collapse|Soviet Union]], the shadow of [[Cold War]] has lifted to reveal shifting political, economic, and cultural alliances and conflicts. The increasing importance of these currents, especially in the cultural sphere, demands a reconsideration of the nature of the international communication field within the rubric of international relations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Communication in Transition: The End of Diversity?|url = https://www.amazon.com/Global-Communication-Transition-Diversity-Values-ebook/dp/B00YFRD9G6/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450650195&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=global+communication+in+transition|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc|date = 1996-02-05|first = Hamid|last = Mowlana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News agencies and propaganda===
Three key players are usually recognized as the founders of the international [[News agency|news agencies]]. In 1835, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] created the world's first news agency; In 1849, [[Bernhard Wolff]] started publishing stock market news and daily reports from Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt; In 1849, [[Paul Reuter|Paul Julius Freiherr von Reuter]] established his own commercial service, the [[Reuters|Reuter]] agency, and organized a worldwide exchange of news in 1870.

In 1859, Reuter, [[Havas]] and the German [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau|Wolff]] agency reached an agreement to exchange news from all over the world, which was known as the League of Allied Agencies, or the " Ring Combination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "The Ring Combination": Information, Power, and the World News Agency Cartel|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YDVlAAAAMAAJ|publisher = University of Chicago, Department of History|date = 1999-01-01|first = Alexander Scott|last = Nalbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[Associated Press|American News Agency Associated Press]] was founded and was formally admitted into the "Ring Combination" in 1887.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are some major factors that point to the growing importance of global communication in the world of the twenty-first century:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# world population explosion

# from [[geopolitics]] to [[Gaia philosophy|gaiapolitics]]

# increased [[cross-cultural communication]]
# changing concept of community
# greater [[Centralisation|centralization of control]]
# information explosion
# changes in technologies
# greater dependence on global communication
# greater [[interdependence]] and democracy
# impact of communication on peace and war

== Theoretical approaches and perspectives ==

=== Transcultural political economy ===

Transcultural Political Economy is a concept that is presented in Global Communications by Paula Chakravartty and Yeuzhi Zhao. This concept looks at global communications and media studies in three major areas: global flows of information and culture, decentralizing the conceptual parameters of global information and media studies, and the normative debates in global communications in the context of neoliberalism. Transcultural Political Economy is a multidisciplinary study that focuses on the tensions between political economy and cultural studies. It "integrate[s] institutional and cultural analyzes and address urgent questions in global communications in the context of economic integration, empire formation, and the tensions associated with adapting new privatized technologies, neoliberalized and globalized institutional structures, and hybrid cultural forms and practices". Transcultural Political Economy addresses the issues surrounding the practice of neoliberalism and its creation of unequal power structures within the world system. 
&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty, P. &amp; Zhao, Y. (2008). Global Communications: toward a transcultural political economy. Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Globalization theory ===
{{See also|Globalization}}

Globalization theory was popularized in the 1990s as a model for understanding global communication. The concept of [[globalization]] inspired a number of theories from various schools of thought in communication studies that each emphasize different aspects of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization, development and the mass media |last=Sparks |first=Colin |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7619-6161-1 |location=Thousand Oaks, California |pages=126–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many globalization theories highlight actors in the business sector as leaders in the processes of global integration. Transnationalizing business is often celebrated as progression toward a more interconnected world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Globalization theories are often associated with theories of modernity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some scholars view globalization as the social, political, economic, and cultural integration of societies into a capitalist system; Others see globalization as a successor to modernity, while some see it as an iteration of imperialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some question the usefulness and legitimacy of globalization theory, arguing that it does not adequately conceptualize current international relations or function as a lens through which to examine everyday events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Globalization Theory: A Post Mortem |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/pal/ip/2005/00000042/00000001/art00002 |journal=International Politics |date=2005-03-01 |pages=2–74 |volume=42 |issue=1 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800098 |first=Justin |last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars criticize globalization theories as overzealous toward and unrealistic about the extent of global integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why the World Isn't Flat in International Politics: Enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last=Ghemawat |first=Pankaj |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-205-77876-8 |location=United States |pages=322–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars criticize social theorists for offering opinions and predictions based on theory with little practical evidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, some scholars work to dispute the pessimistic views of globalization theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Art |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Jervis |editor2-first=Robert |title=International politics: enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last1=Micklethwait |first1=John |last2=Woolridge |first2=Adrian |chapter=Why the Globalization Backlash is Stupid in International Politics |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn= |location=United States |pages=348–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World systems theory ===
World-system theory is a macro-sociological perspective that seeks to explain the dynamics of the "capitalist world economy" as a "total social system". A world-system is what Wallerstein terms a "world-economy", integrated through the market rather than a political centre, in which two or more regions are interdependent with respect to necessities like food, fuel, and two or more polities compete for domination without the emergence of one single centre forever.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfrank, Walter L. (2000). "Paradigm Regained? The Rules of Wallerstein's World-System Method. Journal of World-Systems Research. Vol. 6. N. 2 pp. 150-195&lt;/ref&gt; World-system theory was first articulated by Immanuel Wallerstein. There are three major sources of the world-system theory which conceived by Wallerstein: the Annales school's general methodology, Marx's focus on accumulation process and competitive class struggles and so on, and dependence theory's neo-Marxist explanation of development processes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y The dictionary of anthropology, Wiley-Blackwell]'', {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the transnational division of labor, world-system divides the world into core countries, peripheral countries, semi-peripheral countries and external areas. The core countries usually developed a strong central governments, extensive bureaucracies and large mercenary armies, which permit the local bourgeoisie to obtain control over international commerce and extract capital surpluses from the trade for benefits.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Paul Halsall(1997) [https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Wallerstein.asp Modern History Sourcebook: ''Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral countries often lack strong central governments or been controlled by core countries, they export raw materials and rely on coercive labor practices.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Semi-peripheries which served as buffers between the core and the peripheries. They retain limited but declining access to international banking and the production of high-cost high-quality manufactured goods.[3] External areas such as Russia maintain their own economic systems, they want to remain outside the modern world economy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Modernisation theory ===

The theory of modernization was developed by Daniel Lerner (1958) in the "Passing of traditional society." Lerner's description of "modernised" is an individual having the ability to be empathetic and being able to see oneself in another person's situation. This concept has come from the transition of traditional societies to modern societies, where modern societies is distinctively industrial, urban, literate, and participant. This theory looks at development in a linear fashion, concluding that nations need to develop into a modern society to make it a sustainable and flourishing nation. Developing modernized societies include technological advancement, and developing media sectors to help create a participatory culture. 
&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, D. (1958). The passing of traditional society: Modernising the Middle East. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-colonialism ===
''See also:'' [[Post-structuralism]], [[imperialism]], [[modernity]],

Post-colonialism is a theoretical approach to looking at literature that examines the colonizer-colonized experience. It deals with the adaptation of formerly colonized nations and their development in cultural, political, economical aspects. Some Notable theoreticians include: [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Edward Said]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], [[R Siva Kumar]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[Derek Gregory]].

=== Cultural imperialism ===
Cultural imperialism is a mighty civilization exerts culture influence over another. Less economically prominent cultures often import culture from Western countries, which have the economic means to produce a majority of the world's cultural media, mostly via the global transmission of media.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ketchum, [http://classroom.synonym.com/meaning-cultural-imperialism-7841.html What Is the Meaning of Cultural Imperialism?]&lt;/ref&gt; The weak civilization adopts the mighty civilization's customs, philosophies, worldviews and general ways of life. The theoretical foundations of the academic study of cultural imperialism mostly come from Michel Foucault's concept of biopower, governmentality and Edward Saïd's concept of Post-colonialism, which theories see cultural imperialism as the cultural legacy of colonialism or forms of Western hegemony. Media effect study which integrated with political-economy traditional is the core argument of cultural imperialism. There are two opposite effects of media study. The negative one is that Western media imposes socio-political conflicts to the developing country and the latter one's resistance to the media effects to preserve their traditional cultural identities.&lt;ref&gt;G. K., &amp; Tan. A.S. (1987), ''American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects are the issues of the process of civilization such as women's right or racial equality with exposing to Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J. G., &amp; Morgan, M. (1988). ''Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; Now the term of cultural imperialism usually refers to America's global culture expansion to the rest of world, which include brand name products, video media, fast food and so on.

=== Communication for development (C4D) ===
[[Communication for Development|Communication for Development (C4D)]] is a [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] oriented aspect of global communication studies that approaches [[Global Development|global development]] with a focus on action and participation for social change enacted through communication systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Evaluating Communication for Development: A Framework for Social Change|last = Lennie &amp; Tacchi|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D underlines "voice, citizenship and collective action" as central values that promote citizen-led development where the visiting party provides guidance rather than direction within the host community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speaking up and talking back?: Media empowerment and civic engagement among east and southern African youth|last = Tufte, Wildermuth, Hansen-Skovmoes, &amp; Mitullah|first = |publisher = [UNESCO] International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media, Nordicom.|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Göteborg, Sweden|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D often incorporates bottom-up theories of social change with the aim to create sustainable change which is believed to be more likely to occur if the efforts are planned, implemented, and sustained by community members themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some development workers and academics suggest that a shared definition of communication for development should be clarified, because disagreement within the field can detract from the characteristics that most scholars view as central to current development, including [[participatory action research]] (PAR).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many C4D projects revolve around media systems as a central site for social change,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which differentiates C4D from other approaches to development. Theories behind C4D highlight that development projects should be contextually situated and that communication technology will affect different types of social change accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Global media studies ===
Global media studies is a field of media study in a global scope. Media study deals with the content, history and effects of media. Media study often draws on theories and methods from the disciplines of cultural studies, rhetoric, philosophy, communication studies, feminist theory, political economy and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan, Daniel and Katz, Elihu (1992). ''Media Events''. London, England: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-55956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these study approaches, political economic analysis is non-ignorable in understanding the current media and communication developments. But the political economic research has become more resilient because of stronger empirical studies, and the potential connections to policy-making and alternative praxis.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Wasko (2009). Global Media Studies. Television &amp; New Media. Volume 10 Number 1 January 2009 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country has its own distinct media ecosystem. The media of mainland China is state-run, so the political subjects are under the strict regulations set by the government while other areas such as sports, finance, and increasingly lucrative entertainment industry face less regulation from government.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cfr.org/about/ Council on Foreign Relations.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has a well-developed media sector, but the mass media is threatened by the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism which hinder the form of Canada's media identity.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, John A. (1969). ''Mass Media in Canada''. The Ryerson Press. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the media in America are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenues from advertisings, subscriptions and the sale of copyrighted materials. Currently, six corporations (Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom and CBS Corporation) have controlled roughly 90% of the America media.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Lutz (2012) ''[http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6 These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America.]'' Business Insider. 14 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Such successes come from the policies of the federal government or the tendency to natural monopolies in the industry.

== Central debates ==

=== Global power shifts ===

[[Frog#Locomotion|Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s world system theory develops a basic framework to understand global power shifts in the rise of the modern world. Wallerstein proposes four different categories: '''core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external''', in terms of different region's relative position in the world system. The core regions are the ones that benefited the most from the capitalist world economy, such as England and France. The peripheral areas relied on and exported raw materials to the core, such as Eastern Europe and Latin America. The semi-peripheries are either core regions in decline or peripheries attempting to improve their relative position in the world system, such as Portugal and Spain. The external areas managed to remain outside the modern world economy, such as Russia.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/wallerstein_summary.php/ Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic types of global power shifts in the 21st century. One is traditional power transition amongst states, which follows Wallerstein's world system theory. For instance, the global power shifts from the West to the East since the rise of Asia. The other is power diffusion, the way that power move from states to non-states actors. For instance, "climate change, drug trade, financial flows, pandemics, all these things that cross borders outsider the control of governments."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/joseph_nye_on_global_power_shifts/transcript?language=en#t-832180/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global public sphere ===
[[Public sphere]] theory, attributed to [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]], is a theory that in its basic premise conceives of [[democratic governments]] as those that can stand criticism that comes from public spheres. [[Public sphere]]s are places, physical or imagined, where people discuss any kind of topic, particularly topics of a societal or political nature. Global public sphere is, therefore, a public that is made of people from across the globe, who come together to discuss and act on issues that concern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of global public sphere is linked to the shift of public sphere, from restricted to nation-state, to made of individuals and groups connected across as well as within borders.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Plato, it can be argued that philosophers have been thinking about versions of a common space for all people to debate in; however, a global public sphere that can fit the description above began to appear much later. In the second half of the 20th century, the legacy of World War II and technological advancements created a new sense of the global and started the economic and political phenomena that we now call [[globalization]]. This includes the expansion of humankind into space, which gave individuals the sense of a global unity, the growth of satellite technology, which allowed for people across the globe to view the same television channels, and the internet, which can provide access to an unprecedented amount of information and spaces to connect with other people.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Cultural industries ===
The term "[[culture industry]]" appeared in the [[post-war period]]. At that time, culture and industry were argued to be opposites.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditctab20103_en.pdf|title = Creative Economy 2010 Report|date = 2010|publisher = UNCTAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural industry|Cultural industries]]" are also referred to as the "[[Creative industries]].

==== Definitions and scope of cultural industries ====

In the present day, there remain different interpretations of culture as an industry. For some, cultural industries are simply those industries that produce cultural goods and services.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the cultural industries are regarded as those industries that "combine the creation, production and commercialization of contents which are intangible and cultural in nature. These contents are typically protected by copyright and they can take the form of goods or services". According to [[UNESCO]], an essential part of cultural industries is that they are "central in promoting and maintaining cultural diversity and in ensuring democratic access to culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity |title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cultural industries" combines the cultural and economic, which gives the cultural industries a distinctive profile.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In France, the "cultural industries" have recently been defined as a set of economic activities that combine the functions of conception, creation and production of culture with more industrial functions in the large-scale manufacture and commercialization cultural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Politiques-ministerielles/Etudes-et-statistiques|title = de la prospective et des statistiques|last = |first = |date = 2006|journal = Département des études|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, economic activities involved in the preservation of heritage are also included in the definition of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/87-542-x/2011001/section/s3-eng.htm|title=Defining culture|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global cultural industries ====
Since the rise of the cultural industries has occurred simultaneously with [[economic globalization]], cultural industries have close connections with globalization and global communication.

[[Herbert Schiller]] argued that the 'entertainment, communications and information (ECI) complex were having a direct impact on culture and human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Culture Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science Press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Herbert Schiller|Schiller]] argued, the result of transnational corporate expansion is the perpetuation of [[cultural imperialism]], defined as "the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Cultural Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of transnational corporate expansion, which began in the 1970s with the emergence of [[Free trade zone|Export Processing Zones]] in developing countries, is focused on the development of [[global production networks]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Creative Industries|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Polity Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7456-4839-2|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=19–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was described as a "new international division of labour" (NIDL) by the German political economists Frӧbel et al. (1980).

Ernst and Kim have argued that GPNs are changing the nature of the multinational corporation itself, from "stand alone overseas investment projects, to "global network [[flagship]]s" that integrate their dispersed supply, knowledge and customer bases into global and regional production networks", entailing a shift from top-down hierarchical models of corporate control to increasingly networked and collective forms of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Production Networks, Knowledge Diffusion, and Local Capacity Formation|last = Ernst |first=D. |last2=Kim |first2=L. |date = 2002|journal = Research Policy |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global media empires ====
The largest firms in media and media-related industries have a very high international profile.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Global media empires such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[News Corporation]], [[Time Warner|Time-Warner]] and [[Viacom]]-[[CBS]] now derive 25-45 per cent of their revenues outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding Global Media|last = Flew.T|first = |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Basingstoke, UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often argued that the global media are dominated by a small number of powerful media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Herman and McChesney (1997) argued that the global media were "dominated by three or four dozen large [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporations]] (TNCs) with fewer than ten mostly US-based media conglomerates towering over the global market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Global Media: The New Missionaries of Global Capitalism|last = Herman,E.S &amp; McChesney, R.W|first = |publisher = Cassell|year = 1997|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Manfred Steger]] has observed that " to a very large extent, the global cultural flows of our time are generated and directed by global media empires that rely on powerful communication technologies to spread their message."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last = Steger.M|first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that during the last two decades, a few very large TNCs would come to dominate the global market for entertainment, news, television, and film.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Diaspora ===
[[Diaspora]] is often confused with [[wikt:exodus|exodus]]. Diasporas are minority groups that have a sense of connection with a larger community outside of the borders they currently inhabit, and through diasporic media create a sense of a larger identity and community, whether imagined or real.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In scholarly work about diaspora in communication studies, the view of nation and culture as interchangeable terms is no longer prevalent. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] theorized of hybridity, which he distinguished from "old style pluralism", "nomadic voyaging of the postmodern", and "global homogenization". Hybridity is the retention of an original identity and strong ties to an original country and tradition, but with the understanding that there is no unchanged, ideal nation of the past that they can return to. To be hybrid is to also adapt to a new culture and tradition without simply assimilating in it, but rather negotiating a place between the "original" and "new" cultures.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In Communication studies, diaspora is discussed as the identity that unifies people across time and space, sometimes existing in physical spaces and other times existing in imagined 'non-spaces'. However, it has been argued that the concept of 'diaspora' implies ethnic homogeneity and essentializes identity to only ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; One of the most cited and well-known works in the field of diasporic media is [[Hamid Naficy]]'s work on exiled Iranian Americans' creation of cable television in the United States.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Diasporic media refer to media that address the needs of particular ethnic, religious, and/or linguistic groups that live in multicultural settings {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . Diasporic media can be in the diaspora's traditional language or in another language, and they can include news or media from the "origin" country or they can contain the diaspora's local news or media. Diasporic media can be created in radio, television, film, music, in newspapers, magazines, and other publishing, as well as online. It can be argued that the development and spread of satellite television is an instrumental element of the growth of diasporic media today. Satellite television allowed migrants to access the news and popular culture from their homeland, as well as allowing people who speak the same language to access the same channels that might be produced outside of the "homeland"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diasporic Media Across Europe: Multicultural Societies and the Universalism–Particularism Continuum|journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|pages = 481–498|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/13691830500058794|first = Myria|last = Georgiou|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary studies of diaspora show that diasporic media are part of the change in the tendency Immanuel Wallerstein described in his world systems theory. The world systems theory postulates that much of the flow of people in the world has been from the 'periphery', or economically-developing states, towards the centre; which are often metropolitan, economically-wealthy states that grew their wealth in colonialist entrepreneurship. However, contrary to the movement of people, the flow of information (including media products), has tended to be from the centre to the periphery.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Go with the Flow: Diasporas and Media|last = Sinclair|first = John|date = February 2000|journal = Television &amp; New Media|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Cunningham|first2 = Stuart|issue = 1:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology and media ===
The advancement of media and technology have played the pivotal role in process of [[globalization]] and global communication.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding the media|last = Devereux|first = Eoin|publisher = SAGE|year = 2007|isbn = 9781412929912|location = London, Los Angeles|pages = 28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cable television]], [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], [[digitalization]], direct broadcast [[satellite]]s as well as the [[Internet]] have created a situation where vast amounts of information can be transferred around the globe in a matter of seconds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

During the early 20th century, [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephony]], and [[radio]] started the process of global communication.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Media, Historic Development of|last = Monroe|first = E. Price|date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications, Volume 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As media technologies developed intensely, they were thought to create, in Marshall McLuhan’ s famous words, a ‘‘global village.’’&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], the world’ s first [[artificial satellite]], on October 4, 1957, marked the beginning of technologies that would further interconnect the world.  The first live global television broadcast occurred when [[Neil Armstrong]] stepped onto the moon in July 1969.  In November 1972, pay TV caused expansion of cable when [[Service Electric]] offered Home Box Office over its cable system. By 2000, over direct broadcast satellite, a household could receive channels from all over the world. Now with the [[World Wide Web]], [[Smartphone|smart phones]], [[Tablet computer|tablet devices]], smart televisions and other digital media devices, billions of people are now able to access media content that was once tied to particular communications media ([[Input/output|print]], broadcast) or platforms ([[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], [[Film|cinema]]).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Justice ===
Justice in communication studies includes, but is not limited to, the concern with democratic process and fostering democratic publics  {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]] theorized of [[public sphere]] (in ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'') as the space that is created whenever matters of common concern are discussed between the state and civil society. Thus, public sphere includes not only the media, but also public protest in the form of marches, demonstrations, et cetera. There are, however, critiques of political economy in whose view it is impossible to work within the current system to produce democratic publics. Such a critique is that produced by [[Karl Marx]], who saw institutions such as parliament, the state, the 'acceptable' public sphere, economic enterprises, and so on as structurally produced and perpetuated by a capitalist system, and thus they can not be mobilized to change it. In such a system, there can only be illusory justice, which is fair only within the logic of the system. This illusion of justice is produced through dominating [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Justice and Communication: Mill, Marx, and Habermas|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|journal = Social Justice Research|date = 2009-02-19|issn = 0885-7466|pages = 134–155|volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|language = en|first = Martin|last = Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue of justice in communication studies is the question of decolonizing research methods and theoretical discourse {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . The idea of decolonizing research comes from a rejection of the functionalist approach, which assumed that research can be conducted in a vacuum, free of ideology or the researcher's biases. This approach assumed cultures to be unchanging, homogenous, and isolated from each other. The purpose of decolonizing research and discourse is to 'uncloak' research as an unbiased power structure, and produce research that is more self-aware. The approach in decolonizing research methods attempts to create methodologies that treat the people in the study as participants or partners, rather than subjects - which is a term that in itself carries strong connotations of colonialism. Decolonizing research also involves moving away from Eurocentric models that are assumed to work anywhere else, and instead to create work that is more useful in local contexts. Decolonial approaches specifically seek to produce knowledge about the mechanisms and effects of colonialism. These approaches allow former subjects to 'talk back', which is a reflection of independent agency, on the colonizer's own terms of research, rather than to be 'given' a voice, which is an unequal power structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decolonial Methodologies: Social Justice Perspectives in Intercultural Technical Communication Research|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2190/TW.44.3.e|journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication|pages = 297–327|volume = 44|issue = 3|doi = 10.2190/tw.44.3.e|first = Godwin Y.|last = Agboka|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Day We Fight Back''' was a one-day global protest against [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|mass surveillance]] by the US [[National Security Agency]] (NSA),&lt;ref name="PCWorld"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2086880/advocacy-groups-plan-day-of-protest-against-nsa-surveillance.html |title=Advocacy groups plan day of protest against NSA surveillance |work=[[PC World]] |first=Grant |last=Gross |date=January 10, 2014 |accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MintPress News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mintpressnews.com/activists-announce-day-to-fight-back-against-nsa/176890/ |title=Activists Announce Day To 'Fight Back' Against NSA |publisher=MintPress News |first=Katie |last=Rucke |date=January 14, 2014 |accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="International Business Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/reddit-mozilla-others-protest-nsa-spying-honor-aaron-swartz-day-we-fight-back-1538148 |title=Reddit, Mozilla And Others To Protest NSA Spying, Honor Aaron Swartz On 'The Day We Fight Back' |work=[[International Business Times]] |first=Eric |last=Brown |date=January 14, 2014 |accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We want new laws that curtail online surveillance. Today we fight back."&lt;ref name=Hill /&gt; Organizers hoped lawmakers would be made aware "that there's going to be ongoing public pressure until these reforms are instituted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Siner|first=Emily|title=The Internet Flexes Political Muscle With Anti-NSA Protest|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/02/11/274901562/the-internet-flexes-political-muscle-with-anti-nsa-protest|publisher=NPR|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest was announced on January 10, 2014, by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF).&lt;ref name="MintPress News" /&gt; Other early organizers included digital rights groups such as [[Fight for the Future]], and [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], as well as social media website [[Reddit]], [[Firefox]] producer [[Mozilla]], collaborative blogging website [[Boing Boing]], and populist advocacy group '"The Other 98%".&lt;ref name="PCWorld" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MintPress News" /&gt;&lt;ref name="International Business Times" /&gt;

According to the official website, the protest asked U.S. "legislators to oppose the [[FISA Improvements Act]], support the [[USA Freedom Act]], and enact protections for non-Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thedaywefightback.org/ |title=Today, February 11th, 2014 is The Day We Fight Back against mass surveillance |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/02/data-spying-feb-11-to-become-the-day-we-fight-back/ |title=Data Spying: Feb. 11 To Become "The Day We Fight Back" |publisher=Valuewalk.com|date=2014-02-04 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|02|12}}&lt;!-- the lede needs to be updated with the actual day reality, rather than merely a pre-event projection, and should explicate what, if any, impact followed. --&gt; Protest organizers said roughly 96,000 calls were placed to members of Congress and 555,000 "pro-privacy emails" were sent via the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Damon|first=Poeter|title=The Day We Fight Back Generates Nearly 100K Calls To Congress|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2453387,00.asp|accessdate=17 February 2014|work=PC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The Day We Fight Back was intended as a day of "worldwide solidarity" in protest against NSA surveillance. It was at once an action against censorship and surveillance, and a commemoration of late "open-Internet activist" [[Aaron Swartz]].&lt;ref name="International Business Times" /&gt; In the US, a main goal of the protest was to encourage passage of the [[USA Freedom Act]], a bill that seeks to reign in telephone data collection. Additionally, the banner urged people to call Congress and voice opposition to the [[FISA Improvements Act]], which the ACLU called "a dream come true for the NSA" that would "codify the NSA's unconstitutional call-records program and allow bulk collection of location data from mobile phone users."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wagstaff|first=Keith|title=Reddit, Tumblr and More Protest NSA With 'Day We Fight Back'|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/reddit-tumblr-more-protest-nsa-day-we-fight-back-n26416|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the US, the goal was similar. A ''Guardian'' op-ed described the activists' objective globally as "to push authorities toward policies favoring liberty and privacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gilmore|first=Dan|title=Get ready: the day we fight back against mass surveillance is coming|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/06/nsa-fighting-back-against-surveillence-state|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers posted to their website: "Together we will push back against powers that seek to observe, collect, and analyze our every digital action.Together, we will make it clear that such behavior is not compatible with democratic governance. Together, if we persist, we will win this fight."&lt;ref name=PC4,000 /&gt; Rainey Reitman, director of activism at the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]], said, "The idea is to really harness the outrage of the Internet community in speaking out in one big voice on Feb. 11." The protest comes a month after President Obama made a surveillance reform speech introducing his proposed changes to the collection of US citizens' data. Critics said the reformations wouldn't be "nearly enough".g&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite news |last=Hattem|first=Julian|title="The idea is to really harness the outrage of the Internet community in speaking out in one big voice on Feb. 11," said Rainey Reitman, the director of activism at the Electronic Frontier Foundation|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/197859-thousands-of-sites-to-protest-nsa-spying |publisher=The Hill|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers compared the February protest with the SOPA protest two years prior, saying, "Today we face a different threat, one that undermines the Internet and the notion that any of us live in a genuinely free society". The threats were 'International counterparts like [[Five Eyes]] and [[Tempora]], mass surveillance, and programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], Canada's [[Communications Security Establishment Canada|CSEC]] airport monitoring activities'.&lt;ref name=CH&gt;{{cite news |last=Rickwood|first=Lee|title=Protesting mass surveillance: Canada called to join The Day We Fight Back|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/technology/Protesting+mass+surveillance+Canada+called+join+Fight+Back/9468059/story.html|work=Calgary Herald|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

=== Promotion ===
The Day We Fight Back was promoted in a trailer for an upcoming documentary about Aaron Swartz, currently titled ''The Internet's Own Boy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/11/aaron-swartz-documentary_n_4578257.html |title=Aaron Swartz Documentary Clip Reveals Activist's Thoughts On NSA, Pushes Day Of Action |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] |first=Joanna |last=Zelman |date=January 11, 2014 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the clip, the late activist comments on [[Global surveillance|mass surveillance]]: "It is shocking to think that the accountability is so lax that they don't even have sort of basic statistics about how big the spying programme is. If the answer is, 'Oh, we're spying on so many people we can't possibly even count them,' then that's an awful lot of people." Five months after Swartz's death, the scale of a vast global surveillance program would be [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|revealed]] in great detail through the release of top-secret NSA documents by [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref name="guardian20140111"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/11/aaron-swartz-death-first-anniversary |title=Hacking of MIT website marks first anniversary of Aaron Swartz's death |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Martin |last=Pengelly |date=January 11, 2014 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amy Goodman]] of [[Democracy Now!]] promoted The Day We Fight Back in an opinion article in the ''[[Athens News]]'', noting Swartz's role in the digital rights movement calling for "another fight for the freedom of the Internet" without him.&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.athensnews.com/ohio/article-41560-aaron-swartz-the-life-we-lost-and-the-day-we-fight-back.html |title=Aaron Swartz: The life we lost and the day we fight back |work=Athens News |first=Amy |last=Goodman |date=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reddit "Ask Me Anything" ===

Aaron Swartz was an American activist who founded the online group [[Demand Progress]], known for its campaign against the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA).

{{blockquote|It is shocking to think that the accountability is so lax that they don't even have sort of basic statistics about how big the spying programme is.

==Reaction==
By mid-day, organizers said supporters had sent 104,000 emails and made nearly 50,000 calls to Congress.&lt;ref name=APGoogle /&gt;
 
On [[Twitter]], the [[hashtag]] "StopTheNSA" became a 'trending' topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=LaCapria|first=Kim|title=#StopTheNSA Trends On Twitter Thanks to The Day We Fight Back |url=http://www.business2community.com/social-buzz/day-fight-back-stopthensa-trends-twitter-0774631|publisher=B2C|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joining tech companies and public figures, lawmakers voiced support using the online platform, including [[Tom Udall]], [[Jerry Nadler]], [[Rick Larsen]], [[Ron Wyden]], [[Raul M.

Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] (I-VT) posted: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;What I worry about is kids growing up in a society where they say 'if I send this email or if I visit this website, then somebody may think I'm a terrorist. I'm not going to talk about this issue, I'm not going to read this book, I'm not going to explore this idea.' I don't want anyone thinking about that.

As February 11 drew to a close, ''[[The New York Times]]'' posted a blog titled "The Day the Internet Didn't Fight Back," reporting that "the protest on Tuesday barely registered. [[Wikipedia]] did not participate. Reddit ... added an inconspicuous banner to its homepage. Sites like Tumblr, Mozilla and [[DuckDuckGo]], which were listed as organizers, did not include the banner on their homepages. The eight major technology companies—Google, [[Microsoft]], Facebook, AOL, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], Twitter, Yahoo and LinkedIn ... only participated Tuesday insofar as having a joint website flash the protest banner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/the-day-the-internet-didnt-fight-back/ |title=The Day the Internet Didn't Fight Back |work=[[The New York Times]] |series=Bits |first=Nicole |last=Perlroth |date=February 11, 2014 |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The State of the World's Children''''' is an annual report published by the [[United Nations Children's Emergency Fund]] (UNICEF). It is the flagship publication of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc/ |title=The State of the World's Children reports}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first report was published in 1980, having been introduced by [[James P.

Following the end of Grant's tenure at UNICEF and his death in 1995, ''The State of the World's Children'' has received significantly less attention.&lt;ref name=fifield/&gt;{{rp|390}}

==Content==

''The State of the World's Children 1982–1983'' launches the [[child survival revolution]] and pushed for [[GOBI]] (growth monitoring, [[oral rehydration therapy]], breastfeeding, and immunization).&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 1988 report argues for the need of a "Grand Alliance" for children between governments, schools, mass media, etc., to continue the child survival and development revolution.&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 1991 report features the [[World Summit for Children]], which happened the previous year. The report covers the commitment made by the Summit and serves as a record.&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 2015 ''The State of the World's Children'' report, titled ''Reimagine the Future'', reviews the work on children's health and rights in the world in the context of the 25th anniversary of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/SOWC_2015_Summary_and_Tables.pdf |title=THE STATE OF THE WORLD’S CHILDREN 2015: Executive Summary |publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crop.org/OtherResources/FurtherReading/UNICEF-The-State-of-the-Worlds-Children-in-Numbers-.aspx |title=UNICEF: The State of the World’s Children in Numbers |date=August 24, 2015 |accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report also argued that more innovation is necessary, and highlighted examples including Solar Ear (a solar-rechargeable [[hearing aid]] battery charger) and community-based management of acute malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/world/state-world-s-children-2015-reimagine-future-innovation-every-child |title=The State of the World’s Children 2015: Reimagine the future - Innovation for every child |date = November 20, 2014 |publisher=reliefweb |accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipient of the 2016 Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize==
The Task Force for Global Health received the 2016 Conrad N.

==History==
The organization was co-founded by global health pioneer and former CDC Director, [[William Foege|Dr. William Foege]] and two of his former CDC colleagues, Carol Walters and Bill Watson. It was founded in 1984 as The Task Force for Child Survival.&lt;ref name="Foege"&gt;{{cite news|last=Foege |first=William |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-partners-in-fighting-disease/2012/11/22/f127b0e2-1f00-11e2-ba31-3083ca97c314_story.html |title=Global partners in fighting disease |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2012-11-22 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force was initially launched to foster collaboration among leading health and development agencies. Under the leadership of Dr. Foege, The Task Force brought together [[World Bank Group]], [[The Rockefeller Foundation]], [[United Nations Development Programme|The United Nations Development Programme]], [[WHO]], and [[UNICEF]], [[WHO]] to raise childhood immunization rates.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saportareport.com/task-force-global-health-receive-2016-2-million-prize-hilton-foundation/ |title=Task Force for Global Health to receive 2016 $2 million prize from Hilton Foundation |website=SaportaReport.com |date=2016-08-09 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, only 20 percent of children worldwide were receiving immunizations and 12,000 children, mostly in the world's poorest countries, were dying every day. By 1990, The Task Force had raised childhood immunization rates to 80 percent globally.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt; Since then, The Task Force has used its strength and credibility in collaboration to positively affect a broad range of health issues affecting the world's poor.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt; In 2015, The Task Force celebrated 30 years of contributions to global health at an event that included [[World Bank Group]] President [[Jim Yong Kim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadership.saportareport.com/globalhealth/2015/10/15/the-task-force-for-global-health-celebrates-30-years-of-contributions-to-global-health/ |title=Task Force for Global Health Celebrates 30 Years &amp;#124; Global Health |website=Leadership.saportareport.com |date=2015-10-15 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The Task Force works with hundreds of partners to control and eliminate neglected tropical diseases and increase access to medicines and vaccines for [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[influenza]], and [[cholera]]. Beginning with the Mectizan Donation Program,&lt;ref name="Foege"/&gt; The Task Force is credited with working with the pharmaceutical industry to donate billions of dollars annually in essential medicines for the control and elimination of [[neglected tropical diseases]].&lt;ref name="globalatlanta1"/&gt;

Collaboration, health equity, and social justice are the cornerstones of all Task Force programs.&lt;ref name="businesswire1"/&gt; The organization is a major partner in the global effort to eliminate three neglected tropical diseases by 2025—blinding [[trachoma]], [[Onchocerciasis|river blindness]], and [[lymphatic filariasis]]—which collectively threaten hundreds of millions of people each year with blindness, disfigurement, and death.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt;

Information and laboratory technologies are vital tools in The Task Force's work to control and eliminate diseases and increase access to quality health care for people in developing countries.&lt;ref name="gpbnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpbnews.org/post/atlanta-considered-how-smartphones-and-science-could-help-eradicate-disease |title=Atlanta Considered: How Smartphones And Science Could Help Eradicate Disease &amp;#124; Georgia Public Broadcasting |website=Gpbnews.org |date=2016-02-26 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a smartphone-based data collection system, The Task Force maps the prevalence of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) to determine where interventions should be implemented.&lt;ref name="gpbnews1"/&gt; It uses portable molecular technology and tablet-based systems to detect and diagnose NTDs within populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.wabe.org/post/closer-look-mayor-kasim-reed-santa-claus-and-more |title=Closer Look: Mayor Kasim Reed; Santa Claus; And More &amp;#124; WABE 90.1 FM |website=News.wabe.org |date=2015-12-16 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses diverse technologies to help developing countries manage their healthcare workforce in order to meet the health needs of their populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2015/03/georgians-nation-stretch-health-resources/ |title=Georgians help a nation stretch its health resources |publisher=Georgia Health News |date=2015-03-23 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, The Task Force's Public Health Informatics Institute was named a partner on a new Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation-funded initiative called the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance Program (CHAMPS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://champshealth.org/|title=CHAMPS|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to understand and ultimately address the causes of death for children under 5 in developing countries.

In 2016, the Task Force helped launch a program called Digital Bridge which is developing an electronic case reporting system to improve information exchange between the public health and healthcare sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160827/MAGAZINE/308279979/commentary-stopping-zika-other-emerging-health-threats-requires|title=Commentary: Stopping Zika, other emerging health threats requires stronger surveillance systems|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth and future==
In 2016, The Task Force reached an agreement to purchase a DeKalb County government building in downtown Decatur for a larger headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/global-health-organization-plans-expansion-dekalb/IJ3GYxKoKZg75q9EXc9L7I/|title=Task Force for Global Health may buy DeKalb government building|first=Mark|last=Niesse|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force has begun examining how it might help address the growing epidemic of [[non-communicable diseases]] (NCDs) in developing countries.&lt;ref name="businesswire1"/&gt;

==Big picture==

===Late 1700s–1930s (pre-WWII era)===

During this pre-WWII era, there are three big trends that operate separately, but sometimes affect each other in development and outcomes.

First, a trend of urbanization (fueled by the [[Industrial Revolution]]) as well as greater global trade and migration leads to new challenges, including those in urban sanitation and infectious diseases/pandemics. Six global [[cholera]] pandemics happen in this period because of increased commerce and migration.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

Second, there is a lot of development on the underlying theory of disease, advancements in vaccine and antibiotic development, and a variety of experimental large-scale eradication and control programs. One big example: the [[germ theory of diseases]] begins to become accepted and popularized starting around 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/germtheory.html |title=Germ Theory |publisher=Harvard |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another big example is the development of the smallpox vaccine by Edward Jenner in 1796.&lt;ref name=Baxby1999/&gt; Systematic eradication and control efforts include the [[Rockefeller Sanitary Commission]] and efforts to eradicate smallpox.&lt;ref name="cugh.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150918175742/http://cugh.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/modules/To%20Post%20Both%20Faculty%20and%20Trainees/29_Global_Health_In_Historical_Perspective_The_Uses_Of_History_FINAL.pptx.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Antitoxins and vaccines for numerous diseases including [[cholera]] and [[tuberculosis]] are developed during this period, building on a trend of greater understanding of and control over [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="vaccine_timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/timeline |title=Timeline – History of Vaccines |publisher=The College of Physicians of Philadelphia |accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theme during this era is the formation of various preliminary international alliances and conferences, including the [[International Sanitary Conferences]], [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]], and the [[League of Nations]] Health Committee. This is closely intertwined with the other two trends. For instance, the cholera pandemics mentioned above, as well as the growing scientific understanding of the germ theory of disease, are both key impetuses for the International Sanitary Conferences.&lt;ref name="markel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |title=Worldly approaches to global health: 1851 to the present |first=Howard |last=Markel |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418174941/http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}}

===1940s–early 1960s (post-WWII era)===
Following the end of [[World War II]], the first batch of big organizations, both international and national (with international cooperation), including the [[United Nations]] and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), form.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt; Beginning with the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] for relief of victims of war in 1943, there is a big push to begin creating large scale health initiatives, non-governmental organizations, and worldwide global health programs by the United Nations to improve quality of life around the world. [[UNICEF]], the World Health Organization, as well as the UNRRA are all part of United Nations efforts to benefit global health beginning with developing countries. These various programs aim to aid in economic endeavors by providing loans, direct disease prevention programs, health education, etc.

===Late 1960s–1970s===

After wrapping up complications caused by the end of the war, there is an international energy put in into eradication, beginning with the complete smallpox eradication in 1979. There is greater dissatisfaction with WHO for its focus on disease/infection control at the expense of trying to improve general living conditions, as well as disappointment at its low budget and staffing. This atmosphere spurs other organizations to provide their own forms of aid.&lt;ref name="palilonis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioethics.wfu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Topic-3-A-Brief-History-of-Global-Health.pdf |title=An Introduction to Global Health and Global Health Ethics: A Brief History of Global Health |author= M. A. Palilonis |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|126}} The [[Alma Ata Declaration]] and selective [[primary healthcare]] are created to express urgent action by all governments and citizens to protect and promote the health of all people equally.&lt;ref name="Alma Ata Declaration"&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/publications/almaata_declaration_en.pdf Declaration from the website of the World Health Organization].&lt;/ref&gt; More organizations form following these new active attitudes toward global health, including the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] and the [[Doctors Without Borders]] organization. Publications like the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]] highlight basic medicines required by most adults and children to survive, and set priorities for healthcare fund allocation in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/|title=WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, there is more buy-in for the idea that direct, targeted efforts to address healthcare could be worthwhile and benefit many countries.

===1980s–2000===

Certain specific efforts increase in efficiency and productivity, including improvement in maternal and child health and a focus on [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]] (the 'Big Three') in developing countries. During this time period, the [[child survival revolution]] (CSR), which helps reduce child mortality in the developing world, and [[GOBI-FFF]] are both advocated by [[James P. Grant]].&lt;ref name="David Bornstein 2007 pp. 250"&gt;David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Summit for Children]] also takes place, becoming one of the largest ever gathering of heads of states and government to commit a set of goals to improve the well-being of children. Finally, HIV/AIDS becomes the focus of many governmental and non-governmental organizations, leading to the formation of the Global Programme on AIDS (GPA) by efforts of the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|6}} However, these health organizations also make significant advancements to tuberculosis treatments, including the [[DOTS]] strategy and the formation of the [[Stop TB Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoptb.org/|title=Stop TB Partnership - Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and beyond===

UN's [[Millennium Development Goals]] establishes health care as an important goal (not just combating infectious diseases).&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Later in 2015, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] build on the MDGs to outline the objectives that will transform our world by ending poverty, helping the environment, and improving health and education. More specific disease-targeting organizations are created primarily to fund healthcare plans in developing countries, including the  [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] and [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/|title=Home - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations (especially the WHO) adopt new strategies and initiatives, including the [[3 by 5 Initiative]] to widen the access to [[antiretroviral treatment]], the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/|title=World Health Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private large donors such as the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] begin to play an important role in shaping the funding landscape and direction of efforts in global health.

==Full timeline==

=== Inclusion criteria ===

The following events are selected for inclusion in the timeline:

* Major medical advances, such as the first vaccines or antibiotics for important diseases.
* Major disease outbreaks, particularly those that played a key role in identifying key medical facts about the nature of disease or epidemiology.
* Key programs, innovations, and strategies in delivery of treatments and healthcare supply chains.
* Government policies or healthcare systems that are the first of their kind in the world, or have global significance for some other reason.
* The forming of trans-national organizations and private foundations that either directly deal with global health, or fund and manage other organizations that do. Note that we also include some emergency medical relief organizations, because they have played an important role in identifying and combating disease outbreaks in the aftermath of natural or man-made disaster.
* Important conferences related to global health. For conferences held regularly, we only include an event for the first time the conference was held, or if there was a particularly influential conference.

We do ''not'' include:

* Incremental advances in medical science except the most important ones.
* Rollouts of policies by different governments, or changes to local healthcare structures, except those that are pioneering. To understand healthcare at the country level, you can see the timelines of healthcare by country.
* Incremental changes to existing trans-national organizations or private foundations in their global health programs, except those that have significance as pioneering new approaches to global health.

'''Time–space compression''' (also known as '''space–time compression''' and '''time–space distantiation'''), articulated in 1989 by geographer [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] in ''The Condition of [[Postmodernity]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David. ''The Condition of Postmodernity: An Enquiry into the Origins of Cultural Change''. Cambridge, MA: Blackwell, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; it refers to anything that impacts time and space. Harvey's idea was rooted in Karl Marx's theory of the "annihilation of time and space". A similar idea was proposed by [[Elmar Alvater]] in an article in ''[[PROKLA]]'' in 1987 translated into English as "Ecological and Economic Modalities of Time and Space" and published in ''[[Capitalism Nature Socialism]]'', 1(3) in 1989.

Time–space compression often occurs as a result of technological innovations including technology of communication and economics. 

According to theorists like [[Paul Virilio]], time-space compression is an essential facet of contemporary life: "Today we are entering a space which is speed-space ... This new other time is that of electronic transmission, of high-tech machines, and therefore, man is present in this sort of time, not via his physical presence, but via programming" (qtd. in ''Decron'' 71&lt;ref&gt;Decron, Chris. ''Speed-Space.''  Virilio Live. Ed. John Armitage. London: Sage, 2001. 69–81.&lt;/ref&gt;). In ''"Vitesse et Politique"'', Virilio  coins the term '''dromology''' to describe "speed-space." Virilio describes velocity as the hidden side of wealth and power, which represents a determining factor concerning societies' structures. Historical eras and political events, out of this perspective, are also speed-ratios. In his view, acceleration destroys space and compresses the time in ways of perceiving reality.

[[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]] maintains this idea about time-space compression in her discussion of globalization and its effect on our society. Similar to Virilio, she states that because our world is "speeding up" and "spreading out", time-space compression is more prevalent than ever as [[internationalization]] takes place. Cultures and communities are merged during time-space compression due to rapid growth and change, as "layers upon layers" of histories fuse together to shift our ideas of what the identity of a "place" should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Massey|first1=Doreen |authorlink=Doreen Massey (geographer)|chapter=A Global Sense of Place|title=Space, Place, and Gender|date=1994 |ISBN= 0816626162|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists generally identify two historical periods in which time–space compression occurred; the period from the mid-19th century to the beginnings of the [[First World War]], and the end of the 20th century. In both of these time periods, according to Jon May and Nigel Thrift, "there occurred a radical restructuring in the nature and experience of both time and space ... both periods saw a significant acceleration in the pace of life concomitant with a dissolution or collapse of traditional spatial co-ordinates".&lt;ref&gt;May, Jon and [[Nigel Thrift]]. "Introduction." ''TimeSpace: Geographies of Temporality''. NY: Routledge, 2001. pp.&amp;nbsp;1–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

For [[Moishe Postone]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Postone, Moishe]]. "Theorizing the Contemporary World: Robert Brenner, Giovanni Arrighi, David Harvey" in ''Political Economy of the Present and Possible Global Future(s)'', Anthem Press&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey's treatment of space-time compression and postmodern diversity are as merely reactions to [[capitalism]].  Hence Harvey's analysis remains "extrinsic to the [[social form]]s expressed" by the deep structure concepts of capital, value and the [[commodity]].

For Postone the postmodern moment is not necessarily just a one-sided effect of the contemporary form of capitalism but can also be seen as having an emancipatory side if it happened to be part of a post-capitalism.  And because postmodernism usually neglects its own context of embeddedness it can legitimate capitalism as postmodern, whereas at the level of deep structure it may in fact be more concentrated, with large capitals that, accumulate rather than diverge, and with an expansion of commodification niches with fewer buyers.

Postone asserts one cannot step outside capitalism and declare it a pure evil, or as a one-dimensional badness.  For Postone, the [[emancipatory]] content of such things as equal distribution or diversity are potentials of capitalism itself in its abundant and diverse productive powers.  It misfires however, when a form of life such as postmodernism takes itself for being the whole when in fact it is just another appearance of the same capitalist essence.
