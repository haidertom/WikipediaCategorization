'''John Dadzie''', better known by his musical aliases '''12th Planet''' and '''Infiltrata''' is a [[Los Angeles]] based [[dubstep]] and [[drum and bass]] producer and DJ.

==Biography==
Born John Christopher Dadzie, he grew up in South Los Angeles, the youngest of four children.&lt;ref name="urb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/12th-planet-is-the-johnny-appleseed-of-dubstep-2174054 |title=12TH Planet is the Johnny Appleseed of Dubstep |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date = February 23, 2012|first = Liz|last = Ohanesian|website = laweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first introduced to the electronic music scene in high school. After forming Imperial Recordings with DJ Lith, he launched his production skills on his own terms, originally producing [[drum and bass]] under the alias Infiltrata. In 2006, he decided that he was going to make [[dubstep]]. It was then that his new alias 12th Planet was created, in reference to [[Zecharia Sitchin]]'s book, 12th Planet. All production under the name 12th Planet is original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebigupmagazine.com/blog/about/music/12th-planet/ |title=12th Planet interview in Big magazine |publisher=thebigupmagazine.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314185607/http://thebigupmagazine.com/blog/about/music/12th-planet/ |archivedate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the first individuals to bring the dubstep culture to America (in one of the USA's electronic meccas, [[Los Angeles]]) 12th Planet has frequently been cited as the General of the Riddim Gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urb.com/2010/10/19/12-things-about-12th-planet-and-his-new-music-video-too/ |title=12 Things About 12th Planet (and his new music video too!) |publisher=URB |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803201159/http://www.urb.com/2010/10/19/12-things-about-12th-planet-and-his-new-music-video-too/ |archivedate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2045 Initiative''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] that develops a network and community of researchers in the field of [[life extension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Russian entrepreneur [[Dmitry Itskov]] in February 2011 with the participation of Russian specialists in the field of neural interfaces, robotics, artificial organs and systems.

The main goal of the 2045 Initiative, as stated on site, is "to create technologies enabling the transfer of an individual’s personality to a more advanced non-biological carrier, and extending life, including to the point of immortality. We devote particular attention to enabling the fullest possible dialogue between the world’s major spiritual traditions, science and society".

==Future prospects==
The 2045 Initiative has a roadmap for developing cybernetic [[immortality]].&lt;ref name = social&gt;[http://2045.com/ideology/ About Us, Strategic Social Initiative, 2045]&lt;/ref&gt; The Initiative has the goal for an avatar controlled by a "brain-computer" interface to be developed between 2015 and 2020, between 2020 and 2025 creating an autonomous life-support system for the human brain linked to a robot, between 2030 and 2035 creating a computer model of the brain and human consciousness with the means to transfer it into an artificial carrier, and by 2045 create a new era for humanity with holographic bodies.&lt;ref name = social/&gt;

==Avatar Project==

One of the featured [[Life extension|life-extension]] projects is to design an artificial [[humanoid]] body (called an "avatar") and an advanced [[brain–computer interface]] system. On the biological side, a life support system will be developed for hosting a human brain inside the avatar and maintaining it alive and functional. A later phase of the project will research into the creation of an [[artificial brain]] into which the original individual [[consciousness]] may be transferred.

=== Avatar A ===

A robotic copy of a human body remotely capable of interpreting commands directly from the mind, and sending information back to the mind in a form that can be interpreted via [[brain–computer interface]]. It is estimated to be popularized in or before 2020.

=== Avatar B ===

An avatar in which a human brain is [[Brain transplant|transplanted]] at the end of one's life. Avatar B has an autonomous system providing life support for the brain and allowing it interaction with the environment, possibly mounted into an existing Avatar A Chassis. Deadline of this phase is year 2025.

=== Avatar C ===

An avatar with an artificial brain to which a human personality is transferred for emulation at the end of one's life. The first successful attempt to upload one's personality to a computer is estimated to happen around 2035.

=== Avatar D ===

A [[Holography|hologram]]- or [[diagram]]-like avatar. This is the ultimate goal of this project but is optional since, assuming either the upload is involuntary or all humans chose to upload, biological diseases are prevented in the previous phase, and it is far away from current technological achievement and our understanding on physics.

==Reception==

Professor [[George M. Church]] has complained that "there's a lot of dots that aren't connected in (Itskov's) plans. It's not a real road map." [[Martine A. Rothblatt]], the founder of [[United Therapeutics]], has claimed the Avatar Project is "no more wild than in the early '60s, when we saw the advent of [[liver transplantation|liver]] and [[Kidney transplantation|kidney]] transplants."&lt;ref name=nytimes_06_2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Segal|first=David|title=Dmitry Itskov and the Avatar Quest|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/dmitry-itskov-and-the-avatar-quest.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=9 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph''' (born October 22, 1992), better known by his stage name '''21 Savage''', is an American [[rapper]], record producer, and songwriter from [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Abraham-Joseph grew up around criminality and eventually dropped out of school, beginning to rap in 2013 after the death of a friend. He gained attention in the [[Atlanta]] underground for the 2015 mixtape ''[[The Slaughter Tape]]'' before attaining nationwide attention following the [[Metro Boomin]] collaborative album ''[[Savage Mode]]'' (2016), its lead single "[[X (21 Savage and Metro Boomin song)|X]]", and his collaboration with Drake, "[[Sneakin']]".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/21-savage-seth-rogen-interview|title=21 Savage chops it up with Seth Rogen|date=2018-04-26|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham-Joseph released his debut studio album, ''[[Issa Album]]'', in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/the-break/2015/10/the-break-presents-21-savage/|title=The Break Presents: 21 Savage|last=C.M.|first=Emmanuel|date=October 9, 2015|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL Magazine]]|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which debuted at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200 and gave Abraham-Joseph his first top twenty song, "[[Bank Account (song)|Bank Account]]." He achieved his first number one single at the end of 2017 with his feature on [[Post Malone]]'s "[[Rockstar (Post Malone song)|Rockstar]]."&lt;ref name="XXL Magazine2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/10/post-malone-21-savage-rockstar-no-1-billboard-hot-100-chart/|title=Post Malone's ''Rockstar'' Hits No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=XXL Magazine|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he also released the [[Offset (rapper)|Offset]] and Metro Boomin collaboration ''[[Without Warning (21 Savage, Offset and Metro Boomin album)|Without Warning]]''.

==Early life==
Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph was born on October 22, 1992, in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/21-savage-mn0003515232/biography|title=Biography &amp; History|last=Jeffries|first=David|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birthplace2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_MS37401|title=21 Savage|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|website=[[South by Southwest]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised by his mother Heather, who is of [[People of Dominica|Dominica]] descent, and his four brothers and six sisters, though one is deceased due to a shooting after a [[Illegal drug trade|drug deal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://djbooth.net/features/2016-11-22-brutal-story-behind-21-savage-dagger-face-tattoo|title=The Brutal Story Behind 21 Savage's Dagger Face Tattoo|last=James|first=Andy|date=November 22, 2018|website=[[DJBooth]]|access-date=May 2, 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventh grade, Abraham-Joseph was banned permanently from every school in the [[DeKalb County School District]] due to gun possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1CmVcwIyKo|title=21 Savage Interview With The Breakfast Club (8-4-16)|date=August 4, 2016|people=[[Charlamagne tha God]], [[DJ Envy]]|publisher=[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)]]|location=[[New York City]]|access-date=May 6, 2018|medium=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to begin attending schools around the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] before being sent to a youth detention center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-21-savage-news.22853.html|title=Everything You Need To Know About 21 Savage|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being released from the youth detention center, he completed eighth grade through an alternative program before finishing a semester of high school, dropping out in his freshman year following multiple exclusions which Abraham-Joseph said he was "exhausted" by.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/08/04/21-savage-the-breakfast-club-interview|title=21 Savage Talks Being An "A" Student, Losing His Best Friends On The Breakfast Club|work=The FADER|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After dropping out, Abraham-Joseph joined a gang affiliated with the [[Bloods]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and became a full-time drug dealer, mainly selling cannabis.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; He also took parts in other criminal activities including robbery and grand theft auto regularly, though only being arrested once after contraband was found in a car he was driving.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/21-savage-profile-2018|title=21 Savage: From Robbin’ Season to Role Model|last=Wood|first=Samuel Hine, Geordie|date=2018-06-27|work=GQ|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, when Abraham-Joseph was 19, he lost his "right hand" man, Larry in a shootout.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In 2013, on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph was shot six times and his brother Johnny "Tay-Man" was killed during an attempted robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/10/01/feature-21-savage|title=Meet 21 Savage, Atlanta’s Most Respected New Rapper|website=[[The Fader]]|access-date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===2014–15: Early releases===
Following the death of his friend in a shootout on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph began rapping, naming himself after the event&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; though Savage came from Instagram predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.capitalxtra.com/features/facts/21-savage/|title=19 Facts You Need To Know About 'Rockstar' Rapper 21 Savage|work=Capital XTRA|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His music career was originally subsidized by the uncle of his deceased friend, giving him money for studio time in 2013.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On November 12, 2014, 21 Savage's debut single, "Picky", produced by DJ Plugg, was released. It was later included on his debut mixtape, ''[[The Slaughter Tape]]'', which was released on May 25, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/34127/21-savage-the-slaughter-tape.html|title=21 Savage - The Slaughter Tape|work=LiveMixtapes|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release made him what [[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] called an "underground hero in Atlanta."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On July 2, 2015, 21 released a collaborative EP, ''Free Guwop'', with [[Sonny Digital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/35036/21-savage-free-guwop-ep.html|title=21 Savage - Free Guwop EP|work=LiveMixtapes|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tribute EP to fellow rapper and influence [[Gucci Mane]]. On December 1, 2015, Abraham-Joseph released his second mixtape, ''[[Slaughter King]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/21-savage-slaughter-king-new-mixtape.116157.html|title=21 Savage - Slaughter King - Download &amp; Listen [New Mixtape]|author=Rose Lilah|date=2 December 2015|work=HotNewHipHop|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Abraham-Joseph was named as one of the "Freshman Class" of 2016 by ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/06/xxl-freshman-class-cover-2016/|title=XXL Freshman Class Cover 2016|last=|first=|date=June 13, 2016|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=[[Townsquare Media]]|access-date=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 15, 2016, Abraham-Joseph released his joint [[Extended play|EP]] [[Savage Mode]] with Atlanta-based record producer [[Metro Boomin]]. The EP gained international success and peaked at number 23 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], which became their highest charting EP to date.&lt;ref name="BB2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/7447109/21-savage/chart|title=21 Savage – Chart History: Billboard 200|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on the cover of [[Fader (magazine)|''Fader'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/21-savage-and-futures-x-is-now-platinum-news.25668.html|title=21 Savage on the cover of Fader|last=Lilah|first=Rose|access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His single "[[X (21 Savage and Metro Boomin song)|X]]" featuring [[Future (rapper)|Future]] on the EP was confirmed by Billboard as going platinum in the US, being 21's 1st platinum record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/11/21-savage-first-platinum-record-x/|title=21 Savage Gets His First Platinum Record With "X"|last=Weinstein|first=Max|date=November 22, 2016|website=|publisher=|accessdate=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 18, 2017, Abraham-Joseph announced that he had signed to [[Epic Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/news/id.42064/title.21-savage-inks-record-deal-with-epic-records#|title=21 Savage Inks Record Deal With Epic Records|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, his debut studio album, ''[[Issa Album]]'', reached at number two on the US ''Billboard'' 200 chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7866158/21-savage-haim-billboard-200-albums-chart-top-10|title=21 Savage &amp; Haim Debut in Top 10 on Billboard 200 Albums Chart|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=July 16, 2017|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its lead single, "[[Bank Account (song)|Bank Account]]", charted in the top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://headlineplanet.com/home/2017/08/08/hot-100-niall-horans-slow-hands-enters-top-15-21-savages-bank-account-top-20/|title=Hot 100: Niall Horan’s "Slow Hands" Enters Top 15, 21 Savage’s "Bank Account" Top 20|date=August 7, 2017|work=Headline Planet|access-date=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was featured on [[Post Malone]]'s single "[[Rockstar (Post Malone song)|Rockstar]]", which peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and broke several records.&lt;ref name="XXL Magazine2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/post-malone-rockstar-breaks-spotify-global-record/|title=Post Malone Breaks Spotify Global Record With ''Rockstar'' - XXL|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8031270/post-malone-rockstar-platinum-21-savage|title=Post Malone &amp; 21 Savage's 'Rockstar' Is Now Certified Platinum|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Abraham-Joseph had a guest appearance on [[Young Thug]]'s extended play ''[[Hear No Evil (Young Thug EP)|Hear No Evil]]'' along with fellow rappers [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/04/13/young-thug-hear-no-evil-nicki-minaj-21-savage|title=Young Thug drops Hear No Evil EP|last=Maicki|first=Salvatore|date=April 13, 2018|website=The Fader|access-date=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month he also appeared on the single "Outstanding" by [[SahBabii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/04/sahbabii-21-savage-new-song-outstanding/|title=Listen to SahBabii and 21 Savage's New Song "Outstanding"|last=India|first=Lindsey|date=April 20, 2018|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 21 he was featured on the single "Rover 2.0", which is part of [[BlocBoy JB]]'s [[Simi (mixtape)|Simi]] mixtape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1988300/blocboy-jb-rover-2-0-feat-21-savage/music/|title=BlocBoy JB – "Rover 2.0" (Feat. 21 Savage)|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=March 23, 2018|website=[[Stereogum]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/05/blocboy-jb-simi-mixtape/|title=BlocBoy JB Drops 'Simi' Mixtape Featuring Drake, Lil Pump and More|last=Coleman II|first=C.

On October 31, 2018, [[Halloween]], Abraham-Joseph posted on his Instagram a picture of a man in silhouette jumping in the air in the direction away from a large blaze. In the bottom right corner of the picture there is a "Parental Advisory" notice, as there oftentimes is on the cover of rap releases. Abraham-Joseph also tagged Metro Boomin in the post. For these reasons, some speculated it to be a sequel to 2017's ''Without Warning'' record. However, it turned out to be the cover for Metro’s debut solo album, ''[[Not All Heroes Wear Capes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BpnfcqeBtAT/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=21savage|title=Saint Laurent Don on Instagram: "y’all know what season it is @metroboomin 4L"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical style ==

'''Samantha Davon James''' (born December 18, 1986), better known by her stage name '''3D Na'Tee''', is an American [[rapper]], songwriter, and video director. She was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and grew up in the [[3rd Ward of New Orleans|3rd Ward]]. 3D Na'Tee has been featured on several national media outlets such as [[MTV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTV: SuckaFree Freestyle: 3D Na'Tee|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/651008/sucker-freestyle-3dnatee.jhtml|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Source (magazine)|The Source Magazine]],&lt;ref name="thesource"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE SOURCE MAGAZINE: Top Up &amp; Coming Female Rapper Releases Her Latest Project|url=http://www.thesource.com/articles/235038/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[XXL (magazine)|XXL Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XXL: Surviving The Times: Erick Sermon Talks About New Mixtape, Digital Label &amp; Reviving Skills|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/features/2012/05/surviving-the-times-erick-sermon-talks-about-new-mixtape-digital-label-reviving-skills/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHAHEEM REID: 5 STAR REVIEW FROM XXL'S EDITOR-AT-LARGE SHAHEEM REID &amp; @TEAMSHAHEEM|url=http://3dnatee.com/main/?p=1340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fader Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE FADER MAGAZINE: Features 3D Na'Tee - Lil Kim|url=http://www.thefader.com/index.php?s=na%27tee&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0&amp;submit=Go}}&lt;/ref&gt; RapRadar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAPRADAR: RapRadar Search Features|url=http://rapradar.com/?s=3D+na%27tee&amp;x=0&amp;y=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and RapRehab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAPREHAB: RapRehab's Featured Artist|url=http://raprehab.com/2012/08/3d-natee-new-orleans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also received attention from Louisiana newspapers and music magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE SMOKING SECTION: 3D Na'Tee is Back and we have been invited to her Coronation|url=http://smokingsection.uproxx.com/TSS/2012/07/3d-natee-the-coronation-mixtape}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOLA.COM: 4X Nola HipHop Award Winner 3D Na'Tee Raises The Bar Again By Being The First Native HipHop Artist With A Mobile App|url=http://www.nola.com/music/index.ssf/2011/09/industry_influence_celebrates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
In her middle school years, 3D Na'Tee honed her skills by what is called in New Orleans, ribbin' (rib - ing). Most people know this as "Playing the Dozens". Someone would start a beat by beating on a lunch room table or a garbage can, and off she went, lyrically attacking someone who was bold enough to test her skill. The rhymes were mostly about what they were wearing, how lame they were, or silly they looked.

In 1999, she began recording with local label called '''Clientell Records'''. Over the next five years, she would record multiple mixtapes under the "Snypa Squad" and feature on other projects Clientell Records came out with. However, in 2006, a year after [[Hurricane Katrina]], Clientell Records dismantled and 3D Na'Tee, who had previously established herself as a battler rapper amongst the local rap scene in New Orleans, released her first mix tape project '''"3's Company Vol.1: The Rapper, The Hustler, the Diva"''' followed by '''Volume 2''' in 2007. After the release of her second project, she appeared on '''The Kush 2''' DVD which was produced by [[YMCMB]] president [[Mack Maine]]. The DVD featured other Cash Money/Young Money artist like [[Lil Wayne]], [[Nicki Minaj]], and [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]] as well as [[Curren$y]] of [[Warner Bros. Records]]

==Career==
After the local success of her first two releases and her critically acclaimed appearance on '''The Kush 2''', she released her third mix tape '''Heavy Is the head That Wears The Crown''' followed by a music video for a song she titled, '''Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner'''. That video piqued the interest of [[G-Unit Records]] affiliate and [[Shade 45]] [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius XM]] radio host Nelson Gomez who invited her to [[New York City|New York]] for an interview on his XM show as well as on rapper [[50 Cent|50 Cents']] wildly popular ThisIs50.com website. Soon after, the talk of her third release also got her featured in HipHop Weekly Magazine by [[Benzino]], former co-owner of [[The Source Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3DNATEE.COM: BIO|url=http://3dnatee.com/main/?page_id=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of video releases like Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner which spoofed many mainstream hip hop artists, 3D Na'Tee's music has been described as controversial and sometimes offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WOMEN OF HIPHOP: 3D Na'Tee Explains How HipHop Saved Her Life, Talks Female Rap, and More|url=http://thewomenofhiphop.com/2012/08/04/wohh-exclusive-3d-natee-explains-how-hip-hop-saved-her-lifetalks-female-rap-more/}}&lt;/ref&gt; That song also shared the title of her for mix tape released in 2010.

'''Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner''' (The Mixtape) lead to 3D Na'Tee being nominated for a total of 5 Nola HipHop Awards by her in her home town at the NOLA Hiphop Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OFFBEAT MAGAZINE: Nola HipHop Awards Nominees Finalized|url=http://www.offbeat.com/2010/10/14/nola-underground-hip-hop-award-nominees-finalized/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won three awards (the most awards won by a single artist) for '''Lyricist of the Year''', '''Mixtape of the Year''', and '''Female Artist of the Year'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASHLEE NICOLE SPILLS: Winners of the 2010 HipHop Awards Announced|url=http://www.ashleenicolespills.com/2010/10/20/winners-of-the-2010-nola-underground-hip-hop-awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixtape included collaborations from [[Curren$y]] (courtesy of Warner Bros. Records), '''Ebony Eyez''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STL TODAY: Ebony Eyez Returns With A Story 2 Tell|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/music/ebony-eyez-returns-with-a-story-to-tell/article_6a65d3ae-d2bb-11e1-985c-0019bb30f31a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Babs Bunny''' (formally of [[Sean Combs|Sean "Diddy" Combs]]) founded group, [[Da Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SYFFAL: Forming Da Band|url=http://www.syffal.com/making-the-band}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALL MUSIC.COM: Da Band's Discography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/da-band-mn0000764981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011 3D Na'Tee was featured on [[MTV|MTV's]] SuckerFree Freestyle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTV: SUCKERFREE FREESTYLE: 3DNATEE|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/651008/sucker-freestyle-3dnatee.jhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by [[DJ Envy]]. 3D Na'Tee and Syleena collaborated on a song called '''Go Head'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RHAPSODY: Syleena Johnson|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/syleena-johnson/album/chapter-v-underrated/track/go-head-feat-natee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

July 27, 2011 3D Na'Tee released a video for '''Switch'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLDSTARHIPHOP: 3D Na'Tee's Switch|url=http://hp-www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video800.php?v=wshhd71614snrClf6d9H&amp;set_size=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she shot and edited herself. The song included several previously released instrumental versions of songs produced by super producer [[Timbaland]]. This video gained her a nomination for '''Director of the Year''' and an award for '''Video of the Year'''. Because of the momentum the Switch video gained the day of its release, Timbaland viewed it online and in less than 24 hours, flew 3D Na'Tee to [[The Hit Factory|Miami's Hit Factory Studio]] to work with her on her next project, The Coronation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE FADER MAGAZINE: 3D Na'Tee - Lil Kim|url=http://www.thefader.com/2012/07/30/video-natee-lil-kim/#comments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ONWAX MAGAZINE: Rapper 3D Na'Tee shoots 'Wild' video in New Orleans, produced by Lex Luger|url=http://onwaxmagazine.com/owm/index.php/rapper-3d-natee-shoots-wild-video-in-new-orleans-produced-by-lex-luger/}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several months spent traveling with Timbaland and other artist signed to his label, a contract was presented to 3D Na'Tee to sign to Timbaland's production company [[Mosley Music Group|Mosely Music Group]] and to be managed by members of Timbaland's management team. 3D Na'Tee and Timbaland later announced via [[Twitter]] that she was no longer a part of Timbaland's company because she decided not to sign the contract presented. In a later interview, 3D Na'Tee explained that there was no ill feelings towards Timbaland and cited her reasons for not signing were strictly because of contractual clauses that could not be agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DJSMALLZ.COM: INTERVIEW: SOUTHERN SMOKE TV! 3D NA'TEE (@3DNATEE) SPEAKS ON TURNING DOWN RECORD DEAL WITH TIMBALAND|url=http://www.djsmallz.com/blog/2012/5/18/interview-southern-smoke-tv-3d-natee-3dnatee-speaks-on-turni.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WOMEN OF HIPHOP: [WOHH EXCLUSIVE]!|url=http://thewomenofhiphop.com/2012/08/04/wohh-exclusive-3d-natee-explains-how-hip-hop-saved-her-lifetalks-female-rap-more/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exactly two years after 3D Na'Tee's last mix tape release, she released her highly anticipated street album ''The Coronation'' which featured artists like [[Keri Hilson]], Young Fletcher, and Lyrica Anderson. The Coronation also featured production from Mizay Entertainment's [[Lex Luger (producer)|Lex Luger]], [[Maybach Music Group|Maybach Music Group's]] Yung Shun, Heartbeatz, Casa Di, Versive Manhattan, Serious Beats, Da Smokestarz, among others.

In August 2012 it was announced by DJ Skee, Sirius Satellite Radio Host, that the first release from The Coronation entitled '''NO LOVE''' produced by [[Maybach Music Group|MMG's]] '''Young Shun''' was the #9 most requested song in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIRIUS XM: #9 Song in the Country|url=https://twitter.com/DontHateBeHated/status/235174781102747648}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coronation's second release, '''Lil Kim''' produced by '''Casa Di''' gained tons of recognition as well as it was featured on both [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] and [[The Fader]] Magazines' websites.&lt;ref name="thesource" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FADER MAGAZINE: 3D Na'Tee Releases Lil Kim|url=http://www.thefader.com/2012/07/30/video-natee-lil-kim/#comments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lil Kim was a cautionary tale of a young girl with an absentee father who, because of her father's absence, unfortunately grew up and "fell in love" too fast. The song and its video (directed by Charley Mac), gained a lot of attention from tons of hiphop artist like [[Trina]], [[Missy Elliott]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WEBSTAGRAM: Trina Talks to 3D Na'Tee about 'Lil Kim|url=http://web.stagram.com/p/251601262639516075_14212753}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grammy Award Winning [[Chamillionaire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIG DOOR: Chamillionaire|url=http://www.bigdoor.com/company/press/grammy-award-winning-artist-and-bigdoor-ceo-to-speak-at-gamification-summit/}}&lt;/ref&gt; who featured 3D Na'Tee's video on his famed social site [https://web.archive.org/web/20120802044043/http://www.chamillionaire.com/videos/play/608 www.chamillionaire.com].

Based in [[Las Vegas]], he has released three mixtapes since 2011 and several singles, and has performed at festivals such as [[Electric Zoo]] in New York and EDC Vegas.&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt; In 2014 he released the track "Vikings" with Botnek on [[Dim Mak Records]].&lt;ref name="jblauallmusicbio"/&gt;

==Early life==
Justin David Blau was born in [[Syosset]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States on {{birth date and age|1991|01|09}}.&lt;ref name="ablau"/&gt; Blau grew up around an artistic family, and was soon playing piano, playing guitar and singing. At thirteen, he moved with his family to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he spent the rest of his youth.&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt; He attended [[The Meadows School]] for high school and [[Washington University in St. Louis]] for college.&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt;

== Background ==
Much of 3LAU's music incorporates [[electro house]], [[dubstep]], [[deep house]], and [[progressive house]].&lt;ref name="dblau" /&gt; He is known for his melodic take on dance music and live sets that incorporate [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. He is also known for using [[Ableton]].

==Music career==

===2011–12: First releases===
In 2011, at the age of 20, he vacationed in Sweden, where he discovered electronic dance music. After returning to college he started producing mashups, "mainly because [he] didn't think anyone was doing a good job."&lt;ref name="cblau"/&gt; He soon began mixing under the professional name 3LAU, and by June of that year was uploading mashups to YouTube.&lt;ref name="jblauallmusicbio"/&gt;

3LAU gained recognition in the [[electronic music]] world in 2011 with his two bootlegs, "Girls Who Save the World" and "All Night Long". He also won a remix competition for his remix of [[Tiesto]]'s "Work Hard, Play Hard".

Before 2012, 3LAU spent his days studying at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and DJing at night. He has had remixes charts in the top 10 on both [[Beatport]] and [[Hype Machine]].&lt;ref name="dblau"/&gt;

===2012–15: Singles, touring===
In 2012, he focused on DJing and launched his 3LAU Your Mind tour. That same year, he released his second bootleg album, ''Dance Floor Filth''.&lt;ref name="dblau"/&gt; In 2012, the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' described him as "one of America's fastest-rising DJ-producers."&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt; In 2012 he released ''Dance Floor Filth 2'', an album featuring his production.&lt;ref name="iblau"/&gt;

In late 2013, he went on a short tour with Carnage called the Night Riot tour.&lt;ref name="eblauboston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hblau"/&gt; Wrote Jonah Ollman of ''Sound of Boston'' about 3LAU's live performances in late 2013, "A nice balance of mashups, electro-house, poppy vocal samples, and a 90’s throwback here and there keep the young 20-something crowd going and constantly entertained."&lt;ref name="eblauboston"/&gt;

In the summer of 2015, 3LAU did his first European tour visiting Barcelona, Germany and Ibiza. Later that fall, he went on his first Asian tour which included Bangkok, Jakarta, Tokyo and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tour|url = http://www.3lau.com/tour|website = Tour|access-date = 2016-01-11|language = en-US|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160117071736/http://www.3lau.com/tour|archive-date = 2016-01-17|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alastair Charles Ralphs''' (born May 22, 1977) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and former [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilder]], better known by his [[ring name]], '''A-1''' (alternatively spelled '''A1''' or '''A-One'''). He is best known for his appearances with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) from 2004 to 2007 as part of [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]].

==Early life==
Ralphs was born in [[Placentia Bay]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and relocated to [[Dunnville, Ontario|Dunnville]], [[Ontario]] at the age of five. He later moved to [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]] to attend the [[University of Windsor]].

==Professional wrestling career==

===Border City Wrestling (2001–2005)===
Alastair Ralphs was trained by [[Scott D'Amore]] in the Can-Am Wrestling School, and debuted in D'Amore's [[Border City Wrestling]] promotion in 2001. After spending three years as an [[job (professional wrestling)|undercard talent]], Ralphs became A-1, a cocky, arrogant [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], forming an alliance with [[Joseph Dorgan|Johnny Swinger]]. He defeated [[D'Lo Brown]] for the BCW Heavyweight Championship on December 12, 2004, in [[Belleville, Michigan]] at "[[A Night of Appreciation for Sabu]]".

On January 23, 2005, at New Year's Revolution, Ralphs interrupted the Hall of Fame induction ceremony, complaining that he was being overshadowed by older wrestlers. Scott D'Amore responded with a jibe aimed at Ralph's previous career as a [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilder]], leading to a brawl between Ralphs and D'Amore. Following a distraction from Jade, A-1 was able to powerbomb D'Amore through a table. Ralphs went on to retain the heavyweight title in a match with [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]], using Abyss's own chain to knock him unconscious.

Ralphs lost the BCW Heavyweight Championship to [[Bobby Roode]] on July 22, 2005. In the course of his reign as champion he faced well-known veterans such as [[Jim Neidhart]] and [[King Kong Bundy]].

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004–2007)===
On July 16, 2004, Ralphs appeared in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], losing to [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. He reappeared on March 13, 2005 as a member of [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]], replacing the injured [[Johnny Devine]] at [[Destination X (2005)|Destination X 2005]] and teaming with Bobby Roode, [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] and [[Petey Williams]] to face [[Chris Harris (wrestler)|Chris Harris]], [[James Storm]], [[Brian Gerard James|B.G. James]] and [[Konnan]]. He wrestled on [[TNA Impact!]] throughout April and May 2005, [[tag team|teaming]] with other members of Team Canada or accompanying them to the ring. At [[TNA Hard Justice|Hard Justice]] on May 15, Ralphs took part in the [[Gauntlet for the Gold]]. He entered at number six and was eliminated by [[Monty Sopp|The Outlaw]] and B.G. James. On the May 11, 2006, episode of ''[[TNA Impact!]]'', [[Larry Zbyszko]] asked Team Canada coach [[Scott D'Amore]] for assistance in his feud with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]. D'Amore eventually agreed to help Zbyszko rid TNA of Raven, and nominated A-1 to face Raven in a match at [[TNA Sacrifice#2006|TNA Sacrifice 2006]] in May 2006, a match that A-1 lost. On the June 29, 2006, episode of ''Impact!'', TNA Management Director [[Jim Cornette]] disbanded Team Canada.

A-1 soon began wrestling sporadically, facing Ron Killings in the pre-show of the Hard Justice pay-per-view and against Eric Young at the No Surrender pay-per-view, losing both times. He also took part in the Kevin Nash Open Invitational X-Division Gauntlet Battle Royal at Bound For Glory, despite not being a part of the X-Division. He was eliminated by both [[Matt Bentley|Maverick Matt]] and [[Frankie Kazarian|Kazarian]].

A-1 was released by TNA in February 2007.

===Independent circuit (2007–present)===
Since leaving TNA, A-1 has wrestled on the independent circuit in Canada and the United States.

At [[Impact One Night Only]]: Canadian Clash in February 2018, A-1 returned to [[Impact Wrestling]] for the first time in over 11 years, unsuccessfully challenging [[Eli Drake]] for the [[Impact Global Championship]]. He returned to Impact Wrestling once again at the following month's One Night Only: March Breakdown PPV, where he teamed with [[Allie (wrestler)|Allie]] in a victory over [[Braxton Sutter]] and KC Spinelli. He is also currently a member of the [[Border City Wrestling]] roster.

==Content==
It deals with standard problems in the theory of [[personal identity]] in the form of a dialogue between a terminally ill university professor at a small Midwestern college,, Gretchen Weirob, and her two friends, Sam Miller and Dave Cohen. The views represented include those of [[Bernard Williams]], [[John Locke]], and [[Derek Parfit]]. The format of associating different philosophical positions with different characters in a dialogue recalls [[David Hume]]'s ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.

In the theory of [[Autowave|autowave phenomena]] an '''autowave reverberator''' is an autowave [[vortex]] in a two-dimensional [[Excitable medium|active medium]].&lt;ref group="note" name="P001"/&gt;

A reverberator appears a result of a rupture in the front of a plane autowave. Such a rupture may occur, for example, via collision of the front with a nonexcitable obstacle. In this case, depending on the conditions, either of two phenomena may arise: a ''[[spiral wave]]'', which rotates around the obstacle, or an ''autowave reverberator'' which rotates with its tip free.

== Introduction ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}
The ''reverberator'' was one of the first autowave solutions, researchers found, and, because of this historical context, it remains by nowadays the most studied autowave object.

Up until the late 20th century, the term "''auto-wave reverberator''" was used very active and widely in the scientific literature, written by soviet authors, because of active developing these investigations in [[USSR]] (for more details, see "A brief history of autowave researches" in [[Autowave]]). And, inasmuch as the soviet scientific literature was very often republished in English translation (see e.g.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Yakhno-1979en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Yakhno-1987en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Volobuev-1997en"/&gt;), the term "''autowave reverberator''" became known also in English-speaking countries.

The ''reverberator'' is often confused with another state of the active medium, which is similar to it, - with the ''spiral wave''. Indeed, at a superficial glance, these two autowave solutions look almost identical. Moreover, the situation is further complicated by the fact that the spiral wave may under certain circumstances become the reverberator, and the reverberator may, on the contrary, become the spiral wave!

However, it must be remembered that many features of ''rotating autowaves'' were quite thoroughly studied as long ago as the 1970s,  and already at that time some significant differences in properties of a spiral wave and a reverberator were revealed. Unfortunately, all the detailed  knowledge from those years remains now scattered in different publications of the 1970-1990s, which became little-known now even for the new generations of researchers, not to mention the people that are far from this research topic.  Perhaps, the only book in that it were more or less completely brought together in the form of abstracts basic information about autowaves, known at the time of its publication, remains still the Proceedings „Autowave processes in systems with diffusion“,&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; which was published in 1981 and became already a rare bibliographic edition in nowadays; its content was partially reiterated in another book&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt; in 2009.

The differences between a reverberator and a spiral wave are considered below in detail. But for the beginning it is useful to demonstrate these differences with a simple analogy. Everyone knows well the seasons of a year... Under some conditions, winter can turn into summer, and summer, on the contrary, into winter; and, moreover, these miraculous transformations occur quite regularly! However, though a winter and a summer are similar, for example, in regular alternation of day and night, you cannot think of saying that winter and summer are the same thing, can you? Nearly the same things are with reverberator and spiral waves; and therefore they should not be confused.

It is useful also to keep in mind that it is known now, in addition to the rotating-wave, quite a number of other autowave solutions, and every year the number grows continuously with increasing speed. Because of these causes (or as a result of these events), it was found during the 21st century that many of the conclusions about the properties of autowaves, - which were widely known among readers of the early papers on the subject as well as widely discussed in the press of that time, - unfortunately, proved to be a sort of erroneous hasty generalizations.

== Basic information ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}

=== "Historical" definition ===

{{centered pull quote|An important difference between a reverberator and a spiral wave rotating around the hole, which is similar to reverberator in the form, is that the reverberator is not tied to any structure in the medium. Due to this property, reverberators can appear and disappear at different locations of the medium.

Важным отличием ревербератора от близкой к нему по форме спиральной волны, вращающейся  вокруг отверстия, является то, что ревербератор не привязан к какой-либо структуре в среде. Благодаря этому свойству ревербераторы могут возникать и исчезать в разных местах среды.

|author=(p.20), 1981|source=&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt;}}

=== On the question of terminology  ===

{{centered pull quote|We note here some of the subtleties the established terminology. A ''rotating autowave'' in two-dimensional medium is called by various authors as ''spiral wave'', ''reverberator'', ''rotor'', ''vortex'' or even ''scroll wave''. However, one should take into account that these terms are not functionally interchangeable nevertheless (they are not entire synonyms). Briefly the differences between them are as follows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ordinarily, the term "spiral wave" refers only to the autowaves rotating around a nonexcitable obstacle in the medium that is of sufficiently large size (that is, in this case, such extent, in which the obstacle is small compared with the size of the medium, and is, however, large enough to provide the autowave break). The tip of the spiral wave moves always along the border of the nonexcitable obstacles.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The most important difference between an autowave reverberator and a close to it in the form spiral wave, which rotates around the obstacle, is that the reverberator is not tied to any structure in the medium. Due to this property reverberators can occur in different places of medium, not only in the absence of nonexcitable obstacles, but generally in a completely homogeneous medium (under appropriate initial conditions). In English scientific literature the most similar in meaning is the term "rotor".&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt; However,  we give preference to the term reverberator, although it is now less used (in English literature) than the term "rotor", because it has two advantages being: 1) short enough and 2) not busy with other meaning (while the rotor is  taken already to call [[Rotor (electric)|the moving part of an electric motor]], and, in addition, the term is used in the [[Curl (mathematics)|mathematical theory of the field]]). (...) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the term "autowave vortex", it can be asserted (at a some stretch, which is especially easy for mathematicians) that reverberator is a two-dimensional vortex (and this is plain truth from the point of view of mathematics). For the natural sciences, which are also biophysics as well as modern medicine, two-dimensional objects do not exist in the real world, and therefore one can say only very conditionally about such two-dimensional objects in these sciences, implying that, in the context of the issues discussed, the thickness of the medium does not affect the behaviour of the phenomenon under consideration. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Looking ahead, we say that a ''simple scroll'' is called a three-dimensional vortex that presents identical reverberators at any given time in each section perpendicular to its axis of rotation, and so its behaviour in each of the section is almost identical with behaviour of the reverberator. But this happens only in very limited circumstances, and, in common way, a simple scroll can easily be transformed into more complex objects. Therefore, the substitution of the terms "scroll" and "reverberator" in this case is completely irrelevant, and the term "scroll", in opinion of the authors, is appropriate to use only for description of rotating autowaves in three-dimensional media — i.e., in the cases where you can not neglect the effects caused by the thickness of the medium.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In light of these terminological remarks, we will write "'''2D-autovortex'''" ("'''two-dimensional autowave vortex'''") in the subsequent text, speaking generally about the autowaves rotating in two-dimensional medium ;  and particularly, describing behaviour of 2D-autovortex, we will use the appropriate clarifying term - for example, "spiral wave" or "reverberator".

Отметим здесь же некоторые тонкости установившейся терминологии. Разные авторы называют вращающиеся в двумерной среде автоволны ''спиральными волнами'' (''spiral wave''), ''ревербераторами'', ''роторами'' (''rotor''), ''автоволновыми вихрями'' (''vortex'') или даже ''свитками'' (''scroll wave''). Однако следует учитывать, что всё же эти термины не являются полными синонимами. Вкратце различия между ними следующие. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Термином «спиральная волна» обозначают обычно лишь  автоволны, вращающиеся вокруг невозбудимого препятствия в среде достаточно большой протяженности, то есть в данном случае такой протяженности, в которой препятствие является малым по сравнению с размером среды, однако достаточно большим, чтобы обеспечивать разрыв автоволны. В спиральной волне ее кончик движется по границе невозбудимого препятствия. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Важнейшим отличием ревербератора от близкой к нему по форме спиральной волны, вращающейся вокруг отверстия, является то, что ревербератор не привязан к какой-либо структуре в среде. Благодаря этому свойству ревербераторы могут возникать в разных местах среды, причем не только при отсутствии невозбудимых препятствия, но и вообще в полностью однородной среде (при подходящих начальных условиях). В англоязычной литературе наиболее близким по смыслу является термин «ротор». Однако в  своем изложении мы будем предпочтение отдавать термину ревербератор: хотя оно в настоящее время менее используется, чем термин «ротор», однако имеет два преимущества, одновременно являясь и достаточно коротким, и не занятым другими значениями (в то время как ротором, например, принято уже называть движущуюся часть электромотора, и, кроме того, этот термин широко используется в математической теории поля). (...) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Что же до терминов «автоволновой вихрь», то с некоторыми натяжками (особенно легкими для математиков) можно утверждать, что ревербератор — это двумерный вихрь (и это с точки зрения математики абсолютно верно). Для естественных наук, каковыми являются и биофизика, и современная медицина, двумерных объектов не существует в реальном мире, и поэтому о двумерных объектах в этих науках говорят лишь очень условно, подразумевая при этом лишь то, что в контексте обсуждаемых вопросов толщина среды не сказывается на поведении рассматриваемого или изучаемого явления. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Забегая вперед, скажем, что свитком ('''''простым свитком''''') называют такой трехмерный вихрь,  который в каждый момент времени в сечении, перпендикулярном своей оси вращения, являет собой идентичные ревербераторы, и поэтому его поведение в каждом из сечений практически тождественно поведению ревербератора. Но это происходит лишь в очень ограниченных условиях, а в остальных случаях простой свиток трансформируется в более сложные объекты. Поэтому в данном случае подмена терминов «свиток» и «ревербератор» является совершенно неуместной, и термин «свиток», по мнению авторов, уместно использовать лишь при описании автоволн, вращающихся в трехмерных средах, — то есть в тех случаях, когда нельзя пренебречь эффектами, обусловленными толщиной рассматриваемой среды. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
В свете этих терминологических замечаний мы в дальнейшем изложении, говоря вообще о вращающихся в двумерной среде  автоволнах, будем использовать сокращение '''''2D-автовихрь''''' ('''''двумерный автоволновой вихрь'''''), а в частных случаях описания поведения 2D-автовихря мы будем использовать соответствующий уточняющий термин: например, «спиральная волна» или «ревербератор».

== Types of  reverberator behaviour ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}

=== The "classical" regimes ===

[[File:Diagram of reverberator evolution in FitzHugh-Nagumo model.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of the evolution of reverberator for FitzHugh-Nagumo model (in accordance with the results of A.&amp;nbsp;Winfrey&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt;): ''β'' — parameter of the model that corresponds to the excitation threshold, ''ε'' — parameter of the model that corresponds to  relaxation ability of the active medium, ''∂P'' — "the propagation boundary", out which any autowave propagation is impossible, ''∂R'' — the boundary of existence of the reverberators (the "rotor boundary"), ''∂M'' —  the meander boundary, ''∂C'' — the boundary of hyper-meander.]]

Various autowave regimes, such as ''plane waves''  or ''spiral waves'' can exist in an active media, but only under certain conditions on the medium properties. Using the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model|FitzhHugh-Nagumo model]] for a generic active medium, [[Arthur Winfree|Winfree]]&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Winfree-1991"/&gt; constructed a diagram  depicting the regions of parameter space in which the principle phenomena may be observed. Such diagrams are a common way of presenting the different dynamical regimes observed in both experimental and theoretical settings. They are sometimes called ''flower gardens'' since the paths traced by autowave tips may often resemble the petals of a flower. A flower garden for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is shown to the right. It contains: the line ''∂P'', which confines the range of the model parameters under which impulses can propagate through one-dimensional medium, and ''plane autowaves'' can spread in the two-dimensional medium; the "rotor boundary" ''∂R'', which confines the range of the parameters under which there can be the reverberators rotating around fixed cores (i.e. performing uniform circular rotation); the ''meander'' boundary ''∂M'' and the ''hyper-meander'' boundary ''∂C'', which confine the areas where two-period and more complex (possibly chaotic) regimes can exist. Rotating autowaves with large cores exist only in the areas with parameters close to the boundary ''∂R''.

Similar autowave regimes were also obtained for the other models — Beeler-Reuter model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Efimov-1995"/&gt; Barkley model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Belinec-1977"/&gt; Aliev-Panfilov model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Aliev-1996"/&gt; Fenton-Karma model etc.

It was also shown&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kokoz-1973"/&gt; that these simple autowave regimes should be common to all active media because a system of [[differential equation]]s of any complexity, which describes this or that active medium, can be always simplified to two equations.

In the simplest case without drift (i.e., the regime of ''uniform circular rotation''), the tip of a reverberator rotates around a fixed point along the circumference of a certain radius (the circular motion of the ''tip of the reverberator''). The autowave  cannot penetrate into the circle bounded by this circumference. As far as it approaches the centre of the reverberator rotation, the amplitude of the excitation pulse is reduced, and, at a relatively low excitability of the medium there is a region of finite size in the centre of  reverberator, where the amplitude of the excitation pulse is zero (recall that we speak now about a homogeneous medium, for each point of which its properties are the same). This area of low amplitude in the centre of the reverberator is usually called ''the core of the reverberator''. The existence of such a region in the center of reverberator seems, at first glance, quite incomprehensible, as it borders all the time with the excited sites. A detailed investigation of this phenomenon showed&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; that resting area in the centre of reverberator remains of its normal excitability, and the existence of a quiescent region in the centre of the reverberator is related to the phenomenon of the critical curvature. In the case of "infinite" homogeneous medium, the core radius and the speed of the rotor rotation are determined only by the properties of the medium itself, rather than the initial conditions. The shape of the front of the rotating spiral wave in the distance from the centre of rotation is close to the evolvent of the circumference - the boundaries of its core.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Wiener-1946"/&gt;  The certain  size of the core of the reverberator is conditioned by that the excitation wave, which circulates in a closed path, should completely fit in this path without bumping into its own [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory tail]].

As the ''critical size'' of the reverberator, it is understood as the minimum size of the homogeneous medium in which the reverberator can exist indefinitely. For assessing the critical size of the reverberator one uses sometimes the size of its core, assuming that adjacent to the core region of the medium should be sufficient for the existence of sustainable re-entry. However, the quantitative study of the dependence of the reverberator  behaviour on conductivity  of rapid transmembrane current (that characterize the excitability of the medium), it was found&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; that the critical size of the reverberator  and the size its core are its different characteristics, and the critical size of the reverberator is much greater, in many cases, than the size of its core (i.e. reverberator dies, even the case, if its core fits easily in the boundaries of the medium and its drift is absent)

=== Regimes of induced drift  ===

At meander and hyper-meander, the displacement of the center of autowave rotation (i.e. its drift) is influenced by the forces generated by the very same rotating autowave.

However, in result of  the scientific study of rotating autowaves was also identified a number of external conditions that force reverberator drift. It can be, for example, the heterogeneity of the active medium by any parameter. Perhaps, it is  the works Biktasheva,&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-1995"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2010"/&gt; where different types of the reverberator drift are currently represented the most completely (although there are other authors&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Davydov-1988"/&gt; who are also involved in the study of drift of the autowave reverberator).

In particular, Biktashev offers&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Biktashev-2007"/&gt; to distinguish the following types of reverberator drift in the active medium:
# Resonant drift.
# Inhomogeneity induced drift.
# Anisotropy induced drift.
# Boundary induced drift  (see also&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Biktashev-1989en"/&gt;).
# Interaction of spirals.
# High frequency induced drift.

Note that even for such a simple question, what should be called a drift of autowaves, and what should  not be called, there is still no agreement among researchers. Some researchers (mostly mathematicians) tends to consider as reverberator drift only those of its displacement, which occur under the influence of external events (and this view is determined exactly by the peculiarity of the mathematical approach to the study of autowaves). The other part of the researchers did not find significant differences between the spontaneous displacement of reverberator in result of  the events generated by it itself, and its displacement as a result of external influences; and therefore these researchers tend to believe that meander and hyper-meander are also variants of drift, namely ''the spontaneous drift of the reverberator''. There was not debate on this question of terminology in the scientific literature, but it can be found easily these features of describing the same phenomena by the different authors.

=== Autowave lacet  ===

In the numerical study of reverberator using the Aliev-Panfilov model,&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Aliev-1996"/&gt; the phenomenon of [[bifurcation memory]] was revealed, when the reverberator changes spontaneously its behaviour from ''meander'' to ''uniform circular rotation''; this new regime was named ''autowave lacet''.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Elkin-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Ardashev-2009p06"/&gt;

Briefly, spontaneous deceleration of the reverberator drift by the forces generated by the reverberator itself occurs during the autowave lacet, with the velocity of its drift decreasing gradually down to zero in the result. The regime meander thus degenerates into a simple uniform circular rotation. As already mentioned, this unusual process is related to phenomenon of bifurcation memory.

When autowave lacet was discovered, the first question arose: Does the ''meander'' exist ever or the halt of the reverberator  drift can be observed every time in all the cases, which are called meander, if the observation will be sufficiently long? The comparative quantitative analysis of the drift velocity of reverberator in the regimes of ''meander'' and ''lacet'' revealed a clear difference between these two types of evolution of the reverberator: while the drift velocity quickly goes to a stationary value during meander,  a steady decrease in the drift velocity of the vortex can be observed during the lacet, in which can be clearly identified the phase of slow deceleration and phase of rapid deceleration of the drift velocity.

The revealing of autowave lacet may be important for [[cardiology]]. It is known that reverberators show remarkable stability of their properties, they behave "at their discretion", and their behaviour can significantly affect only the events that occur near the tip of reverberator. The fact that the behaviour of the reverberator can significantly affected only by the events that occur near its core, results, for example, in the fact that, at a meeting with reverberator nonexcitability heterogeneity (e.g. small myocardial scar), the tip of the rotating wave "sticks" to this heterogeneity, and reverberator begins to rotate around the stationary nonexcitability obstacles. The transition  from  polymorphic to monomorphic [[tachycardia]]  is observed on the [[ECG]] in such cases. This phenomenon is called the "''anchoring''" of spiral wave.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Kukushkin-2004"/&gt;
However, it was found in the simulations that spontaneous transition of polymorphic tachycardia in monomorphic one can be observed also on the ECG during the autowave lacet&lt;!-- (see. Fig.) --&gt;; in other words, the ''lacet'' may be another mechanism of transformation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in a monomorphic.&lt;ref group="A:" name="a-Moskalenko-2007b"/&gt; Thus, the autowave theory predicts the existence of special type of ventricular arrhythmias, conditionally called "lacetic",&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Moskalenko-2012"/&gt; which cardiologists do not still distinguish in diagnostics.

== The reasons for distinguishing between variants of rotating autowaves  ==
{{confusing|section|date=March 2014}}
Recall that from 1970th&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; to the present time it is customary to distinguish three variants rotating autowaves: 
# wave in the ring, 
# spiral wave,
# autowave reverberator.

[[File:Сritical size of reverberator.png|thumb|300px|left|Critical size of reverberator (reconstructed on the base of data of {{nobr|A.M. Percov}} and {{nobr|A.V. Panfilov}},&lt;ref group="B:" name="b-Gorky-1981"/&gt; obtained for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model). '''A'''.&amp;nbsp;The relation between the critical size and the size of the core. '''Б'''.&amp;nbsp;The dependence of the critical sizes of the reverberator and the autowave running around the ring on the conduction of rapid current ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; . '''В'''.&amp;nbsp;Dependence of the period of the reverberator and the running around the ring on ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. '''Г'''.&amp;nbsp;Dependence of the refractoriness of the medium(''R'') on ''g''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; for the plane wave (curvature ''k''=0.83) and the plane wave.]]
Dimensions of the core of reverberator is usually less than the minimal critical size of the circular path of circulation, which is associated with the phenomenon of ''critical curvature''. In addition, the refractory period appears to be longer for the waves with non-zero curvature (reverberator and spiral wave) and begins to increase with decreasing the excitability of the medium  before the refractory period for the plane waves (in the case of circular rotation). These and other significant differences between the reverberator and the circular rotation of excitation wave make us distinguish these two regimes of re-entry.

The figure shows the differences found in the behavior of the plane autowave circulating in the ring and reverberator. You can see that, in the same local characteristics of the excitable medium (excitability, refractoriness, etc., given by the nonlinear member), there are significant quantitative differences between dependencies of the reverberator characteristics and characteristics  of the regime of one-dimensional rotation of impulse, although respective dependencies match qualitatively.
&lt;!-- 
More details about the causes of distinguishing between these three variants will be described in section "[[Автоволны/Вращающаяся автоволна|Вращающаяся автоволна]]"

&lt;ref name="P001"&gt;Negligent use of special terms even in scientific literature during the forty years of research of the autowave processes (approximately 1970 to 2010) resulted in rather a lot of confusion in the usage of the names of the rotating autowave.

The US carries out 46% of global research and development (R&amp;D) in life sciences, making it the world leader.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=United States of America. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Stewart|first=Shannon|last2=Springs|first2=Stacy|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal expenditure on biomedical research ==
Life sciences accounted for 51% of federal research expenditure in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
[[File:R&amp;D budget by US agency, 1994–2014.svg|thumb|Research budget by US agency, 1994-2014. Source: Figure 5.4 from UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, based on data from the American Association for the Advancement of Science]]
The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) are considered the government's flagship biomedical research funding organization. Between 2004 and 2014, NIH funding remained relatively flat and was not increased to keep pace with [[inflation]].  The NIH budget peaked at circa $35 billion per year from 2003 to 2005 and was around $30 billion in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Government efforts to increase allocations to research between 2013 and 2016 were often thwarted by the congressional austerity drive, with Congress withholding approval of the federal government's budget several times. Over this period, the executive’s priorities were taken forward largely thanks to collaboration between the government, industry and the non-profit sector. This was particularly true for the health sector which, like climate change, was a priority for the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Towards more targeted therapies ==
A key policy objective of the Obama administration was to develop more targeted therapies while reducing the time and cost of drug development. Developing a new drug takes well over a decade and has a failure rate of more than 95%. The most expensive failures happen in late phase clinical trials. It is thus vital to pinpoint the right biological targets (genes, proteins and other molecules) early in the process, so as to design more rational drugs and better tailored therapies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[21st Century Cures Act]] was signed into law on 13 December 2016, a year after the release of the [[UNESCO Science Report]]. The report had predicted that, ‘were the bill to pass into law, it would alter the way in which clinical trials are conducted by allowing new and adaptive trial designs that factor in personalized parameters, such as biomarkers and genetics. This provision has proven controversial, with doctors cautioning that overreliance on biomarkers as a measure of efficacy can be misleading, as they may not always reflect improved patient outcomes'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another government scheme hopes to increase the number of new diagnostics and therapies for patients, while reducing the time and cost of developing these. At the launch of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in February 2014, NIH director Francis S. Collins stated that 'Currently, we are investing too much money and time in avenues that don't pan out, while patients and their families wait'. Over the five years to 2019, this public−private partnership is developing up to five pilot projects for three common but difficult-to-treat diseases: Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 (adult onset) diabetes and the autoimmune disorders of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Proportional allocation of federal R&amp;D spending in the USA by discipline, 1994–2011.svg|thumb|Proportional allocation of federal research funding in the US by discipline, 1994-2011 (%). Source: Figure 5.5 from UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, based on data from American Association for Advancement of Science]]
The partnership involves the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), as well as 10 major biopharmaceutical companies and several non-profit organizations like the Alzheimer's Association. The industrial partners are [[AbbVie Inc.|Abbvie]] (US), [[Biogen]] (US), [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] (US), [[GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd|GlaxoSmithKline]] (UK), [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] (US), Lilly (US), [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] (US), [[Pfizer]] (US), [[Sanofi]] (France) and [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]] (Japan).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Laboratories share samples, such as blood or brain tissue from deceased patients, to identify biomarkers. They also participate in NIH clinical trials. One critical component is that industry partners have agreed to make the data and analyses arising from the partnership accessible to the broad biomedical community. They will not use any discoveries to develop their own drug until these findings have been made public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In April 2013, the government announced another public−private partnership, this time to implement its [[BRAIN Initiative|Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologie]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (BRAIN) Initiative. The goal of this project is to leverage genetic, optical and imaging technologies to map individual neurons and complex circuits in the brain, eventually leading to a more complete understanding of this organ’s structure and function. By 2015, the BRAIN Initiative had ‘obtained commitments of over US$ 300 million in resources from federal agencies ([[National Institutes of Health]], [[Food and Drug Administration]], National Science Foundation, etc.), industry (National Photonics Initiative, [[General Electric]], [[Google]], GlaxoSmithKline, etc.) and philanthropy (foundations and universities)’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Precision Medicine Initiative]] has been another government priority. Defined as delivering the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, precision medicine tailors treatments to patients based on their unique physiology, biochemistry and genetics. In his 2016 budget request, the president asked for US$215 million to be shared by the NIH, [[National Cancer Institute]] and FDA to fund the Precision Medicine Initiative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Research spending by biopharmaceutical companies ==

In 2013, US pharmaceutical companies spent $40 billion on R&amp;D inside the US and nearly another $11 billion on R&amp;D abroad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 2005 and 2010, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies increased their investment in precision medicine by roughly 75% and a further increase of 53% is projected by 2015. Between 12% and 50% of the products in their drug development pipelines are related to personalized medicine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer R&amp;D tax credits to particular industries and companies. Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years.  According to a survey by the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making décisions about investing in R&amp;D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Tech CFOs don't really trust R&amp;D tax credit, survey says|last=Chasan|first=Emily|date=2012|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, six US biopharmaceutical companies figured in the global Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&amp;D. The following have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included for the first time in 2013 and Amazon in 2014, which is why the online store does not figure in the Top 50 for 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in venture capital investment ==
The National Venture Capital Association has reported that, in 2014, venture capital investment in the life sciences was at its highest level since 2008: in biotechnology, $6.0 billion was invested in 470 deals and, in life sciences overall, $8.6 billion in 789 deals (including biotechnology and medical devices). Two-thirds (68%) of the investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, it was the software industry which invested in the greatest number of deals overall: 1 799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1 005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the State of California, which alone concentrates 28% of US research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Total investment in venture capital amounted to US$48.3 billion in 2014, for 4 356 deals. This represented ‘an increase of 61% in dollars and a 4% increase in deals over the prior year,’ reported the National Venture Capital Association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that venture capital investment in the United States had fully recovered by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science, Technology and Innovation Outlook|last=|first=|publisher=Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development|year=2014|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a number of pharmaceutical companies have made strategic mergers to relocate their headquarters overseas to gain a tax advantage, including Medtronic and Endo International. Pfizer's own attempt to take over the British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca aborted in 2014 after Pfizer admitted plans to cut research spending in the combined company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in prescription drug prices ==
One policy concern for the [[Obama administration]] has been the steep rise in the price of prescription drugs, in a country where these prices are largely unregulated. From January 2008 to December 2014, the price of commonly used branded drugs increased by a little over 127%, even as the price of commonly prescribed generic drugs decreased by almost 63%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014, spending on prescription drugs hit $374 billion. This increase in spending was fuelled by the costly new drugs on the market for treating hepatitis C ($11 billion), rather than by the millions of newly insured Americans under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010 ($1 billion). About 31% of this spending went on specialty drug therapies to treat inflammatory conditions, multiple sclerosis, oncology, hepatitis C and HIV, etc., and 6.4% on traditional therapies to treat diabetes, high cholesterol, pain, high blood pressure and heart disease, asthma, depression and so on’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fuelling the 'astronomic' rise in consumer prices for prescription drugs has been a new trend in the US, the acquisition of pharmaceuticals through licensing, purchase, a merger or acquisition. In the first half of 2014, the value of mergers and acquisitions by pharmaceutical companies totalled US$317.4 billion and, in the first quarter of 2015, the drug industry accounted for a little more than 45% of all US mergers and acquisitions. Several pharmaceutical companies have made strategic mergers in recent years to relocate their headquarters overseas to order to gain a tax advantage. Pfizer’s own attempt to take over the British pharmaceutical company [[AstraZeneca|Astrazeneca]] aborted in 2014, after [[Pfizer]] admitted plans to cut research spending in the combined company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Bringing down the cost to consumers ==
The [[Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act)|Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act]] was signed into law in March 2010 to encourage the development of generic drug competition as a cost containment measure for high-priced pharmaceuticals. Part of the government’s signatory [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], it has created a pathway for fast-track licensure for biological products that are shown to be ‘biosimilar’ to, or ‘interchangeable’ with, an approved biological product. One inspiration for the act was that the patents for many biologic drugs will expire in the next decade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although the act was passed in 2010, the first biosimilar was only approved in the US by the FDA in 2015: Zarxio, made by [[Sandoz Laboratories|Sandoz]]. Zarxio is a biosimilar of the cancer drug Neupogen, which boosts the patient’s white blood cells to ward off infection. In September 2015, a US court ruled that the Neupogen brand manufacturer Amgen could not block Zarxio from being sold in the US. Neupogen costs about US$3 000 per chemotherapy cycle; Zarxio hit the US market on 3 September 2015 at a 15% discount.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Europe, the same drug had been approved as early as 2008 and has been safely marketed there ever since. The lag in development of an approval pathway in the US has been criticized for impeding access to biological therapies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The true cost savings from the use of biosimilars is difficult to assess. A 2014 study by the [[Rand Institute]] estimates a range of US$13–66 billion in savings over 2014–2024, depending upon the level of competition and FDA regulatory approval patterns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike generics, biosimilars cannot be approved on the basis of minimal and inexpensive tests to prove bioequivalence. Since biological drugs are complex, heterogeneous products derived from living cells, they can only be shown to be highly similar to the appropriate reference product and therefore require demonstration that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety and efficacy. The extent to which clinical trials are required will largely determine the cost of development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Orphan drugs ==
Orphan diseases affect fewer than 200 000 Americans each year. Since the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983|Orphan Drug Act]] of 1983, over 400 drugs and biologic products for rare diseases have been designated by the Food and Drug Administration (as of 2015), 260 alone in 2013. In 2014, sales of the top 10 [[Orphan drug|orphan drugs]] in the US amounted to US$18.32 billion; by 2020, orphan drugs sales worldwide are projected to account for 19% (US$ 28.16 billion) of the total US$ 176 billion in prescription drug spending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, orphan drugs cost about 19.1 times more than non-orphan drugs (on an annual basis) in 2014, at an average annual cost per patient of US$ 137 782. Some are concerned that the incentives given to pharmaceutical companies to develop orphan drugs by the FDA’s orphan drug products programme is taking the companies’ attention away from developing drugs that will benefit more of the population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Medical devices ==
There are more than 6500 medical device companies in the US, more than 80% of which have fewer than 50 employees. According to the [[United States Department of Commerce|US Department of Commerce]], the market size of the medical device industry in the US is expected to reach US$ 133 billion by 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Observers foresee the further development and emergence of wearable health monitoring devices, telediagnosis and telemonitoring, robotics, biosensors, three-dimensional (3D) printing, new ''in vitro'' diagnostic tests and mobile apps that enable users to monitor their health and related behaviour better.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in pharmaceutical exports and patents ==
[[File:High-tech exports from the USA as a world share, 2008–2013.svg|thumb|High-tech exports from the United States of America as a world share, 2008-2013, data from Comtrade database, taken from UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 5.10]]
Until 2010, the United States of America was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals. Since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods. The United States has lost its world leadership for high-tech goods. Even computing and communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Byl's loop''' is an [[artificial life]]form similar in concept to [[Langton's loops|Langton's loop]]. It is a two-dimensional, 5-neighbor [[cellular automaton]] with 6 states per cell, and was developed in 1989 by John Byl, from the Department of Mathematical Sciences of [[Trinity Western University]].

== Details ==
The Byl's loop was developed just a few years after Langton's simplification of [[Codd's automaton]], which produced a simpler automaton that would reproduce itself in 151 time-steps. John Byl simplified Langton's automaton further, with an even smaller automaton that reproduced in just 25 time-steps. Byl's automaton consisted of an array of 12 chips — of which 4 or 5 could be counted as the instruction tape — and 43 transition rules, while Langton's device consisted of some 10×15 chips, including an instruction tape of 33 chips, plus some 190 transition rules.

Essentially, the simplification consisted in using fewer cellular states (6 as compared with Langton's 8) and a smaller replicating loop (12 cells as compared with Langton's 86).

'''Death anxiety''' is [[anxiety]] caused by thoughts of [[death]]. One source defines death anxiety as a "feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to [[being|'be']]".&lt;ref&gt;Definition by Farley G.: Death anxiety. National Health Service UK. 2010, found in: {{cite journal|url= http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |title= How death anxiety impacts nurses' caring for patients at the end of life: a review of literature |vauthors= Peters L, Cant R, Payne S, O'Connor M, McDermott F, Hood K, Morphet J, Shimoinaba K |journal= Open Nurs J. |year= 2013 |volume= 7 |pages= 14–21 |doi= 10.2174/1874434601307010014 |pmid= 23400515 |pmc= 3565229 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172346/http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |archivedate= 2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also referred to as '''thanatophobia''' (fear of death), death anxiety is distinguished from [[necrophobia]], which is a specific fear of dead or dying people and/or things (i.e., fear of others who are dead or dying, not of one's own death or dying).&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there is anxiety caused by death-recent  [[Mental status examination#Thought content|thought-content]],&lt;ref&gt;H.

==Types==
[[Robert Langs]] distinguishes three types of death anxiety:&lt;ref name=escp&gt;http://www.escp.org/death_anxiety.html; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predatory death anxiety ===
Predatory death anxiety arises from the fear of being harmed.&lt;ref&gt;Langs, R. Three Forms of Death Anxiety. Retrieved from http://www.escp.org/death_anxiety.html; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most basic and oldest&lt;ref&gt;Castano.Leidner.Bonacossa.Nikkah.Perrulli.Spencer.Humphrey."Ideology, Fear of Death and Death Anxiety "Political Psychology.2011.p615&lt;/ref&gt; form of death anxiety, with its origins in the first [[unicellular organism]]s’ set of adaptive resources. Unicellular organisms have receptors that have evolved to react to external dangers, along with self-protective, responsive mechanisms made to increase the likelihood of survival in the face of chemical and physical forms of attack or danger.&lt;ref&gt;Castano.Leidner.Bonacossa.Nikkah.Perrulli.Spencer.Humphrey."Ideology, Fear of Death and Death Anxiety "Political Psychology.2011.p616&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, predatory death anxiety is evoked by a variety of danger situations that put one at risk or threaten one's survival.&lt;ref name="Castano 2011. p617"&gt;Castano.Leidner.Bonacossa.Nikkah.Perrulli.Spencer.Humphrey."Ideology, Fear of Death and Death Anxiety "Political Psychology.2011.p617&lt;/ref&gt; These traumas may be physical, psychological, or both.&lt;ref name="Castano 2011. p617"/&gt; Predatory death anxiety mobilizes an individual's adaptive resources and leads to a [[fight-or-flight response]]: active efforts to combat the danger or attempts to escape the threatening situation.&lt;ref name="Castano 2011. p617"/&gt;

=== Predation or predator death anxiety ===
Predation or predator death anxiety is a form that arises when an individual harms another, physically and/or mentally. This form of death anxiety is often accompanied by unconscious guilt.&lt;ref name=langs&gt;Langs, R. (1997). Death Anxiety and Clinical Practice. London: Karnac Books; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; This guilt, in turn, motivates and encourages a variety of self-made decisions and actions by the perpetrator of harm to others.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald.Hilgendorf. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3950021 Death imagery and death anxiety.] Journal of Clinical Psychology. 1996. p88&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existential death anxiety ===
Existential death anxiety stems from the basic knowledge that human life must end. Existential death anxiety is known to be the most powerful form.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling. "Identity and Death Anxiety"Central Michigan University.1985.p10&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that language has created the basis for existential death anxiety through communicative and behavioral changes.&lt;ref name="langs"/&gt; Other factors include an awareness of the distinction between self and others, a full sense of personal identity, and the ability to anticipate the future.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"&gt;Sterling. "Identity and Death Anxiety"Central Michigan University.1985.p11&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Awareness of human mortality arose some 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p13"&gt;Simin."War, death anxiety, death depression and religion" California School of Professional Psychology.1996.p13&lt;/ref&gt; In that extremely short span of evolutionary time, humans have fashioned a single basic mechanism through which they deal with the existential death anxieties this awareness has evoked—denial.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p13"/&gt; Denial is effected through a wide range of mental mechanisms and physical actions, many of which go unrecognized.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"/&gt; While denial can be adaptive in limited use, excessive use is more common and is emotionally costly.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"/&gt; Denial is the root of such diverse actions as breaking rules, violating frames and boundaries, manic celebrations, directing violence against others, attempting to gain extraordinary wealth and power—and more.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p14"&gt;Simin."War, death anxiety, death depression and religion" California School of Professional Psychology.1996.p14&lt;/ref&gt; These pursuits are often activated by a death-related trauma, and while they may lead to constructive actions, more often than not, they lead to actions that are damaging to self and others.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p14"/&gt;

== Theories==

===Thanatophobia===

[[Sigmund Freud]] hypothesized that people express a fear of death, called thanatophobia. He said he saw this as a disguise for a deeper source of concern. It was not actually death that people feared, because in Freud's view nobody believes in their own death. The unconscious does not deal with the passage of time or with negations, which does not calculate amount of time left in one's life. Furthermore, that which one does fear cannot be death itself, because one has never died. People who express death-related fears, actually are trying to deal with unresolved childhood conflicts that they cannot come to terms with or express emotion towards.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald&gt;http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106|title=The Truth about Death and Dying|first1=Karen|last1=Meyers|first2=Robert N.|last2=Golden|first3=Fred|last3=Peterson|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9781438125817}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Thanatophobia is made from the Greek figure of death known as [[Thanatos]].

===Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair===

Developmental psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] formulated the psychosocial theory that explained that people progress through a series of crises as they grow older. The theory also envelops the concept that once an individual reaches the latest stages of life, they reach the level he titled as "[[ego integrity]]". Ego Integrity is when one comes to terms with their life and accepts it. It was also suggested that when a person reaches the stage of late adulthood they become involved in a thorough overview of their life to date. When one can find meaning or purpose in their life, they have reached the integrity stage. In opposition, when an individual views their life as a series of failed and missed opportunities, then they do not reach the ego integrity stage. Elders that have attained this stage of ego integrity are believed to exhibit less of an influence from death anxiety.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

===Terror management theory===
{{main|Terror management theory}}
[[Ernest Becker]] based this theory on existential views which turned death anxiety theories towards a new dimension. It said that death anxiety is not only real, but also it is people's most profound source of concern. He explained the anxiety as so intense that it can generate fears and phobias of everyday life—Fears of being alone or in a confined space. Based on the theory, many of people's daily behavior consist of attempts to deny death and to keep their anxiety under strict regulation.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_etal97tm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As an individual develops [[mortality salience]], i.e. becomes more aware of the inevitability of death, they will instinctively try to suppress it out of fear. The method of suppression usually leads to mainstreaming towards cultural beliefs, leaning for external support rather than treading alone. This behavior may range from simply thinking about death to severe phobias and desperate actions.&lt;ref&gt;Castano, Emanuele. (2011). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00822.x/abstract Ideology, Fear of Death, and Death Anxiety] 603.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and adjustment hypotheses===
{{main|Death and adjustment hypotheses}}
[[Mohammad Samir Hossain]] postulated the [[Death and adjustment hypotheses]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} With the declaration of the hypotheses, two things were postulated. The first part of the hypotheses theorizes that death should not be considered the end of existence. The next segment states the belief that the immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

===Being, time and Dasein===

[[Martin Heidegger]], the German philosopher, on the one hand showed death as something conclusively determined, in the sense that it is inevitable for every human being, while on the other hand, it unmasks its indeterminate nature via the truth that one never knows when or how death is going to come. Heidegger does not engage in speculation about whether being after death is possible. He argues that all human existence is embedded in time: past, present, future, and when considering the future, we encounter the notion of death. This then creates angst. Angst can create a clear understanding in one that death is a possible mode of existence, which Heidegger described as “clearing”. Thus, angst can lead to a freedom about existence, but only if we can stop denying our mortality (as expressed in Heidegger's terminology as “stop denying being-for-death”).&lt;ref name=concepts&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010. Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment. Illness, Crisis and Loss, Vol 18. No 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning management theory===

[[Paul T. P. Wong]]'s work on the meaning management theory&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2008). Meaning-management theory and death acceptance. In A. Tomer, G. T. Eliason, &amp; P. T. P. Wong (Eds.), ''Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes'' (pp. 65-87). New York, NY: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that human reactions to death are complex, multifaceted and dynamic.&lt;ref name=concepts/&gt; His “Death Attitude Profile” identifies three types of death acceptances as Neutral, Approach, and Escape acceptances.&lt;ref&gt;Gesser, G., Wong, P. T. P., &amp; Reker, G. T. (1987-88). Death attitudes across the life span. The development and validation of the Death Attitude Profile (DAP). ''Omega, 2'', 113-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P., Reker, G. T., &amp; Gesser, G. (1994). Death Attitude Profile – Revised: A multidimensional measure of attitudes toward death (DAP-R). In R. A. Neimeyer (Ed.), ''Death anxiety handbook: Research, instrumentation, and application'' (pp. 121-148). Washington, DC: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from acceptances, his work also represents different aspects of the meaning of death fear that are rooted in the bases of death anxiety. The ten meanings he proposes are finality, uncertainty, annihilation, ultimate loss, life flow disruption, leaving the loved ones, pain and loneliness, prematurity and violence of death, failure of life work completion, judgment and retribution centered.

===Other theories===

Other theories on death anxiety were introduced in the late part of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p570"&gt;Langs." Adaptive Insights into Death Anxiety" The Psychoanalytic Review.2003.p570&lt;/ref&gt; The existential approach, with theorists such as [[Rollo May]] and [[Viktor Frankl]], views an individual's personality as being governed by the continuous choices and decisions in relation to the realities of life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L. "Psychology" 2011. Chapter 12, page 488.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is the ''regret theory'' which was introduced by Adrian Tomer and Grafton Eliason.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"&gt;Langs. [http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/prev.90.4.565.23914?journalCode=prev Adaptive Insights into Death Anxiety.] The Psychoanalytic Review.2003.p575&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the theory is to target the way people evaluate the quality and/or worth of their lives.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt; The possibility of death usually makes people more anxious if they feel that they have not and cannot accomplish any positive task in the life that they are living.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt;  Research has tried to unveil the factors that might influence the amount of anxiety people experience in life.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt;

===Personal meanings of death===
{{See also|Meaning-making}}
Humans develop meanings and associate them with objects and events in their environment, provoking certain emotions within an individual. People tend to develop personal meanings of death which could accordingly be negative or positive for the individual. If they are positive, then the consequences of those meanings can be comforting (for example, ideas of a rippling effect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yalom |first=Irvin D. |authorlink=Irvin D. Yalom |date=2008 |chapter=Rippling |title=Staring at the sun: overcoming the terror of death |location=San Francisco |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |isbn=9780787996680 |oclc=155715164 |pages=83–92 |quote=Each of us creates—often without our conscious intent or knowledge—concentric circles of influence that may affect others for years, even generations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; left on those still alive). If negative they can cause emotional turmoil. Depending on the certain meaning one has associated with death, the consequences will vary accordingly whether they are negative or positive meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cicirelli |first=Victor G. |date=November 1998 |title=Personal meanings of death in relation to fear of death |journal=[[Death Studies]] |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=713–733 |doi=10.1080/074811898201236 |pmid=10346699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religiosity's effect===

The thought of death causes a different degree of anxiety for different individuals, depending on many factors.

A 2012 study involving Christian and Muslim college students from the US, Turkey, and Malaysia found that their religiosity was positively correlated with an increased fear of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = L. | last2 = Wahab | first2 = E. A. | last3 = Ratnasingan | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1080/13674676.2011.652606 | title = Religiosity and fear of death: A three‐nation comparison | journal = Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 179 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found a strong sense of religion in a person's life can be related to a lower sense of anxiety towards death.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;Wen, Y. (2010). Religiosity and death anxiety. The Journal of Human Resource and Adult Learning, 6(2), 31-37. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/867401301&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been no association discovered between religiosity and death anxiety,&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; it has also been shown that death anxiety tends to be lower in individuals who regularly attend religious meetings or gatherings.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; On a recent study, one hundred and sixty-five church participants have been asked to fill out the "Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale, the Revised Death Anxiety Scale" and the results were analyzed using factor analyses, Pearson correlation, and linear and quadratic regression. All found an inverse relationship between intrinsic religious motivation and death anxiety. In short, the more religious you are, the less anxious you are about death because you may associate death with another beginning that is promised through many religions.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; The study also found that gender did not have an effect on religiosity and total death anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Wen, Ya-Hui. The Journal of Human Resource and Adult Learning6. 2 (Dec 2010): 31-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==

The earliest documentation of the fear of death has been found in children as young as age 5.&lt;ref name="maya"&gt;Griffiths, M. (2007). Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children. The Journal of Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 12 (4), 525-535. Retrieved from http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/13591045/v12i0004/525_duafodiyc&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological measures and reaction times were used to measure fear of death in young children. Recent studies that assess fear of death in children use questionnaire rating scales.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt; There are many tests to study this including The Death Anxiety Scale for Children (DASC) developed by Schell and Seefeldt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slaughter|first=Virginia|author2=Griffiths|title=Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|date=October 2007|volume=12 | issue = 4|pages=525–535|doi=10.1177/1359104507080980|pmid=18095535}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the most common version of this test is the revised Fear Survey Schedule for Children (FSSC-R).&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The FSSC-R describes specific fearful stimuli and children are asked to rate the degree to which the scenario/item makes them anxious or fearful.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The most recent version of the FSSC-R presents the scenarios in a pictorial form to children as young as 4. It is called the Koala Fear Questionnaire (KFQ).&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The fear studies show that children's fears can be grouped into five categories. One of these categories is death and danger.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  This response was found amongst children age 4 to 6 on the KFQ, and from age 7 to 10.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  Death is the most commonly feared item and remains the most commonly feared item throughout adolescence.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;

A study of 90 children, aged 4–8, done by Virginia Slaughter and Maya Griffiths showed that a more mature understanding of the biological concept of death was correlated to a decreased fear of death. This may suggest that it is helpful to teach children about death (in a biological sense), in order to alleviate the fear.&lt;ref&gt;Slaughter, V., Griffiths, M. (2007). Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children. Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry. 12 (4) pg 525-535&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship between adult attachment and death anxiety ==
There has been much literature that supports the existence of a correlation between one's state of coping skills, mental health, emotions and cognitive reactions to stressful events, and one's ability to regulate affect concerning one's death anxiety. A series of tests determined that significantly high levels of death anxiety tend to occur in close relationships with an intimate partner (more so amongst females than males).&lt;ref&gt;Beggs, J. R.The relationship between adult attachment style and death anxiety as related to a romantic partner. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 5231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexes ==
The connection between death anxiety and one's sex appears to be strong.  Studies show that females tend to have more death anxiety than males.  Thorson and Powell (1984) did a study to investigate this connection, and they sampled men and women from 16 years of age to over 60.  The Death Anxiety Scale showed higher mean scores for women than for men.  Moreover, researchers believe that age and culture could be major influences in why women score higher on death anxiety scales than men.&lt;ref name="Harrawood, L. K. 2008"&gt;Harrawood, L. K., White, L. J., &amp; Benshoff, J. J. (2008). Death Anxiety in a National Sample of United States Funeral Directors and Its Relationship with Death Exposure, Age, and Sex. Omega: Journal of Death &amp; Dying, 58(2), 129-146. {{DOI|10.2190/OM.58.2.c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the evolutionary period, a basic method was created to deal with death anxiety and also as a means of dealing with loss.&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew.Dawson."Death anexiety:State or Trait" Journal od Clinical Psychology.1979.pg158&lt;/ref&gt; Denial is used when memories or feelings are too painful to accept and are often rejected.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"&gt;Donald.Charles. "Death Anxiety and Mental Ability" Essence: Issues in the Study of Ageing, Dying and Death. 1979.p85&lt;/ref&gt; By maintaining that the event never happened, rather than accepting it, allows an individual more time to work through the inevitable pain.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; When a loved one dies in a family, denial is often implemented as a means to come to grips with the reality that the person is gone.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; Closer families often deal with death better than when coping individually.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; As society and families drift apart so does the time spent bereaving those who have died, which in turn leads to negative emotion and negativity towards death.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; Women, who are the child bearers and are often the ones who look after children hold greater concerns about death due to their caring role within the family.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"&gt;Langs. "Death Anxiety and the Emotion-processing Mind" Psychoanalytic Psychology .2004.p43&lt;/ref&gt;  It is this common role of women that leads to greater death anxiety as it emphasize the ‘importance to live’ for her offspring.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"/&gt; Although it is common knowledge that all living creatures die, many people do not accept their own mortality, preferring not to accept that death is inevitable, and that they will one day die.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"/&gt;

==Age ==
It is during the years of young adulthood (20 to 40 years of age) that death anxiety most often begins to become prevalent.  However, during the next phase of life, the middle age adult years (40–64 years of age), death anxiety peaks at its highest levels when in comparison to all other age ranges throughout the lifespan.  Surprisingly, levels of death anxiety then slump off in the old age years of adulthood (65 years of age and older).  This is in contrast with most people's expectations, especially regarding all of the negative connotations younger adults have about the elderly and the aging process (Kurlychek &amp; Trenner, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trenner|title=Accuracy of perception and attitude: An intergenerational investigation|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skill|year=1982|volume=54|issue=1|pages=271–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring death anxiety ==

There are many ways to measure death anxiety and fear.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"&gt;Tomer.Eliason."Toward a comprehensive model of death anxiety" Death Stuides.1996.p353&lt;/ref&gt; Katenbaum and Aeinsberg (1972) devised three propositions for this measurement.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; From this start, the ideologies about death anxiety have been able to be recorded and their attributes listed.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; Methods such as imagery tasks to simple questionnaires and apperception tests such as the [[Stroop effect#Stroop test|Stroop test]] enable psychologists to adequately determine if a person is under stress due to death anxiety or suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt;
The Lester attitude death scale was developed in 1966 but not published until 1991 until its validity was proven.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; By measuring the general attitude towards death and also the inconsistencies with death attitudes, participants are scaled to their favorable value towards death.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt;

'''''Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime''''' is a 2007 book written by [[Aubrey de Grey]], a biomedical gerontologist, with his research assistant Michael Rae. ''Ending Aging'' describes de Grey's proposal for eliminating aging as a cause of debilitation and death in humans, and restoring the body to an [[Indefinite lifespan|indefinitely]] youthful state, a project plan that he calls the "[[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence]]", or "SENS". De Grey argues that defeating aging is feasible, possibly within a few decades, and he outlines steps that can be taken to hasten the development of  [[regenerative medicine]] treatments that will save lives.

[[Image:Youth and Time 1901.jpg|thumb|''Youth and Time'', [[John William Godward]], 1901]]

'''Eternal youth''' is the concept of human physical [[immortality]] free of [[ageing]]. The [[youth]] referred to is usually meant to be in contrast to the depredations of aging, rather than a specific age of the human lifespan. Achieving eternal youth so far remains beyond the capabilities of scientific technology. However, much research is being conducted in the sciences of genetics which may allow manipulation of the aging process in the future.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Eternal youth is common in mythology, and is a popular theme in [[fiction]].

==Religion and mythology==
Eternal youth is a characteristic of the inhabitants of [[Paradise]] in [[Abrahamic religion]]s.

The Hindus believe that the Vedic and the post-Vedic rishis have attained immortality, which implies the ability to change one's body's age or even shape at will. These are some of the [[siddha]]s in [[Yoga]]. [[Markandeya]] is said to always stay at the age of 16.

The difference between eternal life and the more specific eternal youth is a recurrent theme in [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. The [[mytheme]] of requesting the boon of immortality from a god, but forgetting to ask for eternal youth appears in the story of [[Tithonus]]. A similar theme is found in [[Ovid]] regarding the [[Cumaean Sibyl]].

In [[Norse mythology]], [[Iðunn]] is described as providing the gods [[apple]]s that grant them eternal youthfulness in the 13th century [[Prose Edda]].

==Telomeres==
An individual's [[DNA]] plays a role in the aging process. Aging begins even before birth, as soon as cells start to die and need to be replaced. On the ends of each [[chromosome]] are repetitive sequences of DNA, [[telomeres]], that protect the chromosome from joining with other chromosomes, and have several key roles. One of these roles is to regulate cell division by allowing each cell division to remove a small amount of genetic code. The amount removed varies by the cell type being replicated. The gradual degradation of the telomeres restricts cell division to 40-60 times, also known as the [[Hayflick limit]]. Once this limit has been reached, more cells die than can be replaced in the same time span. Thus, soon after this limit is reached the organism dies. The importance of telomeres is now clearly evident: lengthen the telomeres, lengthen the life.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;

However, a study of the comparative biology of mammalian telomeres indicated that telomere length correlates inversely, rather than directly, with lifespan, and concluded that the contribution of telomere length to lifespan remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gomes NM, Ryder OA, Houck ML, Charter SJ, Walker W, Forsyth NR, Austad SN, Venditti C, Pagel M, Shay JW, Wright WE | year = 2011 | title = Comparative biology of mammalian telomeres: hypotheses on ancestral states and the roles of telomeres in longevity determination | url = | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 761–768 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2011.00718.x | pmid = 21518243 | pmc=3387546}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, telomere shortening does not occur with age in a some postmitotic tissues, such as in the rat brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cherif H, Tarry JL, Ozanne SE, Hales CN | year = 2003 | title = Ageing and telomeres: a study into organ- and gender-specific telomere shortening | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 1576–1583 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkg208 | pmid = 12595567 | pmc=149817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In humans, skeletal muscle telomere lengths remain stable from ages 23–74.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Renault V, Thornell LE, Eriksson PO, Butler-Browne G, Mouly V | year = 2003 | title = Regenerative potential of human skeletal muscle during aging | url = | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 132–139 | pmid = 12882343 | doi=10.1046/j.1474-9728.2002.00017.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In baboon skeletal muscle, that consists of fully differentiated post-mitotic cells, less than 3% of myonuclei contain damaged telomeres and this percentage does not increase with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeyapalan JC, Ferreira M, Sedivy JM, Herbig U | year = 2007 | title = Accumulation of senescent cells in mitotic tissue of aging primates | journal = Mech Ageing Dev | volume = 128 | issue = 1| pages = 36–44 | doi = 10.1016/j.mad.2006.11.008 | pmid = 17116315 | pmc=3654105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus telomere shortening does not appear to be a major factor in the aging of the differentiated cells of brain or skeletal muscle.

Studies have shown that 90 percent of [[cancer]] cells contain large amounts of an [[enzyme]] called [[telomerase]].&lt;ref name="Damm"/&gt; Telomerase is an enzyme that replenishes the worn away telomeres by adding bases to the ends and thus renewing the telomere. A cancer cell has in essence turned on the telomerase gene, and this allows them to have an unlimited amount of divisions without the telomeres wearing away. Other kinds of cells that can surpass the Hayflick limit are [[stem cells]], [[hair follicles]], and [[germ cells]].&lt;ref name="Hornsby"/&gt; This is because they contain raised amounts of telomerase.

==Therapy==
The idea that the human body can be repaired in old age to a more youthful state has gathered significant commercial interest over the past few years, including by companies such as [[Human Longevity Inc]], [[Google Calico]], and [[Elysium Health]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In addition to these larger companies, many startups are currently developing therapeutics to tackle the 'ageing problem' using therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Esthechoc: Scientists invent 'anti-ageing' chocolate|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/esthechoc-scientists-invent-antiageing-chocolate-10060075.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Startup Alkahest inks a $50M deal for anti-aging R&amp;D|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/startup-alkahest-inks-50m-deal-anti-aging-rd/2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 a new class of drugs [[senolytics]] was announced (currently in pre-clinical development) designed specifically to combat the underlying biological causes of frailty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New "Senolytic" Drugs Can Dramatically Increase Healthy Lifespan|url=http://io9.com/new-senolytic-drugs-can-dramatically-increase-healthy-1690827868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
The "loss of youth" or ageing process is responsible for increasing the risk of individuals to many diseases including [[cancer]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Alzheimer's]], and others. As a result, in recent years, many high net worth individuals have donated large amounts of their money towards initiatives towards scientific research into the ageing process itself or therapies to slow or reverse the ageing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Benjamin|title=An MIT Scientist Claims That This Pill Is the Fountain of Youth|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/08/is-elysium-healths-basis-the-fountain-of-youth.html|work=New York Magazine|date=August 23, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These people include [[Peter Thiel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Billionaire Peter Thiel embarks on anti-aging crusade|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/08/billionaire-peter-thiel-may-want-to-live-forever/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aubrey de Grey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=terview with Aubrey de Grey, PhD|url=http://www.lef.org/magazine/2013/7/Interview-with-Aubrey-de-Grey-PhD/Page-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Ellison]], [[Sergey Brin]], [[Dmitry Itskov]], [[Paul Gallen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=These Tech Billionaires Are Determined to Buy Their Way Out of Death |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tech-billionaires-immortality-2013-8?IR=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mark Zuckerberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-02-zuckerberg-brin-life.html|title=Zuckerberg, Brin join forces to extend life|date=February 20, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow humans to extend or maintain their youth indefinitely.

The '''human condition''' is "the characteristics, key events, and situations which compose the essentials of [[human]] existence, such as birth, growth, emotionality, aspiration, conflict, and mortality".&lt;ref&gt;"[[wikt:human condition|human condition]]" entry at [[Wiktionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very broad topic which has been and continues to be pondered and analyzed from many perspectives, including those of [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[art]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], and [[biology]].

As a [[terminology|literary term]], "the human condition" is typically used in the context of ambiguous subjects such as the [[meaning of life]] or [[morality|moral concerns]].&lt;ref name="lit"&gt;[http://learn.lexiconic.net/humancondition.htm The human condition in literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some perspectives==

Each [[major religious groups|major religion]] has definitive beliefs regarding the human condition. For example, [[Buddhism]] [[Four Noble Truths|teaches]] that life is a perpetual cycle of [[dukkha|suffering]], death, and rebirth from which humans can be liberated via the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Meanwhile, [[Christianity]] teaches that humans are born in a [[original sin|sinful condition]] and are [[Christian views on hell|doomed]] in the [[afterlife]] unless they receive [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] through [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

Philosophers have provided many perspectives. An influential ancient view was that of the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' in which [[Plato]] explored the question "what is justice?" and postulated that it is not primarily a matter among individuals but of [[society]] as a whole, prompting him to devise a [[utopia]]. Two thousand years later [[René Descartes]] declared "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]" because he believed the human mind, particularly its faculty of [[reason]], to be the primary determiner of [[truth]]; for this he is often credited as the father of modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&amp;pg=PA511 ''History of Western Philosophy''] pp.511, 516–7&lt;/ref&gt; One such modern school, [[existentialism]], attempts to reconcile an individual's sense of disorientation and confusion in a universe believed to be [[absurdism|absurd]].

Many works of literature provide perspective on the human condition.&lt;ref name="lit"/&gt; One famous example is [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] monologue "[[All the world's a stage]]" that pensively summarizes seven phases of human life.

Psychology has many theories, such as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] and the notion of [[identity crisis]]. It also has various methods, e.g. the [[logotherapy]] developed by [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor [[Viktor Frankl]] to discover and affirm human meaning. Another method, [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], has become a widespread treatment for [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driessen Ellen |author2=Hollon Steven D | year = 2010 | title = Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Mood Disorders: Efficacy, Moderators and Mediators | url = | journal = Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 537–55 | doi=10.1016/j.psc.2010.04.005 | pmid=20599132 | pmc=2933381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since 1859, when [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', the biological [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[evolution]] has been significant. The theory posits that the human [[species]] is related to all others, living and extinct, and that [[natural selection]] is the primary survival factor. This has provided a basis for new beliefs, e.g. [[social Darwinism]], and for new [[technology]], e.g. [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gladki A, Kaczanowski S, Szczesny P, Zielenkiewicz P |title=The evolutionary rate of antibacterial drug targets |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=14 |pages=36 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23374913 |url= |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-14-36 |pmc=3598507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the term==

Notable uses of the term "the human condition" include  [[André Malraux]]'s novel ''[[Man's Fate]]'', [[René Magritte]]'s painting ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La Condition Humaine]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]]'s [[The Human Condition (book)|political philosophy]], and [[Masaki Kobayashi]]'s [[The Human Condition (film series)|film trilogy]].

'''Human spaceflight''' (also referred to as '''crewed spaceflight''' or '''manned spaceflight''') is [[spaceflight|space travel]] with a [[Astronaut|crew]] or passengers aboard the [[spacecraft]]. Spacecraft carrying people may be operated directly, by human crew, or it may be either [[telerobotic|remotely operated]] from ground stations on Earth or be [[autonomous robot|autonomous]], able to carry out a specific mission with no human involvement.

The [[Vostok 1|first human spaceflight]] was launched by the [[USSR|Soviet Union]] on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April 1961]] as a part of the [[Vostok program]], with [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] aboard. Humans have been continuously present in space for {{age in years and days|2 November 2000|sep=and}} on the [[International Space Station]].  All early human spaceflight was crewed, where at least some of the passengers acted to carry out tasks of piloting or operating the spacecraft.  After 2015, several human-capable spacecraft are being explicitly designed with the ability to operate autonomously.

Since the retirement of the US [[Space Shuttle]] in 2011, only [[Russia]] and [[China]] have maintained human spaceflight capability with the [[Soyuz program]] and [[Shenzhou program]]. Currently, all expeditions to the International Space Station use [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] vehicles, which remain attached to the station to allow quick return if needed. The United States is developing commercial crew transportation to facilitate domestic access to ISS and low Earth orbit, as well as the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] vehicle for beyond-low Earth orbit applications.

While spaceflight has typically been a government-directed activity, commercial spaceflight has gradually been taking on a greater role. The first private human spaceflight took place on 21 June 2004, when [[SpaceShipOne]] conducted a suborbital flight, and a [[List of private spaceflight companies|number of non-governmental companies]] have been working to develop a [[space tourism]] industry. NASA has also played a role to stimulate [[private spaceflight]] through programs such as [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services]] (COTS) and [[Commercial Crew Development]] (CCDev). With its 2011 budget proposals released in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/news/budget/index.html |title=FY 2011 Budget |work=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221004158/http://www.nasa.gov/news/budget/index.html |archivedate=21 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Obama administration moved towards a model where commercial companies would supply NASA with transportation services of both people and cargo transport to low Earth orbit. The vehicles used for these services could then serve both NASA and potential commercial customers. Commercial resupply of ISS began two years after the retirement of the Shuttle, and commercial crew launches could begin by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Hails Success of Commercial Space Program|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-hails-success-of-commercial-space-program/index.html#.U9DmePldV8G|website=nasa.gov|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:As11-40-5886.jpg|thumb|right|[[Neil Armstrong]] became the first human to land and walk on the Moon, July 1969.]]
Human spaceflight capability was first developed during the [[Cold War]] between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), which developed the first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] rockets to deliver [[nuclear weapon]]s. These rockets were large enough to be adapted to carry the first [[artificial satellite]]s into [[low Earth orbit]]. After the first satellites were launched in 1957 and 1958, the US worked on [[Project Mercury]] to launch men singly into orbit, while the USSR secretly pursued the [[Vostok programme|Vostok program]] to accomplish the same thing. The USSR launched the first human in space, [[Yuri Gagarin]], into a single orbit in [[Vostok 1]] on a [[Vostok 3KA]] rocket, on 12 April 1961. The US launched its first [[astronaut]], [[Alan Shepard]], on a suborbital flight aboard ''[[Freedom 7]]'' on a [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Mercury-Redstone rocket]], on 5 May 1961. Unlike Gagarin, Shepard manually [[attitude control|controlled his spacecraft's attitude]], and landed inside it. The first American in orbit was [[John Glenn]] aboard ''[[Friendship 7]]'', launched 20 February 1962 on a [[Atlas LV-3B|Mercury-Atlas rocket]]. The USSR launched five more cosmonauts in Vostok [[space capsule|capsule]]s, including the first woman in space, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] aboard [[Vostok 6]] on 16 June 1963. The US launched a total of two astronauts in suborbital flight and four into orbit through 1963.

US President [[John F. Kennedy]] raised the stakes of the Space Race by setting the goal of landing a man on the [[Moon]] and returning him safely by the end of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Kennedy, John F. |date=25 May 1961 |title=Special Message to Congress on Urgent National Needs |medium=Motion picture (excerpt) |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/xzw1gaeeTES6khED14P1Iw.aspx |accessdate=1 August 2013 |publisher=John F.

Meanwhile, the USSR remained silent about their intentions to send humans to the Moon, and proceeded to stretch the limits of their single-pilot Vostok capsule into a two- or three-person [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] capsule to compete with Gemini. They were able to launch two orbital flights in 1964 and 1965 and achieved the first [[spacewalk]], made by [[Alexei Leonov]] on [[Voskhod 2]] on 8 March 1965. But Voskhod did not have Gemini's capability to maneuver in orbit, and the program was terminated. The US Gemini flights did not accomplish the first spacewalk, but overcame the early Soviet lead by performing several spacewalks and solving the problem of astronaut fatigue caused by overcoming the lack of gravity, demonstrating up to two weeks endurance in a human spaceflight, and the first [[space rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking]]s of spacecraft.

The US succeeded in developing the [[Saturn V]] rocket necessary to send the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon, and sent [[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]], and [[William Anders]] into 10 orbits around the Moon in [[Apollo 8]] in December 1968. In July 1969, [[Apollo 11]] accomplished Kennedy's goal by landing [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] on the Moon 21 July and returning them safely on 24 July along with Command Module pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]]. A total of six Apollo missions landed 12 men to walk on the Moon through 1972, half of which drove [[Lunar Roving Vehicle|electric powered vehicles]] on the surface. The crew of [[Apollo 13]], Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]], survived a catastrophic in-flight spacecraft failure and returned to Earth safely without landing on the Moon.

[[File:Soyuz 7K-OK(A) drawing.svg|thumb|Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft, 1967]]
Meanwhile, the USSR secretly pursued [[Soviet manned lunar programs|human lunar orbiting and landing programs]]. They successfully developed the three-person [[Soyuz spacecraft]] for use in the lunar programs, but failed to develop the [[N1 (rocket)|N1 rocket]] necessary for a human landing, and discontinued the lunar programs in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Challenge To Apollo The Soviet Union and The Space Race, 1945–1974|last = Siddiqi|first = Asif|page = 832|publisher = NASA|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?Ntk=all&amp;Ntx=mode%20matchall&amp;Ntt=SP-2000-4408}}&lt;/ref&gt; On losing the Moon race, they concentrated on the development of [[space station]]s, using the Soyuz as a ferry to take cosmonauts to and from the stations. They started with a series of [[Salyut program|Salyut]] sortie stations from 1971 to 1986.

After the Apollo program, the US launched the [[Skylab]] sortie space station in 1973, manning it for 171 days with three crews aboard Apollo spacecraft. President [[Richard Nixon]] and Soviet Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]] negotiated an easing of relations known as [[détente]], an easing of Cold War tensions. As part of this, they negotiated the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]], in which an Apollo spacecraft carrying a special docking adapter module rendezvoused and docked with [[Soyuz 19]] in 1975. The American and Russian crews shook hands in space, but the purpose of the flight was purely diplomatic and symbolic.

[[File:North American Rockwell P333.jpg|thumb|right|Space Shuttle as originally designed by North American Rockwell, 1969]]
Nixon appointed his Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] to head a Space Task Group in 1969 to recommend follow-on human spaceflight programs after Apollo. The group proposed an ambitious [[Space Transportation System]] based on a [[Space Shuttle design process|reusable Space Shuttle]] which consisted of a winged, internally fueled orbiter stage burning liquid hydrogen, launched by a similar, but larger [[RP-1|kerosene]]-fueled booster stage, each equipped with airbreathing jet engines for powered return to a runway at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] launch site. Other components of the system included a permanent modular space station, reusable [[space tug]] and [[NERVA|nuclear]] interplanetary ferry, leading to a [[human mission to Mars|human expedition to Mars]] as early as 1986, or as late as 2000, depending on the level of funding allocated. However, Nixon knew the American political climate would not support Congressional funding for such an ambition, and killed proposals for all but the Shuttle, possibly to be followed by the space station. [[Space Shuttle|Plans for the Shuttle were scaled back]] to reduce development risk, cost, and time, replacing the piloted flyback booster with two reusable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s, and the smaller orbiter would use an expendable [[Space Shuttle external tank|external propellant tank]] to feed its hydrogen-fueled [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engine]]s. The orbiter would have to make unpowered landings.

[[File:Space Shuttle Atlantis landing at KSC following STS-122 (crop).jpg|thumb|The Space Shuttle orbiter, as built]]
The two nations continued to compete rather than cooperate in space, as the US turned to developing the Space Shuttle and planning the space station, dubbed ''[[Space Station Freedom|Freedom]]''. 
The USSR launched three [[Almaz]] military sortie stations from 1973 to 1977, disguised as Salyuts. They followed Salyut with the development of ''[[Mir]]'', the first modular, semi-permanent space station, the construction of which took place from 1986 to 1996. ''Mir'' orbited at an altitude of {{convert|354|km|nmi|abbr=off|sp=us}}, at a 51.6° inclination. It was occupied for 4,592 days, and made a controlled reentry in 2001.

[[File:Buran on An-225 (Le Bourget 1989) (cropped).JPEG|thumb|Buran Orbiter 1K1 at [[Le Bourget]] airshow, 1989]]
The Space Shuttle started flying in 1981, but the US Congress failed to approve sufficient funds to make ''Freedom'' a reality. A fleet of four shuttles was built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. A fifth shuttle, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built to replace ''Challenger'', which was destroyed in [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|an accident during launch]] that killed 7 astronauts on 28 January 1986. Twenty-two Shuttle flights carried a [[European Space Agency]] sortie space station called [[Spacelab]] in the payload bay from 1983 to 1998.&lt;ref name=StoryShuttle&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of the Space Shuttle |author=David Michael Harland |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] Praxis |date=2004 |page=444 |isbn=978-1-85233-793-3 |authorlink=David M. Harland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USSR copied the reusable [[Space Shuttle orbiter]], which it called ''[[Buran programme|Buran]]''. It was designed to be launched into orbit by the expendable [[Energia]] rocket, and capable of robotic orbital flight and landing. Unlike the US Shuttle, ''Buran'' had no main rocket engines, but like the Shuttle used its orbital maneuvering engines to perform its final orbital insertion. A single unmanned orbital test flight was successfully made in November 1988. A second test flight was planned by 1993, but the program was cancelled due to lack of funding and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Two more orbiters were never completed, and the first one was destroyed in a hangar roof collapse in May 2002.

=== US / Russian cooperation ===
[[File:International Space Station after undocking of STS-132.jpg|thumb|right|International Space Station, assembled in orbit by US and Russia]]
The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought an end to the Cold War and opened the door to true cooperation between the US and Russia. The Soviet Soyuz and Mir programs were taken over by the Russian Federal Space Agency, now known as the [[Roscosmos State Corporation]]. The [[Shuttle-Mir Program]] included American Space Shuttles visiting the ''Mir'' space station, Russian cosmonauts flying on the Shuttle, and an American astronaut flying aboard a Soyuz spacecraft for long-duration expeditions aboard ''Mir''.

In 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] secured Russia's cooperation in converting the planned Space Station ''Freedom'' into the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). Construction of the station began in 1998. The station orbits at an altitude of {{convert|409|km|nmi|sp=us}} and an inclination of 51.65°.

The Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 after 135 orbital flights, several of which helped assemble, supply, and crew the ISS. ''Columbia'' was destroyed in [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|another accident during reentry]], which killed 7 astronauts on 1 February 2003.

=== China ===
After Russia's launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] intended to place a Chinese satellite in orbit by 1959 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the [[China#People's Republic of China (1949–present)|People's Republic of China]] (PRC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2007/10/16/15/33/09.htm|title =赵九章与中国卫星 |publisher= [[中国科学院]]|date=16 October 2007|accessdate=3 July 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080314030932/http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2007/10/16/15/33/09.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, China did not successfully launch its first satellite until 24 April 1970. Mao and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] decided on 14 July 1967, that the PRC should not be left behind, and started China's own human spaceflight program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.tom.com/1121/1122/2005916-250955.html |title=首批航天员19人胜出 为后来积累了宝贵的经验 |publisher=雷霆万钧 |date=16 September 2005 |accessdate=24 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222024152/http://tech.tom.com/1121/1122/2005916-250955.html |archivedate=22 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt, the [[Shuguang spacecraft]] copied from the US Gemini, was cancelled on 13 May 1972.
 
China later designed the [[Shenzhou (spacecraft)|Shenzhou spacecraft]] resembling the Russian Soyuz, and became the third nation to achieve independent human spaceflight capability by launching [[Yang Liwei]] on a 21-hour flight aboard [[Shenzhou 5]] on 15 October 2003. China launched the [[Tiangong-1]] space station on 29 September 2011, and two sortie missions to it: [[Shenzhou 9]] 16–29 June 2012, with China's first female astronaut [[Liu Yang (astronaut)|Liu Yang]]; and [[Shenzhou 10]], 13–26 June 2013. The station was retired on 21 March 2016 and remains in a {{convert|363|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off|adj=on}}, 42.77° inclination orbit.

=== Abandoned programs of other nations ===
The [[European Space Agency]] began development in 1987 of the [[Hermes (spacecraft)|Hermes]] [[spaceplane]], to be launched on the [[Ariane 5]] expendable launch vehicle. The project was cancelled in 1992, when it became clear that neither cost nor performance goals could be achieved. No Hermes shuttles were ever built.

Japan began development in the 1980s of the [[HOPE-X]] experimental spaceplane, to be launched on its [[H-IIA]] expendable launch vehicle. A string of failures in 1998 led to funding reduction, and the project's cancellation in 2003.

=== United States post-Space Shuttle gap ===
[[File:Ares I-X launch 08.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The launch of Ares I prototype, [[Ares I-X]]
on 28 October 2009]]
Under the Bush administration, the [[Constellation Program]] included plans for retiring the Shuttle program and replacing it with the capability for spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit. In the [[2011 United States federal budget]], the Obama administration cancelled Constellation for being over budget and behind schedule while not innovating and investing in critical new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_space_thewritestuff/2008/11/congressional-w.html Congressional watchdog finds NASA’s new rocket is in trouble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129102151/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_space_thewritestuff/2008/11/congressional-w.html |date=29 November 2011 }}.

The period between the retirement of the shuttle in 2011 and the initial operational capability of new systems in 2017, similar to the gap between the end of [[Apollo program|Apollo]] in 1975 and the [[STS-1|first space shuttle flight]] in 1981, is referred to by a presidential Blue Ribbon Committee as the U.S. human spaceflight gap.&lt;ref&gt;Klamper, Amy (8 September 2009) [http://www.space.com/7255-white-house-panel-spells-human-spaceflight-options-nasa.html White House Panel Spells Out Human Spaceflight Options for NASA].

=== Commercial private spaceflight ===

Since the early 2000s, a variety of [[private spaceflight]] ventures have been undertaken. Several of the companies, including [[Blue Origin]], [[SpaceX]], [[Virgin Galactic]], and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation|Sierra Nevada]] have explicit plans to advance human spaceflight.  {{asof|2016}}, all four of those companies have development programs underway to fly commercial passengers.

A commercial [[suborbital spaceflight|suborbital]] spacecraft aimed at the [[space tourism]] market is being developed by [[Virgin Galactic]] called [[SpaceshipTwo]], and could reach space around 2018.&lt;ref&gt;David, Leonard.

[[Alexey Leonov]] became the first human to [[Extravehicular activity|leave a spacecraft in orbit]] on March 18, 1965.

[[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]], and [[William Anders]] became the first humans to travel beyond low Earth orbit (LEO)  Dec 21–27, 1968, when the [[Apollo 8]] mission took them to 10 orbits around the Moon and back.

[[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] became the first humans to land on the Moon on July 20, 1969.

[[Svetlana Savitskaya]] became the first woman to [[Extravehicular activity|walk in space]] on July 25, 1984.

[[Sally Ride]] became the first American woman in space in 1983. [[Eileen Collins]] was the first female shuttle pilot, and with shuttle mission [[STS-93]] in 1999 she became the first woman to command a U.S. spacecraft.

The longest single human spaceflight is that of [[Valeri Polyakov]], who left Earth on 8 January 1994, and did not return until 22 March 1995 (a total of 437 days 17 h 58 min 16 s). [[Sergei Krikalyov]] has spent the most time of anyone in space, 803 days, 9 hours, and 39 minutes altogether. The longest period of continuous human presence in space is {{age in years and days|2 November 2000|sep=and}} on the [[International Space Station]], exceeding the previous record of almost 10 years (or 3,634 days) held by [[Mir]], spanning the launch of [[Soyuz TM-8]] on 5 September 1989 to the landing of [[Soyuz TM-29]] on 28 August 1999.

[[Yang Liwei]] became the first human to orbit the Earth as part of the Chinese manned space program on October 15, 2003.

For many years, only the USSR (later [[Russia]]) and the United States had their own astronauts. Citizens of other nations flew in space, beginning with the flight of [[Vladimir Remek]], a [[Czech Republic|Czech]], on a Soviet spacecraft on 2 March 1978, in the [[Interkosmos]] programme. {{As of|2010}}, citizens from 38 nations (including [[space tourism|space tourists]]) have flown in space aboard Soviet, American, Russian, and Chinese spacecraft.

== Space programs ==
Human spaceflight programs have been conducted by the former Soviet Union and current Russian Federation, the United States, the People's Republic of China and by [[private spaceflight]] company [[Scaled Composites]].

===Current programs===
[[Space vehicle]]s are [[spacecraft]] used for transportation between the Earth's surface and outer space, or between locations in outer space. The following space vehicles and [[spaceport]]s are currently used for launching human spaceflights:
* [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz program]] ([[Soviet Union|USSR]]/Russia): spacecraft on [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz launch vehicle]], from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]; 129 orbital flights since 1967, including one in-flight abort which failed to reach orbit, {{As of|alt=as of July 2016|2016|July}} 
* [[Shenzhou program]] (Chinese): spacecraft on [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March launch vehicle]], from [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]]; 5 flights since 2003, {{As of|alt=as of July 2016|2016|July}}

The following [[space stations]] are currently maintained in Earth orbit for human occupation:
* [[International Space Station]] (US and Russia) assembled in orbit: altitude {{convert|409|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}}, 51.65° inclination; crews transported by Soyuz spacecraft
* [[Tiangong-2]] (Chinese): altitude {{convert|392|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}}; crews transported by Shenzhou spacecraft

Numerous private companies attempted human spaceflight programs in an effort to win the $10 million [[Ansari X Prize]]. The first private human spaceflight took place on 21 June 2004, when SpaceShipOne conducted a suborbital flight. SpaceShipOne captured the prize on 4 October 2004, when it accomplished two consecutive flights within one week. [[SpaceShipTwo]], launching from the carrier aircraft [[Scaled Composites WhiteKnightTwo|White Knight Two]], is planned to conduct regular suborbital space tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = SpaceShipOne {{!}} National Air and Space Museum|url = http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A20050459000|website = airandspace.si.edu|access-date = 15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, the only humans in space are those aboard the ISS, whose crew of six spends up to six months at a time in [[low Earth orbit]].

[[NASA]] and [[ESA]] use the term "human spaceflight" to refer to their programs of launching people into space. These endeavors have also been referred to as "manned space missions," though because of gender specificity this is no longer official parlance according to NASA style guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/styleguide.html |title=Style Guide |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planned future programs===
India has declared it will send humans to space on its orbital vehicle ''[[Gaganyaan]]'' by 2022. The [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) began work on this project in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Space Research Organisation ([[ISRO]])[http://www.isro.org/scripts/futureprogramme.aspx Future Programme].&lt;/ref&gt; The objective is to carry a crew of two to [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) and return them safely for a water-landing at a predefined landing zone. The program is proposed to be implemented in defined phases. Currently, the activities are progressing with a focus on the development of critical technologies for subsystems such as the Crew Module (CM), Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), Crew Escape System, etc. The department has initiated activities to study technical and managerial issues related to crewed missions. The program envisages the development of a fully autonomous orbital vehicle carrying 2 or 3 crew members to about 300&amp;nbsp;km low Earth orbit and their safe return.

[[NASA]] is developing a plan to land humans on Mars by the 2030s. The first step in this mission begins sometime during 2020, when NASA plans to send an uncrewed craft into deep space to retrieve an asteroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Journey to Mars Overview|url = http://www.nasa.gov/content/journey-to-mars-overview/|website = NASA|access-date = 17 January 2016|first = Jim|last = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The asteroid will be pushed into the moon’s orbit, and studied by astronauts aboard [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]], NASA’s first human spacecraft in a generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Orion Overview|url = http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/orion/about/index.html|website = NASA|access-date = 17 January 2016|first = Mark|last = Garcia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orion’s crew will return to Earth with samples of the asteroid and their collected data. In addition to broadening America’s space capabilities, this mission will test newly developed technology, such as [[solar electric propulsion]], which uses solar arrays for energy and requires ten times less propellant than the conventional chemical counterpart used for powering space shuttles to orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP)|url = https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/sep/index.html|website = NASA|access-date = 17 January 2016|first = Lee|last = Mohon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other countries and space agencies have announced and begun human spaceflight programs by their own technology, [[Japan]] ([[JAXA]]), [[Iran]] ([[Iranian Space Agency|ISA]]) and [[Malaysia]] ([[Malaysian National Space Agency|MNSA]]).

== Passenger travel via spacecraft ==
A number of spacecraft have been proposed over the decades that might facilitate spaceliner passenger travel.  Somewhat analogous to travel by [[airliner]] after the middle of the 20th century, these vehicles are proposed to [[space transport|transport]] a large number of passengers to destinations in space, or to destinations on Earth which travel through space. To date, none of these concepts have been built, although a few vehicles that carry fewer than 10 persons are currently in the [[test flight|flight testing]] phase of their development process.

One large spaceliner concept currently in early development is the [[SpaceX]] [[BFR (rocket)|BFR]] which, in addition to replacing the [[Falcon 9]] and [[Falcon Heavy]] [[launch vehicle]]s in the legacy Earth-orbit [[Space launch market competition|market]] after 2020, has been proposed by SpaceX for long-distance commercial travel on Earth.  This is to transport people on point-to-point [[suborbital spaceflight|suborbital]] flights between two points on Earth in under one hour, also known as "Earth-to-Earth," and carrying 100+ passengers.&lt;ref name=rollingstone20171115&gt;

Small [[spaceplane]] or small [[space capsule|capsule]] suborbital spacecraft have been under development for the past decade or so and, {{asof|2017|lc=y}}, at least one of each type are under development.  Both [[Virgin Galactic]] and [[Blue Origin]] are in active [[new product development|development]], with the [[SpaceShipTwo]] spaceplane and the [[New Shepard]] capsule, respectively.  Both would carry approximately a half-dozen passengers up to space for a brief time of zero gravity before returning to the same location from where the trip began.

== Safety concerns ==
There are two main sources of hazard in space flight: those due to the ''environment'' of space which make it hostile to the human body, and the potential for ''mechanical'' malfunctions of the equipment required to accomplish space flight.

=== Environmental hazards ===
{{See also| Space habitat|Effect of spaceflight on the human body|Locomotion in Space}}

Planners of human spaceflight missions face a number of safety concerns.

==== Life support ====

===== Microgravity =====
{{See also|Weightlessness}}

[[Image:Space fluid shift.gif|thumb|The effects of microgravity on fluid distribution around the body (greatly exaggerated).]]

Medical data from astronauts in low Earth orbits for long periods, dating back to the 1970s, show several adverse effects of a microgravity environment: loss of [[bone]] density, decreased muscle strength and endurance, postural instability, and reductions in aerobic capacity. Over time these [[deconditioning]] effects can impair astronauts’ performance or increase their risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/Exploration/Advanced/Human/Exercise/ |title=Exploration Systems Human Research Program – Exercise Countermeasures |work=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011052437/http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/Exploration/Advanced/Human/Exercise/ |archivedate=11 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a weightless environment, astronauts put almost no weight on the back [[muscle]]s or leg muscles used for standing up, which causes them to weaken and get smaller. Astronauts can lose up to twenty per cent of their muscle mass on spaceflights lasting five to eleven days. The consequent loss of strength could be a serious problem in case of a landing emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/64249main_ffs_factsheets_hbp_atrophy.pdf|title = NASA Information: Muscle Atrophy|date = |accessdate = 20 November 2015|website = NASA|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon return to Earth from long-duration flights, astronauts are considerably weakened, and are not allowed to drive a car for twenty-one days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Earth Living Is Tough for Astronaut Used to Space|url = http://www.space.com/21413-hadfield-astronaut-health-return-earth.html|website = Space.com|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronauts experiencing weightlessness will often lose their orientation, get [[motion sickness]], and lose their sense of direction as their bodies try to get used to a weightless environment. When they get back to Earth, or any other mass with gravity, they have to readjust to the gravity and may have problems standing up, focusing their gaze, walking and turning. Importantly, those body motor disturbances after changing from different gravities only get worse the longer the exposure to little gravity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3830060&amp;page=1 Watson, T. (2007, November 11). Readjusting to gravity anti-fun for astronauts. ''ABC News.'' Retrieved from https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3830060&amp;page=1]&lt;/ref&gt; These changes will affect operational activities including approach and landing, docking, remote manipulation, and emergencies that may happen while landing. This can be a major roadblock to mission success.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===== Radiation =====

Without proper shielding, the crews of missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) might be at risk from high-energy protons emitted by [[solar flare]]s. [[Lawrence Townsend]] of the University of Tennessee and others have studied [[Solar storm of 1859|the most powerful solar flare ever recorded]]. That flare was seen by the British astronomer [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Richard Carrington]] in September 1859. Radiation doses astronauts would receive from a Carrington-type flare could cause acute radiation sickness and possibly even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142 |title= Superflares could kill unprotected astronauts|work=New Scientist |date=21 March 2005 |first=Stephen |last=Battersby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of radiation, [[galactic cosmic ray]]s, presents further challenges to human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-309-10264-2|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11760 |title=Space Radiation Hazards and the Vision for Space Exploration |publisher=NAP |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also some scientific concern that extended spaceflight might slow down the body’s ability to protect itself against diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1189/jlb.0309167 |title=Could spaceflight-associated immune system weakening preclude the expansion of human presence beyond Earth's orbit|date=2009|last1=Gueguinou|first1=N.|last2=Huin-Schohn|first2=C.|last3=Bascove|first3=M.|last4=Bueb|first4=J.-L.|last5=Tschirhart|first5=E.|last6=Legrand-Frossi|first6=C.|last7=Frippiat|first7=J.-P.|journal=Journal of Leukocyte Biology|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1027–1038|pmid=19690292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the problems are a weakened [[immune system]] and the activation of dormant [[virus]]es in the body. [[Radiation]] can cause both short and long term consequences to the bone marrow stem cells which create the blood and immune systems. Because the interior of a spacecraft is so small, a weakened immune system and more active viruses in the body can lead to a fast spread of infection.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===== Isolation =====

During long missions, astronauts are isolated and confined into small spaces. [[depression (mood)|Depression]], [[cabin fever]] and other psychological problems may impact the crew's safety and mission success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Christopher F.|date=2005-06-01|title=An Operational Approach to Long-Duration Mission Behavioral Health and Performance Factors|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asma/asem/2005/00000076/A00106s1/art00007|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|volume=76|issue=6|pages=B42–B51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronauts may not be able to quickly return to Earth or receive medical supplies, equipment or personnel if a medical emergency occurs. The astronauts may have to rely for long periods on their limited existing resources and medical advice from the ground.

=== Mechanical hazards ===
Space flight requires much higher velocities than ground or air transportation, which in turn requires the use of high [[energy density]] propellants for launch, and the dissipation of large amounts of energy, usually as heat, for safe reentry through the Earth's atmosphere.

==== Launch ====
{{See also| Launch escape system}}
[[File:Sts33-e204.jpg|thumb|There was no practical way for the Space Shuttle ''Challenger'''s crew to safely abort before the vehicle's violent disintegration.]]
Since rockets carry the potential for fire or explosive destruction, [[space capsule]]s generally employ some sort of [[launch escape system]], consisting either of a tower-mounted solid fuel rocket to quickly carry the capsule away from the [[launch vehicle]] (employed on [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]], and [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]]), or else [[ejection seat]]s (employed on [[Vostok spacecraft|Vostok]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]]) to carry astronauts out of the capsule and away for individual parachute landing. The escape tower is discarded at some point before the launch is complete, at a point where an abort can be performed using the spacecraft's engines.

Such a system is not always practical for multiple crew member vehicles (particularly [[spaceplane]]s), depending on location of egress hatch(es). When the single-hatch Vostok capsule was modified to become the 2 or 3-person [[Voskhod (spacecraft)|Voskhod]], the single-cosmonaut ejection seat could not be used, and no escape tower system was added. The two Voskhod flights in 1964 and 1965 avoided launch mishaps. The [[Space Shuttle]] carried ejection seats and escape hatches for its pilot and copilot in early flights, but these could not be used for passengers who sat below the flight deck on later flights, and so were discontinued.

There have only been two in-flight launch aborts of a crewed flight. The first occurred on [[Soyuz 7K-T No.39|Soyuz 18a]] on 5 April 1975. The abort occurred after the launch escape system had been jettisoned, when the launch vehicle's spent second stage failed to separate before the third stage ignited. The vehicle strayed off course, and the crew separated the spacecraft and fired its engines to pull it away from the errant rocket. Both cosmonauts landed safely. The second occurred on 11 October 2018 with the launch of [[Soyuz MS-10]]. Again, both crew members survived. 

In the only use of a launch escape system on a crewed flight, the planned [[Soyuz 7K-ST No. 16L|Soyuz T-10a]] launch on 26 September 1983 was aborted by a launch vehicle fire 90 seconds before liftoff. Both cosmonauts aboard landed safely.

The only crew fatality during launch occurred on 28 January 1986, when the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] broke apart 73 seconds after liftoff, due to failure of a [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] seal which caused separation of the booster and failure of the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank]], resulting in explosion of the fuel. All seven crew members were killed.

==== Reentry and landing ====
{{See also| Atmospheric reentry}}

The single pilot of [[Soyuz 1]], [[Vladimir Komarov]] was killed when his capsule's parachutes failed during an emergency landing on 24 April 1967, causing the capsule to crash.

The crew of seven aboard the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] were killed on reentry after completing a [[STS-107|successful mission in space]] on 1 February 2003. A wing leading edge [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] heat shield had been damaged by a piece of frozen external tank foam insulation which broke off and struck the wing during launch. Hot reentry gasses entered and destroyed the wing structure, leading to breakup of the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter vehicle]].

==== Artificial atmosphere ====
There are two basic choices for an artificial atmosphere: either an Earth-like mixture of oxygen in an inert gas such as nitrogen or helium, or pure oxygen, which can be used at lower than standard atmospheric pressure. A nitrogen-oxygen mixture is used in the International Space Station and Soyuz spacecraft, while low-pressure pure oxygen is commonly used in space suits for [[extravehicular activity]].

Use of a gas mixture carries risk of [[decompression sickness]] (commonly known as "the bends") when transitioning to or from the pure oxygen space suit environment. There have also been instances of injury and fatalities caused by suffocation in the presence of too much nitrogen and not enough oxygen.
* In 1960, [[McDonnell Aircraft]] test pilot G.B. North passed out and was seriously injured when testing a Mercury cabin / spacesuit atmosphere system in a vacuum chamber, due to nitrogen-rich air leaking from the cabin into his space suit feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giblin |first=Kelly A. |date=Spring 1998 |title ='Fire in the Cockpit!' |journal=[[American Heritage of Invention &amp; Technology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |publisher=American Heritage Publishing |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_46.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120153024/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_46.shtml |archivedate=20 November 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This incident led NASA to decide on a pure oxygen atmosphere for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft.
* In 1981, three pad workers were killed by a nitrogen-rich atmosphere in the aft engine compartment of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] at the [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010605212352/http://www-lib.ksc.nasa.gov/lib/chrono.html 1981 KSC Chronology Part 1 – pages 84, 85, 100; Part 2 – pages 181, 194, 195], NASA&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1995, two pad workers were similarly killed by a nitrogen leak in a confined area of the [[Ariane 5]] launch pad at [[Guiana Space Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/Pr_17_1995_p_EN.html "Fatal accident at the Guiana Space Centre"], ''ESA Portal'', 5 May 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

A pure oxygen atmosphere carries risk of fire. The original design of the Apollo spacecraft used pure oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure prior to launch. An electrical fire started in the cabin of [[Apollo 1]] during a ground test at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34]] on 27 January 1967, and spread rapidly. The high pressure (increased even higher by the fire) prevented removal of the [[plug door]] hatch cover in time to rescue the crew. All three, [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger Chaffee]], were killed.&lt;ref name="SP4029"&gt;{{cite book |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |accessdate=12 July 2013 |series=NASA History Series |origyear=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |work=NASA History Division, Office of Policy and Plans |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-16-050631-X |lccn=00061677 |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |chapter=Apollo 1 – The Fire: 27 January 1967 |chapterurl=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_01a_Summary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led NASA to use a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere before launch, and low pressure pure oxygen only in space.

==== Reliability ====
{{See also| Reliability engineering}}
The March 1966 [[Gemini 8]] mission was aborted in orbit when an [[attitude control system]] thruster stuck in the on position, sending the craft into a dangerous spin which threatened the lives of [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[David Scott]]. Armstrong had to shut the control system off and use the reentry control system to stop the spin. The craft made an emergency reentry and the astronauts landed safely. The most probable cause was determined to be an electrical short due to a [[static electricity]] discharge, which caused the thruster to remain powered even when switched off. The control system was modified to put each thruster on its own isolated circuit.

The third lunar landing expedition [[Apollo 13]] in April 1970, was aborted and the lives of the crew, [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]], [[Jack Swigert]] and [[Fred Haise]], were threatened by failure of a [[cryogenic]] [[liquid oxygen]] tank en route to the Moon. The tank burst when electrical power was applied to internal stirring fans in the tank, causing the immediate loss of all of its contents, and also damaging the second tank, causing the loss of its remaining oxygen in a span of 130 minutes. This in turn caused loss of electrical power provided by [[fuel cell]]s to the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command spacecraft]]. The crew managed to return to Earth safely by using the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar landing craft]] as a "life boat". The tank failure was determined to be caused by two mistakes. The tank's drain fitting had been damaged when it was dropped during factory testing. This necessitated use of its internal heaters to boil out the oxygen after a pre-launch test, which in turn damaged the fan wiring's electrical insulation, because the thermostats on the heaters did not meet the required voltage rating due to a vendor miscommunication.

The crew of [[Soyuz 11]] were killed on June 30, 1971 by a combination of mechanical malfunctions: they were [[asphyxia|asphyxiated]] due to cabin decompression following separation of their descent capsule from the service module. A cabin ventilation valve had been jolted open at an altitude of {{convert|168|km|ft}} by the stronger than expected shock of explosive separation bolts which were designed to fire sequentially, but in fact had fired simultaneously. The loss of pressure became fatal within about 30 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch8-2.htm|title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|accessdate=20 October 2007|publisher=NASA|year=1974|author=NASA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823124845/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch8-2.htm|archivedate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis''' ('''HPT axis''' for short, a.k.a. thyroid homeostasis or thyrotropic feedback control) is part of the [[neuroendocrine system]] responsible for the regulation of [[metabolism]].

As its name suggests, it depends upon the [[hypothalamus]], the [[pituitary gland]], and the [[thyroid gland]].

The hypothalamus senses low circulating levels of thyroid hormone (Triiodothyronine (T3) and Thyroxine (T4)) and responds by releasing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). The TRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The TSH, in turn, stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone until levels in the blood return to normal. Thyroid hormone exerts negative feedback control over the hypothalamus as well as anterior pituitary, thus controlling the release of both TRH from hypothalamus and TSH from anterior pituitary gland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dietrich JW, Landgrafe G, Fotiadou EH|title=TSH and Thyrotropic Agonists: Key Actors in Thyroid Homeostasis|year=2012|journal=Journal of Thyroid Research|volume=2012|pages=1–29|doi=10.1155/2012/351864|pmc=3544290|pmid=23365787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|HPA]], [[hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis|HPG]], and HPT axes are three pathways in which the hypothalamus and pituitary direct neuroendocrine function.

==Physiology==
[[File:Thyrotropic feedback control.svg|thumb|200px|left|Thyrotropic feedback control on a more detailed and quantitative level.&lt;ref&gt;References used in detailed figure are found in image article in Commons: [[:File:Thyrotropic feedback control.svg#References|References]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Thyroid homeostasis results from a multi-loop [[Feedback circuit|feedback system]] that is found in virtually all [[higher vertebrates]]. Proper function of thyrotropic feedback control is indispensable for [[Human development (biology)|growth]], [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], [[reproduction]] and [[intelligence]]. Very few animals (e.g. [[axolotl]]s and [[sloth]]s) have impaired thyroid homeostasis that exhibits a very low [[Setpoint (control system)|set-point]] that is assumed to underlie the [[Metabolism|metabolic]] and [[ontogenesis|ontogenetic]] anomalies of these animals.

The pituitary gland secretes [[thyrotropin]] (TSH; Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) that stimulates the thyroid to secrete [[thyroxine]] (T4) and, to a lesser degree, [[triiodothyronine]] (T3). The major portion of T3, however, is produced in peripheral organs, e.g. [[liver]], [[adipose tissue]], [[glia]] and [[skeletal muscle]] by [[deiodination]] from circulating T4. Deiodination is controlled by numerous [[hormone]]s and [[Nervous system|nerval signals]] including TSH, [[vasopressin]] and [[catecholamines]].

Both peripheral thyroid hormones ([[iodothyronine]]s) inhibit thyrotropin secretion from the pituitary ([[negative feedback]]). Consequently, equilibrium concentrations for all hormones are attained.

TSH secretion is also controlled by [[thyrotropin releasing hormone]] (thyroliberin, TRH), whose secretion itself is again suppressed by plasma T4 and T3 in [[cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]] ([[long feedback]], Fekete–Lechan loop).&lt;ref name=LechanFekete2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lechan|first=Ronald M.|author2=Fekete, C|title=Feedback regulation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH): mechanisms for the non-thyroidal illness syndrome|journal=[[Journal of Endocrinological Investigation]]|year=2004|volume=27|issue=6 Suppl|pages=105–19|pmid=15481810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional feedback loops are [[ultrashort feedback|ultrashort feedback control]] of TSH secretion (Brokken-Wiersinga-Prummel loop)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Prummel MF, Brokken LJ, Wiersinga WM |doi=10.1089/thy.2004.14.825|pmid=15588378|title=Ultra short-loop feedback control of thyrotropin secretion|year=2004|journal=Thyroid|volume=14|issue=10|pages=825–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[linear feedback|linear feedback loops]] controlling [[plasma protein]] binding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12952">'''Indefinite lifespan''' (also known as indefinite life extension or bio-indefinite) is a term used in the [[life extension]] movement and [[transhumanism]] to refer to the hypothetical longevity of humans (and other life-forms) under conditions in which [[ageing]] is effectively and completely prevented and treated.  Their lifespans would be "[[Wikt:indefinite|indefinite]]" (that is, they would not be "[[Wikt:immortal|immortal]]"), because protection from the effects of aging on health does not guarantee survival. Such individuals would still be susceptible to [[death]] by disease, [[starvation]], accidents, or deliberate killing, but not death from aging.  Semantically, "indefinite lifespan" is more accurate than "[[immortality]]" which, especially in religious contexts, implies an inability to die.

== Longevity escape velocity ==
[[File:Longevity Escape Velocity.png|thumb|right|380px|“The first 1000-year-old is probably only ~10 years younger than the first 150-year-old”]]
{{main|Longevity escape velocity}}

[[Longevity escape velocity]] is a term used in the [[life extension]] movement.  It is a hypothetical situation in which [[life expectancy]] is being increased faster than time is being expended.  For example, in a given year in which longevity escape velocity would be maintained, technological advances would increase life expectancy more than that year took away by passing by.

==Not immortality==
The terms "[[immortality]]" and "[[eternal youth]]" are often used as synonyms for "indefinite lifespan", but they carry connotations from their other contexts which science has deemed to be impossible. That is, ''immortal'' means "incapable of dying". ''Eternal'' implies guaranteed existence for [[eternity]], and in this context is also implausible because of [[entropy]]. Even if cures were found for all the degenerative diseases, and effective treatments were developed for all the processes of aging, so that bodies could be maintained as easily as cars can be repaired, people would still be killed in [[accident]]s, slain in [[war]]s, [[suicide|choose]] to die, etc.

The term indefinite lifespan represents a more achievable state of affairs, because it merely implies freedom from death by aging or infirmity.

The use of the term is also sometimes favored for reasons of linguistic aesthetics, in the same way that the term [[birth control]] is preferred to "''birth prevention''" or "''birth elimination''" which both imply, as does 'immortality', that the choice is one-time only and has permanent consequences.  Whereas the point of 'indefinite lifespan', like the point of 'birth control', is to gain the opportunity to lead one's life in a more conscious and deliberate manner.

==Probability==
This question is twofold. On the one hand it can be interpreted to mean, "Will a cure (or program of effective treatments) for aging ever be developed?" while on the other hand it could mean "Will the effective treatment of aging become available soon enough for those alive today to take advantage of it?" The answer to the first question is conditional on medical advancement: if medical science continues to advance in the fields of [[biogerontology]] and [[bioengineering]], then some people hope the answer is "yes, that it will happen eventually, except if some event or series of events were to prevent the further advance of biological science" (''see'' [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth]] ''and the'' [[Doomsday Clock]]). Many scientists researching this area at the moment do not agree. They see a problem in not just individual diseases but in failure of repair mechanisms alluded to above in the discussion of thermodynamic considerations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

While science is constantly advancing and technology is becoming ever more sophisticated, the human body and mind are only evolving very slowly, and the aging process has not, in that time, become any more damaging (''which, in short, is why we live three times as long on average in the twenty-first century as we did ten thousand years before'').&lt;ref&gt;Cairns J (1997). “Matters of Life and Death” Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. (see pages 8-13) {{ISBN|9780691002507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The answer to the second question depends on two factors: the first being ''how fast'' medical science advances, and the second being ''how well'' each person takes care of themself (such as utilizing the best available [[life extension]] technology or not, and generally eating and behaving in a healthful and non-degrading way), both of which may affect whether or not a given person is still alive when the cure (or set of treatments) becomes available. This strategy is captured in the subtitle "Live Long Enough to Live Forever" of the life extension book ''Fantastic Voyage'', by [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Terry Grossman]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The second factor to the second question hinges on the first factor - no amount of healthy living will enable somebody alive today to reach the point of indefinite lifespan if medical science is curtailed significantly, or if aging turns out to be massively more complex than currently believed. However, if biomedical gerontology continues to improve, if somatic [[Genetic engineering#Gene therapy|genetic engineering]] becomes safe and effective (and is not banned by opponents) within the relatively near future, it may be conceivable for some of those now alive to attain indefinite lifespans.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

On the theory that the primary cause of aging is DNA damage [see [[DNA damage theory of aging]] and [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)]]], there are, in principle, two ways of reducing DNA damage in cells, and thus allowing indefinite extension of lifespan. These are:
# Preventing the occurrence of DNA damage, and
# Repairing the DNA damage after it has occurred.

There is a large body of literature on antioxidant phytochemicals that reduce the occurrence of oxidative DNA damage. However, when intervention trials were carried out using these antioxidants as dietary supplements and cancer as the endpoint, the results generally proved disappointing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Andrew R. |title=Antioxidant intervention as a route to cancer prevention |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=41 |issue=13 |pages=1923–30 |year=2005 |pmid=16111883 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2005.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Christina D. |title=Antioxidants and prevention of gastrointestinal cancers |journal=Current Opinion in Gastroenterology |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=195–200 |year=2013 |pmid=23274317 |doi=10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835c9d1b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there seems to be evidence that certain dietary components stimulate repair of DNA damage, and protect against cancer as an endpoint.

The '''Kherubim''' or Kherans are an [[List of extraterrestrials in fiction|alien race]] in the [[fiction]]al [[Wildstorm Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/24114-wildstorm-vets-reunite-for-oral-history.html |title=WILDSTORM Vets Reunite For Oral History |publisher=[[Newsarama.com]] |date=2015-04-13 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were created by [[Jim Lee]] and first appeared in ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]]'' #1 (August 1992).

==Biology==
Kherubim are various groups/races of people from the planet Khera. Kherubim resemble humans in appearance but are physically far stronger and more durable and extremely long-lived, nearly [[Immortality|immortal]]. [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]] was harmed by armor-piercing machine gun bullets; however, after they are surgically removed, she makes a full and rapid recovery. Kherans (including Titanthropes) can interbreed with humans, bearing fertile offspring.

An evolutionary drawback to their near-immortality is that nearly all Kheran females are [[infertile]]; only very rarely will a Kheran produce offspring. This is a natural check against overpopulation. Only one in 10,000 Kheran females is capable of giving birth, and only then at her very first mating. Of those, only one in approximately 10,000 will become pregnant, and only 1 in 1000 of those babies will be born alive; the rest are stillborn. The saving grace of the species is that this infertility does not seem to apply when the Kheran is mating with another species, as Earth has various Kheran/human hybrids.

More powerful Kherans are known as Lords and may possess telekinetic and energy manipulation abilities. [[Mister Majestic]], [[Lord Emp]] and [[Spartan (comics)|Yohn Khol]] are Kherubim Lords.
 
Shapers are a [[subspecies]] of Kherans. They are [[shapeshifters]] who are able to manipulate the molecular structure of their bodies, transforming part or all of their bodies into a substance with [[metal]]lic properties, which they can manipulate and reshape at will. The Wildcat [[Warblade (comics)|Warblade]] is a Shaper.

Though genetically a different species, the Titanthropes (or simply Titans) have been part of Kherubim society for so long that they are also often called Kherubim. However, they are considered and treated as second-class citizens of Khera by the Kherubim. They are large, purple-skinned humanoids who are able to increase or decrease their mass. Males have large yellow horns growing from their backs. A Titan's intelligence is inversely proportional to their current size. The Wildcat [[Maul (Wildstorm)|Maul]] is a Titanthrope.

==History==
Thousands of years ago, the Kherubim destroyed their own planet, according to Titan myth. They then came to Khera and settled it, subjugating the Titans. The Titans would slowly become more or less accepted within the Kherubim society but remained [[second-class citizen]]s.

Millennia ago, the Kherans came into contact with the [[Daemonite]]s and a war erupted between both species. This war would last several centuries. A small group of Kherans and Daemonites crashlanded on Earth and inspired humanity with tales of gods, angels, demons, and monsters. Their conflict would continue until the end of the 20th century, while in space the Kherans would go on to defeat the Daemonites. Kherans imposed heavy [[indemnity|indemnities]] on the Daemonites and their society went bankrupt trying to pay them off. Khera allowed Daemonites to migrate to the more prosperous planet, but forced these Daemonites refugees to live in [[ghetto]]s.

When a small group of Kheran and half-Kheran heroes from Earth known as the [[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]] arrived on Khera, they were welcomed as heroes, but quickly learned that Kheran society had changed over the years. Disgusted with the autocratic nature of Kheran society, they left the planet and returned to Earth.

Later, the Kherubim lord [[Mister Majestic|Majestros]] found hidden Kheran devices, known as Planet Shaper Engines, beneath the surface of the Earth. This caused the realization that humanity and Kherans were closely related and that similar species had been seeded throughout the universe, creating both the Daemonites and Kherans in addition to humans.

The Shaper Guild from Khera arrived on Earth and announced that factions within Kherubim society had decided on using Planet Shaper Engines to transform the Earth into another Khera, causing a civil war.

==Culture==
Kherans are a warrior race with a strong emphasis on hand-to-hand combat and [[honor]].

Due to their low fertility, every Kheran man and woman coming of age has to mate with an appointed partner. If the woman gives birth, she must become a priestess. If not, she may go on to live her life as she wishes. [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]] has managed to avoid becoming a priestess, despite giving birth, because her mother told others that the baby had died, allowing Zannah to become a warrior. Her mother then passed Zannah's baby, [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]], off as Zealot's sister. As a mother of two children, Zannah's mother, Harmony, has become a living legend. No Kheran can remember the last time a Kheran woman gave birth to more than one child in her life. Zannah became the founder of the [[Coda (Wildstorm)|Coda]] Sisterhood.

Older and more powerful Kherans are named Lords. It remains unclear what makes a Kheran a Lord, but a Lord is capable of undergoing the ritual of Ascension when he is ready. The Ascension ritual is an important part of the Kheran culture, where a Lord asks a partner or good friend to destroy his body so that his spirit can be free. A Lord usually has so much energy stored in his body that this process tends to consume both Kherans.

The Coda worship a goddess, Hecate, but little is known about this religion. Other Kherans apparently do not worship any gods but believe in individual enlightenment through Ascension.

Though originally seen as noble and protective of other species, the Kherans were later shown to be quite [[speciesism|speciesist]], looking down upon other species while perceiving themselves as tolerant and benevolent.

==Politics==
The Kherans have a political system where various parties vie for power. The various factions include:
*The Pantheon, the party of the Lords. They are currently in power and stand for stability and economic progress.
*The Coda, a sisterhood of warriors. They want war and combat to prove their worth.
*The Shapers Guild represents all Shapers within Kheran society. They follow the orders from the Pantheon but have their own secret agenda. They claim to shape the destiny of Khera and are aware of its true origin.
*The Titantropes, while individually repressed by the Kherubim, hold great power as a faction. While being only a small political faction, it is in fact their vote that either keeps the Pantheon in power or puts the Coda in power.
* The Brotherhood of the Sword: a male version of the Coda, its members are created through [[genetic engineering]] and [[cloning]]. They devote their whole life to the mastery of bladed weapons and suppressing their own emotions. Some Bladesmen sacrifice themselves to become Scimitars, using stolen DNA from the Shapers Guild to become living war machines. The Brotherhood on Earth betrayed Khera and allied themselves with the Daemonites.
* The Adrastea: a race of Kherubim empaths, originally bred to be slaves, but they soon became the largest [[organized crime|crime syndicate]] in Kheran society.

==Technology==
While preferring bladed weapons in combat, Kherans are technologically advanced. They own spaceships capable of interstellar flights. They are capable of inscribing knowledge in the form of organic molecules, which when injected into the bloodstream, downloads that knowledge straight into the brain. They are capable of manipulating the laws of chance, simply for the purpose of entertainment as their 'Coincidental Mansion' shows. Armies of very advanced [[Android (robot)|androids]] known as the [[Spartan (comics)|Spartan Guards]] serve as soldiers. Spartan Guards have shown high intelligence and superhuman physical capabilities. Kherubim Planet Shapers can [[Terraforming|terraform]] worlds and alter living DNA and can remain functional for billions of years.

==Notable Kherans==
*[[Mister Majestic|Lord Majestros]], the greatest living hero for all Kherubim.
*[[Lord Emp]], ascended from the physical plane. Former member of the Pantheon.
*[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]], former member of the Coda.
*[[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]]
*[[Spartan (comics)|Lord Yohn Kohl]], the template for the android Spartan.
*Lord S'lyton, father of [[Backlash (Marc Slayton)|Marc Slayton]]
*Ferrian, member of [[Wildcore]].
*Charis, also known as [[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]]. An Adrastea with empathic abilities, trained by the Coda.

[[File:LangtonsAnt.png|right|frame|Langton's ant after 11,000 steps. A red pixel shows the ant's location.]]

'''Langton's ant''' is a two-dimensional [[universal Turing machine]] with a very simple set of rules but complex [[Emergence|emergent]] behavior. It was invented by [[Chris Langton]] in 1986 and runs on a [[Square tiling|square lattice]] of black and white cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0167-2789(86)90237-X | last = Langton | first = Chris G. | title = Studying artificial life with cellular automata | year = 1986 | journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | volume = 22 | pages = 120–149 | hdl = 2027.42/26022 | issue = 1-3| url = https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/26022/1/0000093.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Computationally universal|universality]] of Langton's ant was proven in 2000.&lt;ref name="Gajardo2000" /&gt; The idea has been generalized in several different ways, such as [[turmite]]s which add more colors and more states.

==Rules==
[[File:LangtonsAntAnimated.gif|500px|right|thumb|Animation of first 200 steps of Langton's ant]]

Squares on a plane are colored variously either black or white. We arbitrarily identify one square as the "ant". The ant can travel in any of the four cardinal directions at each step it takes. The "ant" moves according to the rules below:
* At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
* At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

Langton's ant can also be described as a [[cellular automaton]], where the grid is colored black or white and the "ant" square has one of eight different colors assigned to encode the combination of black/white state and the current direction of motion of the ant.&lt;ref name="Gajardo2000" /&gt;

==Modes of behavior==
These simple rules lead to complex behavior. Three distinct modes of behavior are apparent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratchett|first=Terry|title=The Science Of Discworld|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; when starting on a completely white grid.

#Simplicity. During the first few hundred moves it creates very simple patterns which are often symmetric.
#Chaos. After a few hundred moves, a big, irregular pattern of black and white squares appears. The ant traces a pseudo-random path until around 10,000 steps.
#Emergent order. Finally the ant starts building a recurrent "highway" pattern of 104 steps that repeats indefinitely.

All finite initial configurations tested eventually converge to the same repetitive pattern, suggesting that the "highway" is an [[attractor]] of Langton's ant, but no one has been able to prove that this is true for all such initial configurations. It is only known that the ant's trajectory is always unbounded regardless of the initial configuration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bunimovich |first=Leonid A. |last2=Troubetzkoy |first2=Serge E. |title=Recurrence properties of Lorentz lattice gas cellular automata |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=67 |issue=1-2 |pages=289–302 |year=1992 |doi=10.1007/BF01049035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– this is known as the [[E.G.D. Cohen|Cohen]]–Kung theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stewart |first=I. |title=The Ultimate in Anty-Particles |journal=Sci. Am. |volume=271 |pages=104–107 |year=1994 |url=http://dev.whydomath.org/Reading_Room_Material/ian_stewart/AntyParticles.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universality==

In 2000, Gajardo et al. showed a construction that calculates any [[boolean circuit]] using the trajectory of a single instance of Langton's ant.&lt;ref name="Gajardo2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gajardo |first1=A. |last2=Moreira |first2=A. |last3=Goles |first3=E. |title=Complexity of Langton's ant |journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics |volume=117 |issue=1-3 |pages=41–50 |date=15 March 2002 |doi=10.1016/S0166-218X(00)00334-6 |url=http://www.dim.uchile.cl/~anmoreir/oficial/langton_dam.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it would be possible to simulate an arbitrary [[Turing machine]] using the ant's trajectory for computation. This means that the ant is capable of universal computation.

==Extension to multiple colors==

[[Greg Turk]] and [[Jim Propp]] considered a simple extension to Langton's ant where instead of just two colors, more colors are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gale |first1=D. |last2=Propp |first2=J. |last3=Sutherland |first3=S. |last4=Troubetzkoy |first4=S. |title=Further Travels with My Ant|journal=Mathematical Entertainments column, Mathematical Intelligencer |year=1995 |volume=17|pages=48–56 |url=http://www.math.sunysb.edu/cgi-bin/preprint.pl?ims95-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colors are modified in a cyclic fashion. A simple naming scheme is used: for each of the successive colors, a letter "L" or "R" is used to indicate whether a left or right turn should be taken. Langton's ant has the name "RL" in this naming scheme.

Some of these extended Langton's ants produce patterns that become [[symmetric]] over and over again. One of the simplest examples is the ant "RLLR". One sufficient condition for this to happen is that the ant's name, seen as a cyclic list, consists of consecutive pairs of identical letters "LL" or "RR" (the term "cyclic list" indicates that the last letter may pair with the first one). The proof involves [[Truchet tiles]].

&lt;gallery caption="Some example patterns in the multiple-color extension of Langton's ants:"&gt;
Image:LangtonsAnt-nColor_RLR_13937.png|RLR: Grows chaotically. It is not known whether this ant ever produces a highway.

Image:CA50338 animation.gif|R1R2NUR2R1L2: Animation.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The hexagonal grid permits up to six different rotations, which are notated here as N (no change), R1 (60° clockwise), R2 (120° clockwise), U (180°), L2 (120° counter-clockwise), L1 (60° counter-clockwise).

==Extension to multiple states==
{{Main|Turmite}}
A further extension of Langton's ants is to consider multiple states of the Turing machine – as if the ant itself has a color that can change. These ants are called [[turmite]]s, a contraction of "Turing machine [[termites]]". Common behaviours include the production of highways, chaotic growth and spiral growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | last = Pegg, Jr. | first = Ed | title = Turmite | publisher = From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource, created by [[Eric W. Weisstein]] | url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Turmite.html | accessdate = 15 October 2009 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Extension to multiple ants==
Multiple Langton's ants can co-exist on the 2D plane, and their interactions give rise to complex, higher-order automata that collectively build a wide variety of organized structures. There is no need for conflict resolution, as every ant sitting on the same square wants to make the same change to the tape. There is a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XQQhCgq5c YouTube video] showing these multiple ant interactions.

Multiple turmites can co-exist on the 2D plane as long as there is a rule for what happens when they meet. [[Ed Pegg, Jr.]] considered ants that can turn for example ''both'' left and right, splitting in two and annihilating each other when they meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Pegg, Jr. | first = Ed | title = Math Puzzle | url=http://www.mathpuzzle.com/26Mar03.html | accessdate = 15 October 2009 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46776">The survival of some [[microorganisms]] exposed to [[outer space]] has been studied using both simulated facilities and [[low Earth orbit]] exposures. Bacteria were some of the first organisms investigated, when in 1960 a Russian satellite carried ''Escherichia coli'', ''Staphylococcus'', and ''Enterobacter aerogenes'' into orbit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.indy100.com/article/bacteria-get-dangerously-weird-in-space-7380481| title=Bacteria get dangerously weird in space| last=Love| first=Shayla|date=2016-10-26| newspaper=The Independent| access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of microorganisms have been selected for exposure experiments since, as listed in the table below.

Experiments of the adaption of microbes in space have yielded unpredictable results. While sometimes the microorganism may weaken, they can also increase in their disease-causing potency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is possible to classify these microorganisms into two groups, the [[Medical microbiology|human-borne]], and the [[extremophiles]]. Studying the human-borne microorganisms is significant for human welfare and future [[Human spaceflight|crewed missions in space]], whilst the extremophiles are vital for studying the physiological requirements of survival in space.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA has pointed out that normal adults have ten times as many microbial cells as human cells in their bodies.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/microorganisms.html NASA – Spaceflight Alters Bacterial Social Networks (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also nearly everywhere in the environment, and although normally invisible, can form slimy biofilms.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Extremophiles have adapted to live in some of the most extreme environments on Earth. This includes [[hypersaline lake]]s, [[desert|arid regions]], [[deep sea]], acidic sites, cold and dry polar regions and [[permafrost]].&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of extremophiles has led to the speculation that microorganisms could survive the harsh conditions of extraterrestrial environments and be used as model organisms to understand the fate of biological systems in these environments. The focus of many of the experiments has been to investigate the possible survival of organisms inside rocks ([[lithopanspermia]]),&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'/&gt; or their survival on [[Mars]] for understanding the likelihood of past or present life on that planet.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'/&gt;  Because of their ubiquity and resistance to spacecraft decontamination, bacterial [[spore]]s are considered likely potential [[Planetary protection|forward contaminants]] on robotic missions to [[Mars]].  Measuring the resistance of such organisms to space conditions can be applied to develop adequate decontamination procedures.&lt;ref&gt;

Research and testing of microorganisms in outer space could eventually be applied for [[directed panspermia]] or [[terraforming]].

Exchanged cells can multiply and establish long-lasting cell lines that are immunologically active even decades after giving birth.]] 
'''Microchimerism''' is the presence of a small number of cells that originate from another individual and are therefore genetically distinct from the cells of the host individual. This phenomenon may be related to certain types of [[autoimmune diseases]]; however, the mechanisms responsible for this relationship are unclear.

==Types==

===Human===
In humans (and perhaps in all [[placentals]]), the most common form is '''fetomaternal microchimerism''' (also known as ''fetal cell microchimerism'' or ''fetal chimerism'') whereby cells from a [[fetus]] pass through the [[placenta]] and establish cell lineages within the mother. Fetal cells have been documented to persist and multiply in the mother for several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bianchi|first=DW|author2=Zickwold GK |author3=Weil GJ |author4=Sylvester S |author5=DeMaria MA. |title=Male fetal progenitor cells persist in maternal blood for as long as 27 years postpartum|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|year=1996|volume=93|pages=705–708|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.2.705|pmc=40117|issue=2|pmid=8570620}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Evans PC, Lambert N, Maloney S, Furst DE, Moore JM, Nelson JL | title=Long-term fetal microchimerism in peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets in healthy women and women with scleroderma| journal=Blood | year=1999 | pages=2033–2037 | volume=93|pmid= 10068676|issue= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact [[phenotype]] of these cells is unknown, although several different cell types have been identified, such as various immune lineages, [[mesenchymal stem cells]], and placental-derived cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pritchard |first=Stephanie |author2=Wick HC |author3=Slonim DK |author4=Johnson KL |author5=Bianchi DW |title=Comprehensive analysis of genes expressed by rare microchimeric fetal cells in the maternal mouse lung |journal=Biology of Reproduction |date=August 2012 |volume=87 |pages=42 |pmid=22674387 |url=http://www.biolreprod.org/content/87/2/42.long |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923204002/http://www.biolreprod.org/content/87/2/42.long |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-09-23 |issue=2 |doi=10.1095/biolreprod.112.101147 |pmc=3431427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study at the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]], Seattle, has detected cells with the [[Y chromosome]] in multiple areas of the brains of deceased women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Male microchimerism in the human female brain|journal=PLOS ONE|date=26 September 2012|volume=7|issue=9|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0045592|pmid=23049819|pages=e45592|pmc=3458919|vauthors=Chan WF, Gurnot C, Montine TJ, Sonnen JA, Guthrie KA, Nelson JL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fetomaternal microchimerism occurs during pregnancy and shortly after giving birth for most women. However, not all women who have had children contain fetal cells. Studies suggest that fetomaternal microchimerism could be influenced by killer-cell immunoglobin-like (KIR) [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]].&lt;ref name="fetomaternal microchimerism" /&gt; [[Lymphocytes]] also influence the development of persisting fetomaternal microchimerism since [[natural killer cells]] compose about 70% of lymphocytes in the first trimester of pregnancy. KIR patterns on maternal natural killer cells of the mother and KIR ligands on the fetal cells could have an effect on fetomaternal microchimerism. In one study, mothers with KIR2DS1 exhibited higher levels of fetomaternal microchimerism compared to mothers who were negative for this activating KIR.&lt;ref name="fetomaternal microchimerism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruchen|first1=Anne|last2=Stahl|first2=Tanja|last3=Gieseke|first3=Friederike|last4=Binder|first4=Thomas|last5=Oezcan|first5=Zakir|last6=Meisel|first6=Roland|last7=Kreyenberg|first7=Hermann|last8=Bader|first8=Peter|last9=Gruhn|first9=Bernd|last10=Greil|first10=Johann|last11=Pfeieffer|first11=Matthias|last12=Doering|first12=Michaela|last13=Handgretinger|first13=Rupert|last14=Fehse|first14=Boris|last15=Mueller|first15=Ingo|title=Fetomaternal Microchimerism Is Associated with Better Outcome in Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|journal=Blood|date=2014|volume=124|issue=21|url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/124/21/1242.abstract?sso-checked=true|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential health consequences of these cells are unknown. One hypothesis is that these fetal cells might trigger a [[Graft-versus-host disease|graft-versus-host reaction]] leading to [[autoimmune disease]]. This offers a potential explanation for why many autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in middle-aged women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=JL|title=Maternal-fetal immunology and autoimmune disease: is some autoimmune disease auto-alloimmune or allo-autoimmune?|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=1996|volume=39|issue=2|pages=191–194|doi=10.1002/art.1780390203|pmid=8849367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis is that fetal cells home to injured or diseased maternal tissue where they act as [[stem cells]] and participate in repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khosrotehrani|first=K|author2=Johnson KL |author3=Cha DH |author4=Salomon RN |author5=Bianchi DW |title=Transfer of fetal cells with multilineage potential to maternal tissue|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|year=2004|volume=292|pages=75–80|doi=10.1001/jama.292.1.75|pmid=15238593|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nguyen Huu|first=S|last2=Oster |first2=M |last3=Avril |first3=MF |last4=Boitier |first4=F |last5=Mortier |first5=L |last6=Richard |first6=MA |last7=Kerob |first7=D |last8=Maubec |first8=E |last9=Souteyrand |first9=P |last10=Moguelet |first10=P |last11=Khosrotehrani |first11=K |last12=Aractingi |first12=S |title=Fetal microchimeric cells participate in tumour angiogenesis in melanomas occurring during pregnancy|journal=Am J Cardiovasc Pathol|year=2009|volume=174|issue=2|pages=630–637|doi=10.2353/ajpath.2009.080566|pmc=2630570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible that the fetal cells are merely innocent bystanders and have no effect on maternal health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=KL|author2=Bianchi DW|title=Fetal cells in maternal tissue following pregnancy: what are the consequences?|journal=Hum Reprod Update|year=2004|volume=10|issue=6|pages=497–502|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmh040|pmid=15319378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After giving birth, about 50–75% of women carry fetal immune cell lines. Maternal immune cells are also found in the offspring yielding in '''maternal→fetal microchimerism''', though this phenomenon is about half as frequent as the former.&lt;ref name="labinvest"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Loubičre LS, Lambert NC, Flinn LJ, Erickson TD, Yan Z, Guthrie KA, etal | title=Maternal microchimerism in healthy adults in lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages and NK cells| journal= Lab Invest | year=2006| volume=86 | pages=1185–92|pmid= 16969370|issue= 11|doi= 10.1038/labinvest.3700471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal===
Microchimerism occurs in most pairs of twins in [[cattle]]. In cattle (and other [[Bovinae|bovine]]s), the [[placenta]]e of fraternal twins usually fuse and the twins share blood circulation, resulting in exchange of cell lines.  If the twins are a male-female pair, the male hormones from the bull calf have the effect of partially masculinising the heifer (female), creating a ''martin heifer'' or ''[[freemartin]]''.  Freemartins appear female, but are infertile and so cannot be used for breeding or [[dairy farming|dairy production]].  Microchimerism provides a method of diagnosing the condition, because male genetic material can be detected in a blood sample.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theriojournal.com/article/0093-691X(95)00039-B/abstract A. Fujishiro, K. Kawakura, Y-I. Miyake, Y. Kaneda, "A fast, convenient diagnosis of the bovine freemartin syndrome using polymerase chain reaction", ''Theriogenology'', '''43''' (5), pp 883–891 (1 April 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with autoimmune diseases and breast cancer==
Microchimerism has been implicated in autoimmune diseases. Independent studies repeatedly suggested that microchimeric cells of fetal origin may be involved in the [[pathogenesis]] of [[systemic sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Artlett CM, Smith JB, Jimenez SA | title=Identification of fetal DNA and cells in skin lesions from women with systemic sclerosis| journal=New England Journal of Medicine| year=1998 | pages=1186–1196|issue= 17|pmid= 9554859 | volume=338|doi= 10.1056/NEJM199804233381704 | url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/338/17/1186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, microchimeric cells of maternal origin may be involved in the pathogenesis of a group of autoimmune diseases found in children, i.e. juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (one example would be [[juvenile dermatomyositis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Artlett CM, Ramos R, Jimenez SA, Patterson K, Miller FW, Rider LG | title=Chimeric cells of maternal origin in juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Childhood Myositis Heterogeneity Collaborative Group| journal=Lancet| year=2000 | pages=2155–2156 | volume=356|doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)03499-1|pmid= 11191545|issue= 9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microchimerism has now been further implicated in other autoimmune diseases, including [[Lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson KL, McAlindon TE, Mulcahy E, Bianchi DW | title=Microchimerism in a female patient with systemic lupus erythematosus| journal=Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism| year=2001 | pages=2107–2111 | volume=44|doi= 10.1002/1529-0131(200109)44:9&lt;2107::AID-ART361&gt;3.0.CO;2-9 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/85512936/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|issue= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, an alternative hypothesis on the role of microchimeric cells in lesions is that they may be facilitating tissue repair of the damaged organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Gilliam AC | title=Microchimerism and skin disease: true-true unrelated?| journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology | year=2006 | pages=239–241 | volume=126|doi= 10.1038/sj.jid.5700061|pmid= 16418731|issue= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, fetal immune cells have also been frequently found in breast cancer stroma as compared to samples taken from healthy women. It is not clear, however, whether fetal cell lines promote the development of tumors or, contrarily, protect women from developing breast carcinoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gadi VK, Nelson JL | title=Fetal microchimerism in women with breast cancer| journal=Cancer Research | year=2007| pages=9035–9038 | volume=67|doi= 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4209|pmid= 17909006|issue= 19 | url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/67/19/9035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dubernard G, etal | title=Breast cancer stroma frequently recruits fetal derived cells during pregnancy| journal=Breast Cancer Research | year=2008| pages=R14 | volume=10|doi= 10.1186/bcr1860|pmid= 18271969|issue= 1|pmc= 2374970 | url=http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/10/1/R14#B38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic lupus erythematosus===

The presence of fetal cells in mothers can be associated with benefits when it comes to certain autoimmune diseases. In particular, male fetal cells are related to helping mothers with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]]. When kidney biopsies were taken from patients with lupus nephritis, DNA was extracted and run with [[PCR]]. The male fetal DNA was quantified and the presence of specific Y chromosome sequences were found. Women with lupus nephritis containing male fetal cells in their kidney biopsies exhibited better [[renal system]] functioning. Levels of [[serum creatinine]], which is related to kidney failure, were low in mothers with high levels of male fetal cells.&lt;ref name="systemic lupus" /&gt; In contrast, women without male fetal cells who had lupus nephritis showed a more serious form of [[glomerulonephritis]] and higher levels of serum creatinine.&lt;ref name="systemic lupus"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Florim|first1=Greiciane|last2=Cardas|first2=Helosia|last3=de Melo|first3=Julio|last4=Baptista|first4=Maria Alice|last5=Fernandes|first5=Ida|last6=Savoldi-Barbosa|first6=Marcela|last7=Goldman|first7=Gustavo|last8=Abbud-Filho|first8=Mario|title=Fetal microchimerism in kidney biopsies of lupus nephritis patients may be associated with a beneficial effect|journal=Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy|volume=17|date=15 April 2015|url=https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-015-0615-4|accessdate=3 December 2016|doi=10.1186/s13075-015-0615-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific role that fetal cells play in microchimerism related to certain autoimmune diseases is not fully understood. However, one hypothesis states that these cells supply [[antigens]], causing inflammation and triggering the release of different foreign antigens.&lt;ref name="systemic lupus" /&gt; This would trigger autoimmune disease instead of serving as a therapeutic. A different hypothesis states that fetal microchimeric cells are involved in repairing tissues. When tissues get inflamed, fetal microchimeric cells go to the damaged site and aid in repair and regeneration of the tissue.&lt;ref name="systemic lupus" /&gt;

===Thyroid disease===

Fetal maternal microchimerism may be related to autoimmune thyroid diseases. There have been reports of fetal cells in the lining of the blood and thyroid glands of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. These cells could become activated after delivery of the baby after immune suppression in the mother is lost, suggesting a role of fetal cells in the pathogenesis of such diseases.&lt;ref name="thyroid" /&gt; Two types of thyroid disease, [[Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis]] (HT) and [[Graves Disease|Graves’ Disease]] (GD) show similarities to [[graft vs host disease]] which occurs after [[hematopoietic stem cell]] transplants. Fetal cells colonize maternal tissues like the thyroid gland and are able to survive many years postpartum. These fetal microchimeric cells in the thyroid show up in the blood of women affected by thyroid diseases.&lt;ref name="thyroid"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lepez |first1=Trees |last2=Vandewoestyne |first2=Mado |last3=Deforce |first3=Dieter |title=Fetal microchimeric cells in autoimmune thyroid diseases |journal=Chimerism |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=111–118 |date=20 May 2013 |doi=10.4161/chim.25055 |pmc=3921191 |pmid=23723083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stem cells==

===Animal models===

Fetomaternal microchimerism has been shown in experimental investigations of whether fetal cells can cross the blood brain barrier in mice. The properties of these cells allow them to cross the blood brain barrier and target injured brain tissue.&lt;ref name="stem cells (mice)" /&gt; This mechanism is possible because [[umbilical cord]] blood cells express some proteins similar to [[neurons]]. When these umbilical cord blood cells are injected in rats with brain injury or stroke, they enter the brain and express certain nerve cell markers. Due to this process, fetal cells could enter the brain during pregnancy and become differentiated into neural cells. Fetal microchimerism can occur in the maternal mouse brain, responding to certain cues in the maternal body.&lt;ref name="stem cells (mice)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Xiao-Wei|last2=Liao|first2=Hong|last3=Sun|first3=Li|last4=Okabe|first4=Masaru|last5=Xiao|first5=Zhi-Cheng|last6=Dawe|first6=Gavin|title=Fetal Microchimerism in the Maternal Mouse Brain: A Novel Population of Fetal Progenitor or Stem Cells Able to Cross the Blood–Brain Barrier?|journal=Stem Cells|date=1 November 2005|volume=23|issue=10|pages=1443–1452|doi=10.1634/stemcells.2004-0169|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1634/stemcells.2004-0169/full|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health implications==

Fetal microchimerism could have an implication on maternal health. Isolating cells in cultures can alter the properties of the stem cells, but in pregnancy the effects of fetal stem cells can be investigated without in vitro cultures. Once characterized and isolated, fetal cells that are able to cross the blood brain barrier could impact certain procedures.&lt;ref name="stem cells (mice)" /&gt; For example, isolating stem cells can be accomplished through taking them from sources like the umbilical cord. These fetal stem cells can be used in intravenous infusion to repair the brain tissue. Hormonal changes in pregnancy alter neurogenesis, which could create favorable environments for fetal cells to respond to injury.&lt;ref name="stem cells (mice)" /&gt;

The true function on fetal cells in mothers is not fully known, however, there have been reports of positive and negative health effects. The sharing of genes between the fetus and mother may lead to benefits. Due to not all genes being shared, health complications may arise as a result of resource allocation.&lt;ref name="maternal health" /&gt; During pregnancy, fetal cells are able to manipulate the maternal system to draw resources from the placenta, while the maternal system tries to limit it.&lt;ref name="maternal health"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boddy|first1=Amy|last2=Fortunato|first2=Angelo|last3=Wilson Sayres|first3=Melissa|title=Fetal microchimerism and maternal health: A review and evolutionary analysis of cooperation and conflict beyond the womb|journal=BioEssays|volume=37|issue=10|pages=1106–18|date=28 August 2015|doi=10.1002/bies.201500059|pmid=26316378|pmc=4712643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miscarriage rates increase steadily with age, with more substantial increases after age 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bray I, Gunnell D, [[George Davey Smith|Davey Smith G]]|year=2006|title=Advanced paternal age: How old is too old?|journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health|volume=60|issue=10|pages=851–3|doi=10.1136/jech.2005.045179|pmc=2566050|pmid=16973530}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In those under the age of 35 the risk is about 10% while it is about 45% in those over the age of 40.&lt;ref name="John2012" /&gt; Risk begins to increase around the age of 30.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Epi" /&gt; Paternal age is associated with increased risk.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=175}}

===Obesity, eating disorders and caffeine===
Not only is obesity associated with miscarriage, it can result in sub-fertility and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recurrent miscarriage is also related to obesity. Women with [[bulimia nervosa]] and [[anorexia nervosa]] may have a greater risk for miscarriage. Nutrient deficiencies have not been found to impact miscarriage rates but [[hyperemesis gravidarum]] sometimes precedes a miscarriage.
{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}}

[[Caffeine]] consumption also has been correlated to miscarriage rates, at least at higher levels of intake.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, such higher rates have been found to be statistically significant only in certain circumstances.

Vitamin supplementation has generally not shown to be effective in preventing miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue = 5|pages = CD004073|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi O|last2=da Silva Lopes|first2=Katharina|last3=Ota|first3=Erika|last4=Takemoto|first4=Yo|last5=Rumbold|first5=Alice|last6=Takegata|first6=Mizuki|last7=Mori|first7=Rintaro|date=2016-05-06|isbn = |language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd004073.pub4|pmid = 27150280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese traditional medicine has not been found to prevent miscarriage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Endocrine disorders===
Disorders of the thyroid may affect pregnancy outcomes. Related to this, iodine deficiency is strongly associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}} The risk of miscarriage is increased in those with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}} Women with well-controlled diabetes have the same risk of miscarriage as those without diabetes.&lt;ref name=Ferri2017&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred F.

===Food poisoning===
Ingesting food that has been contaminated with [[listeriosis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], and [[salmonella]] is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = gloss/&gt;

===Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling===
Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are procedures conducted to assess the fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. Chorionic villus sampling is a similar procedure with a sample of tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="Alfirevic"/&gt; Miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis ([[chorionic villus sampling]] (CVS) and [[amniocentesis]]) is rare (about 1%).&lt;ref name="Agarwal-Alfirevic-2012"/&gt;

===Surgery===
The effects of surgery on pregnancy are not well-known including the effects of [[bariatric]] surgery. Abdominal and pelvic surgery are not risk factors in miscarriage. Ovarian tumors and cysts that are removed have not been found to increase the risk of miscarriage. The exception to this is the removal of the corpus luteum from the ovary. This can cause fluctuations in the hormones necessary to maintain the pregnancy.{{sfn|Hoffman|pages=172–173}}

===Medications===
Immunizations have not been found to cause miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=72}} There is no significant association between [[antidepressant]] medication exposure and spontaneous abortion.&lt;ref name="Ross LE 436–443"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross LE|last2=Grigoriadis S|last3=Mamisashvili L|display-authors=etal|date=2013-04-01|title=Selected pregnancy and delivery outcomes after exposure to antidepressant medication: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|volume=70|issue=4|pages=436–443|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.684|pmid=23446732|issn=2168-622X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of miscarriage is not likely decreased by discontinuing [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] prior to pregnancy.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalke|first=Katharine Baratz|last2=Wenzel|first2=Amy|last3=Kim|first3=Deborah R.|date=2016-04-19|title=Depression and Anxiety During Pregnancy: Evaluating the Literature in Support of Clinical Risk-Benefit Decision-Making|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1–12|doi=10.1007/s11920-016-0698-x|pmid=27091646|issn=1523-3812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some available data suggest that there is a small increased risk of miscarriage for women taking any [[antidepressant]],&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Gestational exposure to antidepressants and the risk of spontaneous abortion: A review|journal=Current Drug Delivery|volume=7|issue=1|pages=76–92|doi=10.2174/156720110790396508|pmid=19863482|vauthors=Broy P, Bérard A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Use of antidepressants during pregnancy and the risk of spontaneous abortion|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=182|issue=10|pages=1031–7|doi=10.1503/cmaj.091208|pmc=2900326|pmid=20513781|vauthors=Nakhai-Pour HR, Broy P, Bérard A}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this risk becomes less [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] when excluding studies of poor quality.&lt;ref name="Ross LE 436–443"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yonkers|first=Kimberly A.|last2=Blackwell|first2=Katherine A.|last3=Glover|first3=Janis|last4=Forray|first4=Ariadna|date=2014-01-01|title=Antidepressant Use in Pregnant and Postpartum Women|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=10|issue=1|pages=369–392|doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032813-153626|pmc=4138492|pmid=24313569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicines that increase the risk of miscarriage include:

* retinoids&amp;nbsp;
* nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&amp;nbsp;, such as ibuprofen
* misoprostol&amp;nbsp;
* methotrexate&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Chemotherapy and radiation treatments for cancer===
Ionizing radiation levels given to a woman during cancer treatment cause miscarriage. Exposure can also impact fertility. The use of chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat childhood cancer increases the risk of miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}}

===Intercurrent diseases===
Several [[intercurrent diseases in pregnancy]] can potentially increase the risk of miscarriage, including diabetes, [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS), hypothyroidism, certain infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. PCOS may increase the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Two studies suggested treatment with the drug [[metformin]] significantly lowers the rate of miscarriage in women with PCOS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jakubowicz DJ, Iuorno MJ, Jakubowicz S, Roberts KA, Nestler JE | title = Effects of Metformin on Early Pregnancy Loss in the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 524–9 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11836280 | doi = 10.1210/jc.87.2.524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khattab S, Mohsen IA, Foutouh IA, Ramadan A, Moaz M, Al-Inany H | title = Metformin reduces abortion in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome | journal = Gynecological Endocrinology | volume = 22 | issue = 12 | pages = 680–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17162710 | doi = 10.1080/09513590601010508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the quality of these studies has been questioned.&lt;ref name="RCOG-PCOS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|title=Long-term consequences of polycystic ovarian syndrome|url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/GT33_LongTermPCOS.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20100710113119/http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/GT33_LongTermPCOS.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-07-10|website=Green-top Guideline No. 27|publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|accessdate=2 July 2013|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metformin treatment in pregnancy has not been shown to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lilja AE, Mathiesen ER | title = Polycystic ovary syndrome and metformin in pregnancy | journal = Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica | volume = 85 | issue = 7 | pages = 861–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16817087 | doi = 10.1080/00016340600780441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists also recommended against use of the drug to prevent miscarriage.&lt;ref name="RCOG-PCOS" /&gt; Thrombophilias or defects in coagulation and bleeding were once thought to be a risk in miscarriage but have been subsequently questioned.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=174}}
Severe cases of [[hypothyroidism]] increase the risk of miscarriage. The effect of milder cases of hypothyroidism on miscarriage rates has not been established. A condition called luteal phase defect (LPD) is a failure of the uterine lining to be fully prepared for pregnancy. This can keep a fertilized egg from implanting or result in miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-get-pregnant/trying-conceive/#4|title=Trying to conceive {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' infection is associated with increased risk of [[preterm birth]] and miscarriage.&lt;ref name="LisRowhani-Rahbar2015"/&gt;

Infections can increase the risk of a miscarriage: rubella&amp;nbsp;(German measles), cytomegalovirus, bacterial vaginosis, HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhoea,&amp;nbsp;syphilis,&amp;nbsp;and malaria.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Immune status===
Autoimmunity is possible cause of recurrent or late-term miscarriages. In the case of an autoimmune-induced miscarriages the woman's body attacks the growing fetus or prevents normal pregnancy progression.&lt;ref name="CarpSelmi2012"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=The autoimmune bases of infertility and pregnancy loss|journal=J Autoimmun|type=Review|volume=38|issue=2–3|pages=J266–74|doi=10.1016/j.jaut.2011.11.016|pmid=22284905|vauthors=Carp HJ, Selmi C, Shoenfeld Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=Female infertility due to abnormal autoimmunity: Frequently overlooked and greatly underappreciated.

===Anatomical defects and trauma===
Fifteen percent of women who have experienced three or more recurring miscarriages have some anatomical defect that prevents the pregnancy from being carried for the entire term.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=181}} The structure of the [[uterus]] has an effect on the ability to carry a child to term. Anatomical differences are common and can be congenital.

===Smoking===
{{See also|Smoking and pregnancy}}
Tobacco (cigarette) smokers have an increased risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; There is an increased risk regardless of which parent smokes, though the risk is higher when the gestational mother smokes.&lt;ref name="paternal smoking"/&gt;

===Morning sickness===
Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP, or [[morning sickness]]) are associated with a decreased risk.

===Chemicals and occupational exposure===
Chemical and [[occupational exposure]]s may have some effect in pregnancy outcomes. A cause and effect relationship almost can never be established. Those chemicals that are implicated in increasing the risk for miscarriage are [[DDT]], [[lead]], [[formaldehyde]], [[arsenic]], [[benzene]] and [[ethylene oxide]]. [[Video display terminal]]s and ultrasound have not been found to have an effect on the rates of miscarriage. In dental offices where [[nitrous oxide]] is used with the absence of [[anesthetic gas scavenging equipment]], there is a greater risk of miscarriage. For women who work with cytotoxic [[antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent]]s there is a small increased risk of miscarriage. No increased risk for [[cosmetologist]]s has been found.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=272}}

==Diagnosis==
In the case of blood loss, pain, or both, [[Obstetric ultrasonography|transvaginal ultrasound]] is performed.  If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is not found with ultrasound, blood tests (serial [[human chorionic gonadotropin|βHCG]] tests) can be performed to rule out ectopic pregnancy, which is a life-threatening situation.&lt;ref name="followHCG"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Condous G, Okaro E, Khalid A, Bourne T | title = Do we need to follow up complete miscarriages with serum human chorionic gonadotrophin levels? | journal = BJOG | volume = 112 | issue = 6 | pages = 827–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15924545 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00542.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bmj&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/666.html|title=Miscarriage|last=BMJ Best Practice|first=|date=|website=us.bestpractice.bmj.com|language=en|others=Ida Muslim, Jothi Doraiswamy, Acknowledgements|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If [[hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], and [[anemia]] are discovered, exclusion of an ectopic pregnancy is important.&lt;ref name = bmj/&gt;

A miscarriage may be confirmed by an [[obstetric ultrasound]] and by the examination of the passed tissue. When looking for microscopic [[pathology|pathologic]] symptoms, one looks for the [[products of conception]].

===Ultrasound criteria===
A review article in [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] based on a consensus meeting of the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound in America (SRU) has suggested that miscarriage should be diagnosed only if any of the following criteria are met upon ultrasonography visualization:&lt;ref name="Doubilet2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doubilet PM, Benson CB, Bourne T, Blaivas M, Barnhart KT, Benacerraf BR, Brown DL, Filly RA, Fox JC, Goldstein SR, Kendall JL, Lyons EA, Porter MB, Pretorius DH, Timor-Tritsch IE | title = Diagnostic Criteria for Nonviable Pregnancy Early in the First Trimester | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 15 | pages = 1443–1451 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24106937 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1302417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
A threatened miscarriage describes any bleeding during pregnancy, prior to viability, that has yet to be assessed.. At investigation it may be found that the fetus remains viable and the pregnancy continues without further problems.{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2017}}

An [[Anembryonic gestation|anembryonic pregnancy]] (also called an "empty sac" or "blighted ovum") is a condition where the [[gestational sac]] develops normally, while the embryonic part of the pregnancy is either absent or stops growing very early. This accounts for approximately half of miscarriages. All other miscarriages are classified as embryonic miscarriages, meaning that there is an embryo present in the gestational sac. Half of embryonic miscarriages have [[aneuploidy]] (an abnormal number of chromosomes).&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

An inevitable miscarriage occurs when the cervix has already dilated,&lt;ref name="isbn 0-07-144874-8"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Latha |last1=Stead |first2=S. Matthew |last2=Stead |first3=Matthew |last3=Kaufman|first4=Luis |last4=Suarez |title=First Aid for The Obstetrics and Gynecology Clerkship |publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York |year=2006 |page=138 |isbn=978-0-07-144874-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the fetus has yet to be expelled. This usually will progress to a complete miscarriage. The fetus may or may not have cardiac activity.

[[File:Complete miscarriage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]] after an episode of heavy bleeding in an intrauterine pregnancy that had been confirmed by a previous ultrasononography. There is some widening between the [[uterine wall]]s, but no sign of any [[gestational sac]], thus in this case being diagnostic of a complete miscarriage.]] A complete miscarriage is when all products of conception have been expelled; these may include the [[trophoblast]], [[chorionic villi]], [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]], and [[fetal pole]] ([[embryo]]); or later in pregnancy the [[fetus]], [[umbilical cord]], [[placenta]], amniotic fluid, and [[amniotic sac|amniotic membrane]]. The presence of a [[pregnancy test]] that is still positive as well as an empty uterus upon [[transvaginal ultrasonography]] does, however, fulfill the definition of [[pregnancy of unknown location]]. Therefore, there may be a need for follow-up pregnancy tests to ensure that there is no remaining pregnancy, including an ectopic pregnancy. [[File:Incomplete miscarriage.jpg|thumb|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]], with some products of conception in the [[cervix]] (to the left in the image) and remnants of a [[gestational sac]] by the [[fundus of the uterus|fundus]] (to the right in the image), indicating an incomplete miscarriage.]] An incomplete miscarriage occurs when some [[products of conception]] have been passed, but some remains inside the uterus.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus"&gt;{{cite web |author=MedlinePlus | authorlink =MedlinePlus | date = October 25, 2004 |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000904.htm | title =Abortion – incomplete | website=Medical Encyclopedia| accessdate =May 24, 2006 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060425090648/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000904.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an increased distance between the [[uterine wall]]s on transvaginal ultrasonography may also simply be an increased endometrial thickness and/or a [[polyp]].

A [[Septic abortion|septic miscarriage]] occurs when the tissue from a missed or incomplete miscarriage becomes infected, which carries the risk of spreading infection ([[septicaemia]]) and can be fatal.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

[[Recurrent miscarriage]] ("recurrent pregnancy loss" (RPL) or "habitual abortion") is the occurrence of multiple consecutive miscarriages; the exact number used to diagnose recurrent miscarriage varies.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt; If the proportion of pregnancies ending in miscarriage is 15% and assuming that miscarriages are independent events,&lt;ref name="rcog2003" /&gt; then the probability of two consecutive miscarriages is 2.25% and the probability of three consecutive miscarriages is 0.34%.

The physical symptoms of a miscarriage vary according to the length of pregnancy, though most miscarriages cause pain or cramping. The size of blood clots and pregnancy tissue that are passed become larger with longer gestations. After 13 weeks' gestation, there is a higher risk of placenta retention.&lt;ref name="ausbirth"&gt;{{cite web| date=October 2004| title=miscarriage| url=http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=6620&amp;page=13| accessdate=3 January 2014| author=Home page at www.birth.com.au| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201112940/http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=6620&amp;page=13| archivedate=December 1, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Prevention of a miscarriage can sometimes be accomplished by decreasing risk factors.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; This may include good [[prenatal care]], avoiding drugs and alcohol, preventing infectious diseases, and avoiding x-rays.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; Identifying the cause of the miscarriage may help prevent future pregnancy loss, especially in cases of recurrent miscarriage. Often there is little a person can do to prevent a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; Vitamin supplementation before or during pregnancy has not been found to affect the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2016|title=Vitamin supplementation for preventing miscarriage|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=5|issue=5|pages=CD004073|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004073.pub4|pmid=27150280|vauthors=Balogun OO, da Silva Lopes K, Ota E, Takemoto Y, Rumbold A, Takegata M, Mori R|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modifiable risk factors===
Maintaining a healthy weight and good pre-natal care can reduce the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Some risk factors can be minimized by avoiding the following:
*Smoking&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paternal smoking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*Cocaine use&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;

*Drug abuse&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Management==
Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not require any subsequent medical treatment but they can benefit from support and counseling.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jeve"/&gt; Most early miscarriages will complete on their own; in other cases, medication treatment or aspiration of the products of conception can be used to remove remaining tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1039515/understanding-early-miscarriage#ixzz2x52G1IYu |title=Understanding early miscarriage |date=January 2017 |accessdate=June 4, 2017 |publisher=BabyCenter, L.L.C. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905095051/https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1039515/understanding-early-miscarriage#ixzz2x52G1IYu |archivedate=September 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[bed rest]] has been advocated to prevent miscarriage, this has not been found to be of benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christina A.|last1=McCall|first2=David A.|last2=Grimes|first3=Anne Drapkin|last3=Lyerly|title="Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=1 June 2013|issn=1873-233X|pages=1305–1308|volume=121|issue=6|pmid=23812466|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e318293f12f}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffman|page = 176}} Those who are or who have experienced an abortion benefit from the use of careful medical language.

===Methods===
No treatment is necessary for a diagnosis of complete miscarriage (so long as ectopic pregnancy is ruled out). In cases of an incomplete miscarriage, empty sac, or missed abortion there are three treatment options: watchful waiting, medical management, and surgical treatment. With no treatment ([[watchful waiting]]), most miscarriages (65–80%) will pass naturally within two to six weeks.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kripke C | title = Expectant management vs. surgical treatment for miscarriage | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 74 | issue = 7 | pages = 1125–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17039747 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/1001/p1125.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140525195924/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/1001/p1125.html | archivedate = May 25, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment avoids the possible side effects and complications of medications and surgery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tang OS, Ho PC | title = The use of misoprostol for early pregnancy failure | journal = Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 581–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17099326 | doi = 10.1097/GCO.0b013e32800feedb }}&lt;/ref&gt; but increases the risk of mild bleeding, need for unplanned surgical treatment, and incomplete miscarriage. Medical treatment usually consists of using [[misoprostol]] (a [[prostaglandin]]) to contract the uterus, expelling remaining tissue out of the cervix. This works within a few days in 95% of cases.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;  Vacuum aspiration or sharp curettage can be used, though vacuum aspiration is lower-risk and more common.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;

===Delayed and incomplete miscarriage===
In delayed or incomplete miscarriage, treatment depends on the amount of tissue remaining in the uterus. Treatment can include surgical removal of the tissue with [[vacuum aspiration]] or [[misoprostol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333519/|title=Surgery for Family Planning, Abortion, and Postabortion Care|last=Babigumira|first=Joseph B.|last2=Vlassoff|first2=Michael|last3=Ahimbisibwe|first3=Asa|last4=Stergachis|first4=Andy|date=2015-01-01|publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank|isbn=9781464803468|editor-last=Debas|editor-first=Haile T.|location=Washington (DC)|pmid=26741012|editor-last2=Donkor|editor-first2=Peter|editor-last3=Gawande|editor-first3=Atul|editor-last4=Jamison|editor-first4=Dean T.|editor-last5=Kruk|editor-first5=Margaret E.|editor-last6=Mock|editor-first6=Charles N.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910181311/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333519/|archivedate=September 10, 2017|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1596/978-1-4648-0346-8_ch7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies looking at the methods of anaesthesia for surgical management of incomplete miscarriage have not shown that any adaptation from normal practice is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calvache|first1=JA|last2=Delgado-Noguera|first2=MF|last3=Lesaffre|first3=E|last4=Stolker|first4=RJ|title=Anaesthesia for evacuation of incomplete miscarriage|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=18 April 2012|issue=4|pages=CD008681|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008681.pub2|pmid=22513963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations recommend delaying sexual relations immediately after a miscarriage to prevent [[infection]].&lt;ref name="misorg" /&gt; However, there is not sufficient evidence for the routine use of antibiotic to try to avoid infection in incomplete abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=May|first1=W|last2=Gülmezoglu|first2=AM|last3=Ba-Thike|first3=K|title=Antibiotics for incomplete abortion|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=17 October 2007|issue=4|pages=CD001779|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001779.pub2|pmid=17943756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent pregnancies===
Some parents want to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The decision of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and want to know about the risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one [[menstrual cycle]] before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage or [[molar pregnancy]], or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.&lt;ref name="misorg"/&gt;

The risks of having another miscarriage vary according to the cause. The risk of having another miscarriage after a molar pregnancy is very low. The risk of another miscarriage is highest after the third miscarriage. Pre-conception care is available in some locales.&lt;ref name="misorg" /&gt;

===Later cardiovascular disease===
There is a significant association between miscarriage and later development of [[coronary artery disease]], but not of [[cerebrovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oliver-Williams CT, Heydon EE, Smith GC, Wood AM | title = Miscarriage and future maternal cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Heart | volume = 99 | issue = 22 | pages = 1636–1644 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23539554 | pmc = 3812894 | doi = 10.1136/heartjnl-2012-303237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffman|page = 172}}

==Epidemiology==
Among women who know they are pregnant, the miscarriage rate is roughly 10% to 20%, while rates among all [[Fertilisation|fertilized zygotes]] are around 30% to 50%.&lt;ref name="John2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NIH2013Epi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="jeve" /&gt; A 2012 review found the risk of miscarriage between 5 and 20 weeks from 11% to 22%.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt; Up to the 13th week of pregnancy, the risk of miscarriage each week was around 2%, dropping to 1% in week 14 and reducing slowly between 14 and 20 weeks.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt;

The precise rate is not known because a large number of miscarriages occur before pregnancies become established and before the woman is aware they are pregnant.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ammon Avalos L, Galindo C, Li DK | title = A systematic review to calculate background miscarriage rates using life table analysis | journal = Birth Defects Research. Part A, Clinical and Molecular Teratology | volume = 94 | issue = 6 | pages = 417–23 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22511535 | doi = 10.1002/bdra.23014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, those with bleeding in early pregnancy may seek medical care more often than those not experiencing bleeding.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012" /&gt; Although some studies attempt to account for this by recruiting women who are planning pregnancies and testing for very early pregnancy, they still are not representative of the wider population.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012" /&gt;

The prevalence of miscarriage increases with the age of both parents.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nybo Andersen AM, Wohlfahrt J, Christens P, Olsen J, Melbye M | title = Maternal age and fetal loss: Population based register linkage study | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7251 | pages = 1708–12 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10864550 | pmc = 27416 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7251.1708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kleinhaus K, Perrin M, Friedlander Y, Paltiel O, Malaspina D, Harlap S | title = Paternal Age and Spontaneous Abortion | journal = Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 369–77 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16880308 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000224606.26514.3a }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Slama R, Bouyer J, Windham G, Fenster L, Werwatz A, Swan SH | title = Influence of Paternal Age on the Risk of Spontaneous Abortion | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 161 | issue = 9 | pages = 816–23 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15840613 | doi = 10.1093/aje/kwi097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Danish register-based study where the prevalence of miscarriage was 11%, the prevalence rose from 9% at 22 years of age to 84% by 48 years of age.&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt;{{Update inline|date=October 2017}} Another, later study in 2013 found that when either parent was over the age of 40, the rate of known miscarriages doubled.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

In 2010, 50,000 inpatient admissions for miscarriage occurred in the UK.&lt;ref name="radford" /&gt;

==Terminology==
Most affected women and family members refer to miscarriage as the loss of a baby, rather than an embryo or fetus, and healthcare providers are expected to respect and use the language that the person chooses.&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt; Clinical terms can suggest blame, increase distress, and even cause anger. Terms that are known to cause distress in those experiencing miscarriage include:

* ''abortion'' (including ''spontaneous abortion'') rather than miscarriage, 
* ''habitual aborter'' rather than a woman experiencing [[recurrent pregnancy loss]], 
* ''products of conception'' rather than [[baby]], 
* ''blighted ovum'' rather than early pregnancy loss or delayed miscarriage, 
* ''cervical incompetence'' rather than [[cervical weakness]], and 
* ''evacuation of retained products of conception'' (ERPC) rather than [[surgical management of miscarriage]].&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt;

''Pregnancy loss'' is a broad term that describes miscarriage, ectopic and molar pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt; The term ''[[fetal death]]'' applies variably in different countries and contexts, sometimes incorporating weight, and gestational age from 16 weeks in Norway, 20 weeks in the US and Australia, 24 weeks in the UK to 26 weeks in Italy and Spain.&lt;ref name="Mohangoo-2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mohangoo AD, Blondel B, Gissler M, Velebil P, Macfarlane A, Zeitlin J | title = International comparisons of fetal and neonatal mortality rates in high-income countries: should exclusion thresholds be based on birth weight or gestational age? | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = e64869 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23700489 | pmc = 3658983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0064869 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...864869M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIHW-2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Z|title=Australia's Mothers and Babies 2010|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=60129542372|website=Perinatal statistics series no. 27.

==History==

Some medical authors advocated change to use of ''miscarriage'' instead of ''spontaneous abortion'' because they argued this would be more respectful and help ease a distressing experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beard RW, Mowbray JF, Pinker GD | title = Miscarriage or abortion | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8464 | pages = 1122–3 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2865589 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(85)90709-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutchon DJ, Cooper S | title = Terminology for early pregnancy loss must be changed | journal = BMJ | volume = 317 | issue = 7165 | pages = 1081 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9774309 | pmc = 1114078 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.317.7165.1081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=October 2017}} The change was being recommended by some in the profession in Britain in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=Hutchon-1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutchon DJ, Cooper S | title = Terminology for early pregnancy loss must be changed | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 317 | issue = 7165 | pages = 1081 | date = Oct 17, 1998 | pmid = 9774309 | pmc = 1114078 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.317.7165.1081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) published a paper aiming to facilitate a revision of nomenclature used to describe early pregnancy events.&lt;ref name=Farquharson&gt;{{cite journal | author = Farquharson RG, Jauniaux E, Exalto N | title = Updated and revised nomenclature for description of early pregnancy events | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 20 | issue = 11 | pages = 3008–11 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16006453 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/dei167 | author4 = ESHRE Special Interest Group for Early Pregnancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Society's reactions to miscarriage changed over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;In the early 20th century, the focus was on the mother's physical health and the difficulties and disabilities that miscarriage could produce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Other reactions, such as the expense of medical treatments and relief at ending an unwanted pregnancy, were also heard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s, people were more likely to express relief, not because the miscarriage ended an unwanted or mistimed pregnancy, but because people believed that miscarriages were primarily caused by birth defects, and miscarrying meant that the family would not raise a child with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dominant attitude in the mid-century was that a miscarriage, although temporarily distressing, was a blessing in disguise for the family, and that another pregnancy and a healthier baby would soon follow, especially if women trusted physicians and reduced their anxieties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Media articles were illustrated with pictures of babies, and magazine articles about miscarriage ended by introducing the healthy baby—usually a boy—that had shortly followed it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Beginning in the 1980s, miscarriage in the US was primarily framed in terms of the individual woman's personal emotional reaction, and especially her grief over a tragic outcome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The subject was portrayed in the media with images of an empty crib or an isolated, grieving woman, and stories about miscarriage were published in general-interest media outlets, not just [[women's magazines]] or health magazines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Family members were encouraged to grieve, to memorialize their losses through funerals and other rituals, and to think of themselves as being parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;This shift to recognizing these emotional responses was partly due to medical and political successes, which created an expectation that pregnancies are typically planned and safe, and to women's demands that their emotional reactions no longer be dismissed by the medical establishments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;It also reinforces the [[Pro-Life movement|pro-life movement's]] belief that human life begins at conception or early in pregnancy, and that [[Pronatalism|motherhood is a desirable life goal]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The modern one-size-fits-all model of grief does not fit every woman's experience, and an expectation to [[Performativity|perform]] grief creates unnecessary burdens for some women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reframing of miscarriage as a private emotional experience brought less awareness of miscarriage and a sense of silence around the subject, especially compared to the public discussion of miscarriage during campaigns for access to birth control during the early 20th century, or the public campaigns to prevent miscarriages, stillbirths, and infant deaths by reducing industrial pollution during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/the-history-of-talking-about-miscarriage.html|title=The History of Talking About Miscarriage|last=Blei|first=Daniela|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In places where induced abortion is illegal or carries social stigma, suspicion may surround miscarriage, complicating an already sensitive issue.

In the 1960s, the use of the word ''miscarriage'' in Britain (instead of ''spontaneous abortion'') occurred after changes in legislation.

Developments in ultrasound technology (in the early 1980s) allowed them to identify earlier miscarriages.&lt;ref name="pmid23429567" /&gt;

According to French statutes, an infant born before the age of viability, determined to be 28 weeks, is not registered as a 'child'. If birth occurs after this, the infant is granted a certificate that allows women who have given birth to a stillborn child, to have a symbolic record of that child. This certificate can include a registered and given name with the purpose of allowing a funeral and acknowledgement of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Communiqué de presse de [[Rachida Dati]], Garde des Sceaux, ministre de la Justice et de [[Roselyne Bachelot|Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin]], ministre de la Santé, de la Jeunesse, des Sports et de la Vie associative, « Possibilité de demande d’un acte d’enfant sans vie », 22 août 2008, [http://www.sante.gouv.fr/possibilite-de-demande-d-un-acte-d-enfant-sans-vie.html lire en ligne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.service-public.fr/|title=Accueil Particuliers {{!}} service-public.fr|website=www.service-public.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Décret n°74-449 du 15 mai 1974 relatif au livret de famille et à l'information des futurs époux sur le droit de la famille - Article 9|date=15 May 1974|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006285245&amp;cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000328986|accessdate=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
{{anchor|In animals}}
Miscarriage occurs in all animals that experience pregnancy, though in such contexts it is more commonly referred to as a "spontaneous abortion" (the two terms are synonymous). There are a variety of known risk factors in non-human animals. For example, in sheep, miscarriage may be caused by crowding through doors, or being chased by dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, James.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RXMuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=abortion+and+husbandry&amp;ct=result#PPA124,M1 Sheep Husbandry in Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924203629/https://books.google.com/books?id=RXMuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=abortion+and+husbandry&amp;ct=result |date=September 24, 2015 }}'', page 124 (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; In cows, spontaneous abortion may be caused by contagious disease, such as [[brucellosis]] or ''[[Campylobacter]]'', but often can be controlled by vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/B/BeefCattleAndBeefProduction/ManagementAndHusbandryOfBeefCattle/en "Beef cattle and Beef production: Management and Husbandry of Beef Cattle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101142401/http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/B/BeefCattleAndBeefProduction/ManagementAndHusbandryOfBeefCattle/en |date=January 1, 2009 }}, ''Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;  In many species of sharks and rays, stress induced miscarriage occurs frequently on capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Kye R.|last2=Fetterplace|first2=Lachlan C.|last3=Davis|first3=Andrew R.|last4=Taylor|first4=Matthew D.|last5=Knott|first5=Nathan A.|title=Sharks, rays and abortion: The prevalence of capture-induced parturition in elasmobranchs|journal=Biological Conservation|date=January 2018|volume=217|pages=11–27|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2017.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other diseases are also known to make animals susceptible to miscarriage. Spontaneous abortion occurs in pregnant [[prairie vole]]s when their mate is removed and they are exposed to a new male,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fraser-Smith AC | title = Male-induced pregnancy termination in the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster | journal = Science | volume = 187 | issue = 4182 | pages = 1211–3 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1114340 | doi = 10.1126/science.1114340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an example of the [[Bruce effect]], although this effect is seen less in wild populations than in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00265-002-0484-0 |title=A field test of the Bruce effect in the monogamous prairie vole (''Microtus ochrogaster'') |year=2002 |last1=Mahady |first1=Scott |last2=Wolff |first2=Jerry |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=31–7 |jstor=4602102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female mice who had spontaneous abortions showed a sharp rise in the amount of time spent with unfamiliar males preceding the abortion than those who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Becker SD, Hurst JL | title = Female behaviour plays a critical role in controlling murine pregnancy block | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 276 | issue = 1662 | pages = 1723–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19324836 | pmc = 2660991 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2008.1780 | jstor = 30245000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1981–2000==
In 1981 Torella and Morita described very small cells called [[ultramicrobacteria]]. Defined as being smaller than 300&amp;nbsp;nm, by 1982 MacDonell and Hood found that some could pass through a 200&amp;nbsp;nm membrane. Early in 1989, geologist Robert L. Folk found what he later identified as ''nannobacteria'' (written with double "n"), that is, nanoparticles isolated from geological specimens&lt;ref&gt;A convention has been adopted between researchers to name -or spell- the nanoparticles isolated from geological specimens as ''nannobacteria'', and those from biological specimens as ''nanobacteria''.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[travertine]] from hot springs of [[Viterbo]], Italy.  Initially searching for a bacterial cause for travertine deposition, [[scanning electron microscope]] examination of the mineral where no bacteria were detectable revealed extremely small objects which appeared to be biological.&lt;!-- 1989 find: Dark Life, pg 44 --&gt;  His first oral presentation elicited what he called "mostly a stony silence", at the 1992 [[Geological Society of America]]'s annual convention.&lt;ref name="Folk1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalscience.com/ns/articles/01-03/ns_folk.html|title=Nanobacteria: surely not figments, but what under heaven are they?|last=Folk|first=Robert L.|date=March 4, 1997|publisher=naturalSCIENCE|accessdate=2008-12-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209035746/http://naturalscience.com/ns/articles/01-03/ns_folk.html|archivedate=December 9, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that nanobacteria are the principal agents of precipitation of all minerals and crystals on Earth formed in liquid water, that they also cause all oxidation of metals, and that they are abundant in many biological specimens.&lt;ref name="Folk1997" /&gt;

In 1996, NASA scientist [[David S. McKay|David McKay]] published a study suggesting the existence of nanofossils — fossils of Martian nanobacteria — in [[ALH84001]], a meteorite originating from Mars and found in Antarctica.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKay |first=David S. |year=1996 |title=Search for Past Life on Mars: Possible Relic Biogenic Activity in Martian Meteorite ALH84001 |journal=Science |volume=273 |issue=5277 |pages=924–930 |doi=10.1126/science.273.5277.924 |url=|pmid=8688069 |bibcode=1996Sci...273..924M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nanobacterium sanguineum'' was proposed in 1998 as an explanation of certain kinds of pathologic [[calcification]] ([[apatite]] in [[kidney stone]]s) by [[Finland|Finnish]] researcher [[Olavi Kajander]] and [[Turkey (country)|Turkish]] researcher [[Neva Ciftcioglu]], working at the [[University of Kuopio]] in Finland. According to the researchers the particles [[Self-replication|self-replicated]] in [[microbiological culture]], and the researchers further reported having identified [[DNA]] in these structures by staining.&lt;ref name=Kajander&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kajander E, Ciftçioglu N |title=Nanobacteria: An alternative mechanism for pathogenic intra- and extracellular calcification and stone formation |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/95/14/8274 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=95 |issue=14 |pages=8274–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9653177 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.14.8274 |pmc=20966|bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.8274K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper published in 2000 by a team led by an [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] scientist [[John Cisar]] further tested these ideas. It stated that what had previously been described as "self-replication" was a form of [[Crystal structure|crystalline]] growth. The only DNA detected in his specimens was identified as coming from the bacteria ''[[Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum]]'', which is a common contaminant in PCR reactions.&lt;ref name=Cisar &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cisar J, Xu D, Thompson J, Swaim W, Hu L, Kopecko D |title=An alternative interpretation of nanobacteria-induced biomineralization |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/21/11511 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=97 |issue=21 |pages=11511–5 |year=2000 |pmid=11027350 |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.21.11511 |pmc=17231 |bibcode=2000PNAS...9711511C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2001–present==
In 2004 a [[Mayo Clinic]] team led by Franklin Cockerill, John Lieske, and Virginia M. Miller, reported to have isolated nanobacteria from diseased human [[artery|arteries]] and [[kidney stone]]s. Their results were published in 2004 and 2006 respectively.&lt;ref name=mayo1 &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller V, Rodgers G, Charlesworth J, Kirkland B, Severson S, Rasmussen T, Yagubyan M, Rodgers J, Cockerill F, Folk R, Rzewuska-Lech E, Kumar V, Farell-Baril G, Lieske J |title=Evidence of nanobacterial-like structures in calcified human arteries and cardiac valves |url=http://ajpheart.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/287/3/H1115 |journal=Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol |volume=287 |issue=3 |pages=H1115–24 |year=2004 |pmid=15142839 |doi=10.1152/ajpheart.00075.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo2 &gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kumar V, Farell G, Yu S, etal |title=Cell biology of pathologic renal calcification: contribution of crystal transcytosis, cell-mediated calcification, and nanoparticles |journal=J.

Dr. Puskás identified these particles in cultures obtained from human atherosclerotic aortic walls and blood samples of atherosclerotic patients but the group was unable to detect DNA in these samples.&lt;ref name=puskas &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Puskás L, Tiszlavicz L, Rázga Z, Torday L, Krenács T, Papp J |title=Detection of nanobacteria-like particles in human atherosclerotic plaques |journal=Acta Biol Hung |volume=56 |issue=3–4 |pages=233–45 |year=2005 |pmid=16196199 |doi=10.1556/ABiol.56.2005.3-4.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Ciftcioglu and her research team at [[NASA]] used a rotating [[cell culture]] flask, which simulates some aspects of low-gravity conditions, to culture nanobacteria suspected of rapidly forming kidney stones in astronauts. In this environment, they were found to multiply five times faster than in normal Earth gravity. The study concluded that nanobacteria might have a potential role in forming kidney stones and may need to be screened for in crews pre-flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciftçioglu N, Haddad R, Golden D, Morrison D, McKay D |title=A potential cause for kidney stone formation during space flights: enhanced growth of nanobacteria in microgravity |journal=Kidney Int |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=483–91 |year=2005 |pmid=15673296 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.67105.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The February 2008 ''Public Library of Science (PLoS) Pathogens'' article focused on the comprehensive characterization of nanobacteria. The authors say that their results rule out the existence of nanobacteria as [[Life|living]] entities and that they are instead a unique [[Plant propagation|self-propagating]] entity, namely self-propagating mineral-[[fetuin]] complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Raoult D, Drancourt M, Azza S, etal |title=Nanobacteria Are Mineralo Fetuin Complexes |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e41 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18282102 |pmc=2242841 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0040041 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2008 ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)'' article also reported that blood nanobacteria are not living organisms and stated that "CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; precipitates prepared ''in vitro'' are remarkably similar to purported nanobacteria in terms of their uniformly sized, membrane-delineated vesicular shapes, with cellular division-like formations and aggregations in the form of colonies."&lt;ref name="Martel J, Young JD 2008 5549–54"/&gt; The growth of such "biomorphic" inorganic precipitates was studied in detail in a 2009 ''Science'' paper, which showed that unusual crystal growth mechanisms can produce [[witherite]] precipitates from barium chloride and silica solutions that closely resemble primitive organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=García-Ruiz JM, Melero-García E, Hyde ST |title=Morphogenesis of self-assembled nanocrystalline materials of barium carbonate and silica |journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5912 |pages=362–5 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19150841 |doi=10.1126/science.1165349 |url=http://garciaruiz.com/biomorphs/Science_2009_files/Morphogenesis%20of%20Self-Assembled%20Nanocrystalline_JM_science_2009_1.pdf|bibcode = 2009Sci...323..362G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors commented on the close resemblance of these crystals to putative nanobacteria, stating that their results showed that evidence for life cannot rest on morphology alone.

Further work on the importance of nanobacteria in geology by R. L. Folk and co-workers includes study of calcium carbonate Bahama ooids,&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Lynch. FL (2001) Organic matter, putative nanobacteria and the formation of oolites and hard grounds, Sedimentology, 48:215-229.&lt;/ref&gt; silicate clay minerals,&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Lynch, FL, (1997) The possible role of nanobacteria (dwarf bacteria) in clay-mineral diagenesis, Journal of Sedimentary Research, 67:583-589.&lt;/ref&gt; metal sulfides,&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL (2005) nanobacteria and the formation of framboidal pyrite, Journal Earth System Science, 114:369-374&lt;/ref&gt; and iron oxides.&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Carlin J (2006) Adventures in an iron birdbath: nanostructure of iron oxide and the nanobacteria connection, Geological Society of America, Abstracts with programs, v. 38 (3), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In all these chemically diverse minerals, the putative nanobacteria are approximately the same size, mainly 0.05 to 0.2&amp;nbsp;μm. This suggests a commonality of origin. At least for the type locality at Viterbo, Italy, the biogenicity of these minute cells has been supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, B and Lynch, FL (2005) nanobacteria, Big Foot and the Loch Ness Monster—what are you supposed to believe?, Geological Society of America, abs. with progr., v. 37:253.&lt;/ref&gt; Slices through a green bioslime showed entities from 0.4 down to as small as 0.09&amp;nbsp;μm with definite cell walls and interior dots resembling ribosomes; and even smaller objects with cell walls and lucent interiors with diameters of 0.05&amp;nbsp;μm.&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Kirkland, B, (2007) On the smallness of life: new TEM evidence from biofilm in hot springs, Viterbo, Italy, Geological Society of America, abs. with proper., v. 39 (6) 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Culturable organisms on earth are the same 0.05&amp;nbsp;μm size as the supposed nanobacteria on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Taylor, L (2002) nanobacterial alteration of pyroxenes in Martian meteorite ALH84001, Meteorology and Planetary Science, v. 37:1057-1070.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noble Ape''' is an [[artificial life]] development project launched in June, 1996 by [[Tom Barbalet]]. It was designed to be a forum for a diversity of contributors to work towards a coherent [[cognitive]] [[simulation]] development environment.&lt;ref name="FIRST"&gt;{{cite web

==The Simulation==
The central software of the project is the [http://www.nobleape.com/sim/ Noble Ape Simulation], based on the ideas outlined in [http://www.nobleape.com/man/philosophic.html Noble Ape Philosophic]. There are two primary aims of the Simulation;
* to simulate the biological environment the Noble Apes inhabit, and,
* to simulate the Noble Apes' [[cognitive]] processes.&lt;ref name="SECOND"&gt;{{cite web

==Music==

Noble Ape received a grant from the [[Australian Film Commission]] in 1998. Barbalet used this money to buy computer hardware and record an audio CD/CDROM, ''Isle of the Apes''. Having returned from the US at the end of 1998, Barbalet recorded the second CD/CDROM, ''Mind Monkeys and Purrfect Beats'' (sic). A collection of tracks from these CDs were released on the 2018 digital compilation ''Noble Ape: Project Music''. In mid-2018, Barbalet released the single ''June 13 (This is Noble Ape)'' to address some of the challenges the development has experienced over twenty two years.&lt;ref name="TENTH"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2018-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video Project==

To celebrate twenty-two years of continuous development, Barbalet undertook an at-least a video per day [[vlog]] project documenting many different aspects of Noble Ape that had not been previously talked about. Barbalet noted that the reason to do this on [[YouTube]] and [[Instagram]] was to introduce a new audience to his work.&lt;ref name="ELEVENTH"&gt;{{cite web

==Sub-Projects==

Noble Ape provided the core of six different sub-projects that had been developed by Barbalet and others through the Noble Ape development history. These six sub-projects are actively maintained under the Noble Ape development.&lt;ref name="TWELTH"&gt;{{cite web

Noble Warfare was developed by Barbalet in [[Wilmslow]] in Cheshire. Inspired by [[Lindow Man]], Barbalet reflected on the impact unwritten wars had through history on a local population. He was also inspired by the [[Total War (series)]] of video games. Noble Warfare pits two armies defined through an [[ApeScript]]-like interface and shows how the resolution of the battles can be covered by many different probabilistic outcomes.

===Mushroom Boy===

The early development of the Mushroom Boy came from Barbalet's time in [[Canberra]], Australia. The simulation is based in a vast [[suburb]]-based landscape and uses a number of core technologies in Noble Ape to create the environment and the entities that wander through the suburban environment. The name comes from an urban terrorism simulation Barbalet initially developed with the sub-project.

===Planet Noble Ape===

Planet Noble Ape was initially developed by Barbalet in [[Sunnyvale]], California. It provides the Noble Ape Simulation as part of a planetary simulation.

===Ecosim===

Ecosim takes the ideas of the Noble Ape Simulation and creates an educational tool specifically developed to highlight concepts in biodiversity. It was developed by Barbalet in 1997-1998 based on correspondence with a high school science teacher in Australia who wanted to have a tool to teach biodiversity based on Barbalet's work with Noble Ape.

===Noble Ape Skeleton===

This sub-project comes from the work of Bob Mottram to create a [[skeleton]] and [[vascular]] simulation based on the Noble Ape Simulation. The sub-project is based on taking Mottram's work and re-integrating it with the ongoing development.

===Noble Insect===

Noble Insect came from Barbalet's time in [[Las Vegas]], Nevada. It is based on taking an [[insect brain]] and simulating that interaction with ideas and concepts developed through Noble Ape.

'''''Phaedon''''' ({{lang-de|Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele}}), published in 1767, is a book by the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]], in which Mendelssohn offers a defense of [[immortality]].&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Lenn E. |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
''Phaedon'' is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul.&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popkind"&gt;{{cite book |author=Popkin, Richard H. |editor=Audi, Robert |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1999 |isbn=0-521-63722-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue [[Phaedo]], in which [[Socrates]] argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including [[Plotinus]], [[Descartes]], and [[Leibniz]], argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the ''Phaedon'', Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that [[Kant]] calls ''the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology''). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.

==Reception==
Materialistic views were at the time rampant and fashionable, and faith in immortality was at a low ebb. At this favourable juncture appeared Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele (Phaedo or On the Immortality of Souls; 1767). Modelled on [[Plato]]'s dialogue of the same name, Mendelssohn's work possessed some of the charm of its Greek exemplar and impressed the German world with its beauty and lucidity of style. The Phaedon was an immediate success, and besides being one of the most widely read books of its time in German it was speedily translated into several European languages, including English. The author was hailed as the "German Plato," or the "German Socrates"; royal and other aristocratic friends showered attentions on him, and it was said that "no stranger who came to Berlin failed to pay his personal respects to the German Socrates."

[[Immanuel Kant]] criticized Mendelssohn's argument for immortality in the second edition of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787), at B413–15. Commentators disagree over whether Kant's criticism is successful. Mendelssohn's arguments have been largely overlooked by contemporary analytic philosophers, but philosophers including [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[E.J. Lowe]] have offered arguments for the simplicity of the soul.

[[File:Dilthey1-4.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Wilhelm Dilthey]]]]

There are at least two senses in which the term [[philosophy]] is used: a formal and an informal sense. In the formal sense, philosophy is an academic study of the fields of [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], as well as [[Social philosophy|social]] and [[political philosophy]]. One's "'''philosophy of life'''" is philosophy in the informal sense, as a personal philosophy, whose focus is resolving the [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fetler, ''Philosophy and Philosophy of Religion Charts'', Sun Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  

"Philosophy of life" also refers to a specific conception of philosophizing as a [[way of life]],&lt;ref name="Hadot"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/hadot/ Pierre Hadot (1922-2010)] by Matthew Sharpe in the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by the German ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' movement whose main representative is [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott Campbell, Paul W. Bruno (eds.), ''The Science, Politics, and Ontology of Life-Philosophy'', Bloomsbury, 2013, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and several other [[Continental philosophers]] such as [[Henri Bergson]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Chase, Stephen R. L. Clark, Michael McGhee (eds.), ''Philosophy as a Way of Life: Ancients and Moderns – Essays in Honor of Pierre Hadot'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Hadot]].&lt;ref name="Hadot"/&gt;

==The human situation==
{{prose|section|date=April 2013}}

{{Main|Human situation}}
The human situation appears to be a struggle between what ''is'' (existence) and what ''ought'' (essence) to be.
* [[Normative situation]]s&amp;nbsp;– [[Alternative lifestyle|Alternatives]], [[Choice]], [[Liberty|Freedom]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|Values]], [[Moral code|Standards]], [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideals]], [[Obligation]], [[Moral responsibility|Responsibility]]
* [[Existential predicament]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Finitude]], [[Social alienation|Alienation]], [[Anxiety]], [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]], [[Ambivalence]], [[Thrownness]]

==Main answers to the existential question==
There are at least three prevailing theories on how to respond to the existential question.

===Denial of essence===
* [[Nihilism]], denial of meaning

===Denial of existence===
* [[Essentialism]]

===Affirmation of life===
* [[Secular humanism]]
* [[Religion]]

==Religion as an attempt to overcome the existential predicament==
There are two basic forms of [[existentialism]]:

===Religious existentialism===
{{Main|Christian existentialism}}

Religious existentialism is best exemplified by [[St. Augustine]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Paul Tillich]], and the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. Religious existentialism holds that there are two levels of reality, essence, which is the ground of [[being]], and existence. Religion is the ultimate concern in this view.

===Atheistic existentialism===
{{Main|Atheistic existentialism}}

Atheistic existentialism is best exemplified by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. It holds that there is one level of reality, existence. In this view, each person constructs his own unique and temporary essence.

[[File:Phoenix-Fabelwesen.jpg|thumb|right|A phoenix depicted in a book of legendary creatures by [[Friedrich Justin Bertuch|FJ Bertuch]] (1747–1822)]]
In [[Greek mythology]], a '''phoenix''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|n|ᵻ|k|s}}; {{lang-grc|φοῖνιξ}}, ''phoînix'') is a long-lived [[bird]] that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. 

Associated with the Sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the [[ash]]es of its predecessor. According to some sources, the phoenix dies in a show of flames and combustion, although there are other sources that claim that the legendary bird dies and simply decomposes before being born again.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA146 146]}} There are different traditions concerning the lifespan of the phoenix, but by most accounts the phoenix lived for  500 years before rebirth.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA67 67&amp;ndash;70]}} [[Herodotus]], [[Lucan]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pope Clement I]], [[Lactantius]], [[Ovid]], and [[Isidore of Seville]] are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of the phoenix motif.

In the historical record, the phoenix "could symbolize renewal in general as well as the sun, time, [[Roman Empire|the Empire]], [[metempsychosis]], [[consecration]], [[resurrection]], life in the heavenly [[Paradise]], [[Christ (title)|Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], [[virginity]], the exceptional man, and certain aspects of Christian life".{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9 9]}}

==Etymology==
The modern English noun ''phoenix'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''phenix'' (before 1150), itself from [[Old English]] ''fēnix'' (around 750). Old English ''fēnix'' was borrowed from Medieval Latin ''phenix'', which is derived from Classical Latin ''phoenīx''. The Classical Latin ''phoenīx'' represents Greek φοῖνιξ ''phoinīx''.{{Sfn | Barnhart | 1995 | p = 564}}

In ancient Greece and Rome, the bird, phoenix, was sometimes associated with the similar-sounding [[Phoenicia]], a civilization famous for its production of purple dye from conch shells. A late antique etymology offered by the 6th- and 7th-century CE archbishop [[Isidore of Seville]] accordingly derives the name of the phoenix from its allegedly purple-red hue. Because the costly purple dye from Phoenicia was associated with the upper classes in antiquity and, later, with royalty, in the medieval period the phoenix was considered "the royal bird".{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 51}}

In spite of these [[folk etymology|folk etymologies]], with the deciphering of the [[Linear B]] script in the 20th century, the original Greek φοῖνιξ was decisively shown to be derived from [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''po-ni-ke'', itself open to a variety of interpretations.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 62–66}}

==Relation to the Egyptian Bennu==
Classical discourse on the subject of the phoenix points to a potential origin of the phoenix in [[Ancient Egypt]]. In the 19th century scholastic suspicions appeared to be confirmed by the discovery that Egyptians in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] had venerated the [[Bennu]], a solar bird observed in some respects to be similar to the Greek phoenix.  However, the Egyptian sources regarding the bennu are often problematic and open to a variety of interpretations. Some of these sources may have actually been influenced by Greek notions of the phoenix, rather than the other way around.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 14–25}}

[[Herodotus]], writing in the 5th century BC, gives a somewhat skeptical account of the phoenix:

{{quote|[The Egyptians] have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I myself have never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great rarity, even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix dies. Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as follow:– The plumage is partly red, partly golden, while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there buries the body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he hollows out the ball, and puts his parent inside, after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such is the story they tell of the doings of this bird.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.2.ii.html Book II] Trans. G. Rawlinson (1858)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Appearance==
[[File:Phoenix_detail_from_Aberdeen_Bestiary.jpg|thumb|right|Detail from the 12th-century ''[[Aberdeen Bestiary]]'', featuring a phoenix]]
The phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|nimbus]], which emphasizes the bird's connection with the Sun.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} In the oldest images of phoenixes on record these nimbuses often have seven rays, like [[Helios]] (the sun Titan of Greek mythology).{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 246–247}} Pliny the Elder&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Magic and the Supernatural in the Modern Visual and Performing Arts'', edited by Filippo CarlÁ,Irene Berti, page172&lt;/ref&gt; also describes the bird as having a crest of feathers on its head,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} and [[Ezekiel the Tragedian|Ezekiel the Dramatist]] compared it to a rooster.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}}

Although the phoenix was generally believed to be colorful and vibrant, sources provide no clear consensus about its coloration. [[Tacitus]] says that its color made it stand out from all other birds.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 253}} Some said that the bird had peacock-like coloring, and [[Herodotus]]'s claim of the Phoenix being red and yellow is popular in many versions of the story on record.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 259}} Ezekiel the Dramatist declared that the phoenix had red legs and striking yellow eyes,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}} but [[Lactantius]] said that its eyes were blue like sapphires{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 256}} and that its legs were covered in yellow-gold scales with rose-colored talons.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 257–258}}

Herodotus, Pliny, [[Solinus]], and [[Philostratus]] describe the phoenix as similar in size to an eagle,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 251}} but Lactantius and Ezekiel the Dramatist both claim that the phoenix was larger, with Lactantius declaring that it was even larger than an ostrich.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 252}}

==In later European culture==
[[Dante]] refers to the phoenix in ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' Canto XXIV:
{{Verse translation|lang=it|
&lt;poem&gt;Così per li gran savi si confessa
che la fenice more e poi rinasce,
quando al cinquecentesimo anno appressa;

erba né biado in sua vita non pasce,
ma sol d’incenso lagrime e d’amomo,
e nardo e mirra son l’ultime fasce.&lt;/poem&gt;
|attr1=In the [[:s:it:Divina Commedia/Inferno/Canto XXIV|original Italian]]|
&lt;poem&gt;Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed
The phoenix dies, and then is born again,
When it approaches its five-hundredth year;

On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,
But only on tears of [[incense]] and [[amomum]],
And [[Spikenard|nard]] and [[myrrh]] are its last [[shroud|winding-sheet]].&lt;/poem&gt;
|attr2=In [[s:The Divine Comedy/Inferno/Canto XXIV|English translation]]
}}

In the play ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], the King says in [[s:The Life of King Henry the Eighth|Act V Scene v]], in flattering reference to his young daughter Elizabeth (who was to become [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]):

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
Her ashes new create another heir
As great in admiration as herself;
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
Shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was,
And so stand fix'd.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

'''Polyworld''' is a cross-platform ([[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]]) program written by [[Larry Yaeger]] to evolve [[Artificial Intelligence]] through [[natural selection]] and [[evolutionary algorithm]]s. 

It uses the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] graphics toolkit and [[OpenGL]] to display a graphical environment in which a population of trapezoid agents search for food, mate, have offspring, and prey on each other. The population is typically only in the hundreds, as each individual is rather complex and the environment consumes considerable computer resources. The graphical environment is necessary since the individuals actually move around the 2-D [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] and must be able to "see." Since some basic abilities, like eating carcasses or randomly generated food, seeing other individuals, mating or fighting with them, etc., are possible, a number of interesting behaviours have been observed to spontaneously arise after prolonged evolution, such as cannibalism, predators and prey, and mimicry.

Each individual makes decisions based on a [[neural net]] using [[Hebbian learning]]; the neural net is derived from each individual's genome. The genome does not merely specify the wiring of the neural nets, but also determines their size, speed, color, [[mutation rate]] and a number of other factors. The [[genome]] is randomly mutated at a set probability, which are also changed in descendant organisms.

[[File:Kalanchoe veg.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Production of new individuals along a leaf margin of the  miracle leaf plant (''[[Kalanchoe pinnata]]''). The small plant in front is about 1&amp;nbsp;cm (0.4&amp;nbsp;in) tall. The concept of "individual" is obviously stretched by this asexual reproductive process.]]
'''Reproduction''' (or '''procreation''' or '''breeding''') is the [[biological process]] by which new individual [[organism]]s – "offspring" – are produced from their "parents". Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known [[life]]; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. There are two forms of reproduction: [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] and [[Sexual reproduction|sexual]].

In asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. Asexual reproduction is not limited to [[unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]]. The [[cloning]] of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction. By asexual reproduction, an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. The [[evolution of sexual reproduction]] is a major puzzle for biologists. The two-fold cost of sexual reproduction is that only 50% of organisms reproduce&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; and organisms only pass on 50% of their [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual reproduction typically requires the sexual interaction of two specialized organisms, called [[gamete]]s, which contain half the number of [[chromosome]]s of normal cells and are created by [[meiosis]], with typically a male [[fertilization|fertilizing]] a female of the same [[species]] to create a fertilized [[zygote]]. This produces [[offspring]] organisms whose genetic characteristics are derived from those of the two parental organisms.

==Asexual==
{{Main article|Asexual reproduction}}
Asexual reproduction is a process by which organisms create genetically similar or identical copies of themselves without the contribution of genetic material from another organism. [[Bacteria]] divide asexually via [[binary fission]]; [[virus]]es take control of host cells to produce more viruses; [[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]] ([[invertebrate]]s of the [[Order (biology)|order]] ''Hydroidea'') and [[yeast]]s are able to reproduce by [[budding]]. These organisms often do not possess different sexes, and they are capable of "splitting" themselves into two or more copies of themselves. Most [[plant]]s have the ability to reproduce asexually and the ant species [[Mycocepurus smithii]] is thought to reproduce entirely by asexual means.

Some species that are capable of reproducing asexually, like [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], [[yeast]] (See [[Mating of yeast]]s) and [[jellyfish]], may also reproduce sexually. For instance, most plants are capable of [[vegetative reproduction]]—reproduction without seeds or spores—but can also reproduce sexually. Likewise, bacteria may exchange genetic information by [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]].

Other ways of asexual reproduction include [[parthenogenesis]], [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]] and [[spore formation]] that involves only [[mitosis]]. Parthenogenesis is the growth and development of [[embryo]] or [[seed]] without [[fertilization]] by a [[male]]. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in some species, including lower [[plant]]s (where it is called [[apomixis]]), [[invertebrate]]s (e.g. [[water flea]]s, [[aphid]]s, some [[bee]]s and [[parasitic wasp]]s), and [[vertebrate]]s (e.g. some
[[reptile]]s,&lt;ref name="reptiles"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Halliday | first1 = Tim R. | last2=Adler |first2=Kraig (eds.) | title = Reptiles &amp; Amphibians | publisher = Torstar Books |year= 1986

It is sometimes also used to describe reproduction modes in hermaphroditic species which can self-fertilize.

==Sexual==
{{Main article|Sexual reproduction}}
{{See also|Human reproduction}} 
[[File:Hoverflies mating midair.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hoverfly|Hoverflies]] mating in midair flight]]
Sexual reproduction is a [[biological process]] that creates a new [[organism]] by combining the [[Genetics|genetic]] material of two organisms in a process that starts with [[meiosis]], a specialized type of [[cell division]]. Each of two parent organisms contributes half of the offspring's genetic makeup by creating [[haploid]] [[gametes]]. Most organisms form two different types of gametes. In these '''''anisogamous''''' species, the two sexes are referred to as [[male]] (producing [[sperm]] or microspores) and [[female]] (producing [[ovum|ova]] or megaspores). In '''''isogamous species''''', the gametes are similar or identical in form ([[isogamete]]s), but may have separable properties and then may be given other different names (see [[isogamy]]). For example, in the green alga, ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'', there are so-called "plus" and "minus" gametes. A few types of organisms, such as many [[fungi]] and the [[ciliate]] ''Paramecium aurelia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T. M. Sonneborn |title= Mating Types in Paramecium Aurelia: Diverse Conditions for Mating in Different Stocks; Occurrence, Number and Interrelations of the Types. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 79, No. 3 (Sep. 30, 1938), pp. 411-434 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |jstor=984858}}&lt;/ref&gt; have more than two  "sexes", called [[syngen]]s.
Most [[animal]]s (including humans) and [[plants]] reproduce sexually. Sexually reproducing organisms have different sets of genes for every trait (called [[alleles]]). Offspring inherit one allele for each trait from each parent. Thus, offspring have a combination of the parents' genes. It is believed that "the masking of deleterious alleles favors the evolution of a dominant diploid phase in organisms that alternate between haploid and diploid phases" where recombination occurs freely.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Otto and D. B. Goldstein. "Recombination and the Evolution of Diploidy". [[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]. Vol 131 (1992): 745-751.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Hopf FA, Michod RE. (1987) The molecular basis of the evolution of sex. ''Adv Genet.'' '''24''':323-370. Review. {{PMID|3324702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bryophyte]]s reproduce sexually, but the larger and commonly-seen organisms are [[haploid]] and produce [[gametes]]. The gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a [[sporangium]], which in turn produces haploid spores. The [[diploid]] stage is relatively small and short-lived compared to the haploid stage, i.e. ''haploid dominance''. The advantage of diploidy, heterosis, only exists in the diploid life generation. Bryophytes retain sexual reproduction despite the fact that the haploid stage does not benefit from heterosis. This may be an indication that the sexual reproduction has advantages other than heterosis, such as [[genetic recombination]] between members of the species, allowing the expression of a wider range of traits and thus making the [[population]] more able to survive environmental variation.

===Allogamy===
{{Main article|Allogamy}}
Allogamy is the [[fertilization]] of the combination of gametes from two parents, generally the [[ovum]] from one individual with the [[spermatozoa]] of another. (In isogamous species, the two gametes will not be defined as either sperm or ovum.)

===Autogamy===
{{main article|Autogamy}}
Self-[[fertilization]], also known as autogamy, occurs in [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] organisms where the two [[gamete]]s fused in fertilization come from the same individual, e.g., many [[vascular plants]], some [[foraminifera]]ns, some [[ciliate]]s. The term "autogamy" is sometimes substituted for autogamous pollination (not necessarily leading to successful fertilization) and describes [[self-pollination]] within the same flower, distinguished from [[geitonogamy|geitonogamous pollination]], transfer of pollen to a different flower on the same [[flowering plant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eckert, C.G. |year=2000 |title=Contributions of autogamy and geitonogamy to self-fertilization in a mass-flowering, clonal plant |journal=Ecology |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=532–542 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0532:coaagt]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or within a single [[monoecious]] [[Gymnosperm]] plant.

===Mitosis and meiosis===
[[Mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] are types of [[cell division]]. Mitosis occurs in [[somatic cells]], while meiosis occurs in [[gametes]].

'''Mitosis'''
The resultant number of cells in mitosis is twice the number of original cells. The number of [[chromosomes]] in the offspring cells is the same as that of the parent cell.
{{Clear}}&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:mitosis.jpg|center]] --&gt;
'''Meiosis'''
The resultant number of cells is four times the number of original cells. This results in cells with half the number of [[chromosomes]] present in the parent cell. A [[diploid]] cell duplicates itself, then undergoes two divisions ([[tetraploid]] to diploid to haploid), in the process forming four [[haploid]] cells. This process occurs in two phases, meiosis I and meiosis II.

==Same-sex==
In recent decades, developmental biologists have been researching and developing techniques to facilitate same-sex reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samesexprocreation.com/timeline.htm |title=Timeline of same-sex procreation scientific developments |publisher=samesexprocreation.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The obvious approaches, subject to a growing amount of activity, are [[female sperm]] and [[male egg]]s, with female sperm closer to being a reality for humans, given that Japanese scientists have already created female sperm for chickens. "However, the ratio of produced W chromosome-bearing (W-bearing) spermatozoa fell substantially below expectations. It is therefore concluded that most of the W-bearing PGC could not differentiate into spermatozoa because of restricted spermatogenesis."&lt;ref name="chicken sperm"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9227893|title=Differentiation of female chicken primordial germ cells into spermatozoa in male gonads|publisher= | doi=10.1046/j.1440-169X.1997.t01-2-00002.x|volume=39|issue=3|date=June 1997|pages=267–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, by altering the function of a few genes involved with imprinting, other Japanese scientists combined two mouse eggs to produce daughter mice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Washington Post |date=April 22, 2004 |title=Japanese scientists produce mice without using sperm |publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nUIgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wYQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6950,1352704&amp;dq=japanese+scientists+combine+two+mouse+eggs+to+produce+daughter+mice&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018 Chinese scientists created 29 female mice from two female mice mothers but were unable to produce viable offspring from two father mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/no-father-necessary-as-mice-are-created-with-two-mothers-2vskf8w58|title=No father necessary as mice are created with two mothers|last=Blakely|first=Rhys|date=2018-10-12|work=The Times|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en|issn=0140-0460|subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhi-Kun|last2=Wang|first2=Le-Yun|last3=Wang|first3=Li-Bin|last4=Feng|first4=Gui-Hai|last5=Yuan|first5=Xue-Wei|last6=Liu|first6=Chao|last7=Xu|first7=Kai|last8=Li|first8=Yu-Huan|last9=Wan|first9=Hai-Feng|date=2018-10-01|title=Generation of Bimaternal and Bipaternal Mice from Hypomethylated Haploid ESCs with Imprinting Region Deletions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1934590918304417|journal=Cell Stem Cell|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2018.09.004|issn=1934-5909|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies ==
&lt;!--[[Reproductive strategy]], [[Reproduction strategy]] and [[Reproduction strategies]] redirect here--&gt;
{{further information|Modes of reproduction|Life history theory}}

There are a wide range of reproductive strategies employed by different species. Some animals, such as the [[human]] and [[northern gannet]], do not reach [[sexual maturity]] for many years after birth and even then produce few offspring. Others reproduce quickly; but, under normal circumstances, most offspring do not survive to [[adult]]hood. For example, a [[rabbit]] (mature after 8 months) can produce 10–30 offspring per year, and a [[Drosophila melanogster|fruit fly]] (mature after 10–14 days) can produce up to 900 offspring per year. These two main strategies are known as [[K-selection]] (few offspring) and [[r-selection]] (many offspring). Which strategy is favoured by [[evolution]] depends on a variety of circumstances. Animals with few offspring can devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of each individual offspring, thus reducing the need for many offspring. On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population.  Some organisms such as honey bees and fruit flies retain sperm in a process called [[Female sperm storage|sperm storage]] thereby increasing the duration of their fertility.

===Other types===
{{main article|Semelparity and iteroparity}}
* '''Polycyclic animals''' reproduce intermittently throughout their lives.
* '''Semelparous organisms''' reproduce only once in their lifetime, such as [[annual plant]]s (including all grain crops), and certain species of salmon, spider, bamboo and century plant. Often, they die shortly after reproduction. This is often associated with [[R/K selection theory|r-strategists]].
* '''Iteroparous organisms''' produce offspring in successive (e.g. annual or seasonal) cycles, such as [[perennial plant]]s. Iteroparous animals survive over multiple seasons (or periodic condition changes). This is more associated with [[R/K selection theory|K-strategists]].

==Asexual vs. sexual reproduction==
[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|250px|right|Illustration of the ''twofold cost of sexual reproduction''. If each organism were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation.]]

Organisms that reproduce through asexual reproduction tend to grow in number exponentially. However, because they rely on mutation for variations in their DNA, all members of the species have similar vulnerabilities. Organisms that reproduce sexually yield a smaller number of offspring, but the large amount of variation in their genes makes them less susceptible to disease.

Many organisms can reproduce sexually as well as asexually. [[Aphid]]s, [[slime mold]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, some species of [[starfish]] (by [[fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]]), and many plants are examples. When environmental factors are favorable, asexual reproduction is employed to exploit suitable conditions for survival such as an abundant food supply, adequate shelter, favorable climate, disease, optimum pH or a proper mix of other lifestyle requirements. Populations of these organisms increase exponentially via asexual reproductive strategies to take full advantage of the rich supply resources.

When food sources have been depleted, the climate becomes hostile, or individual survival is jeopardized by some other adverse change in living conditions, these organisms switch to sexual forms of reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures a mixing of the gene pool of the species. The variations found in offspring of sexual reproduction allow some individuals to be better suited for survival and provide a mechanism for selective adaptation to occur. The meiosis stage of the sexual cycle also allows especially effective repair of DNA damages (see [[Meiosis]] and Bernstein et al.).&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H., Bernstein C. and Michod R.E. (2011). Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair. Chapter 19: 357-382 in ''DNA Repair'', Inna Kruman (Ed.), InTech (publisher) {{ISBN|978-953-307-697-3}}. Available online from [http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair intechopen.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, sexual reproduction usually results in the formation of a life stage that is able to endure the conditions that threaten the offspring of an asexual parent. Thus, seeds, spores, eggs, pupae, cysts or other "over-wintering" stages of sexual reproduction ensure the survival during unfavorable times and the organism can "wait out" adverse situations until a swing back to suitability occurs.

==Life without==
The existence of life without reproduction is the subject of some speculation. The biological study of how the [[origin of life]] produced reproducing organisms from non-reproducing elements is called [[abiogenesis]]. Whether or not there were several independent abiogenetic events, biologists believe that the [[last universal ancestor]] to all present life on Earth lived about [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 billion years ago]].

Scientists have speculated about the possibility of creating life non-reproductively in the laboratory. Several scientists have succeeded in producing simple viruses from entirely non-living materials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12114528&amp;dopt=Abstract Chemical synthesis of poliovirus cDNA: generation of infectious virus in the absence of natural template]&lt;br/&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/b/a/042809.htm Scientists Create Artificial Virus]&lt;/ref&gt; However, viruses are often regarded as not alive. Being nothing more than a bit of RNA or DNA in a protein capsule, they have no [[metabolism]] and can only [[self-replication|replicate]] with the assistance of a hijacked [[cell (biology)|cell]]'s metabolic machinery.

The production of a truly living organism (e.g. a simple bacterium) with no ancestors would be a much more complex task, but may well be possible to some degree according to current biological knowledge. A [[Synthetic Genomics|synthetic genome]] has been transferred into an existing bacterium where it replaced the native DNA, resulting in the artificial production of a new ''[[M. mycoides]]'' organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1190719| pmid = 20488990| year = 2010| last1 = Gibson | first1 = D.| last2 = Glass | first2 = J.| last3 = Lartigue | first3 = C.| last4 = Noskov | first4 = V.| last5 = Chuang | first5 = R.| last6 = Algire | first6 = M.| last7 = Benders | first7 = G.| last8 = Montague | first8 = M.| last9 = Ma | first9 = L.| last10 = Moodie | first10 = M.

There is some debate within the scientific community over whether this cell can be considered completely synthetic&lt;ref name="venter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703559004575256470152341984|title=Scientists Create First Synthetic Cell|author=Robert Lee Hotz|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the chemically synthesized genome was an almost 1:1 copy of a naturally occurring genome and, the recipient cell was a naturally occurring bacterium. The Craig Venter Institute maintains the term "synthetic bacterial cell" but they also clarify "...we do not consider this to be "creating life from scratch" but rather we are creating new life out of already existing life using synthetic DNA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/first-self-replicating-synthetic-bacterial-cell/faq |title=FAQ |author=Craig Venter Institute |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter plans to patent his experimental cells, stating that "they are pretty clearly human inventions".&lt;ref name="venter"/&gt; Its creators suggests that building 'synthetic life' would allow researchers to learn about life by building it, rather than by tearing it apart. They also propose to stretch the boundaries between life and machines until the two overlap to yield "truly programmable organisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = W. Wayte Gibbs | title = Synthetic Life | journal = Scientific American | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=synthetic-life| date = May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers involved stated that the creation of "true synthetic biochemical life" is relatively close in reach with current technology and cheap compared to the effort needed to place man on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3214/01.html |title= NOVA: Artificial life |accessdate=2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lottery principle==
Sexual reproduction has many drawbacks, since it requires far more energy than asexual reproduction and diverts the organisms from other pursuits, and there is some argument about why so many species use it. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] used [[lottery]] tickets as an [[analogy]] in one explanation for the widespread use of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;[[George C. Williams (biologist)|Williams G C.]] 1975. Sex and Evolution. Princeton (NJ): Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that asexual reproduction, which produces little or no genetic variety in offspring, was like buying many tickets that all have the same number, limiting the chance of "winning" - that is, producing surviving offspring. Sexual reproduction, he argued, was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers and therefore a greater chance of success. The point of this analogy is that since asexual reproduction does not produce genetic variations, there is little ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment. The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

She came second in the [[The Voice of Finland (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[The Voice of Finland]]'' in 2012. Aalto competed in the Finnish national selection to [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest|represent Finland]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] two times, first in [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]] with "[[Blessed with Love]]" and then in [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]] with "[[No Fear (Saara Aalto song)|No Fear]]", both times placing second. On 7 November 2017, it was announced that she had been internally selected by broadcaster [[Yle]] to [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018|represent Finland]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]] in [[Lisbon]]. The Finnish public chose the song "[[Monsters (Saara Aalto song)|Monsters]]". She qualified for the grand final and finished in 25th place.

She has taken part in musicals on stage and has done a great number of dubbings for feature films and foreign television series. Saara Aalto is the voice of [[Anna (Disney)|Princess Anna]] in the Finnish version of Disney's animated movie ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''. She has dueted with [[Adam Lambert]],&lt;ref&gt;10 December 2016 X Factor: Bohemian Rhapsody&lt;/ref&gt; and had concerts together with [[Andrea Bocelli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/andrea-bocelli/2015/hartwall-areena-helsinki-finland-4bcaf32a.html|title=Andrea Bocelli Setlist at Hartwall Areena, Helsinki, Finland - Tour: A Passion for Life | date=25 January 2015 |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Carreras]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbcs.fi/archives/jose-carreras-concert-with-saara-aalto|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304113657/http://www.fbcs.fi/archives/jose-carreras-concert-with-saara-aalto|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 March 2017|title=Jose Carreras Concert with Saara Aalto 2 May 2013 Shanghai Daning Theatre|date=|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pianist [[Robert Wells (composer)|Robert Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finland.cn/public/default.aspx?contentid=261040&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US |title=Concert in Shanghai: Robert Wells - Rhapsody In Rock|date=26 October 2012|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has released 5 albums on her own record label Yume Records.&lt;ref name=Rojas&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Rojas |url=http://www.esc-plus.com/saara-aalto-i-want-my-song-to-be-the-happy-funeral-of-fear-where-people-are-dancing-together-finnish-semifinalist-exclusive-interview/ |title=Saara Aalto: "I want my song to be the happy funeral of fear, where people are dancing together!"

She has worked with several top orchestras and military bands and toured across Finland with her own band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saaraaalto.com/en/#bio|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301123804/http://www.saaraaalto.com/en/#bio|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 March 2012|date=|title=BIO|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, becoming an international singer, and singing in English, has always been Aalto's dream, and that is why she auditioned for [[The X Factor (UK series 13)|''The X Factor UK'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Josh Darvill |publisher=tellymix.co.uk | url=http://www.tellymix.co.uk/reality-tv/the-x-factor/303367-x-factors-saara-aalto-says-uk-new-home-performs-live-tour.html |date=7 March 2017 |title=X Factor's Saara Aalto says the UK is her 'new home' as performs on live tour | accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=kari |url=http://classicalcrossover.proboards.com/post/17247 |date=17 December 2016 |title=This is the reason why Saara wanted to go to X Factor in England.

===Finnish Eurovision Song Contest selections (2011, 2016, 2018)===
Saara Aalto took part on two separate occasions in the selection process in a bid to represent Finland in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. She participated in the qualifying rounds in Finland for [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|Eurovision 2011]] with her self-penned song "[[:fi:Blessed with Love|Blessed with Love]]", placing second to [[Paradise Oskar]] who went on to represent Finland with his song "[[Da Da Dam]]". She received 40.7% of the public televotes, compared to 46.7% for Oskar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finland sends Paradise Oskar to Düsseldorf!|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=25203&amp;_t=finland_sends_paradise_oskar_to_duesseldorf|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aalto's recording was released as a single by Yume Records, a self-release record label she founded together with Teemu Roivainen in 2011.

Her second bid to represent Finland was for [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]] through the competition ''[[Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu]]'' where she sang another of her own compositions titled "No Fear", again placing second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/ensimmaiset_umk-finalistit_valittu__onko_joku_heista_suomen_euroviisuedustaja/8654646|title=Ensimmäiset UMK-finalistit valittu – onko joku heistä Suomen euroviisuedustaja?|publisher=Yle |date=6 February 2016 |accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although winning the public vote, she was disadvantaged with the judging vote going to the eventual winner [[Sandhja]] who went on to represent Finland with the song "[[Sing It Away]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UMK 2016: FINLAND REVEALS FULL RESULTS OF TELEVOTE AND JURIES|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2016/03/02/umk-2016-full-results-revealed/129687/|publisher=wiwibloggs.com |accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview Aalto described her music.&lt;ref name=Rojas/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I call my music Epic Love Pop! I love dramatic and emotional music with a show feeling. I also want to bring love, joy and encouragement for everybody; be yourself and inspire others! I’ve studied piano since I was a little kid and through music schools, singing competitions, my career and concerts (in Finland and all over the world) I’ve gotten lots of experience and confidence to be who I am as an artist. (...) I’ve performed in musicals and big shows in Finland. (...) I’m happy to be versatile performer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Saara Aalto represented Finland in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]]. The decision was made by the Finnish national broadcaster [[Yleisradio|Yle]]. Her song was selected among three choices in a national final; the selected song was "Monsters". She qualified for the final on 8th May but finished second last (25th) on 12th May.

===Success in China===
Following her performance of "Blessed with Love" for qualification in Eurovision 2011, that December she was involved in the Santa Claus Season's Greetings Song Contest, where she sang "Ai De Zhu Fu," a Chinese (Mandarin) version of her Eurovision song "Blessed with Love". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finland.cn/Public/default.aspx?contentid=236100&amp;nodeid=35178&amp;culture=en-US |title=Chinese listeners to vote for best Finnish SANTA CLAUS SEASON'S GREETINGS SONG 2012 |publisher=Finland.cn |date= |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finland.cn/public/default.aspx?contentid=237411&amp;nodeid=35178&amp;contentlan=1&amp;culture=fi-FI |title=Negative voitti joululaulukilpailun |website = Suomen suurlähetystö, Peking -Suomen pääkonsulaatti, Shanghai |language = Finnish|publisher=Finland.cn |date=29 December 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finding great reception from Chinese audiences, in July 2013 Aalto went on to release a full album destined for [[Mainland China]] and other Chinese markets also titled ''Ai De Zhu Fu''. On the album she performed nine of the album's 13 tracks in [[Mandarin language]].

===''The Voice of Finland'' (2012)===
Aalto participated in [[The Voice of Finland (season 1)|season one]] of ''[[The Voice of Finland]]''. In the blind auditions, broadcast on 6 February 2012 on the Finnish commercial television channel [[Nelonen]], she performed "[[Taking Chances (song)|Taking Chances]]" from [[Celine Dion]] with all four coaches, [[Elastinen]], [[Lauri Tähkä]], [[Paula Koivuniemi]] and [[Michael Monroe]] turning their chairs. She opted to be part of Team Monroe.

In the Battle Round on 17 February, she was confronted with team competitor Anna Inginmaa, both singing "[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]". Coach Monroe opted for Aalto to go to the next round. In the live show on 23 March, she sang "[[Barracuda (song)|Barracuda]]" and was saved by Monroe after failing to get enough votes from the public. She followed it up with the French language "Je suis malade" from [[Serge Lama]] and was safe after the public vote. In the semifinals with her rendition of "[[Over the Rainbow]]", she qualified for the finals held on 20 April where she sang "[[I'm Gonna Be Strong]]" from [[Frankie Laine]] and an original song titled "My Love". She placed second to winner Mikko Sipola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/viihde/2012020315152992_vi.shtml |title=Voice of Finland: Riitaa laulajista! &amp;#124; Viihde |publisher=Iltalehti.fi |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The X Factor UK'', Eurovision Song Contest and ''Wild Wild Wonderland''===
Aalto auditioned for the [[The X Factor (UK series 13)|thirteenth UK series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2016, singing a cover of [[Sia Furler|Sia]]'s "[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]", which earned her three yeses from the attending judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2016/08/28/finlands-saara-aalto-nails-x-factor-uk-audition/149412/|title="That's How You Do It!" Finland's Saara Aalto Nails X Factor UK Audition|date=29 August 2016|publisher=Wiwibloggs|website=wiwibloggs.com|last=Rahn|first=Florian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the bootcamp, she performed "[[On the Radio (Donna Summer song)|On the Radio]]" by [[Donna Summer]] and was sent through as part of the over-25s category with [[Sharon Osbourne]] as her mentor. At the six-chair challenge, she performed "[[I See Fire]]" by [[Ed Sheeran]] and was sent home by Osbourne who stated a lack of connection. However, after the crowd chanted to bring her back, Aalto was given a chance to perform [[Serge Lama]]'s "[[Je suis malade (song)|Je suis malade]]", which caused the crowd to turn on her, while [[Nicole Scherzinger]] criticized her song choice, stating "we ain't in France". Osbourne then asked Aalto to leave. 

Aalto was brought back as Scherzinger's wildcard pick for the over-25s category and therefore went to judges' houses. She was chosen to proceed to the live shows after performing [[ABBA]]'s "[[The Winner Takes It All]]". In week 1 of the live shows, Aalto finished in the bottom three after performing "[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]" and faced a sing-off against the duo Bratavio, where she performed "[[Alive (Sia song)|Alive]]" by Sia. Aalto was saved with only [[Louis Walsh]] voting to eliminate her, though praising her performance. The following week, she sang "[[River Deep – Mountain High]]" and finished again in the bottom three, performing "[[Run (Snow Patrol song)|Run]]" by [[Snow Patrol]] in a sing-off against Freddy Parker. The result went to deadlock and Aalto was saved as she had the greater public vote. In week 3 she performed "[[It's Oh So Quiet]]" coming 2nd in the public vote, and in week 4 Aalto sang "[[Bad Romance]]", placing 3rd in the public vote. In week 5, Aalto finished in the bottom three for the third time after her rendition of "[[Sound of the Underground (song)|Sound of the Underground]]", but was saved by majority vote after performing "[[Who You Are (Jessie J song)|Who You Are]]" in a sing-off against the group Four of Diamonds. Her following performances were "[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]" in week 6 placing 2nd and "[[My Heart Will Go On]]" in week 7 again placing 2nd. In week 8, she sang "The Winner Takes It All" and a medley of "[[Diamonds Are Forever (soundtrack)|Diamonds Are Forever]]" and "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]", topping the public vote for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting stats 2016 revealed |url=http://www.itv.com/xfactor/news/voting-stats-2016|website=[[Itv.com|ITV]]|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the eliminations of Relley C in week 3 and Honey G in week 8, Aalto became Osbourne's last remaining act in the competition.

In the semifinals on 3 December, she sang a medley of "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" and "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]", and "Chandelier" as 2nd song, topping the vote again reaching the Final 3, where on 10 December she performed "[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]" and "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", the latter as a duet with [[Adam Lambert]], again topping the public vote. With the elimination of the group [[5 After Midnight]] she was in the Final 2 facing [[Matt Terry]]. In the Final on 11 December, she performed "It's Oh So Quiet" and "[[I Didn't Know My Own Strength (Whitney Houston song)|I Didn't Know My Own Strength]]". In the ensuing public vote, she placed as the runner-up to eventual winner Matt Terry with 40.4% of the votes.

[[File:SonOfManNovel.jpg|thumb|First edition, published by [[Ballantine Books]]. Cover art by [[Gene Szafran]].]]
'''''Son of Man''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[novel]] by American writer [[Robert Silverberg]], published in 1971. The book is about Clay, a 20th-century man, who travels billions of years into the future and meets humanity in its future forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concatenation.org/frev/sonofman.html |title=Review of the Robert Silverberg SF novel Son of Man |publisher=Concatenation.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/s/robert-silverberg/son-of-man.htm |title=Son of Man by Robert Silverberg |publisher=Fantasticfiction.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the issues discussed in the book are sexuality, [[telepathic]] communication between people, physical prowess or frailty, division of humans by [[caste]] or ability, and the preservation of ancient [[wisdom]], among other things.

==Reception==
[[Norman Spinrad]] has described it as "brilliant".&lt;ref name=Spinrad&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=EvCsY3IEJ14C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=%22son+of+man%22+silverberg+review&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P2ZwIyJaha&amp;sig=z_3kVrYYMCPgEPLT46l1eBpUtv4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg8afekJ3VAhVm2IMKHWESBCwQ6AEI0wEwHw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22son%20of%20man%22%20silverberg%20review&amp;f=false Science Fiction in the Real World], by [[Norman Spinrad]]; published 1990 by [[Southern Illinois University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matt Hughes (writer)|Matt Hughes]] considers it "an artifact of its period, a remarkable, heady, head-trippy plunge into a [[New Wave science fiction|new way of writing sf]], and into a new way of thinking", but notes that because Silverberg is addressing "the timeless questions -- what are we? where do we come from? where are we going?", the book has not become "stale and musty".&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;[https://www.sfsite.com/01a/sm287.htm Son of Man, by Robert Silverberg], reviewed by [[Matt Hughes (writer)|Matt Hughes]], at the ''[[SF Site]]''; published 2009; retrieved July 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''spermatheca''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|s|p|ɚ|m|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|k|ə}} plural: '''spermathecae''' {{IPAc-en|s|p|ɚ|m|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|s|iː}}), also called '''receptaculum seminis''' (plural: '''receptacula seminis'''), is an [[organ (biology)|organ]] of the female reproductive tract in [[insect]]s, e.g. [[bee]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Tales V. Pascini, and Gustavo F. Martins. 2017. "The insect spermatheca: an overview". ZOOLOGY https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zool.2016.12.001&lt;/ref&gt; some [[mollusc]]s, [[oligochaeta]] worms and certain other [[invertebrate]]s and [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Sever, Cynthia K.

Spermathecae can sometimes be the site of [[fertilisation|fertilization]] when the [[oocyte]]s are sufficiently developed.&lt;ref&gt;Jan A. Pechenick. Biology of the Invertebrates.

Some species of animal have multiple spermathecae.  For example, certain species of earthworms have four pairs of spermathecae—one pair each in the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th segments. The spermathecae receive and store the spermatozoa of another earthworm during copulation.&lt;ref&gt;Jan A. Pechenik. Biology of the Invertebrates. New York: McGraw Hill, 2010, pg. 322&lt;/ref&gt; They are lined with [[epithelium]] and are variable in shape: some are thin, heavily coiled tubes, while others are vague outpocketings from the main reproductive tract. It is one of the many variations in sexual reproduction.

The nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' has two spermathecae, one at the end of each gonad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On the control of oocyte meiotic maturation and ovulation in Caenorhabditis elegans.|date = |journal = Dev.

"http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research". ''SENS Research Foundation website''&lt;/ref&gt; for the periodical repair of all age-related damage to human tissue with the ultimate purpose of maintaining a state of [[negligible senescence]] in the patient, thereby postponing [[age-associated disease]] for as long as the therapies are reapplied.&lt;ref name=EndingAging&gt;de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael (September 2007).

The term "[[negligible senescence]]" was first used in the early 1990s by professor [[Caleb Finch]] to describe organisms such as [[lobsters]] and [[hydra (genus)|hydra]]s, which do not show symptoms of aging. The term "engineered negligible senescence" first appeared in print in [[Aubrey de Grey]]'s 1999 book ''The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging'',&lt;ref name="isbn1587061554"&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (November 2003). ''The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging.'' Austin, Texas: Landes Bioscience. {{ISBN|1-58706-155-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was later prefaced with the term "strategies" in the article ''Time to Talk SENS: Critiquing the Immutability of Human Aging''&lt;ref name="pmid11976218"&gt;de Grey AD, Ames BN, Andersen JK, Bartke A, Campisi J, Heward CB, McCarter RJ, Stock G (April 2002).

==Framework==

[[File:Aging treatment approaches.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The arrows with flat heads are a notation meaning "inhibits," used in the literature of gene expression and gene regulation.]]

The ultimate objective of SENS is the eventual elimination of age-related diseases and infirmity by repeatedly reducing the state of senescence in the organism. The SENS project consists in implementing a series of periodic medical interventions designed to repair, prevent or render irrelevant all the types of molecular and cellular damage that cause age-related pathology and degeneration, in order to avoid debilitation and death from age-related causes.&lt;ref name=EndingAging/&gt;

De Grey defines aging as "the set of accumulated side effects from metabolism that eventually kills us", and, more specifically, as follows: "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecule|molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an [[adult]] [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death."&lt;ref name="pmid12844502"&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (January 8, 2003). "[http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/manu16.pdf An engineer's approach to the development of real anti-aging medicine]". ''Sci Aging Knowledge Environ''. 2003 (1): VP1. {{doi|10.1126/sageke.2003.1.vp1}}. {{PMID|12844502}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He adds: "[[geriatrics]] is the attempt to stop damage from causing pathology; traditional [[gerontology]] is the attempt to stop [[metabolism]] from causing damage; and the SENS (engineering) approach is to eliminate the damage periodically, so keeping its abundance below the level that causes any pathology." The SENS approach to biomedical [[gerontology]] is thus distinctive because of its emphasis on tissue rejuvenation rather than attempting to slow the aging process.

By enumerating the various differences between young and old tissue identified by the science of [[biogerontology]], a 'damage' report was drawn, which in turn formed the basis of the SENS strategy. The results fell into seven main categories of 'damage', seven alterations whose reversal would constitute [[negligible senescence]]:

For each of these areas SENS offers at least one strategy, with a research and a clinical component. The clinical component is required because in some of the proposed therapies, feasibility has already been proven, but not completely applied and approved for human trials. These strategies do not presuppose that the underlying metabolic mechanisms of aging be fully understood, only that we take into account the form senescence takes as directly observable to science, and described in scientific literature..

==Types of aging damage and treatment schemes==

===Nuclear mutations/epimutations—OncoSENS===
These are changes to the nuclear DNA ([[nDNA]]), or to proteins which bind to the nDNA. Certain mutations can lead to [[cancer]].

This would need to be corrected in order to prevent or [[cure for cancer|cure cancer]]. SENS focuses on a strategy called "whole-body interdiction of lengthening [[telomere]]s" (WILT), which would be made possible by periodic [[regenerative medicine]] treatments.

===Mitochondrial mutations—MitoSENS===

[[Mitochondria]] are components in our [[cell (biology)|cells]] that are important for [[energy]] production. Because of the highly [[Oxidative stress|oxidative]] environment in mitochondria and their lack of the sophisticated repair systems, mitochondrial mutations are believed to be a major cause of progressive cellular degeneration.

This would be corrected by [[allotopic expression]]—copying the [[DNA]] for mitochondria completely within the cellular [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], where it is better protected. De Grey argues that experimental evidence demonstrates that the operation is feasible, however, a 2003 study showed that some mitochondrial proteins are too [[hydrophobic]] to survive the transport from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;Oca-Cossio, J. et al., 2003. Limitations of Allotopic Expression of Mitochondrial Genes in Mammalian Cells. Genetics, 165(2), 707–720.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intracellular junk—LysoSENS===
{{tone|date=January 2018}}
Our cells are constantly breaking down [[protein]]s and other molecules that are no longer useful or which can be harmful. Those molecules which can’t be digested accumulate as junk inside our cells, which is detected in the form of [[lipofuscin]] granules. [[Atherosclerosis]], [[macular degeneration]], [[liver spot]]s on the skin and all kinds of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s (such as [[Alzheimer's]] disease) are associated with this problem.

Junk inside cells might be removed by adding new [[enzymes]] to the cell's natural [[digestion]] organ, the [[lysosome]]. These enzymes would be taken from [[bacteria]], [[mold]]s and other organisms that are known to completely digest animal bodies.

===Extracellular junk—AmyloSENS===

Harmful junk protein can accumulate outside of our cells. Junk here means useless things accumulated by a body, but which cannot be digested or removed by its processes, such as the amyloid plaques characteristic of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other [[amyloidosis|amyloidoses]].

Junk outside cells might be removed by enhanced [[phagocytosis]] (the normal process used by the immune system), and small drugs able to break chemical beta-bonds. The large junk in this class can be removed surgically.

===Cell loss and atrophy—RepleniSENS===

Some of the cells in our bodies cannot be replaced, or can be only replaced very slowly—more slowly than they die. This decrease in cell number affects some of the most important tissues of the body.  Muscle cells are lost in [[skeletal muscle]]s and the heart, causing them to become frailer with age.  Loss of neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] causes [[Parkinson's disease]], while loss of immune cells impairs the [[immune system]].

This can be partly corrected by therapies involving [[exercise]] and [[growth factor]]s, but [[stem cell therapy]], [[regenerative medicine]] and [[tissue engineering]] are almost certainly required for any more than just partial replacement of lost cells.

===Cell senescence—ApoptoSENS===

[[Cellular senescence#Cellular senescence|Senescence]] is a phenomenon where the cells are no longer able to divide, but also do not die and let others divide. They may also do other harmful things, like secreting proteins. Degeneration of [[joint]]s, immune senescence, accumulation of [[visceral fat]] and [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] are caused by this. Cells sometimes enter a state of resistance to signals sent, as part of a process called [[apoptosis]], to instruct cells to destroy themselves.

Cells in this state could be eliminated by forcing them to apoptose (via [[suicide gene]]s, [[vaccine]]s, or recently discovered [[senolytics|senolytic agents]]), and healthy cells would multiply to replace them.

===Extracellular crosslinks—GlycoSENS===

Cells are held together by special linking proteins. When too many [[cross-links]] form between cells in a [[Biological tissue|tissue]], the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including arteriosclerosis, presbyopia and weakened skin texture. These are chemical bonds between structures that are part of the body, but not within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. In senescent people many of these become brittle and weak.

SENS proposes to further develop small-molecular drugs and [[enzyme]]s to break links caused by sugar-bonding, known as [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s, and other common forms of chemical linking.

==Scientific controversy==
While some fields mentioned as branches of SENS are broadly supported by the medical research community, e.g., [[stem cell research]] (RepleniSENS), [[Alzheimer's disease clinical research|anti-Alzheimers research]] (AmyloSENS) and [[oncogenomics]] (OncoSENS), the SENS programme as a whole has been a highly controversial proposal, with many critics arguing that the SENS agenda is fanciful and the highly complicated biomedical phenomena involved in the aging process contain too many unknowns for SENS to be fully implementable in the foreseeable future&lt;ref name="pmid16264422" /&gt;. Cancer may well deserve special attention as an [[Aging-associated diseases|aging-associated disease]] (OncoSENS), but the SENS claim that nuclear DNA damage only matters for aging because of cancer has been challenged in the literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Best, BP | title=Nuclear DNA damage as a direct cause of aging 
| journal=Rejuvenation Research  | volume=12 | issue=3 | date=2009 | pages=199–208  
| url=http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/Nuclear_DNA_in_Aging.pdf | format= [[PDF]]  
| doi = 10.1089/rej.2009.0847 |  pmid=19594328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by material in the article [[DNA damage theory of aging]].

In November 2005, 28 biogerontologists published a statement of criticism in ''[[EMBO Journal|EMBO Reports]]'', "Science fact and the SENS agenda: what can we reasonably expect from ageing research?,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"&gt;Warner H ''et al.'' (November 2005). "Science fact and the SENS agenda. What can we reasonably expect from ageing research?". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (11): 1006–1008. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400555}}. {{PMID|16264422}}.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing "each one of the specific proposals that comprise the SENS agenda is, at our present stage of ignorance, exceptionally optimistic,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; and that some of the specific proposals "will take decades of hard work [to be medically integrated], if [they] ever prove to be useful."&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; The researchers argue that while there is "a rationale for thinking that we might eventually learn how to postpone human illnesses to an important degree,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; increased basic research, rather than the goal-directed approach of SENS, is presently the scientifically appropriate goal. This article was written in response to a July 2005 ''EMBO Reports'' article previously published by de Grey&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (July 2005). "Resistance to debate on how to postpone ageing is delaying progress and costing lives". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (S1): S49–S53. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400399}}. {{PMID|15995663}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a response from de Grey was published in the same November issue.&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (November 2005). "Like it or not, life-extension research extends beyond biogerontology". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (11): 1000. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400565}}. {{PMID|16264420}}.&lt;/ref&gt; De Grey summarizes these events in "The biogerontology research community's evolving view of SENS," published on the [[Methuselah Foundation]] website.&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey. "[http://www.mfoundation.org/files/sens/Gandhi3.htm The biogerontology research community's evolving view of SENS]".

===''Technology Review'' controversy===

In February 2005, ''[[Technology Review]]'', which is owned by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], published an article by [[Sherwin Nuland]], a Clinical Professor of Surgery at [[Yale University]] and the author of "How We Die",&lt;ref&gt;Nuland, Sherwin (1994). ''How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter''. New York: Knopf Random House. {{ISBN|0-679-41461-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that drew a skeptical portrait of SENS, at the time de Grey was a computer associate in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100108033304/http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Research/flybase.htm Flybase Facility] of the [http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Genetics] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The April 2005 issue of ''Technology Review'' contained a reply by Aubrey de Grey&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (April2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14097&amp;ch=infotech Aubrey de Grey Responds]", ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous comments from readers.&lt;ref&gt;TR Readers (April 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14310&amp;ch=infotechReaders LETTERS: Our February cover story on Aubrey de Grey and antiaging science lives on]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During June 2005, [[David Gobel]], CEO and Co-founder of Methuselah Foundation offered Technology Review $20,000 to fund a prize competition to publicly clarify the viability of the SENS approach. In July 2005, Pontin announced a $20,000 prize, funded 50/50 by Methuselah Foundation and MIT Technology Review, open to any molecular biologist, with a record of publication in biogerontology, who could prove that the alleged benefits of SENS were "so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate."&lt;ref&gt;Pontin, Jason (July 28, 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/pontin/14968/ The SENS Challenge]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Technology Review'' received five submissions to its Challenge. In March 2006, ''Technology Review'' announced that it had chosen a panel of judges for the Challenge: [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Anita Goel]], [[Nathan Myhrvold]], [[Vikram Sheel Kumar]], and [[Craig Venter]].&lt;ref&gt;Pontin, Jason (March 14, 2006). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/16593/ We've picked the judges for our biogerontology prize]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the five submissions met the terms of the prize competition. They were published by ''Technology Review'' on June 9, 2006. Accompanying the three submissions were rebuttals by de Grey, and counter-responses to de Grey's rebuttals. On July 11, 2006, ''Technology Review'' published the results of the SENS Challenge.&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130606111748/http://www.mprize.com/index.php?pagename=newsdetaildisplay&amp;ID=0104 SENS Withstands Three Challenges : $20,000 Remains Unclaimed]". Methuselah Foundation. Retrieved on July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, no one won the $20,000 prize. The judges felt that no submission met the criterion of the challenge and discredited SENS, although they unanimously agreed that one submission, by [[Preston Estep]] and his colleagues, was the most eloquent. [[Craig Venter]] succinctly expressed the prevailing opinion: "Estep et al. ... have not demonstrated that SENS is unworthy of discussion, but the proponents of SENS have not made a compelling case for it."&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt; Summarizing the judges' deliberations, Pontin wrote that SENS is "highly speculative" and that many of its proposals {{clarify|text=could not be reproduced with the scientific technology of that period.|date=April 2016}} Myhrvold described SENS as belonging to a kind of "antechamber of science" where they wait until technology and scientific knowledge advance to the point where it can be tested.&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invincible Man"/&gt; In a letter of dissent dated July 11, 2006 in Technology Review, Estep et al. criticized the ruling of the judges.

==Social and economic implications==

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | date = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/sens/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

De Grey and other scientists in the general field have argued that the costs of a rapidly growing aging population will increase to the degree that the costs of an accelerated pace of aging research are easy to justify in terms of future costs avoided. Olshansky ''et al.'' 2006 argue, for example, that the total economic cost of [[Alzheimer's disease]] in the US alone will increase from $80–100 billion today to more than $1 trillion in 2050.&lt;ref name=TheLongevityDividend&gt;Olshansky, S. Jay; Perry, Daniel; Miller, Richard A.; Butler, Robert N. (March 2006). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160110004616/http://www.edmontonagingsymposium.com/files/eas/Longevity_Dividend.pdf In Pursuit of the Longevity Dividend: What Should We Be Doing To Prepare for the Unprecedented Aging of Humanity?]". ''The Scientist''. 20 (3): 28–36.&lt;/ref&gt; "Consider what is likely to happen if we don't [invest further in aging research]. Take, for instance, the impact of just one age-related disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD). For no other reason than the inevitable shifting demographics, the number of Americans stricken with AD will rise from 4 million today to as many as 16 million by midcentury. This means that more people in the United States will have AD by 2050 than the entire current population of the Netherlands. Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation. The US economic toll is currently $80–$100 billion, but by 2050 more than $1 trillion will be spent annually on AD and related dementias. The impact of this single disease will be catastrophic, and this is just one example."&lt;ref name=TheLongevityDividend/&gt;

== SENS Research Foundation ==
{{Main|SENS Research Foundation}}

The SENS Research Foundation is a [[non-profit organization]] co-founded by Michael Kope, [[Aubrey de Grey]], Jeff Hall, Sarah Marr and Kevin Perrott, which is based in [[California]], [[United States]]. Its activities include SENS-based research programs and [[public relations]] work for the acceptance of and interest in related research.

Before March 2009, the SENS research programme was mainly pursued by the [[Methuselah Foundation]], co-founded by Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel.  The [[Methuselah Foundation]] is most notable for establishing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]], a monetary prize awarded to researchers who extend the lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths.&lt;ref name=MFMission&gt;

'''Fear of being buried alive''' is the [[fear]] of being [[premature burial|placed in a grave while still alive]] as a result of being incorrectly pronounced [[Death|dead]]. The abnormal, [[psychopathology|psychopathological]] version of this fear is referred to as '''taphophobia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] τάφος - ''taphos'', "grave, tomb"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dta%2Ffos1 τάφος],  Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and φόβος - ''phobos'', "fear"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;), which is translated as "fear of graves".&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich H. "Taphophobia and resurrection mania", ''Schweizer Arkiv für Neurologie, Neurochirurgie und Psychiatrie''. 1977;120(2):195–203 {{PMID|905788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of modern medicine, the fear was not entirely irrational. Throughout history, there have been numerous cases of people being buried alive by accident. In 1905, the English reformer [[William Tebb]] collected accounts of premature burial. He found 219 cases of near live burial, 149 actual live burials, 10 cases of live dissection and 2 cases of awakening while being embalmed.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Christine. ''The Corpse: A History''&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century had seen the development of [[Artificial respiration|mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]] and crude [[defibrillation]] techniques to revive persons considered dead, and the [[Royal Humane Society]] had been formed as the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|journal=Cryonics
|date=September 1990
|accessdate=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, an American funeral director, T. M. Montgomery, reported that "nearly 2% of those exhumed were no doubt victims of suspended animation",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/horrors/gruesome/buried.asp "Just Dying to Get Out"], from [[Snopes.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; although folklorist Paul Barber has argued that the incidence of burial alive has been overestimated, and that the normal effects of decomposition are mistaken for signs of life.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Paul. ''Vampires, Burial and Death: Folklore and Reality''. Yale University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many [[urban legend]]s of people being accidentally buried alive. Legends included elements such as someone entering into the state of [[sopor (sleep)|sopor]] or [[coma]], only to wake up years later and die a horrible death. Other legends tell of coffins opened to find a corpse with a long beard or corpses with the hands raised and palms turned upward. Of note is a legend about the premature burial of Ann Hill Carter Lee, the wife of [[Henry Lee III]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/jarvis/jarvis81.html Robert E. Lee's Mother]&lt;/ref&gt;  On his deathbed in 1799, [[George Washington]] made his attendants promise not to bury him for two days.

Literature found fertile ground in exploring the natural fear of being buried alive. One of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s horror stories, "[[The Premature Burial]]", is about a person suffering from taphophobia. Other Poe stories about premature burial are "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]" and "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]"—and to a lesser extent, "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]".

Fear of being buried alive was elaborated to the extent that those who could afford it would make all sorts of arrangements for the construction of a [[safety coffin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://p6.hostingprod.com/@www.kirchersociety.org/blog/?p=233 A Short History of Security Coffins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927090943/http://p6.hostingprod.com/@www.kirchersociety.org/blog/?p=233 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure this would be avoided (e.g., glass lids for observation, ropes to bells for signaling, and breathing pipes for survival until rescued).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpmlegal.com/wcoffin.html Improved burial case]&lt;/ref&gt;

An urban legend states that the sayings "Saved by the bell" and "Dead ringer" are both derived from the notion of having a rope attached to a bell outside the coffin that could alert people that the recently buried person is not yet deceased; these theories have been proven a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilton|first=David|title=Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|pages=75–77|isbn=978-0-19-537557-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although greater public confidence in the medical profession and its ability to diagnose death accurately has seen a reduction in fear of premature burial after the early 20th century there have been periods of public alarm in recent decades after medical errors in diagnosing death were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bondeson |first1=Jan |title=Buried Alive: The Terrifying History of Our Most Primal Fear |date=17 March 2002 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=London |isbn=978-0393322224}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taphophobia may remain common in some parts of the world.  For example, a study of Pakistani women found severe taphophobia in one third of subjects with mental illness and a mild degree of this fear in half of the controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bajwa |first1=Munaza |title=Prevalence and factors associated with phobias among women |journal=Asean Journal of Psychiatry |date=2014 |volume=15 |issue=2 |page=140–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although rare in the developed world, a recent study reported three cases of taphophobia among older people in the west of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fanous |first1=S. |last2=O’Keeffe |first2=S.T. |title=Not yet dead and buried!

'''The Order of the Good Death''' is a [[Death anxiety (psychology)|death acceptance]] organization founded in 2011 by mortician and author [[Caitlin Doughty]].&lt;ref name=Coye2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=OConnor2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Washburn2013/&gt; The group advocates for [[natural burial]] and embracing human mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Natural Burial|publisher=The Order of the Good Death|url=http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/naturalburial|accessdate=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Doughty, members include Sarah Chavez&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/members&lt;/ref&gt;, Director of The Order of the Good Death, Megan Rosenbloom, Director of Death Salon, and Amber Carvaly, Director of Undertaking LA. Other notable members are artist and monument-maker [[Greg Lundgren]], [[TED (conference)|TED speaker]] Jae Rhim Lee, alternative funeral home director Jeff Jorgenson, artist [[Landis Blair]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/members&lt;/ref&gt; and other death professionals, artists and academics.&lt;ref name=Gross2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kiley2014a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kiley2014b/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayles2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Members: Death Professionals|publisher=The Order of the Good Death|url=http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/members/death-professionals|accessdate=2014-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pompilio2013/&gt;

The group held its first "death [[salon (gathering)|salon]]" in Los Angeles in 2013.&lt;ref name=Hayasaki2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=OConnor2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Courtland2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellogg2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=deathsalon/&gt; Another salon was held in 2014 at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] Pathology Museum in London by museum curator Carla Valentine.&lt;ref name=Sherwin2014/&gt;

The group took its name from the Brazilian [[Order of Our Lady of the Good Death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=About us|publisher=The Order of the Good Death|url=http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/about|accessdate=2014-12-27|quote=The Order was inspired by several historical concepts of the good death, including the medieval Ars Moriendi (Art of Dying) and the Tibetan Bardo Thodol. The name itself is taken from the 19th century Brazilian sisterhood of African slaves, Irmandade da Nossa Senhora da Boa Morte, or, Sisterhood of Our Lady of the Good Death.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vitalij Aab''' (born November 14, 1979, in [[Karaganda]], [[Soviet Union]]) is a German [[ice hockey]] player who is currently an [[Unrestricted Free Agent]]. He most recently played for the [[Thomas Sabo Ice Tigers]] in the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icetigers.de/ICETIGERS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=518:vitalij-aab-kehrt-nach-nuernberg-zurueck&amp;catid=1:aktuelle-nachrichten&amp;Itemid=76|title=Vitalij Aab returns to Nürnberg|publisher=Thomas Sabo Ice Tigers|language=German|date=2010-05-11|accessdate=2010-05-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226201047/http://www.icetigers.de/ICETIGERS/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=518:vitalij-aab-kehrt-nach-nuernberg-zurueck&amp;catid=1:aktuelle-nachrichten&amp;Itemid=76|archivedate=2010-12-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
Vitalij Aab's professional debut was at the age of 17 for EC Wilhelmshaven. In his second season, he scored 28 points. In 1999, he was promoted into the second division with Wilhelmshaven. Two years later, he transferred to the [[Nuremberg Ice Tigers]], where he played for three years. During this time he played so well that the German national coach called him up to play for the [[Germany men's national ice hockey team|German national ice hockey team]]. Aab had the worst season of his career in 2004–05 with the [[Adler Mannheim]]; he only scored 24 points in 48 games, and therefore received very little ice time at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeyweb.de/static/spielerportraits/aab_vitalij.htm|title=Vitalij Aab profile|website=Hockeyweb.de|date=2010-05-11|accessdate=2010-05-11|language=German|archivedate=2007-12-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219224955/http://www.hockeyweb.de/static/spielerportraits/aab_vitalij.htm|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He left Mannheim after only one season and switched to the [[Iserlohn Roosters]]. After struggling at first, Aab's performance improved dramatically. At the end of the season, he was the highest scorer in Germany. Before the 2006–07 season, he signed with the [[Hamburg Freezers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=German|website=abendblatt.de|date=2006-05-09 |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2008/09/26/943403.html|title=Vitalij Aab: Forward joins the Freezers|accessdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also a member of the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities ([[Koninklijke Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen]]) and the Academy of Europe ([[Academia Europaea]]).&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; Van der Aalst was elected member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/nl/leden/leden/13802 |title=Wil van der Aalst |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Van der Aalst's research interest is in the fields of [[information systems]], [[business process management]], [[simulation]], [[Petri nets]], [[process model]]s, [[workflow management]] systems, verification techniques, [[process mining]], [[enterprise resource planning]] systems, computer supported cooperative work, [[web service]]s, [[business process redesign]], resource allocation and interorganizational [[business process]]es.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

He is a strong supporter of [[open-source software]]. He initiated and led the development of:
*the ProM framework, a [[process mining]] tool
*[[YAWL]], a workflow management system
*and several other software tools including Declare, Woflan, XRL, etc.

He also initiated the [[workflow patterns]] initiative. This work influenced industry standards such as the [[Business Process Execution Language]] (BPEL), the [[Business Process Modeling Notation]] (BPMN), etc. Van der Aalst's ideas have also influenced various widely used commercial software tools such as Flower, Protos, Futura Reflect, Staffware, WebSphere, and [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems|ARIS]].

Other scientific contributions of Van der Aalst are in the fields of [[Business Process Discovery]], [[event-driven process chain]]s, the [[Workflow Management Coalition]] and [[XPDL]].

Van der Aalst is an [[ISI Highly Cited]] researcher. According to [[Google Scholar]] he is the eight highest ranked computer scientist in the world and 1st among computer scientists not in the US. See [http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/h-number.html H-index for computer science].
