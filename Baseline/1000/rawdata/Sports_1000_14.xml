      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4173">'''All-Around Cowboy''' or '''All-Around Cowgirl''' is an award given to a [[rodeo]] competitor who is most successful in two or more [[Rodeo#Events|events]].  Most individual rodeos and championships determine the winner of this award at the conclusion of the other events or championships.

== Championships ==

The [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (PRCA) World All-Around Cowboy Championship is awarded at the [[Thomas &amp; Mack Center]] at the [[National Finals Rodeo]] (NFR) in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], every December. The PRCA Cowboy who wins the most prize money in a year while competing in at least two events, earning a minimum of $3,000 in each event, wins the world all-around championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prorodeo.com/prorodeo/rodeo/rodeo101/all-around|title=All-Around|website=www.prorodeo.com|publisher=Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Events"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rodeo 101|url=http://www.prorodeo.com/prorodeo/rodeo/rodeo101|website=www.prorodeo.com|publisher=www.prorodeo.com|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the events for the NFR are held at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, except the steer roping, which is called the National Finals Steer Roping (NFSR) and is held at the Kansas Star Arena in [[Mulvane, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Finals Steer Roping|url=http://www.prorodeo.com/prorodeo/wrangler-national-finals-rodeo/national-finals-steer-roping|website=Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|publisher=www.prorodeo.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas Star Casino Hotel Event Center|url=http://www.kansasstareventcenter.com/|website=Kansas Star Event Center|publisher=www.kansasstareventcenter.com/|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trevor Brazile]] of [[Decatur, Texas]], currently holds the single season record for the most money won in a season at $507,921 during the 2010 campaign.&lt;ref name="relentless"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prorodeo.com/prorodeo/cowboys/cowboy-biographies?id=1633|title=Cowboy Biographies - Trevor Brazile|website=www.prorodeo.com|publisher=Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|access-date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also holds the record for most all-around titles with 13 from competing in the timed-events of [[Calf roping|tie-down roping]], [[steer roping]], and [[Team roping|team-roping]]. Brazile holds a total of 23 titles altogether in roping events, another record. [[Ty Murray]], who is known as the modern day "King of the Cowboys" of [[Stephenville, Texas]], previously held the record with seven titles, from competing in the rough-stock events, such as [[Bronc riding|saddle bronc riding]], [[Bronc riding|bareback bronc riding]], and [[bull riding]]. He also holds two titles in bull riding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ty Murray - Biography|url=http://www.tymurray.com/biography.cfm|website=Ty Murray - King of the Cowboys|publisher=www.tymurray.com|accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Professional Rodeo Association]] (IPRA) World All-Around Cowboy Championship is held at the International Finals Rodeo (IFR) in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Professional Rodeo Association|url=http://www.ipra-rodeo.com/about/|website=About the IPRA|publisher=www.ipra-rodeo.com|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], under the rules set forth by the [[Canadian Professional Rodeo Association]] in order for a competitor to win the all-around crown, that contestant must win the most money and compete two or more of saddle bronc riding, bareback riding, bull riding, tie-down roping, steer wrestling or team roping. One of the two events must be riding event and one must be a timed event.&lt;ref name="RuleBook"&gt;{{cite web|title=CPRA Rulebook with Bylaws|url=http://www.rodeocanada.com/rule-book/CPRA_Rulebook_with_Bylaws_July31_2017.pdf|website=Canadian Professional Rodeo Association|publisher=www.rodeocanada.com|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''athletic director''' (commonly "'''athletics director'''" or "'''AD'''") is an administrator at many clubs or institutions, like [[college]]s and [[university|universities]], as well as in larger [[high schools]] and [[middle schools]], who oversees the work of [[coach (sports)|coaches]] and related staff involved in athletic programs.

==Position at institution==
Modern athletic directors are often in a precarious position, especially at the larger institutions.  Although technically in charge of all of the coaches, they are often far less well-compensated and also less famous, with few having their own [[television]] and [[radio]] programs as many coaches now do.  In attempting to deal with misconduct by coaches, they often find their efforts trumped by a coach's powerful connections, particularly if he is an established figure with a long-term winning record.  However, in the case of severe coaching misconduct being proven, often the athletic director will be terminated along with the offending coach.

Over the last several years, the role of an athletic director has changed dramatically. Before, the athletic department was overseen by one of the school's head coaches. Now, the position attracts executives inside and outside the sports industry. Athletic directors can negotiate multimillion-dollar media deals and can manage powerful coaches who are usually the highest paid employees in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbelzer/2015/02/19/the-dynamic-role-of-the-modern-day-college-athletics-director/#41856aee2002|title=The Dynamic Role Of The Modern Day College Athletics Director|first=Jason|last=Belzer|date=|website=forbes.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the division and the school's athletic needs, athletic directors can also be in charge of scheduling games and events, monitoring a team's players and making sure coaches, players and anyone who is heavily involved with the department are complying with all of the sports agency's regulations.&lt;ref name="chron.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://work.chron.com/athletic-directors-duties-15807.html|title=An Athletic Director's Duties|author=|date=|website=chron.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[bachelor's degree]] is required for all divisions and a [[masters degree]] is preferred by larger schools.&lt;ref name="chron.com"/&gt; These degrees normally consist of [[sports management]], [[psychology]], [[physical education]] and [[business management]].&lt;ref name="chron.com"/&gt;  The top athletic directors in [[high school]] have an average [[salary]] ranging from $58,400 to $87,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salarygenius.com/1/1/salary/high-school-athletic-director-salary|title=High School Athletic Director Salary - Salary Genius|author=|date=|website=salarygenius.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the highest paid athletic director at the NCAA Division I level was [[David Williams (athletic director)|David Williams]] of [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] who was paid $3,239,678.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-20-highest-paid-athletic-directors-in-college-sports-2013-3?op=1|title=The 20 Highest-Paid Athletic Directors In College Sports|author=|date=|website=businessinsider.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Williams' salary is not directly comparable to that of other Division I athletic directors because of Vanderbilt's unique administrative structure for varsity athletics. Unlike all other Division I schools, Vanderbilt athletics are not administered by a separate athletic department, but instead are governed directly by the university (specifically within its Division for Student Life). Effectively, Vanderbilt athletics are treated as any other student organization. Williams' athletic duties are part of his position as Vanderbilt's vice president for student life.

==Athletic directors as coaches==
Formerly, especially at major [[American football|football]]-playing institutions, particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]], the head football coach was also the "AD".  Among the coaches to hold simultaneously hold the AD position were [[Bear Bryant]] (Texas A&amp;M and Alabama), [[Ray Perkins]] (Alabama), [[Frank Broyles]] (Arkansas), [[Pat Dye]] (Auburn), [[Ray Graves]] (Florida), [[Wally Butts]] (Georgia), [[Vince Dooley]] (Georgia), [[Charles Shira]] (Mississippi State), [[Bud Wilkinson]] (Oklahoma), [[Robert Neyland]] (Tennessee), [[Darrell Royal]] (Texas) and [[Emory Bellard]] (Texas A&amp;M).

Broyles retired as Arkansas football coach in 1976, but remained as Razorbacks athletic director through 2007. Dooley retired as Georgia football coach in 1988, but remained as athletic director well into the 2000s.

[[LSU Tigers and Lady Tigers|LSU]] was one of the exceptions to the rule in the south. [[LSU Tigers football|Football]] coach [[Charles McClendon]] nearly bolted for [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies|Texas A&amp;M]] when he was offered the combined position of football coach and athletic director by the Aggies in January 1972, but remained in Baton Rouge after successful lobbying by LSU athletic director [[Carl Maddox]] and Louisiana Governor [[John McKeithen]].

[[Kentucky Wildcats|Kentucky]] always kept its coaching and athletic director positions separate, even during the period (1946–53) when Bear Bryant coached [[Kentucky Wildcats football|football]] and [[Adolph Rupp]] coached [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|men's basketball]]. Even though Bryant and Rupp were technically equals under athletic director [[Bernie Shively]], Bryant chafed under the impression he was far less powerful and far less revered than Rupp, a main factor in his departure from Lexington.

This was usually done in a nominal sense, giving the coach additional prestige, additional pay, and the knowledge that the only supervision that he was under was that of the college [[president]] or chancellor and perhaps an athletics committee, and such supervision was often token.  An associate athletics director actually performed the functions of athletic director on a daily basis in the name of the coach. At a few institutions where [[basketball]] was the predominant sport the head men's basketball coach was treated similarly.  In recent decades, this system has been almost entirely abandoned; collegiate sports, especially in its compliance aspects, has become far too complicated an undertaking to be run on a part-time basis.  The last football coach to hold both positions at a major university was [[Derek Dooley (American football)|Derek Dooley]] at [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs and Lady Techsters|Louisiana Tech]] before leaving to become head coach at [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] after the 2009 season.

[[Paul Dietzel]] (LSU) and [[Tom Osborne]] (Nebraska) coached the football teams at their respective schools to national championships and later came back as athletic director after working elsewhere. Dietzel left LSU following the 1961 football season and coached at Army and South Carolina before returning to LSU as AD in 1978. Osborne served three terms in the [[United States House of Representatives]] after coaching the Cornhuskers from 1973 through 1997; he returned to Nebraska as AD in 2007.

[[Johnny Vaught]], who coached [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]] to a share of the 1960 national championship, was not the Rebels' athletic director during his original 24-year tenure (1947-70) as football coach, but was re-hired as coach and also given the duties of athletic director three games into the [[1973 Ole Miss Rebels football team|1973 season]]. Vaught stepped down as football coach at the end of the 1973 season, but remained as athletic director until 1978. 

Additionally, most of the old-line coaches who demanded such total control as a condition of employment have since either retired (or in Dooley's case, forced out) or died (Bryant died four weeks after coaching his final football game at Alabama), leaving in place a new generation who are not desirous of such an arrangement, if it were to be made available, and additionally have developed other sources of income, such as shoe contracts and radio and television appearance fees and endorsement contracts, that make the income which might come from the additional duty of athletic director unnecessary.

Increasingly, college athletic directors are less likely to be retired or active coaches with physical education or sports administration degrees and more likely to be persons who majored in business administration or a related field.  The budget for a major athletic department of a large American university is now routinely at the level of tens of millions of dollars; such enterprises demand professional management.  Athletic directors have their own professional organization in the U.S., the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]].

Other individuals may be referred to as athletic directors. As mentioned above, many U.S. [[high school]]s have someone who performs this duty at least on a part-time basis, usually in conjunction with another coaching or administrative position; some [[school district]]s have a full-time director of athletics.  Additionally, corporations which sponsor recreational or competitive sports may employ an athletic director.

[[File:Baseball diamond marines.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The baseball diamond of the [[San Diego]] [[San Diego Padres|Padres]]' [[Petco Park]], seen from the left-field stands.]]

A '''baseball field''', also called a '''ball field''', '''sandlot''' or a '''baseball diamond''', is the [[playing field|field]] upon which the game of [[baseball]] is played. The term can also be used as a [[metonym]] for a [[baseball park]].

==Specifications==
:''Unless otherwise noted, the specifications discussed in this section refer to those described within the [[Official Baseball Rules]], under which Major League Baseball is played.''&lt;ref name="Rule1" /&gt;
[[File:Baseball diamond.svg|thumb|500px|Diagram of a baseball field.]]
The starting point for much of the action on the field is [[home plate]] (officially "home base"), which is a five-sided slab of whitened rubber, {{convert|17|in|cm}} square with two of the corners removed so that one edge is 17 inches long, two adjacent sides are {{convert|8.5|in|cm}} and the remaining two sides are {{convert|12|in|cm}} and set at an angle to make a point. The plate is set into the ground such that its surface is level with the surrounding ground. Adjacent to each of the two parallel 8.5-inch sides is a batter's box. The point of home plate where the two 12-inch sides meet at right angles is at one corner of a {{convert|90|ft|m|2|adj=on}} square. The other three corners of the square, in counterclockwise order from home plate, are called [[first base|first]], [[second base|second]], and [[third base]]. Three canvas or rubber bases {{convert|15|in|cm}} square and {{convert|3|-|5|in|cm}} in thickness made of soft material mark the three bases.

Near the center of the square is an artificial hill known as the pitcher's mound, atop which is a white rubber slab known as the pitcher's plate, colloquially the "rubber." The specifications for the pitcher's mound are described [[#Pitcher's mound|below]].

All the bases, including home plate, lie entirely within fair territory. Thus, any batted ball that touches those bases must necessarily be in fair territory. While the first and third base bags are placed so that they lie inside the 90-foot square formed by the bases, the second base bag is placed so that its center (unlike first, third and home) coincides exactly with the "point" of the ninety-foot square. Thus, although the "points" of the bases are 90 feet apart, the physical distance between each successive pair of base markers is closer to {{convert|88|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=DIAGRAM NO 2|page=5|title=Official Rules of Major League Baseball, 2013 Edition|publisher=Triumph Books|isbn=978-1-60078-797-3|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2013/official_baseball_rules.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines from home plate to first and third bases extend to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction and are called the foul lines. The portion of the playing field between (and including) the foul lines is fair territory; the rest is "foul territory." The area within the square formed by the bases is officially called the infield, though colloquially this term also includes fair territory in the vicinity of the square; fair territory outside the infield is known as the outfield. Most baseball fields are enclosed with a fence that marks the outer edge of the outfield. The fence is usually set at a distance ranging from {{convert|300|to|420|ft|m|-1}} from home plate. Most professional and college baseball fields have a right and left foul pole. These poles are at the intersection of the foul lines and the respective ends of the outfield fence and, unless otherwise specified within the [[ground rules]], lie in fair territory. Thus, a batted ball that passes over the outfield wall in flight and touches the foul pole is a fair ball and the batter is awarded a home run.

==First base==
{{main|First baseman}}
[[File:Chris Davis, Kevin Pillar (34422505340).jpg|thumb|right|[[Kevin Pillar]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] reaches first base safely as Chris Davis of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] attempts to scoop a bouncing ball thrown by one of the other infielders during a game in May 2017]] 

First base is the first of four bases that must be touched by a player on the batting team in order to score a run. Unlike when an offensive player reaches second or third base, it is permissible for a batter-runner to overrun first base without being in jeopardy of being put out. After contact is made with the base, the batter-runner may slow down and return to first base at his leisure, so long as he makes no move or attempt to advance to second base.

The first baseman is the defensive player responsible for the area near first base. A professional first baseman is often a slow runner and tall.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  A tall first baseman presents a large target to which other fielders can throw, and his height gives him a larger range in reaching and catching errant throws. Players who are left-handed are marginally preferable for first base because: first, it is easier for a left-handed fielder to catch a [[Pickoff|pick-off]] throw from the pitcher and tag the baserunner; and, second, it is easier for a left handed thrower to make the throw to second base to start a 3–6–3, 3–6–4, or a 3–6–1 double play.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Also, a right-handed first baseman must, when setting himself up to receive a throw from an infielder, execute a half-pivot near the base; this is a move that a left-hander need not make (this advantage is very marginal, however). There are three infield positions that can only effectively be occupied by right-handed players: 2nd base, 3rd base, and shortstop. This is because of the time it takes to pivot and set to throw. It takes a left-handed thrower more time to make that pivot and in the fast-paced major league game, that time is critical. As a result, there are fewer positions a left-handed player can occupy, and if that player is not fast, the outfield may not be a good fit.

In the [[Baseball scorekeeping|numbering system]] used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.

==Second base==
{{main|Second baseman}}
[[File:Second baseman Brian Dozier trying to turn double play.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brian Dozier]] of the [[Minnesota Twins]] leaps over a sliding [[Jonathan Schoop]] of the Baltimore Orioles attempting to turn a [[double play]]]]

Second base is the second of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a base runner in order to score a run for that player's team. Second base is typically defended by the second baseman and the [[shortstop]]. Second base is also known as the keystone sack. A runner on second base is said to be in "scoring position," owing to the high likelihood of reaching home plate and scoring a run from second base on most base hits. Since second is the farthest base from home plate, it is the most common target of [[base stealing]].

Ideally, the second baseman and shortstop possess quick hands and feet and the ability to release the ball rapidly and with accuracy. One will usually cover second base when the other attempts to field the ball. Both players must communicate well to be able to make a [[double play]]. Particular agility is required of the second baseman in double play situations, which usually forces the player to throw towards first while his momentum carries him in the opposite direction. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4, and the shortstop 6.

==Third base==
[[File:Andy Wilkins rounds the bases.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Andy Wilkins rounds third base following a home run for the [[2010 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team]].]]
{{main|Third baseman}}
Third base is the third of four bases a base runner must touch in a counterclockwise succession in order to score a run. Many batted balls that result in the batter being put out (such as a [[sacrifice fly]]) may nevertheless allow a runner to reach home plate and score a run from third base, provided that the third and final out is not recorded before he can do so. A runner on third base is therefore particularly valuable to the batting team when fewer than two outs have been recorded.

The third baseman is the defensive player whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base. A third baseman ideally possesses quick reaction to batted balls and a strong arm to make the long throw to first base. The distance from 3rd to 1st is about {{convert|127|ft|m}}. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5.

==Home plate==
{{redirect|Home plate}}
[[File:Home base of baseball field in Třebíč, Czech Republic.jpg|thumb|Home plate of a baseball field]]
Home plate, formally designated home base in the rules, is the final base that a player must touch to score. Unlike the other bases, home plate is a [[pentagon|five-sided]] slab of whitened rubber that is set at ground level. The use of rubber was developed by [[Bob Keating|Robert Keating]], who pitched one game for the 1887 Baltimore Orioles. Previously the plate was made of stone, iron, or wood.&lt;ref&gt;James, B. New Historical Baseball Abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimensions of home plate are {{convert|17|in|cm}} across the front, {{convert|8.5|in|cm}} down each side, with a triangular rear of two sides of {{convert|12|in|cm}}. The rear edges are at 45 degrees to the sides, making a point at the back.&lt;ref name="Rule1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/objectives_1.jsp|title=Official Rules: 1.00 Objectives of the Game|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plate is white and surrounded by a black strip {{convert|3/4|in|cm}} in width. The plate sits entirely in "fair" territory, with the two rear edges aligned with the right and left field foul lines. The length and angle requirements for home plate mandate that it is not a regular pentagon; it is a 17 by 8.5 inches rectangle with an isosceles triangle of base 17 inches and equal sides of 12 inches attached to the back.

{{convert|50|to|100|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} behind home plate is the [[backstop (baseball)|backstop]], which is a wall/fence that will stop [[wild pitch]]es, [[passed ball]]s, and [[foul ball]]s. In enclosed stadiums, the backstop is often composed of a lower part, which is like any other part of the wall, and an upper netting to protect spectators seated behind it; in recreational baseball fields, there is usually a tall [[chain-link fence]], including an angled top section, composing the entire backstop.

==Batter's box and catcher's box==&lt;!---"Catcher's box" and variations of that spelling redirect here. Additionally, it has been recommended to merge "Batter's box" and various spellings in this section ---&gt;
[[File:David-ortiz-batters-box.JPG|right|thumb|300px|[[David Ortiz]] (in gray) of the [[Boston Red Sox]] stands in the left-handed hitters' batter's box at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] against the [[Chicago White Sox]] on July 7, [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]].]]
The batter's box is the place where the [[batting (baseball)|batter]] stands when ready to receive a [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] from the [[pitcher]]. It is usually drawn in [[chalk]] on the dirt surrounding [[home plate]], and the insides of the boxes are watered down before each game.

The chalk lines delineating the two foul lines are rarely extended through the batter's boxes. However, those lines exist conceptually for the purpose of judging a batted ball fair or foul. In addition, inside edges of the batter's boxes are often not laid-in with chalk. Similarly, though not marked, those lines continue to exist for the purpose of the rules pertaining to the batter's box and the batter's position relative thereto.

There are two batter's boxes, one on each side of home plate. The batter's boxes are {{convert|4|ft|m|2}} wide and {{convert|6|ft|m|2}} long. The batter's boxes are centered lengthwise at the center of home plate with the inside line of each batter's box {{convert|6|in|cm}} from the near edge of home plate. A [[handedness|right-handed]] batter would stand in the batter's box on the left side of home plate from the perspective of the [[catcher]] and umpire. A left-handed batter would stand in the batter's box to their right. A batter may only occupy one batter's box at a time and may not legally leave the batter's box after the pitcher has come set or has started his windup. Should the batter wish to leave the batter's box once the pitcher has engaged the [[pitcher's plate|rubber]], he must first ask the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] for [[Time-out (sport)|time-out]]. Time will not be granted if the pitcher has already started his pitching motion. For playing rules relating to the batter's box, see Rules 6.05 and 6.06 of the [[Official Baseball Rules]].

==Foul poles==
[[File:Dsc03277.JPG|right|thumb|250px|One of two foul poles at [[Citizens Bank Park]], Philadelphia.]]
Foul poles, if present, help umpires judge whether a fly ball hit above the fence line is [[Foul ball|foul]] (out of play) or fair (a [[home run]]). The poles are a vertical extension of the foul lines at the edge of the field of play. The outer edge of the foul lines and foul poles define foul territory. Both the lines and the poles are in fair territory, in contrast to American football and basketball, where the lines marking the playing boundaries are out of bounds. The minimum distance to hit a home run (along either foul line) is set by baseball rules, generally at {{convert|325|feet|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/rules/field-dimensions |title=Field Dimensions |publisher=MLB.com |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1920,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} the foul lines extended indefinitely; a batter was awarded a home run only if a fly ball out of the field was fair where it landed, or "when last seen" by the umpire. Now, a batted ball that leaves the field in flight is judged fair or foul at the point it leaves the field. Thus, such a fly ball passing on the fair side of a foul pole, or hitting a foul pole, is a home run regardless of where the ball goes thereafter.

Foul poles are typically much higher than the top of the outfield fence or wall, and often have a narrow screen running along the fair side of the pole. This further aids the umpires' judgment, as a ball that bounces off this screen is a home run. It can still be a difficult call, especially in ballparks with no outfield stands behind the poles to provide perspective. [[Wrigley Field]] is notorious for arguments over long, curving flies down a foul line (most notably in left field) that sail higher than the foul pole.

At Major League Baseball fields, foul poles are usually yellow. Those at [[Citi Field#Features|Citi Field]] are orange. At the [[Rogers Centre]], there are no foul poles, but large nets suspended from the roof that serve the same purpose. At [[Petco Park]], there is no foul pole in left field; the pole's function is served by a yellow metal strip along the corner of the Western Metal Supply Co. building.

==Pitcher's mound==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[San Francisco Giants]] --&gt;
[[File:Baseball pitch release.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The pitcher moves forward off the rubber as the pitch is released.]]
In roughly the middle of the square, equidistant between first and third base, and a few feet closer to home plate than to second base, is a low artificial hill called the pitcher's mound. This is where the [[pitcher]] stands when throwing the [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]]. Atop the mound is a white rubber slab, called the pitcher's plate or pitcher's rubber. It measures {{convert|6|in|cm}} front-to-back and {{convert|2|ft|cm}} across, the front of which is exactly {{convert|60|ft|6|in|m}} from the rear point of home plate. This peculiar distance was set by the rule makers in 1893, not due to a clerical or surveying error as popular myth has it, but intentionally (further details under ''[[#History|History]]'').

In [[Major League Baseball]], a regulation mound is {{convert|18|ft|m}} in diameter, with the center {{convert|59|ft|m}} from the rear point of home plate, on the line between home plate and [[second base]]. The front edge of the ''pitcher's plate'' or ''rubber'' is {{convert|18|in|cm}} behind the center of the mound, making the front edge's midpoint 60 feet 6 inches from the rear point of home plate. Six inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) in front of the pitcher's rubber the mound begins to slope downward. The top of the rubber is to be no higher than ten inches (25&amp;nbsp;cm) above home plate. From 1903 through 1968, this height limit was set at {{convert|15|in|cm}}, but was often slightly higher, sometimes as high as {{convert|20|in|cm}}, especially for teams that emphasized pitching, such as the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], who were reputed to have the highest mound in the majors.

A pitcher will push off the rubber with his foot in order to gain velocity toward [[home plate]] when pitching. In addition, a higher mound generally favors the pitcher. With the height advantage, the pitcher gains more leverage and can put more downward velocity on the ball, making it more difficult for the batter to strike the ball squarely with the [[baseball bat|bat]]. The lowering of the mound in 1969 was intended to "increase the batting" once again, as pitching had become increasingly dominant, reaching its peak the prior year; 1968 is known among baseball historians as "The Year of the Pitcher." This restrictive rule apparently did its job, contributing to the hitting surge of modern baseball.

A pitcher's mound is difficult for [[groundskeeper]]s to maintain. Usually before every game it is watered down to keep the dust from spreading. On youth and amateur baseball fields, the mound may be much different from the rule book definition due to erosion and repair attempts. Even in the major leagues, each mound gains its own character, as pitchers are allowed to kick away pieces of dirt in their way, thereby sculpting the mound a bit to their preference.

The pitcher may keep a [[rosin]] bag on the rear of the mound to dry off his hands. Major League Baseball teams are also permitted [[Cleat (shoe)|cleat]] cleaners on the back of the mound. This may be a flat grate-style plate, or simply a hand tool such as a piece of wood used to remove mud and dirt from cleats. These items are allowed to remain on the backside of the mound at the discretion of the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]], thus reducing the probability that they will affect a live play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/pitcher_8.jsp|title=Official Rules|work=Major League Baseball|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseline==
A baseline is the straight line between two adjacent bases. Baselines are not drawn on the field, although the foul lines serve to mark the baseline between home plate and first base, and between third base and home.

===Running baseline===
Generally, [[baserunner|base runner]]s are not required to follow the baseline. A base runner seeking to advance more than one base typically "rounds" the base, following a more circular path. However, a base runner's left-right motion is constrained when the defense tries to [[Tag out|tag]] him. At the moment the defense begins the attempt, the baserunner's running baseline is established as a direct line from his current position to the base he is trying for. A runner straying more than {{convert|3|ft|m|0|spell=in}} away from this baseline to avoid a tag may be called out.

===Running lane===
Beginning halfway between home and first base, and ending at first base, there is a second chalk line to the right of the foul line. This second line and the part of the foul line it runs parallel to, form the running lane that defines the path in which a batter-runner must run as he is advancing to first base. Rule 6.05(k) of the [[Official Baseball Rules]] states that, if a batter-runner running to first base runs outside the running lane, and "in doing so" interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first, then the batter-runner is automatically out. First base itself is not located in the running lane, but Rule 6.05 lets the batter-runner leave the running lane "by means of a step, stride or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base" to step on first base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Baseball Explained|author=Mahony, Phillip|publisher=McFarland Books|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grass line==
[[File:Metrodome ALDS Oct 2004.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], showing a white "grass" line. ]] The grass line, where the dirt of the infield ends and the grass of the outfield begins, has no special significance to the rules of the game, but it can influence the outcome of a game. Dirt running paths between the bases (and, at one time and still in some parks, between the pitcher and the catcher) have existed since the beginning of the game, although they were not mentioned in the rule books until around 1950, and their specifications are flexible. In addition to providing a running path, the grass lines act as a visual aid so that players, [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]] and fans may better judge distance from the center of the diamond. Occasionally the ball may take a tricky bounce off the dirt area or the edge between the dirt and the grass. Multiple [[World Series]] championships (including 1924, 1960 and 1986) have been decided or heavily influenced by erratic hops of [[ground ball]]s.

In [[artificial turf]] stadiums, infield dirt was originally only placed around the bases and around the pitcher's and batting areas, which are referred to as "sliding pits."  In this configuration, the "grass line" is usually designated with a white arc. Among Major League Baseball fields, [[Rogers Centre]] was the last stadium to maintain this type of configuration and was reconfigured with a full dirt infield starting in the 2016 MLB season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto Blue Jays' new dirt infield under construction at Rogers Centre|date=February 10, 2016|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/construction-begins-new-dirt-infield-rogers-centre-1.3442659|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[college baseball]] parks with artificial turf fields, the entire field (along with possibly the pitcher's mound) is made up of turf, with parts of the field mainly containing dirt instead merely being clay-colored turf.

==Outfield==
{{anchor|outfield}}The [[outfield]] is made from thick grass or artificial turf. It is where the outfielders play. The positions to play in the outfield are right, center, and left field (named in relation to the batter's position; thus left field is beyond third base and right field is beyond first base). Outfields vary in size and shape depending on the overall size and shape of the playing field. The outfield stretches from the infield to the outfield wall and it contains the warning track. Outfields especially vary from Little League to Major League fields. Little League outfields vary more in size than Major League outfields. Outfields often differ from infields in the specific type of grass used, but most Major League outfields are grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballpilgrimages.com/grass-at-major-league-ballparks.html|title=Major League Baseball Ballpark Grass and Turf|website=www.baseballpilgrimages.com|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warning track==
[[File:Outfield warning track from the right field line, Husky Field - Baseball.JPG|thumb|right|The warning track abutting the outfield fence of Husky Field, used by the Houston Baptist Huskies baseball team]]
The warning track is the strip of dirt at the edges of the baseball field (especially in front of the home run fence and along the left and right sides of a field). Because the warning track's color and feel differ from the grass field, a fielder can remain focused on a fly ball near the fence and measure his proximity to the fence while attempting to catch the ball safely.

A warning track's width is not specified in the rules. It is generally designed to give about three steps of warning to the highest-level players using the field. Typical widths run from about six feet for Little League fields to about {{convert|10|-|15|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} for college- or professional-level play. A warning track this wide also lets groundskeepers avoid driving maintenance vehicles on the grass.

The track can be composed of finely ground rock particles such as cinders, which is why announcer [[Bob Wolff]] called it the "cinder path" rather than the "warning track."

The idea of a warning track originated in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], where an actual running track was built for use in track and field events. When ballpark designers saw how the track helped fielders, it soon became a feature of every ballpark.

Single-minded fielders often crash into a wall trying to make a catch despite the warning track. For this reason, outfield walls are typically padded for extra safety. [[Wrigley Field]]'s brick wall is covered only by ivy, which is not especially soft. However, there are pads on the walls of the tight left and right field corners in foul ground.

''Warning-track power'' is a derogatory term for a batter who seems to have just enough power to hit the ball to the warning track for an out, but not enough to hit a home run. The term more generally refers to someone or something that is almost but not quite good enough for something.

==Outfield wall==
[[File:Green Monster 2006.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Green Monster]] in 2006, showing the manual scoreboard and Green Monster seating, and more recent additions, including charity advertisements along the top, billboards above the Green Monster seating, and the [[American League East]] standings.]]
[[File:Jacob's Field Fultz and Betancourt in the Bullpen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pitchers warming up in the bullpen]]

The outfield wall or outfield fence is the wall or fence that marks the outer boundary of the outfield. A ball passing over the wall is [[dead ball|dead]]; if it passes over the wall in [[fair territory]] while [[in flight]], it is a home run. The official rules do not specify the shape, height, or composition of the wall, or a specific mandatory distance from home plate (though Major League Baseball mandates a minimum distance of {{convert|250|ft|m}} and recommends a minimum distance of {{convert|320|ft|m}} at the foul poles and {{convert|400|ft|m}} at center field). As a result, baseball fields can vary greatly along those lines. The wall has numbers affixed or painted on it that denote the distance from that point on the wall to home plate. In most modern major league ballparks, the wall is made of some hard material (e.g., concrete, plywood, sheet metal) with padding on the field side to protect players who may collide with the wall at high speed while trying to make a play. [[Chain link fencing]] may also be incorporated into the wall in areas where the wall needs to be transparent, e.g., an outfield [[bullpen]], a spectator area behind the wall, or to protect a [[scoreboard]] incorporated into the wall. Many ballparks feature a yellow line denoting the top of the wall to aid umpires in judging whether the ball passed over the wall or if the ball is fair or foul.

==Bullpen==
{{main|Bullpen}}
The bullpen (sometimes referred to as simply "the 'pen") is the area where pitchers warm up before entering a game. Depending on the ballpark, it may be situated in foul territory along the baselines or just beyond the outfield fence. Relief pitchers usually wait in the bullpen when they have yet to play in a game, rather than in the [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] with the rest of the team. The starting pitcher also makes his final pregame warmups in the bullpen. Managers can call coaches in the bullpen on an [[hotline|in-house telephone]] from the dugout to tell a certain pitcher to begin his warmup tosses.
"Bullpen" is also used [[metonymy|metonymically]] to describe a team's collection of relief pitchers.

==On-deck circles==
{{main|On-deck}}
There are two on-deck circles in the field, one for each team, positioned in foul ground between home plate and the respective teams' benches. They are technically known as next-batter's boxes. The on-deck circle is where the next scheduled batter, or "on-deck" batter, warms up while waiting for the current batter to finish his turn. The on-deck circle is either an area composed of bare dirt; a plain circle painted onto artificial turf; or often, especially at the professional level, a mat made from artificial material, with the team or league logo painted onto it.

==Coach's boxes==
The [[coach's box]]es, located behind first and third base, are where the first and third base [[coach (baseball)|coaches]] are supposed to stand, although coaches often stand outside the box. This is permissible as long as the coach does not interfere with play and the opposing team does not object (in which case the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] shall ensure that all coaches on both teams must abide by the boundaries of the coach's boxes). The coach's boxes are marked with chalk or paint. In the early days of baseball, the term "coacher's box" was used, as "coach" was taken to be a verb. As the term "coach" evolved into a noun, the name of the box also changed.

==History==
{{Original research section|date=May 2012}}
The basic layout of the diamond has been little changed since the original [[Knickerbocker Rules]] of the 1840s. The distance between bases was already established as {{convert|90|ft|m|2}}, which it remains. Through trial and error, 90 feet had been settled upon as the optimal distance. 100 feet would have given too much advantage to the defense, and 80 feet too much to the offense.

The original Knickerbocker Rules did not specify the pitching distance explicitly. By the time major league baseball began in the 1870s, the pitcher was compelled to pitch from within a "box" whose front edge was {{convert|45|ft|m}} from the "point" of home plate. Although he had to release the ball before crossing the line, as with bowlers in [[cricket]], he also had to start his delivery from within the box; he could not run in from the field as bowlers do. Furthermore, the pitcher had to throw underhand. By the 1880s, pitchers had mastered the underhand delivery—in fact, in 1880, there were two [[perfect game]]s within a week of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/boxscore/06121880.shtml|title=Lee Richmond Perfect Game Box Score by Baseball Almanac|work=baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to "increase the batting," the front edge of the pitcher's box was moved back 5 feet in 1881, to {{convert|50|ft|m}} from home plate. The size of the box was altered over the following few years. Pitchers were allowed to throw overhand starting in 1884, and that tilted the balance of power again. In 1887, the box was set at {{convert|4|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|5.5|ft|m}} deep, with the front edge still 50 feet from the plate. However, the pitcher was compelled to deliver the ball with his back foot at the {{convert|55.5|ft|m|adj=on}} line of the box, thus somewhat restricting his ability to "power" the ball with his overhand delivery.&lt;ref name=Lansch&gt;{{cite book|title=Glory Fades Away|author=Lansch, Jerry}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96}}

In 1893, the box was replaced by the pitcher's plate, although "the box" is still used today as a slang term for the pitcher's location on the field. Exactly 5 feet was added to the point the pitcher had to toe, again "to increase the batting" (and hopefully to increase attendance, as fan interest had flagged somewhat), resulting in the seemingly peculiar pitching distance of {{convert|60.5|ft|m|2}}.&lt;ref name=Lansch/&gt;{{rp|230}}

Many sources suggest that the pitching distance evolved from 45 to 50 to 60.5 feet. However, the first two were the "release point" and the third is the "pushoff point," so the 1893 increase was not quite as dramatic as is often implied; that is, the 1893 rule change added only 5 feet to the release point, not 10.5 feet.

Originally the pitcher threw from flat ground, but over time the raised mound was developed, somewhat returning the advantage to the pitchers. Before the mid-20th century, it was common for baseball fields to include a dirt pathway between the pitcher's mound and home plate. This feature is sometimes known as the "keyhole" due to the shape that it makes together with the mound. The keyhole was once as wide as the pitcher's box and resembled a [[cricket pitch]]. Sometimes this path extended through the batting area and all the way to the backstop. Once the rounded pitcher's mound was developed, the path became more ornamental than practical, and was gradually thinned before being largely abandoned by the 1950s. In recent years some ballparks, such as [[Comerica Park]] and [[Chase Field]] in the major leagues, have revived the feature for nostalgic reasons.

[[File:Game 3 of the 2006 NBA Finals.jpg|thumb|right|The home court of the [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]]] In [[basketball]], the '''basketball court''' is the playing surface, consisting of a rectangular floor with baskets at either end. In professional or organized basketball, especially when played indoors, it is usually made out of a [[wood]], often [[maple]], and highly polished and completed with a 10 foot rim. Outdoor surfaces are generally made from standard paving materials such as [[concrete]] or [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]].

== Dimensions ==
Basketball courts come in different sizes. In the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the court is {{convert|94|by|50|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. Under [[FIBA|International Basketball Federation]] (FIBA) rules,&lt;ref name="FIBA2006Rules"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.fiba.com/asp_includes/download.asp?file_id=328 | title = Official Basketball Rules 2006 | format = pdf | work =  | publisher = [[FIBA|International Basketball Federation]] | accessdate = 2007-04-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070406072645/http://www.fiba.com/asp_includes/download.asp?file_id=328| archivedate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the court is minutely smaller, measuring exactly {{convert|28|by|15|meters|ft|sigfig=3}}. In amateur basketball, court sizes vary widely. The baskets are always {{convert|10|ft|m|sigfig=3}} above the floor (except possibly in youth competition). Basketball courts have a three-point arc at both baskets. A basket made from behind this arc is worth three points; a basket made from within this line, or with a player's foot touching the line, is worth 2 points. The free-throw line, where one stands while taking a foul shot, is located within the three-point arc at 15 feet from the basket. A foul shot is worth 1 point, but if a shot is made from the foul line while in play it is still worth 2 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wissel|first=Hal|title=Basketball: steps to success|year=1994|publisher=Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc.|location=United States|isbn=0-7360-5500-2|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections==
[[File:Basketball terms.png|thumb|300px|Most important terms related to the basketball court]]
===Center circle===
The only two players permitted to enter this area prior to the tipoff are the players contesting the jump ball (usually but not always centers). Both players jump when the referee throws the ball in the air, each attempting to tap the ball into the hands of a player of their own team.

===Three-point line===
The three-point line is the line that separates the two-point area from the [[three-point field goal|three-point area]]; any shot converted beyond this line counts as three points. If the shooting player steps on the line, it is counted as two points. Any foul made in the act of shooting beyond the three-point line would give the player three [[free throws]] if the shot does not go in, and one if it does.

The distance to the [[three-point field goal|three-point]] line from the center of the basket varies depending on the level or league, and has changed several times. These are the current distances, with the league or level using each distance:

* 19.75&amp;nbsp;ft (6.02 m): High School
* 20.75&amp;nbsp;ft (6.32 m): NCAA
* 21.65&amp;nbsp;ft (6.60 m) to 22.15&amp;nbsp;ft (6.75 m): WNBA and FIBA
* 22&amp;nbsp;ft (6.71 m) to 23.75&amp;nbsp;ft (7.24 m): NBA

The NBA adopted the three-point line at the start of the [[1979–80 NBA season|1979–80 season]]. This is of variable distance, ranging from {{convert|22|ft|m}} in the corners to {{convert|23.75|ft|m}} behind the top of the key. During the 1994–95, 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons, the NBA attempted to address decreased scoring by shortening the overall distance of the line to a uniform {{convert|22|ft|m}} around the basket. It was moved back to its original distance after the 1996–97 season. FIBA and the NCAA both adopted the three-point line in 1985.

In most high school associations in the United States, the distance is 19.75 feet. This was formerly the distance for [[college basketball]] as well. On May 26, 2007, the NCAA playing rules committee agreed to move the three-point line back one foot to 20.75 feet for the men. This rule went into effect for the 2008–2009 season. The three-point line for women (NCAA) moved back one foot to 20.75 feet at the start of the 2011–2012 season.

The international distance, used in most countries outside the United States and in [[FIBA]] and [[WNBA]] competition, is currently 6.6&amp;nbsp;m (21.65&amp;nbsp;ft) to 6.75&amp;nbsp;m (22.15&amp;nbsp;ft).

===Perimeter===
The perimeter is defined as the areas outside the free throw lane and inside the three-point line. Shots converted (successfully made) from this area are called "perimeter shots" or "medium-range shots."
If a player's foot is on the three-point line, the shot is considered a perimeter shot.

===Low post area===
The low post is defined as the areas that are closest to the basket but outside of the free throw lane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbaballers.org/BasketballGlossary/Basketball-Glossary-L.html Basketball Glossary Terms, Definition, Lane violation, Low post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430102709/http://nbaballers.org/BasketballGlossary/Basketball-Glossary-L.html |date=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is fundamental to strategy in basketball. Skilled low post players can score many points per game without ever taking a [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]].

=== Key ===
The [[key (basketball)|key]], free throw lane or shaded lane refers to the usually painted area beneath the basket; for the NBA it is {{convert|16|ft|m}} wide, for the NCAA it is {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide; for both instances it extends {{convert|15|ft|m}} from the backboard. At the top of the rectangle is the [[free throw]] line, behind which players shoot uncontested shots when they're fouled. A circle is drawn around the free-throw line with a {{convert|6|ft|m}} [[radius]]; this is used for jump ball instances, as is done at the [[#Center circle|center circle]].  Two 6-inch hash lines, 3&amp;nbsp;ft from the free throw lane line and 5&amp;nbsp;ft 8 in from the free throw line, show the lower defensive box linked to the restricted area.

For FIBA tournaments, since October 2010 the key has been a rectangle 4.9 m wide and 5.8 m long. Previously it was a trapezoid 3.7 meters (12&amp;nbsp;ft) wide at the free-throw line and 6 meters (19 feet and 6.25&amp;nbsp;inches) at the end line.

The key is primarily used to prevent players from staying beneath the basket of the opponents' team for long periods (maximum three seconds).

The restricted area arc is a semi-circular arc drawn around the area directly underneath the basket. With some exceptions, members of the defending team cannot draw charging fouls in this area.
The restricted arc in all North American rule sets above high school level ([[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] men's and women's, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]) has a radius 4 feet (1.22 m) from below the center of the basket. The restricted area arc rule first appeared at any level of basketball in the NBA in the 1997-98 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factuation.com/shaq-and-the-no-charge-zone-rule/ |title=Shaq and the No Charge Zone Rule |publisher=Factuation |date=July 1, 2015 |website=Factuation |access-date=February 27, 2018 |quote=In the 1997-1998 season, NBA added the “no charge zone” or the “restricted area”. This is the portion of the key, denoted by an arc in the painted area that is positioned four feet from the basket. The arc is important because a defending player can not force a charging foul within this area. It was designed to provide benefit offensive post-up player like [Shaquille] O’Neal, players who drive to the basket and limit collisions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAA restricted area arc was originally established for the 2011–12 men's and women's seasons at a {{conv|3|ft|adj=on}} radius from below the center of the basket, and was extended to match the (W)NBA radius for the 2015–16 season and beyond.

===Other lines===
On NBA floors, two hash marks are drawn at the end lines near the key to mark the area known as the lower defensive box. A defensive player is allowed to draw a charging foul within the restricted arc if the offensive player receives the ball and/or starts his drive within this area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/nba101/misunderstood_0708.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, two lines are drawn on each of the sidelines, 28 feet from each of the endlines, which designates the extent of the coaching box and bench. This line marks the farthest extent a coach (aside from the sidelines) can stand. Directly behind this area is the team bench.

On the half-court line of NBA floors two lines extend outside the playing court, designating the place where substitutes wait before they can enter the playing court; directly behind this area are the various off-court officials such as the timekeeper and reserve referee.

===FIBA changes===

On April 26, 2008, FIBA announced several major rules changes involving the court markings. These changes took effect for major international competitions on October 1, 2010, after that year's World Championships [[2010 FIBA World Championship|for men]] and [[2010 FIBA World Championship for Women|women]], and became mandatory for other competitions on October 1, 2012 (although national federations could adopt the new markings before 2012). The changes were as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/news/lateNews/p/newsid/24352/arti.html |title=The FIBA Central Board approves historic rule changes |publisher=FIBA |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2008-04-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080430210952/http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/news/lateNews/p/newsid/24352/arti.html| archivedate= 30 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The shape of the key changed from a trapezoid to a rectangle as it is in the NBA, with NBA dimensions.
* The three-point line moved back to 6.75 meters (22&amp;nbsp;ft 1.7 in) from 6.25 meters (20&amp;nbsp;ft 6.1 in), compared to {{convert|23|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}} for the NBA at the top of the arc.
* The FIBA adopted the NBA's restricted area arc with a marginally wider radius of 1.25 meters (4&amp;nbsp;ft 1.2 in).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6492">[[File:Wheelchair rugby game 1.jpg|thumb|A game of [[wheelchair rugby]], a sport where some competitors are believed to "Boost"]]
'''Boosting''' is a method of inducing [[autonomic dysreflexia]] with the intention of enhancing performance in sport. It can be used by an athlete with a [[spinal cord injury]] to increase their [[blood pressure]] and is performed by causing a painful stimulus in the lower part of the body. The [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) banned the practice in 1994, but many competitors with spinal injuries are still thought to be using it as a performance enhancer.

==Method==
Athletes with spinal injuries can have difficulties with autonomic functions and their bodies may be unable to control blood pressure and [[heart rate]]. Because of this their bodies do not adapt to the increased demand of physical activity. Without these changes the athlete can become fatigued and suffer from a lower level of endurance. Boosting works by tricking the body into a state of high blood pressure and heart rate,&lt;ref name="ADaB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/sites/default/files/document/120131183408508_Thompson_Autonomic_Dysreflexia_and_Boosting.pdf|title=Autonomic Dysreflexia and Boosting: Lessons from an athlete survey|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an increased utilization of oxygen improving the athlete's performance.&lt;ref name="Bhambhani"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/Bhambhani_final_report_2009.PDF |title=Boosting in Athletes with High Level Spinal Cord Injury: Incidence, Knowledge and Attitudes of Athletes in Paralympic Sport |publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831175741/http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/Bhambhani_final_report_2009.PDF |archivedate=31 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletes who perform boosting before or during an event will often [[self-harm]] with some taking extreme measures to achieve the desired boost level. Techniques include:&lt;ref name="McGrath"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19325756|title=Paralympic athletes who harm themselves to perform better|first=Matt|last=McGrath|publisher=BBC News|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/2010/03/04/the-danger-of-paralympic-boosting/|title=The Danger of Paralympic Boosting|first=Hilary|last=Thomson|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clamping the [[catheter]] to ensure that the bladder becomes overly full
*Overly tightening leg straps
*Electric shocks or stress to the feet, legs, scrotum, or testicles
*Breaking a bone, usually in the toe.

==Effectiveness and risks==
[[File:Holly Koester, 2007 Chevron Houston Marathon (357322273).jpg|thumb|Boosting simulations were conducted on wheelchair marathon athletes in 1994 and showed that significant performance gains could be made]]
Boosting has been shown in simulated races to give noticeable improvements in the performance of wheelchair marathon athletes.&lt;ref name="Bhambhani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/sc/journal/v32/n5/pdf/sc199450a.pdf|title=Self-induced autonomic dysreflexia ('boosting') practised by some tetraplegic athletes to enhance their athletic performance|publisher=International Medical Society of Paraplegia|year=1994|first=Phillip|last=Harris|accessdate=23 August 2012|volume=32|doi=10.1038/sc.1994.50|journal=Paraplegia|pages=289–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1994 study the athletes attained an average 9.7 percent improvement after their bladder had been over-distended or after sitting in the racing chair for 1–2 hours prior to competing.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt; It is believed to be capable of enhancing performance by up to 15 percent.&lt;ref name="Thomson" /&gt;

There are many possible side effects of boosting, including the occurrence of a cerebrovascular or cardiovascular event such as a stroke or heart attack.&lt;ref name="Bhambhani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McGrath" /&gt; Other complications include:&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt;
*[[aphasia]]
*[[bradycardia]]
*[[cerebral hemorrhage|cerebral haemorrhage]]
*[[epilepsy]]
*[[hypertension]]
*[[hyperthermia]]
*neurological abnormalities
*visual disturbances

==Prevalence==
The IPC conducted a survey during the 2008 Games with 99 responses.&lt;ref name="ADaB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McGrath" /&gt; 16.7 percent of the participants indicated that they had tried boosting in training or during a competition, with more than half of them being competitors in [[wheelchair rugby]].&lt;ref name="ADaB" /&gt; The use of boosting continues in athletes but is very difficult to detect.&lt;ref name="McGrath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson" /&gt; During the Games 20 athletes were tested just before their event for evidence of boosting but there were no positive results.&lt;ref name="ADaB" /&gt;

==IPC view==
The IPC made boosting illegal in 1994.&lt;ref name="McGrath" /&gt; Their handbook states in Chapter 4.3:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An athlete with a systolic blood pressure of 180mm Hg or above will be re-examined approximately ten minutes after the first examination. If on the second examination the systolic blood pressure remains above 180mm Hg the person in charge of the examination shall inform the Technical Delegate to withdraw the athlete from the particular competition in question.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Any deliberate attempt to induce Autonomic Dysreflexia is forbidden and will be reported to the Technical Delegate. The athlete will be disqualified from the particular competition regardless of the systolic blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/sites/default/files/document/120203171154502_Sec_ii_chapter_4.3_Position_Statement_on_Autonomic_Dysreflexia_and_Boosting.pdf|title=IPC Handbook|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|date=April 2009|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was written by [[Tommy Walker (events director)|Tommy Walker]] while a junior at the [[University of Southern California]] in the fall of 1946.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Paul Collins (American writer)|Paul Collins]] |coauthors= |title=You Say It's Your Birthday|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2298271/ |quote=Wikipedia entries since 2007 attributed the song to 1940s University of Southern California composer Tommy Walker—a contention bolstered by a link to Sports Illustrated's online archive, which featured Walker's own story of the tune's composition with co-writer Dick Winslow. |newspaper=[[Slate magazine]] |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fanfare consists of six notes followed by rooters shouting, "Charge!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1136204/index.htm|title=Give Him Credit For The Charge|date=November 12, 1990|accessdate=April 12, 2011|last=Anderson|first=Bruce|journal=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally, the fanfare is repeated one or more times in the same key or in successively higher keys, or is preceded by a lead-in vamp.

In 1958 the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] moved to [[Los Angeles]] and in the spring of 1959 the Dodgers put on sale, at $1.50 apiece, 20,000 toy trumpets capable of playing the six notes of the "Charge" fanfare.  The fanfare was heard in NBC broadcasts of games 3, 4 and 5 of the [[1959 World Series]] between the Dodgers and the [[Chicago White Sox]].

It also appeared in the original ''[[The Flintstones]]'' 1960s television cartoon series (episode dates uncertain), followed by "Charge!" or "Charge it!", shouted by characters (typically [[Wilma Flintstone]] and [[Betty Rubble]]) on the way to a shopping spree.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; [[Scrappy-Doo]], a character that appeared in the 1980s incarnations of the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise, also regularly used the fanfare as a lead-in to his catchphrase, "puppy power!"{{or|date=August 2015}}  The fanfare was incorporated into the jingles used on ''[[Scott Shannon]]'s Rockin American Top 30 Countdown'' which ran from 1984 through 1992. In the [[first person shooter]] video game ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', the character Bastion makes a noise similar to this fanfare when it uses its ultimate ability.

Bobby Kent, former musical director of the [[San Diego Chargers]], has claimed he invented the "Charge" fanfare in 1978 while working for the Chargers.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia-Roberts|first=Gus|title=Bobby Kent Claims He Invented "Da Da Da Da Da Da Charge!"

The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] settled with Kent for $3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calcaterra|first=Craig|title=The guy who composed "da-da-da-da-da-da … Charge!" is suing everyone|url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/04/19/the-guy-who-composed-da-da-da-da-da-da-charge-is-suing-everyone/|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kent's claim can be disproven by the fact that Frank Leahy, the Chargers' first general manager in 1960, chose the name "Chargers" after the already existing fanfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchise nicknames|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/franchise-nicknames/|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|date=January 1, 2005|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2996">'''Closed kinetic chain exercises''' or '''closed chain exercises''' (CKC) are [[physical exercise]]s performed where the [[hand]] (for arm movement) or [[foot]] (for leg movement) is fixed in space and cannot move. The extremity remains in constant contact with the immobile surface, usually the ground or the base of a machine.

The opposite of CKC exercises are [[open kinetic chain exercises]] (OKC).

Closed chain exercises are often compound movements, that generally incur compressive forces, while open-chain exercises are often isolation movements that promote more shearing forces.&lt;ref&gt;Electromyographic evaluation of closed and open kinetic chain knee rehabilitation exercises. Graham VL, Gehlsen GM, Edwards JA. J Athl Train. 1993 Spring;28(1):23-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

CKC exercises involve more than one muscle group and joint simultaneously rather than concentrating solely on one, as many OKC exercises do (single-joint movements), lending the former to more utilitarian and athletic activities.&lt;ref&gt;The relationship between open and closed kinetic chain strength of the lower limb and jumping performance.

The '''''Code of Points''''' is a rulebook that defines the scoring system for each level of competition in gymnastics. There is not a universal international ''Code of Points'', and every oversight organization — such as the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] ([[International Gymnastics Federation|Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique]]), [[NCAA]] Gymnastics, and most national gymnastics federations — designs and employs its own unique ''Code of Points''. 

== The FIG Code of Points ==
Gymnasts competing at lower levels or outside the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]]'s jurisdiction (e.g., [[NCAA]] gymnastics and local club teams) may not be scored according to the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] code.

=== 2006 Revised Code ===
In 2006, the ''Code of Points'' and the entire gymnastics scoring system were completely overhauled. The change stemmed from the judging controversy at [[2004 Olympics]] in [[Athens]], which brought the reliability and objectivity of the scoring system into question, and arguments that execution had been sacrificed for difficulty in artistic gymnastics. It follows a similarly radical scoring change in [[figure skating]] that also was prompted by irregularities in judging at major events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/6092731/ "[[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] considers gymnastics rules changes"] Associated Press, September 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in major events in 2006, the ''Code'' has faced strong opposition from many prominent coaches, athletes and judges. Proponents of the new system believe it is a necessary step in advancing gymnastics, promoting difficult skills and increasing judging objective. Opponents feel that people outside the gymnastics community will not understand the scoring and will lose interest in the sport, and that, without emphasising artistry, the essence of gymnastics will change. Many opponents of the new scoring system feel that this system, in essence, chooses the winners before competition ever begins. Competitors no longer compete on the same level. Each contestant begins with a unique start value; therefore, contestants assigned a lower start value or difficulty rating are knocked out of the winner's circle before the competition begins. They may compete, but they cannot win. A competitor with a higher difficulty rating will begin competition with a higher combined base score. There has been dissent over the fact that the new ''Code'' effectively abolishes the "perfect 10" score, for many years one of the hallmarks of gymnastics. There has also been concern that the new ''Code'' strongly favors extreme difficulty over form, execution and consistency. At the 2006 World Championships, for instance, [[Vanessa Ferrari]] of Italy was able to controversially win the women's all-around title despite a fall on the [[balance beam]], in part by picking up extra points from performing more high-difficulty skills on [[floor exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20618167-11088,00.html "Dasha's near miss"] ''Herald Sun,'' October 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/summer/2005-04-27-gymnastics-scoring-changes_x.htm "Scoring changes in gymnastics studied"] Nancy Armour, Associated Press, April 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intlgymnast.com/news/2005/apr.html "Champions rally against ''Code''] ''International Gymnast,'' April 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 report of the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]]'s Athletes' Commission, drafted after a review and discussion of the year's events noted several areas of concern including numerous inconsistencies in judging and evaluation of skills and routines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/LOB/media/MEDIA14269.pdf 2006 Report of the FIG's Athletes' Commission] International Gymnastics Federation, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the leadership of the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] remains committed to the new ''Code.'' While small revisions have been made to the ''Code,'' there is currently no indication that it will be significantly altered{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} or that there will be a return to the old ''Code'' or 10.0 scoring system. 

The current ''Code of Points'' covers the years 2017 to 2020. Following past editions, there is no top score of 10.0, nor is there an upper limit of the difficulty score. Official men's skills are rated from A to H and women's skills from A to I. 

====Table of elements====

The ''Table of Elements'' is the section of the ''Code of Points'' which is used to identify, classify and assign value to gymnastics elements. Every acrobatic and dance skill is listed, illustrated and assigned a specific difficulty rating. Currently, difficulty ratings for both the women's and men's code range from A (with assigned numerical value of 0.10; easiest) to I (with assigned numerical value of 0.90; most difficult) for all apparatus except vault. Currently, every vault is assigned a specific points value which range from 2.0 to 7.2. The ''Table of Elements'' is the one aspect of the ''Code'' that did not undergo major changes in the 2006 ''Code'' overhaul.

As other aspects of the ''Code,'' the ''Table of Elements'' is frequently re-evaluated. Skills listed in the ''Table'' may have their difficulty ratings raised or lowered after evaluation by the FIG Technical Committee. In addition, skills that are determined to be too dangerous to the athletes may be banned outright. The Technical Committee may also give specific hazardous skills artificially low difficulty ratings to deter gymnasts from trying to compete them.

Many of the skills in the ''Table of Elements'' are named after gymnasts. An original element is named after an athlete when he or she is the first person to successfully perform it at a World Championships or Olympics. Gymnasts and their coaches must submit their original skill to the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] before the meet for evaluation and possible inclusion in the ''Table of Elements''.

====Judging and score tabulation====

Two panels of judges score every single routine, evaluating different aspects of the performance. The final mark is the combined total of these two scores.

The '''D-score''' (or difficulty score) evaluates the content of the exercise on three criteria: difficulty value (DV), composition requirements (CR) and connection value (CV).

* '''DV:''' The difficulty value of the eight highest value elements of the routine, including the dismount, are added together. Elements are ranked depending on their difficulty; for example on beam, a back layout salto to two feet is given a difficulty of E, and a back layout salto with a full twist is given a difficulty of G.  For a G skill a gymnast earns 0.7; for an E, he or she earns 0.5 points.
* '''CR:''' Gymnasts must demonstrate skills from four required Element Groups on each apparatus. A gymnast may use skills to fulfill the DV and the CR simultaneously. For each CR presented, 0.5 points are awarded. A maximum score of 2.00 points may be earned here. From 2008-2016, there were five different Element Groups for each apparatus, allowing a gymnast to earn up to 2.5 points. In the 2017 Code of Points, it was reduced down to four.
* '''CV:''' Extra points are given for connections of two or more elements of specific value, with 0.1 or 0.2 points apiece up to a maximum of 0.4 in total for connection

Although the A judging panel does not take deductions, they may decide not to give gymnasts DV or CR points for elements that are performed with falls. A gymnast may also lose CV credit if there are extra steps or pauses between skills that are meant to be connected.

The D-score is open-ended; in theory a gymnast could obtain unlimited points by performing connected skills although this was made harder in the 2009-2012 revision of the code when the number of elements that counted towards the D-score was lowered.

'''The E-score''' (or Execution score) evaluates the performance: the execution and artistry of the routine.

* The base score is 10.0. Judges do not add to this, but rather, take away points for errors in form, artistry, execution, technique and routine composition. There is a 1.0 mark deduction for falling off an apparatus.  Errors are judged to be small, medium or large and respective 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 deductions are applied.

The D-score and E-score are added together for the gymnast's final mark.

This judging system applies to all WAG and MAG events '''except [[Gymnastics vault|vault]]'''.  Vault scoring is somewhat different:

* Every vault has been assigned a specific points value in the ''Code''. The D-score is simply this value. Every gymnast performing the same vault will receive the same number of points.
* The E-score is the most important on this apparatus. Judges on this panel work from a 10.0 base mark and deduct for form, technique, execution and landing.

As with other apparatus, the D-score and E-score are added together for the gymnast's final mark.

There are several acts that completely invalidate the vault and result in a score of 0. These include receiving spotting (assistance) from a coach, going before the signal and not using the U-shaped safety mat for [[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko-style vaults]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/index2.jsp?menu=RULES Code of Points] International Gymnastics Federation, 2006-2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://universalsports.nbcsports.com/articles/inside_sport/171?sport_id=13 "Artistic gymnastics judging"] NBC Olympics&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-2006 Code ===

'''Skills:''' Every acrobatic and dance element was awarded a specific difficulty rating, ranging from A (easiest) to I (hardest) in the ''Table of Elements''. Gymnast earned bonus points by performing difficult skills alone or in combination.

'''Required elements''': Routine composition was decided by the gymnast and his or her coaches, however, on every apparatus except vault there was a list of required elements (similar to the EGR in the new ''Code'') that had to be performed during the routine. Examples of required elements included 360 degree turns on [[balance beam]] and a backwards [[Somersault|salto]] (somersault) on [[floor exercise]].

'''Base score''': The base score was the default Start Value of the routine, provided the gymnast fulfilled all required elements. This changed over the years and tended to lower as the codes went on. For instance, for the 1992-1996 code, a base score of 9.4 was awarded if all of the basic elements were fulfilled. For the 1996-2000 code, the base score was a 9.0. Finally, a base score of 8.8 was awarded for the 2000-2004 Olympic years. Before the new code, the base score again dropped to an 8.6 but this was not adopted for a very long time (only 2005-2006).

'''Start Value''': The Start Value (SV) of each routine was determined by adding the base score to the bonus points earned from performing difficult elements and combinations. Ideally, a gymnast wanted to have an SV as close to 10.0 as possible.

On vault, every vault was assigned a specific Start Value in the ''Code''.

The score was determined by subtracting any deductions for poor form, execution, steps, falls or other infractions from the SV.

A '''combat sport''', or '''fighting sport''', is a competitive [[contact sport]] that usually involves one-on-one combat. In many combat sports, a contestant wins by scoring more points than the opponent or by disabling the opponent. Common combat sports include [[Mixed Martial Arts|mixed martial arts]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[fencing]], [[savate]], [[kickboxing]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Sanda (Sport)|Sanda]], [[Tae Kwon Do]], [[Capoeira]], [[Brazilian Jiu-jitsu]], [[Historical medieval battles|HMB]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]], [[Kyokushin]], and [[Kūdō]].

== History ==
{{further information|History of martial arts}}
[[Folk wrestling|Tradition styles of wrestling]] exist in most cultures; [[wrestling]] can be considered a [[cultural universal]]. [[Boxing]] contests date back to ancient [[Sumer]] in the 3rd millennium BCE and [[ancient Egypt]] ''circa'' 1350 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boxing|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/boxing|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|accessdate=May 12, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Olympic Games]] included several combat-related sports: [[Hoplitodromos|armored foot races]], boxing, wrestling, and [[pankration]], which was introduced in the [[Olympic Games]] of 648 BCE.

In [[ancient China]], combat sport appeared in the form of [[lei tai]]. It was a no-holds barred combat sport that combined boxing and wrestling. There is evidence of similar combat sports in ancient Egypt, [[History of India|India]] and [[History of Japan|Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brownell|first=Susan Elaine|title=The olympic movement on its way into Chinese culture|date=1990|publisher=[[University of California, Santa Barbara]]|pages=29, 63|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ita1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=ancient+leitai|language=en|quote=In both ancient China and Greece, the most popular sports were probably wrestling, boxing, and combinations thereof (Greek pankration, Chinese leitai). The same might be argued for ancient Egypt, India and Japan. [...] In both ancient China and Greece, the no-holds-barred combat sport (Greek pankration, Chinese leitai) was probably the most popular one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[Middle ages]] and [[Renaissance]], the [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]] was popular. Tournaments were competitions that featured several mock combat events, with [[jousting]] as a main event. While the tournament was popular among [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s, combat sports were practiced by all levels of society. The [[German school of fencing|German school]] of late medieval martial arts distinguished sportive combat (''schimpf'') from serious combat (''ernst''). In the [[German Renaissance]], sportive combat competitions were known as [[Fechtschule]]n, corresponding to the [[Prize Playing]] in [[Tudor England]]. Out of these Prize Playing events developed the English [[boxing]] (or ''prizefighting'') of the 18th century, which evolved into modern boxing with the introduction of the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]] in 1867.

[[Amateur boxing]] has been part of the modern Olympic Games since their introduction in 1904. [[Professional boxing]] became popular in the United States [[Boxing in the 1920s|in the 1920s]] and experienced a "golden age" [[Boxing in the 1950s|after World War II]].

The creation of [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] is attributed to the [[Gracie family|Gracie]] family of Brazil in 1925 after Asian martial arts were introduced to Brazil. [[Vale-tudo]], wrestling, [[muay thai]] kickboxing and luta livre gained popularity.
Modern [[Muay Thai]] was developed in the 1920s to 1930s. [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] was introduced in the [[Soviet Union]]. Modern [[Taekwondo]] also emerged after the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] and became an Olympic sport in 2000. [[Sanshou]] as part of [[Wushu (sport)|modern wushu]] was developed in the [[People's Republic of China]] since the 1950s. [[Kickboxing]] and [[full contact karate]] were developed in the 1960s and became popular in Japan and the West during the 1980s and 1990s. Modern [[Mixed Martial Arts]] developed out of the interconnected subcultures of [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] and [[shoot wrestling]]. It was introduced in Japan in the form of [[Shooto]] in 1985, and in the United States as [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) in 1993. The [[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]] were introduced in 2000, and the sport experienced peak popularity in the 2000s. During this period, multiple brands and promotions were established. The most well-known promotion for MMA is UFC.

[[File:José Aldo vs. Conor McGregor, UFC 189 World Tour London.jpg|thumb|363x363px|A photo of Conor McGregor, Jose Aldo, and Dana White at a press conference for the fight between McGregor and Aldo. This shows the two fighters posing for media, increasing revenue and interest in the fight.]]

== Popularity of combat sports by gender ==
Combat sports are generally more popular among men, both as athletes and as spectators. For many years, participation in combat sports was practically exclusive to men; [[USA Boxing]] had a ban on women's boxing until 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Boxing/About-Us/History-of-Amateur-Boxing.aspx|title=History of Amateur Boxing|work=Team USA|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A study conducted by Greenwell, Hancock, Simmons and Thorn in 2015 revealed that combat sports had a largely male audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenwell, Hancock, Simmons, Thorn|year=2015|title=The effects of gender and social roles on the marketing of combat sport.|journal=Sport Marketing Quarterly|volume=24|issue=1|page=19|issn=1061-6934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combat sport promotions such as UFC or [[Bellator MMA]] are generally advertised to men.

== Modern sports ==
Combat [[Sportsperson|athletes]] usually [[fight]] one-on-one. Different sports involve different skill sets and moves. For example, [[boxing]] only allows [[Punch (strike)|punches]], [[taekwondo]] largely involves [[kick]]s, and both [[muay thai|Muay Thai]] and [[Burmese boxing]] allow the use of [[Elbow (strike)|elbows]] and [[Knee (strike)|knees]]. There are also combat sports based on [[grappling]], such as both [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Collegiate wrestling]]. Modern [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] is similar to the ancient Greek Olympic sport of [[pankration]]; Both allow a wide range of both [[strike (attack)|striking]] and grappling techniques.

Some combat sports involve the use of [[weapons]] and armor, such as [[fencing]], [[kendo]], and the new sport [[SCA Heavy Combat]]; In [[Gatka]] and [[Modern Arnis]], sticks are used.

==Techniques==

The techniques used can be categorized into three domains: [[Strike (attack)|striking]], [[grappling]], and [[martial arts weapon|weapon usage]], with some [[hybrid martial arts|hybrid]] rule-sets combining striking and grappling. In combat sports the use of these various techniques are highly regulated to minimize permanent or severe physical damage to each participant though means of organized officiating by a single or multiple referees that can distribute penalties or interrupt the actions of the competitors during the competition. In weapon based sports, the weapons used are made to be non-lethal by means of modifying the striking portions of the weapon and requiring participants to wear protective clothing/armor.

== Olympic Combat Sports ==
* [[Amateur boxing]] - (1904 - 2016). Boxing has been staged at every summer Olympic games since 1904 except Stockholm in 1912 due to Swedish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/boxing-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Boxing Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Judo]] - (1964, 1972 - 2016). Judo was not included in the 1968 Mexico City summer Olympics. Women's judo was added to the Olympics in 1992 in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/judo-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Judo Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Wrestling ([[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]]) - (1908 - 2016). The first form of wrestling to be held at the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/wrestling-greco-roman-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Wrestling Greco Roman Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Was modified at the 2000 Sydney Games and reduced the amount of weight categories provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/wrestling-freestyle-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Wrestling Freestyle Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pankration]] and [[singlestick]] are two other forms of combat sports that have been included in the olympics. These combat sports were introduced to the Olympic Games in the early 1900s however singlestick was only represented at the 1904 Olympic games and pankration whilst lasting four centuries in Ancient Greek Olympia's, was not included at all after 1900.
* [[Fencing]] - (1896 - 2016) Competitive fencing is one of the five activities which have been featured in every modern Olympic Games, the other four being athletics, cycling, swimming, and gymnastics.

== Protective Gear/Clothing ==
In combat sports, victory is obtained from blows, punches or attacks to the head to a point of physical injury that the opponent is unable to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ama.com.au/position-statement/combat-sport-2015|title=Combat Sport - 2015|date=2015-11-21|website=Australian Medical Association|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of combat sport have different rules and regulations into the equipment competitors have to wear. In Amateur boxing seen at the Olympics, competitors are permitted to wear head guards and correctly weighted padded gloves, mouth guards are optional and the canvas floor protection from a hard fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/boxing-equipment-and-history|title=Boxing Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sports such as Taekwondo, competitors are permitted to wear a trunk protector, head guard, gloves, groin guard and shin and forearm pads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/taekwondo-equipment-and-history|title=Taekwondo Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional boxing and UFC are two of the most dangerous combat sports in the world due to the lack of protective gear worn. Competitors in these two sports have the option to wear a mouthguard and must wear suitable gloves. The lack of protective clothing makes competitors vulnerable to concussion and further traumatic head injuries. A scientific experiment, conducted last year by Dr Andrew McIntosh of ACRISP at the Federation University of Australia, tested the impact of 7 different head guards in combat sport. The results of the experiment revealed the benefits of the combination of a glove and headguard in maximising the impact energy attenuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/17/1113.full|title=Sign In|publisher=|pmid=26192195}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by Lystad showed that combat sports with little to no protective gear such as MMA or boxing has an injury incidence rate range of 85.1-280.7 per 1000 athletes in comparison to another striking combat sport like Taekwondo which has a large amount of protective gear such as pads, headgear, mouth guard and gloves, has an injury incidence rate range of 19.1-138.8 per 1000 athletes. This means that injury rates are drastically lowered when protective gear is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lystad|first=Reidar|year=2015|title=Epidemiology of injuries in full-contact combat sports|journal=Australasian Epidemiologist|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''List of Protective Gear/Clothing'''
* Gloves
* Head gear
* Mouthguard
* Shin Guards
* Arm Guards
* Groin Guard
* Trunk Protector
* Wraps (Material wrapped around the hand that provides added protection and support)

== Fighting area ==
*Mat
::Circular, rectangular layout
*Ring
::boxing ring, sumo ring ([[dohyō]]), sand ring
*Fenced area (generically referred to as "cage")
::Can be round or have at least six sides. Cages vary: some replace the metal fencing with a net, others have a different shape (a hexagon, an octagon). The fenced area is called a cage, or a hexagon, an octagon depending on the shape.
*No-rope ring (sometimes referred by fans as "the pit") 
::A circle which is 27 feet in diameter, of which the inner 24 feet is colored blue. The next 3 feet is yellow, which is the caution area. When the fighter gets to the yellow area, he knows he's getting close to stepping out-of-bounds. The last edge of the ring is the red zone, which features a 30-degree upward angle. When a fighter steps on the red area, he's stepping up slightly, letting him know he's out-of-bounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3087">{{about||the exercise machine sometimes called a "cross trainer"|Elliptical trainer|the business training practice|Cross-training (business)}}'''Cross-training''' is athletic training in sports other than the athlete's usual sport. The goal is improving overall performance. It takes advantage of the particular effectiveness of one training method to negate the shortcomings of another.

==In general sports==
Cross-training in sports and [[physical fitness|fitness]] involves combining [[exercise]]s to work various parts of the body. Often one particular activity works certain muscle groups, but not others; cross-training aims to eliminate this imbalance.

===In mixed martial arts===
In [[Korea]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], cross-training refers to training in multiple [[martial arts]] or fighting systems to become proficient in all the [[mixed martial arts#Phases of combat|phases of unarmed combat]]. This training is meant{{by whom?|date=January 2016}} to overcome the shortcomings of one style by practicing another style which is strong in the appropriate area. A typical combination involves a [[strike (attack)|striking]]-based art such as [[Muay Thai]], combined with a [[grappling]]-based art such as [[wrestling]] and [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]]. Many [[hybrid martial arts]] can be considered{{by whom?|date=January 2016}} derivatives of such cross-training - most notably Dan Inosanto's Jeet Kune Do concepts, a hybrid of Filipino martial arts, wing chun and savate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedfightingmethods.com/jkd-concepts |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 29, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417022519/http://www.appliedfightingmethods.com/jkd-concepts |archivedate=April 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apolaki Krav Maga &amp; Dirty Boxing, a hybrid martial-art blending Krav Maga, Filipino martial arts, silat and Brazilian jiu-jitsu and [[kajukenbo]], an American hybrid art consisting of karate, tang soo do, jujutsu, kenpo, and boxing.

Modern mixed martial-arts training generally involves cross-training in the different aspects and ranges of fighting.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

=== Water sports ===
In [[water sports]], cross-training often involves doing exercises and training on land. This is often referred to{{by whom?|date=January 2016}} as "dryland". For swimming, cross-training frequently includes running, stretching, and other resistance and agility training. Diving dryland exercises include various unique exercises such as on-land landing biomechanics training. &lt;ref&gt;

'''Disabled sports''', also '''adaptive sports''' or '''parasports''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is parasport?|url=http://paralympic.ca/what-parasport|website=Canadian Paralympic Committee|publisher=Canadian Paralympic Committee|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sports played by persons with a [[disability]], including [[physical disability|physical]] and [[intellectual disabilities]]. As many disabled sports are based on existing able bodied sports, modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as ''adapted sports''. However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in non-disabled sports. Disability exists in four categories: physical, mental, permanent and temporary.

==Organization and history==
Organized sport for athletes with a [[disability]] is generally divided into three broad disability groups: the [[deaf]], people with [[Physical disability|physical disabilities]], and people with [[intellectual disabilities]]. Each group has a distinct history, organization, competition program, and approach to sport.

Formal international competition in deaf sport began with the 1924 Paris ''Silent Games'', organized by the [[Comité International des Sports des Sourds]], CISS (The International Committee of Sports for the Deaf). These games evolved into the modern [[Deaflympics]], governed by the CISS. The CISS maintains separate games for deaf athletes based on their numbers, their special communication needs on the sports field, and the social interaction that is a vital part of sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=International Committee of Sport for the Deaf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized sport for persons with physical disabilities existed as early as 1911, when the "Cripples Olympiad" was held in the U.S.A.  One of the successful athletes was Walter William Francis, a Welshman, who won both the running and wrestling championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skipper Francis at Thames Star, New Zealand|date= 17 October 1913|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=THS19131017.2.25|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, events often developed out of rehabilitation programs. Following the [[Second World War]], in response to the needs of large numbers of injured ex-service members and civilians, sport was introduced as a key part of rehabilitation. Sport for rehabilitation grew into recreational sport and then into competitive sport. The pioneer of this approach was [[Ludwig Guttmann|Sir Ludwig Guttmann]] of the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England. In 1948, while the [[1948 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] were being held in London, he organized a sports competition for wheelchair athletes at Stoke Mandeville. This was the origin of the [[Stoke Mandeville Games]], from which evolved both the [[IWAS World Games]] and the [[Paralympic Games]]. The first official Paralympic Games, which were simultaneously the 9th International Stoke Mandeville Games ('international' having been added when Dutch service personal first took part in the Games in 1952), were held in Rome in 1960. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Paralympic Games were simultaneously the 13th, 17th and 21st international Stoke Mandeville Games.

In 1975, the Paralympic Games expanded to include those with limb amputations and visual impairments. Individuals with [[cerebral palsy]] were allowed to compete beginning in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Rory A.|last2=Nowak|first2=Christopher J.|title=Paralympics and veterans|journal=[[Journal of Rehabilitation Research &amp; Development]]|date=2011|volume=48|issue=10|pages=xi–xii|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2011.11.0209}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[Paralympic sports|Paralympic sport]] is governed by the [[International Paralympic Committee]], in conjunction with a wide range of other international sport organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paralympic Games|url=http://www.paralympic.org/Paralympic_Games/|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are numerous sport opportunities throughout the United States for injured service members, including cycling, wheelchair tennis, shooting, wheelchair basketball, track and field, adapted water sports, and snow skiing. One such program is the [[Army Wounded Warrior Program]], which offers [[sitting volleyball]] to injured service members. Some organizations also offer sport opportunities to family and friends of injured service members in addition to the members themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goff|first1=Mandy|title=Adapted Sport Programs for Veterans with Disabilities|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=March 2012|volume=83|issue=3|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sport for persons with intellectual disabilities began to be organized in the 1960s through the [[Special Olympics]] movement.  This grew out of a series of summer camps organized by [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]], beginning in 1962. In 1968 the first international Special Olympics were held, in Chicago. Today, Special Olympics provides training and competition in a variety of sports for persons with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref name="so-history"&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=September 12, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sport for persons with physical disabilities began to be organized in the US in the late 1960s through [[Disabled Sports USA]].  Disabled Sports USA was established in 1967 by disabled military veterans, including Jim Winthers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disabled Sports: Early History|url=http://www.disabledsportsusa.org/disabled-sports-early-history/|website=Disabled Sports USA|publisher=Disabled Sports USA|accessdate=2016-02-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205185150/http://www.disabledsportsusa.org/disabled-sports-early-history/|archivedate=2016-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help rehabilitate the injured soldiers returning from Vietnam&lt;ref&gt;Megan Crandall, [http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/newsroom/2011/april/NR_04_12_2011.html "BLM Enters Into Memorandum of Understanding with Disabled Sports USA"], ''US Bureau of Land Management Press Release'', December 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and originally named the National Amputee Skiers Association.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Durso, [http://www.pcma.org/Convene/Issue-Archives/June-2010/Leading-By-Example.htm "Leading By Example: Kirk Bauer Able-Bodied"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604114307/http://www.pcma.org/Convene/Issue-Archives/June-2010/Leading-By-Example.htm |date=June 4, 2012 }}, ''Convene Magazine'', June, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Hal O'Leary founded the [[National Sports Center for the Disabled]] (NSCD) at Winter Park in Colorado. Today, NSCD has 19 certified instructors and more than 1,000 volunteers. Disabled Sports USA has become one of the largest national multi-sport, multi-disability organizations in the United States, serving more than 60,000 wounded warriors, youth and adults annually.&lt;ref&gt;Candus Thomson, [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-07-31/sports/bs-sp-disabled-kilimanjaro-climber-20100731-12_1_mount-kilimanjaro-disabled-veterans-disabled-sports-usa "Disabled veterans vow to conquer Mount Kilimanjaro"], ''Baltimore Sun'', July 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the [[International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability]] (INAS-FID) was formed to support elite competition for athletes with intellectual disabilities. This was established in contrast to the more participative, "sport for all" approach of Special Olympics. For a time, athletes with intellectual disabilities were included in the Paralympic Games. After [[cheating at the Paralympic Games|a cheating scandal]] at the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]], where a number of athletes participating in intellectual disability events were revealed to not be disabled, INAS-FID athletes were banned from Paralympic competition, but the ban on intellectually disabled athletes has since been lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, the Extremity Games were formed for people with limb loss or limb difference to compete in [[extreme sports]]. [[College Park Industries]], a manufacturer of prosthetic feet, organized this event to give amputee athletes a venue to compete in this increasingly popular sports genre also referred to as [[action sports]].  This annual event held in the summer in Orlando, FL includes competitions in skateboarding, wakeboarding, rock climbing, mountain biking, surfing, moto-x and kayaking. Various organizations, such as Paradox Sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paradoxsports.org|title=Paradox Sports - Physical Adaptive Sports|work=Paradox Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; have arisen to help empower and inspire disabled people through equipping and welcoming them into the extreme sports community.

Also in 2006, The Federation de Internationale Powerchair Football Association and The [[United States Power Soccer Association]] were formed to standardize the rules of play and promote one of the few competitive team sports for motorized wheelchair users. [[Powerchair football]] (or power soccer).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/983162005|title=COMMUNICATION, SPORT AND DISABILITY : the case of power soccer.|last=S.|first=JEFFRESS, DR. MICHAEL|date=2017-01-01|publisher=ROUTLEDGE|isbn=9781138053588|oclc=983162005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a group of [[San Diego]], [[California]]-based athletes, coaches, volunteers, and parents split from [[Special Olympics]] Southern California to gain local control over disabled athletics programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20070426-9999-7m26special.html |title=Special Olympics members break away |publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune |date=2007-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group – [[SPORTS for Exceptional Athletes]] (S4EA) – serves people with developmental disabilities within the age range of 5 years old through adults. By combining people with and without disabilities, S4EA hopes that participating athletes will interact and form lasting bonds of friendship through shared sports and recreational activities in S4EA's served communities. Although the organization's focus is primarily [[San Diego County]], S4EA has grown from this base to satellite programs in [[Ventura, California|Ventura]] and [[Temecula]], [[California]].

Since 1988, the International Olympic Committee has chosen to validate Disabled Sports (physical disabilities) and incorporate it as a part of the Games: the staging of the Paralympic Games immediately follows the Olympic Games. This scheduling helps to foster greater interest in disabled sports. An investigation published on a Swiss website has /shown that more and more International Sports Federations list disabled athletes than any other sportsmen or sportswomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AB40V |location= Lausanne, Switzerland |url=http://www.wheelchair.ch/fra/sports/sports.html#ioh |title=Le Sport avant tout, avec ou sans handicap – Info Stades, Salle polyvalentes, Fédération Sportives, Clubs, Championnats... tout le Handisport |publisher=Wheelchair.ch |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Paralympic-style [[multi-sport event]]s exist exclusively for wounded, injured or sick armed services personnel and veterans. These are the [[Warrior Games]] in the United States and the [[Invictus Games]] which originated in the United Kingdom.

Adapted sports help society learn about disability. They also can help remove some of the stigma associated with having a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|last2=Nowak|title=Paralympics and veterans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==

A wide range of sports have been adapted to be played by people with various [[disability|disabilities]], as well as several that are unique just to disabled athletes. Within each movement, different sports are practised at different levels; for example, not all sports in the Paralympic movement are part of the Paralympic Games. In addition, many sports are practiced by persons with a disability outside the formal sports movements.

== Training ==
There is evidence to support that the use of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) as a training intervention can be implemented to increase the aerobic fitness, respiratory function, and overall quality of life in this population of athletes. Long term physiological adaptations through prolonged training demonstrated within athletes with disabilities include increased respiratory volume, improved executive functions and increased reaction time among other benefits in relation to non athletes in the same age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dehghansai|first=Nima|date=January 2017|title=Touro College-New York|url=https://erms.tourolib.org/url/http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=s3h&amp;AN=121353697&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Adapted physical activity quarterly|volume=34| issue =  1|pages=72–90|doi=10.1123/APAQ.2016-0030|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusion==
Beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s, work began within several countries and organizations to include athletes with disabilities in the non-disabled sport system. This included adding events for athletes with disabilities to major games such as the [[Olympic Games]] and the [[Commonwealth Games]], and integration of these athletes into non-disabled sports organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1984, the Olympics have included exhibition events for Paralympic athletes. However, integration of full medal events has not taken place, and the status of athletes with a [[disability]] in the Olympic movement remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2004 IOC decision |url=http://www.rickhansen.com/Media/News2004/IOCdecision.htm |website=www.rickhansen.com |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323103328/http://www.rickhansen.com/Media/News2004/IOCdecision.htm |archivedate=March 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the Commonwealth Games, athletes with a disability were first included in 1990 Auckland Commonwealth Games, then at the [[1994 Commonwealth Games|exhibition events in 1994]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[2002 Commonwealth Games|2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games]] they were included as full members of their national teams, making these the first fully inclusive international multi-sport games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecgf.com/sports/ead.asp |title=Commonwealth Games Federation - Commonwealth Sports - Elite Athletes With A Disability (EAD) |publisher=Thecgf.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has continued with the [[2006 Commonwealth Games|2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games]], where Canadian [[Chantal Petitclerc]] became the first athlete with a disability to carry her country's flag in the Opening Ceremonies of an integrated games.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
Individual athletes such as swimmer [[Natalie du Toit]] and track athlete [[Oscar Pistorius]] have competed as equals against able bodied athletes at various events including the Olympic Games.

2013 the [[FIFA]] decided that Austrian footballer [[Martin Hofbauer]] can continue to play competitive [[association football|football]] with prosthetics after he lost his right lower leg due to cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steiermark.orf.at/news/stories/2583850/ FIFA erlaubt Steirer Einsatz mit Prothese], orf.at, 2013-05-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[self-determination theory]] has been one of the most proven theories on how athletes participate in competitions of this level. Studies have supported this theory especially in intellectually or developmentally disabled athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self Determination Theory: An Approach to Human Motivation &amp; Personality|url=http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have continued to question the motivation for joining such competitions like the [[Special Olympics]] as well as the [[Paralympic Games]]. The [[Motivations for joining the Special Olympics]] uncover themes among individuals and families for their participation or abstention from these Olympic programs.

There are specific strategies that may be employed to increase inclusion of people with disabilities in sports. This includes modifying rules or adapting activities for a  particular individual. As well, maintaining a non-competitive focus helps to increase the inclusion of participants with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Geidne"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geidne|first=Susanna|last2=Jerlinder|first2=Kajsa|date=2016-05-01|title=How sports clubs include children and adolescents with disabilities in their activities. A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ssr.2015.25.issue-1-2/ssr-2016-0002/ssr-2016-0002.xml|journal=Sport Science Review|language=en|volume=25|issue=1-2|doi=10.1515/ssr-2016-0002|issn=2069-7244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including children with intellectual disabilities in sports programs in which they play with non-disabled athletes results in these children becoming more involved in mainstream sports, incorporating more physical activity in their daily lives and it increases their interactions with children who are not disabled. It is important for children with disabilities to get different types of support while participating in sports programs, for example, direct support from coaches and other athletes, indirect support from parents and non-human support from therapy dogs. Activities should be modified to suit different types of children's abilities and inclusivity is easier when activities are non-competitive.&lt;ref name="Geidne"/&gt;

===Unified sports===
"Unified sports" involve teams made up of athletes with and without disabilities.&lt;ref name="specialolympics.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/unified-sports.aspx|title=Special Olympics: Unified Sports|work=specialolympics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, Special Olympics Unified Sports have been promoting social inclusion through shared sports training and competition. This initiative has expanded globally and now involves more than 700,000 players in 127 countries worldwide. The principle behind Unified Sports is simple: training together and playing together is a quick path to friendship and understanding.

The NBA has been a major supporter of Unified Sports, sponsoring the annual NBA Cares Special Olympics Unified Basketball Game during the NBA All-Star Weekend. The Walt Disney Company, ESPN and Special Olympics are also working on a two-year global initiative that will leverage the power of sports to promote an environment of social inclusion and acceptance.&lt;ref name="specialolympics.org"/&gt;

Disabled drivers have competed in motorsport versus fully abled drivers, for example [[Alex Zanardi]], [[Albert Llovera]], [[Clay Regazzoni]] and [[Jason Watt]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42420">In sports, a '''drought''' refers to instances in which an individual or team has gone through a lengthy period of time without accomplishing some goal. For a team, this usually refers to an extended period of time without making the [[playoff]]s or winning a championship. Droughts occur for a variety of reasons, from chronic mismanagement to bad luck. Some droughts are also popularly attributed to a [[sports curses|curse]].

==North America==

===Droughts by sport===
*In [[Major League Baseball|MLB]], the [[Chicago Cubs]] suffered a 108-year [[World Series]] drought from 1908 until [[2016 World Series|2016]], when they defeated the [[Cleveland Indians]]. In turn, the Indians inherited the longest active drought, last winning the World Series in [[1948 World Series|1948]]. {{further information|List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts}}
*In the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], the [[New York Rangers]] suffered a [[Curse of 1940|54-year]] [[Stanley Cup]] drought from 1940 until [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994]], when they defeated the [[Vancouver Canucks]]. The longest current title drought is shared by two teams: the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], who have not won the Stanley Cup since [[1966–67 NHL season|1967]], and the [[St. Louis Blues]], who entered the league when it [[1967 NHL expansion|doubled in size]] [[1967–68 NHL season|the following season]], and have not yet won the Cup (and have not appeared in a Cup Final since [[1969-70 NHL season|1970]]). {{further information|List of NHL franchise post-season droughts }}
*In the [[National Football League|NFL]], four teams have never appeared in a [[Super Bowl]] (the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Detroit Lions]], [[Houston Texans]] and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]), and eight other teams have never won that game. The longest active title drought is that of the [[Arizona Cardinals]] franchise, which last won an NFL championship in the [[1947 NFL season|1947 season]]. The Cardinals have played home games in four cities in three market areas since the team last won a title: Chicago, St. Louis, and the Phoenix suburbs of Tempe and Glendale. {{further information|List of NFL franchise post-season droughts}}
*12 [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] teams have never won a championship. The league's longest drought belongs to the [[Sacramento Kings]], who have not won the championship or even been to the NBA Finals since 1951, when they were known as the [[Rochester Royals]]. Sacramento is the fifth city to host the team since it last won a title (Rochester, Cincinnati, Kansas City, and Omaha are the others). {{further information|List of NBA franchise post-season droughts}}
*In the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]], the longest current [[Grey Cup]] drought is held by the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] at 28 years. The Blue Bombers last won the Grey Cup in 1990, defeating the Edmonton Eskimos 50–11. Historically, the CFL's longest continuous drought is 56 years (the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]], from their inception in 1910 to 1966).

*In [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), the longest current [[MLS Cup]] drought is 22 years, held by three teams, [[FC Dallas]], the [[New England Revolution]], and the [[New York Red Bulls]], as each team has failed to win the league title despite having competed in every MLS season dating back to 1996. All have made MLS Cup Final appearances (Dallas lost to the [[Colorado Rapids]] in [[MLS Cup 2010]], the Red Bulls lost to the [[Columbus Crew SC|Columbus Crew]] in [[MLS Cup 2008]], and New England lost to the [[LA Galaxy|Los Angeles Galaxy]] in [[MLS Cup 2002]], [[MLS Cup 2005]], and [[MLS Cup 2014]] and to the [[Houston Dynamo]] in [[MLS Cup 2006]] and [[MLS Cup 2007]]). [[Atlanta United FC]], [[Los Angeles FC]], [[Minnesota United FC]], the [[Montreal Impact]], [[New York City FC]], [[Orlando City SC]], the [[Philadelphia Union]], and [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]] have also never won an MLS Cup title, but were added as expansion teams subsequent to 1996. Defunct teams [[CD Chivas USA]], [[Miami Fusion FC]] and the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] never won the MLS Cup before they were shut down.{{further information|List of MLS club post-season droughts}}

*With regard to other major domestic trophies, the longest active [[Supporters Shield]] drought is shared by two teams, the Colorado Rapids and the New England Revolution. Neither has won a Supporters Shield despite competing in every MLS season since 1996. Among MLS teams, the longest [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]] drought is 20 years, shared by three teams, the Colorado Rapids, New York Red Bulls, and [[San Jose Earthquakes]]. Four other current United States-based teams have not won the Open Cup (the Houston Dynamo, the Philadelphia Union, the [[Portland Timbers]], and [[Real Salt Lake]]), but were added as expansion teams after 1996. The three Canada-based MLS teams, the Montreal Impact, [[Toronto FC]], and Vancouver Whitecaps FC are ineligible as they compete in the [[Voyageurs Cup]].

===Cities with significant droughts===
Several North American cities are considered to have championship droughts among their “Big Four” pro sports teams:
* 55 years – [[San Diego]] since 1963 AFL title (pre-Super Bowl, lost 1995 Super Bowl, [[Los Angeles Chargers|Chargers]] relocated beginning 2017), no World Series title (lost 1984 and 1998 World Series), no NBA title ([[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]] relocated to Los Angeles in 1984)
* 53 years – [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] since 1965 AFL title (pre-Super Bowl, lost 1991 to 1994 Super Bowls), no Stanley Cup title since joining NHL in 1970–71 (lost 1975 and 1999 Stanley Cup final), no NBA title ([[Buffalo Braves|Braves]] relocated to San Diego in 1978).
* 48 years – [[Vancouver]] no Stanley Cups since joining NHL in 1970, lost 1982, 1994, and 2011 Stanley Cup finals (The CFL’s [[List of BC Lions seasons|BC Lions]] have won six Grey Cups, last in 2011), no NBA title ([[List of Memphis Grizzlies seasons|Grizzlies]] relocated to Memphis in 2001).

Those who believe in the ''Buffalo Curse''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buffalocurse.com The Buffalo Curse&lt;/ref&gt; cite as examples the four consecutive [[Super Bowl]] losses by [[List of Buffalo Bills seasons|the Buffalo Bills]] from [[Super Bowl XXV|1990]] to [[Super Bowl XXVIII|1993]], as well as the failure of [[List of Buffalo Sabres seasons|the Buffalo Sabres]] to ever win the [[Stanley Cup]]. [[Wide Right (Buffalo Bills)|Wide Right]], [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|No Goal]], and The [[Music City Miracle]] also contribute to the belief in the Buffalo Curse. Hearts were broken{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} once again in [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|2006]], when the Sabres lost to [[2005–06 Carolina Hurricanes season|the Carolina Hurricanes]] in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, as four of their top six defensemen were lost to injury along with Tim Connolly, the leading scorer of the playoffs at the time of his injury. Even though the Sabres made it back to the conference finals the next year, they lost again, this time to the division rival [[2006–07 Ottawa Senators season|Ottawa Senators]]. It is notable that the Buffalo Bills won the [[American Football League|AFL]] championship in 1964 and 1965. The alleged “curse”, however, has not extended to the city’s fringe or minor league teams—the [[Buffalo Bandits]] of the NLL have won 4 league championships (1992, 1993, 1996, 2008) and six division Championships (1992, 1993, 1994, 2004, 2006, 2008), and the [[Western New York Flash]] of the [[National Women's Soccer League]], based in Buffalo but playing home games in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], won the 2016 NWSL Championship. The Flash also won league titles in the two competitions that directly preceded the NWSL—[[Women's Professional Soccer]] in [[2011 Women's Professional Soccer season|2011]] and [[Women's Premier Soccer League Elite|WPSL Elite]] in 2012. The Flash also won the NWSL Shield, awarded to the team with the best regular-season record, in that league's inaugural [[2013 National Women's Soccer League season|2013 season]], but lost the championship final to [[Portland Thorns FC]]. The [[Buffalo Beauts]] of the [[National_Women's_Hockey_League_(2015–)|National Women's Hockey League]] won their first Isobel Cup in the 2016–17 season.&lt;ref&gt;https://thehockeywriters.com/buffalo-beauts-win-2017-nwhl-isobel-cup/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of the San Diego Padres|The San Diego Padres]] have never won a World Series, believed{{By whom|date=January 2017}} to stem from the ''[[San Diego Sports Curse]]''. San Diego’s former NFL team, [[List of Los Angeles Chargers seasons|the Chargers]] and its former NBA teams, the Rockets and Clippers, never won a Super Bowl or an NBA championship when located within the city. The Padres are tied with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for the most World Series appearances (two) of the seven teams without a World Series championship. The Chargers won the 1963 [[American Football League|AFL]] championship and only appeared in one Super Bowl ([[Super Bowl XXIX]], which they lost to [[1994 San Francisco 49ers season|the San Francisco 49ers]], 49–26).

Some cities with at least three teams have shorter yet notable droughts. [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]] has not reached a championship series or Super Bowl since [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|the Twins]] won the [[1991 World Series]]. This drought, like the one in Buffalo, has not extended to the market’s fringe or minor league teams—two such teams, the WNBA’s [[Minnesota Lynx]] and the [[Minnesota United FC|Minnesota Stars]] of the [[North American Soccer League|current North American Soccer League]], won league championships in 2011, and the Lynx claimed another league title in 2013 and 2015.

Since the founding of [[Major League Soccer]] in 1996, both Columbus, Ohio and Washington, D.C. have won all three major U.S. soccer trophies (MLS Supporters' Shield, MLS Cup and U.S. Open Cup) during their “Big Four” droughts. Toronto won all three major Canadian soccer trophies (MLS Supporters' Shield, MLS Cup and [[Voyageurs Cup]]) in the [[2017 MLS season]], during its current "Big Four" drought. San Jose has won the MLS Supporters' Shield and MLS Cup during its "Big Four" drought while Portland and Salt Lake City have won the MLS Cup (but no MLS Supporters’ Shields or U.S. Open Cups) during their "Big Four" droughts.

All of the Canadian cities listed above have won multiple Grey Cups during their "Big Four" droughts listed above.

Notable former droughts:
* Prior to winning the 2016 NBA Finals, [[Cleveland]] had gone 52 years without a championship in any major professional sport. The drought began after the Cleveland Browns won the 1964 NFL Championship (pre-Super Bowl). The Indians lost two World Series finals, the Browns did not make it to the Super Bowl, and the Cavaliers lost 2 NBA finals during the drought.
* [[New Orleans]] had gone 43 years without winning a championship in any major professional sport until the [[New Orleans Saints]] brought the city its first professional sports title via the 2010 Super Bowl. The drought began in 1967, the inaugural year of the New Orleans Saints (the oldest professional sports team still playing in New Orleans). During the drought, neither the Saints nor the Hornets (now the Pelicans) made the Super Bowl or the NBA finals respectively.
* [[Seattle]] had gone 35 years without winning a championship in any major professional sport from the 1979 NBA Finals to the 2014 Super Bowl. During the drought, the Mariners never made the World Series, the Seahawks lost the 2006 Super Bowl, and the then SuperSonics (now the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]) lost the 1996 NBA Finals. Including only Seattle’s current major league sports teams, the Mariners and the Seahawks, increases the former drought's length to 38 years (because the Seahawks were founded in 1976, the earlier of the two teams’ inceptions).
* [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] had gone 33 years without winning a championship in any major professional sport until [[2001 Arizona Diamondbacks season|the Diamondbacks]] won the [[2001 World Series]]. The drought began in 1968 with the inception of the Phoenix Suns (the oldest professional sports team still playing in Phoenix). During the drought, the Diamondbacks did not make the World Series (albeit only beginning play in 1997), the Cardinals did not make the Super Bowl, the Suns lost two NBA Finals, and the Coyotes did not make the Stanley Cup Final (albeit only beginning play in 1996). The [[Arizona Rattlers]] did win the [[Arena Football League]] twice during this dry spell, in 1994 and 1997. Since the World Series title, however, Phoenix has experienced a 16-year ongoing drought, leaving that World Series title its only major sports championship.
* Prior to [[2017–18 Washington Capitals season|the Washington Capitals]] winning the 2018 Stanley Cup Final, [[Washington, D.C.]] had gone 26 years without a championship in any of the “Big Four” sports. The drought began after [[1991 Washington Redskins season|the Redskins]] won [[Super Bowl XXVI]] in 1992. During the drought, the Capitals themselves were the only team from Washington, D.C. that had made it to the championship round, losing the [[1998 Stanley Cup Final]] before winning the 2018 Stanley Cup Final.
* Prior to [[2008 Philadelphia Phillies season|the Phillies]] winning the 2008 World Series, [[Philadelphia]] had gone 25 years without a championship.  The drought began after [[1982–83 Philadelphia 76ers season|the 76ers]] won the [[1983 NBA Finals]]. [[1986–87 Philadelphia Flyers season|The Flyers]] lost the [[1987 Stanley Cup Finals]], the Phillies lost the [[1993 World Series]], the Flyers again lost the [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals]], the 76ers lost the [[2001 NBA Finals]], and [[2004 Philadelphia Eagles season|the Eagles]] lost [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] in 2005. The drought was explained by locals as the [[Curse of Billy Penn]], in reference to the statue of [[William Penn]] atop [[Philadelphia City Hall]] and a supposed [[gentlemen's agreement]] to build nothing higher than the statute.  The "curse" was lifted when a small statute was placed atop the [[Comcast Center]], then the tallest building in Philadelphia.  The current [[tallest building in Philadelphia]], the [[Comcast Technology Center]] also has a small statute of William Penn affixed to the highest structural element.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/business/comcast/comcast-ironworkers-billy-penn-eagles-nfl-new-tower-20171130.html|title=Ironworkers plant Billy Penn atop new Comcast tower to help Eagles avoid curse - Philly|work=Philly.com|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/The-Comcast-Technology-Center-Is-Phillys-Tallest-Building-and-Yes-Theres-a-Mini-Billy-Penn-Up-There-461105383.html|title=Yes, There’s a Billy Penn Statue on Philly's New Skyscraper|work=NBC 10 Philadelphia|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prior to winning the 2017 World Series, [[Houston]] had gone 22 years without a championship in any major professional sport. The drought began after the Houston Rockets won the 1995 NBA Finals. The Astros lost the 2005 World Series, the Rockets did not make it to the NBA Finals, and the Texans did not make it to the Super Bowl during the drought.

In the [[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]] (1897–present), the longest premiership drought was that of [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne/Sydney]], who won their third premiership in 1933, but did not win another premiership until 2005, 72 years later. The second-longest drought in the league was that of [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] (69 years) who won their first and only senior premiership in 1966.
[[Melbourne Demons]] currently hold the longest active drought having not won a premiership since 1964.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Fitzroy merged with the Brisbane Bears in 1996, having never appeared in another Grand Final after their 1944 premiership, to become the Brisbane Lions. The new Lions team is more referred to as a continuation of the old Brisbane team than of Fitzroy. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This is commonly known as the "[[Colliwobbles]]". &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Geelong finished runners-up in 1897, but no Grand Final was required under the round-robin finals system in place that year.

===Baseball===

; South Korea

*[[Lotte Giants]] has not won a [[KBO League]]  since 1992.

===Rugby league===
The [[Parramatta Eels]] hold the longest active drought in the [[National Rugby League|NRL]] totalling thirty-three years, having not won a premiership since 1986. For reference, Parramatta's first premiership came in its 35th season in 1981. The next longest active drought is twenty-five years held by the [[Canberra Raiders]] who have not won a premiership (nor appeared in a Grand Final) since 1994.

The [[North Sydney Bears]] held the longest premiership drought in the [[National Rugby League|NSWRL/NRL]] with a total of seventy-seven years. This lasted between their second premiership in 1922 up until the end of 1999 when they began a short-lived merger with [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]] known as the [[Northern Eagles]].  North Sydney also had the longest drought waiting for the next grand final appearance which stood at fifty six years.  Their last grand final appearance was against Newtown in 1943&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/who-has-the-longest-drought-in-australian-sport/3095611/&lt;/ref&gt;. This merger was dissolved after three seasons resulting in [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] being expelled from the league. As of 2018 they are still applying for re-entry.

The [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]] won their first premiership in 2016 after 50 seasons of NSWRL/ARL/Super League/NRL competition – the longest wait for a first title that any club has endured. Prior to this, the Sharks had played in four Grand Finals (including a replay in 1978) for one draw and three losses.

The [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] won 20 premierships in the [[NSWRL]] from the league's inception in 1908 until 1971, but had to wait to win their 21st title (their 1st in the [[NRL]] era) until 2014, a drought lasting 41 years (the Rabbitohs were inactive in 2000-01).

The Gold Coast itself as a city has suffered a premiership drought of sorts.  The original Gold Coast side was founded in 1988 as The Gold Coast-Tweed Giants and then were rebranded three times.  First as The Gold Coast Seagulls, then Gold Coast Gladiators and then The Gold Coast Chargers.  In 2006, The [[Gold Coast Titans]] entered the competition.  Since 1988, no Gold Coast team has made a grand final or won a premiership.  The best season for any of the franchises was in 2010, when Gold Coast Titans made the preliminary final&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/02/23/the-fall-and-rise-of-the-gold-coast-titans/&lt;/ref&gt; .  

[[Hull F.C.]] lost seven consecutive [[Challenge Cup]] Final appearances at [[Wembley Stadium]] between 1959 and 2008.&lt;ref name = "hull"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-23673360 |title=Rugby League: Will Hull FC's Wembley hoodoo strike again? |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |first=Trevor |last=Gibbons |date=23 August 2013 |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team won two Challenge Cups during that time, but the final victories were at [[Elland Road]] (1982 replay) and the [[Millennium Stadium]] ([[2005 Challenge Cup|2005]], while Wembley was being rebuilt).&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt;

[[Warrington Wolves]] were founded in 1876 and have won three premierships in their history with the last being in 1955.  Out of all the current teams in The English Super League they have waited longer than any other team to win their next premiership.  As of 2018, it has been 63 years since Warrington had won the premiership.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/rugby-league/37307917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/sport/15085532.NOSTALGIA__Season_openers_in_Wolves_history/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Castleford Tigers]] currently hold the record for the longest time to win a premiership in either The Super League or The NRL.  Founded in 1926, Castleford have only played in three grand finals (1938,1969 &amp; 2017) and for the first time in their 92-year history they finished first in The 2017 Super League season to claim their first ever league leaders shield.  Castleford's drought of 92 years to wait for a first title eclipses The [[Cronulla Sutherland Sharks]] record in The NRL of 49 years who had the longest drought of any professional rugby league team in Australia to wait for a first title.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/castleford-tigers/luke-gale-in-race-against-time-to-help-castleford-tigers-push-for-grand-final-1-8750268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/40698382&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sport.bt.com/rugby-league/castleford-win-league-leaders-shield-for-first-time-S11364204765897&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby union===
In [[Rugby union in France|France]], [[ASM Clermont Auvergne]] had a championship history arguably as tortured as the most "cursed" teams in North America or Australia. From their formation in 1911 through 2009, they had never won a national title despite making the championship final 10 times, and had come within a converted try in six of those games.

The drought culminated in three consecutive title-game losses in 2007 through 2009, and ''Les Jaunards'' finally broke through in [[2009–10 Top 14 season|2010]] to win their first title after 91 years of competition (they did not play in 1915–1919 or 1940–1942 due to World War I and World War II).

===Cricket===
Queensland won the [[Sheffield Shield]] in 1994/95, its 63rd season of competition, having finished second on 11 occasions in that time. In 46 of those years, only five teams competed for the Shield, as Tasmania were admitted in 1977/78 (winning the Shield in 2007/08, after 30 years).

[[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] have not yet won the English [[County Championship]] since they were admitted to the competition in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/somerset-always-the-bridesmaids-of-the-county-championship-8566614.html |title=Somerset: Always the bridesmaids of the County Championship |first=Jack |last=Pitt-Brooke |work=The Independent |publisher= |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/england/2610086/Somerset-scent-a-piece-of-history-Cricket.html |title=Somerset scent a piece of County Championship history |work=Daily Telegraph |first=Scyld |last=Berry |date=23 August 2008 |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] have not won the Championship since it was constituted in 1890, but won three unofficial "Champion County" titles in the 1870s, the last in 1874.

[[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] have not yet won the Championship since being admitted to the competition in 1905, after the club was granted first class status.

The [[England cricket team]] has never won a 50 over ICC world cup, even though England founded the game of cricket.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3206">'''Extended length conditioning''' (ELC) also known as "end range conditioning" is  a type of [[physical exercise]] that strengthens the body muscles through a wide range of flexible motions.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Zaichik, [https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=jjl3AAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Extended+Length+Conditioning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y "ElasticSteel Method of Athletic Conditioning: The Finest in Strength and Flexibility Preparation"],.&lt;/ref&gt; ELC exercises are end range exercises or deep range exercises that contract the muscles from full stretch.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Bryant, [http://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/6-best-extended-range-motion-moves-mass-0 "6 Best Extended Range Of Motion Moves For Mass"], ''muscleandfitness.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.family-friendly-fun.com/family-health/therapy/range-of-motion.htm "Range of motion (ROM) exercises for joint mobility "], ''family-friendly-fun.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt; A typical  example of extended length conditioning is the [[Deadlift|stiffed legged deadlift]] which is meant for strengthening  one of the three posterior thigh muscles referred to as "[[hamstring]]".&lt;ref&gt;Josh Bryant, [http://www.elasticsteel.net/Articles.asp?ID=158 "Leg Circles Part II – Stretching the Hip Muscles for Higher Kicks"], ''elasticsteel.net'',.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Extended length conditioning exercises can help people get more comfortable, feel stronger and protected in a deep range.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.easyflexibility.com/products/extended-length-conditioning-for-lower-body?variant=844272217 "Extended Length Conditioning for Lower Body"], ''easyflexibility.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt; The exercises allow for better cold flexibility and faster warm up. They also encourage prevention of injuries developed during muscle stretching.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kurz, [https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=eo4FwKPQppsC&amp;dq=Extended+Length+Conditioning&amp;source=gbs_book_similarbooks "Stretching Scientifically: A Guide to Flexibility Training"],.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Zaichik, [http://www.fightingarts.com/reading/article.php?id=530 "Leg Circles Part 2– Stretching the Hip Muscles for Higher Kicks"],.&lt;/ref&gt; Extended length conditioning exercises help people to stay safe and maintain their flexibility gains. They also add to the overall strength of the individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel Tsatsouline, [https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=buyFfeuFmekC&amp;dq=Extended+Length+Conditioning&amp;source=gbs_book_similarbooks "Relax Into Stretch: Instant Flexibility Through Mastering Muscle Tension"],.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects== 
Extended length conditioning can lead to injuries if the individual fails to warm up properly just like the case with other similar exercises. Injuries can occur when the movement is jerky during ELC exercises.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wellnesswinz.com/2015/11/02/different-types-of-exercise-pros-and-cons/ "Different Types of Exercise: Pros and Cons"], ''wellnesswinz.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mollythrodahl.wordpress.com/2012/02/26/pros-and-cons-of-strength-training-to-failure/ "Pros and Cons of Strength Training to Failure"], ''mollythrodahl.wordpress.com'',February 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2929">'''The Football Act 1424''' was passed by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in the reign of [[James I of Scotland|James I]]. It became law on 26 May 1424, one of a set of [[statute]]s passed that day; it is recorded as ''James I. 1424 (May 26) c.18'' in the Record Edition of the statutes, and ''James I. Parl. 1-1424 c.17'' in the Duodecimo Edition. The title of the Act was "Of playing at the fut ball".

The Act stated that ''it is statut and the king forbiddis that na man play at the fut ball under the payne of iiij d''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn =|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; - in other words, playing [[football]] was forbidden by the King, and punishable by a fine of four [[Penny Scots|pence]].

The Act remained in force for several centuries, although somewhat unsurprisingly, it fell into disuse. It was finally repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1906]].

Three further 15th century Acts (in 1457, 1470 and 1490) explicitly prohibit both football and golf (see [[Golf in Scotland]]) during ''wappenschaws'' ({{lang-en|[[Muster (military)|musterings]]}}) for [[archery]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Handicapping''', in [[sport]] and [[game]]s, is the practice of assigning advantage through scoring compensation or other advantage given to different contestants to equalize the chances of winning.  The word also applies to the various methods by which the advantage is calculated. In principle, a more experienced participant is disadvantaged, or a less experienced or capable participant is advantaged, in order to make it possible for the less experienced participant to win whilst maintaining fairness.  Handicapping is used in scoring many games and competitive sports, including [[Go (board game)|go]], [[shogi]], [[chess]], [[croquet]], [[golf]], [[bowling]], [[polo]], [[basketball]], and [[track and field]] events.  Handicap races are common in clubs which encourage all levels of participants, such as swimming or in cycling clubs and sailing clubs, or which allow participants with a variety of standards of equipment.  Often races, contests or tournaments where this practice is competitively employed are known as ''Handicaps''.

'''Handicapping''' also refers to the various methods by which spectators can predict and quantify the results of a sporting match.  The term is applied to the practice of predicting the result of a competition, such as for purposes of betting against the [[Spread betting|point spread]]. A favored team that wins by less than the point spread still wins the game, but bets on that team lose.

In either case the '''handicapper''' is the person who sets the handicaps for the activity.  &lt;!-- Handicapper redirects to this article --&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''handicap'' derives from [[hand-in-cap]], referring to a system wherein players placed bets or money into the cap of a neutral arbiter to reach an agreement as to the relative values of items sought to be traded.&lt;ref&gt;"handicap, n." The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 8 Oct. 2008 {{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50102189 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524184911/http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50102189 |archivedate=May 24, 2011 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition handicapping==
In a 'result adjustment' style handicap event, the outcome may be adjusted by some factor determined by the handicap.  Some forms of car or yacht racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the PY|publisher=Royal Yachting Association|url=http://www.rya.org.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/technical/Web%20Documents/py-general/RYA_G01_Panel_15_2000x1500_07.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the winner, on elapsed time, may differ from the fastest competitor when the times have been adjusted for the different competitors' handicaps.

In a 'pursuit' style handicap race, all participants are clocked in a time trial before the race. When this takes place at the same event as the main race, it is known as the handicap. In the race itself, the participants do not all start at the same "Go"; the starts are staggered, based on the handicaps. The slowest swimmer, or cyclist, for example, starts first and the fastest starts last, making the end of the race (hopefully) close. An ideal handicap race is one in which all participants finish at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukhorseracing.co.uk/newtoracing/HandicappingExplained.asp] UK Horse Racing. Accessed 5 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The winner is the person who beats his or her own time.

Similarly, physically staggered starting positions can be used, for example, in greyhound racing a handicap race is where greyhounds (based on their ability) start from different [[Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom#Racing Jacket Colours and Starting Traps|starting traps]] set at different measurements from the finish line, and in human foot racing, for example, the [[Stawell Gift]].

Some motorsport events, especially in [[sports car racing]], demand teams to stop the vehicle in the pitbox a fixed period of time depending on the drivers' classification, thus giving advantage to less skilled drivers. An example of a championship using this system is the [[International GT Open]]. The advantage of this system over [[ballast weight]] systems is that vehicles have the normal performance on track, so better drivers will be able to recover time and overtake slower drivers.

Contrarily, horse race handicaping is implemented using extra weight.

===Horse racing===
{{main|Handicap (horse racing)}}
A handicap race in horse racing is a race in which horses carry different weights, allocated by the handicapper. A better horse will carry a heavier weight, to give him or her a disadvantage when racing against slower horses. The handicapper's goal in assigning handicap weights is to enable all the horses to finish together (in a dead heat).

The skill in betting on a handicap horse race is in determining which horse can overcome its handicap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishhorseracing.com/inside_horseracing/about/whatwedo/handicapping.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031095844/http://britishhorseracing.com/inside_horseracing/about/whatwedo/handicapping.asp |archivedate=2010-10-31 |df= }} British Horseracing Authority. Accessed 5 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golf===
{{main|Handicap (golf)}}
Handicapping in the game of golf is by manipulating the golfer's score (number of strokes).

===Chess===
{{main|Handicap (chess)}}
Types of chess handicaps include:
* the stronger player surrenders a certain piece or pieces
* the weaker player has extra moves at the beginning of the game
* the weaker player has extra time on the chess clock
* the odds-giver to deliver checkmate with a specified piece

===Go===
{{main|Handicap (go)}}
Handicapping in go includes the weaker player being given an advantage by placing a number of stones before the stronger player commences, and by final points adjustment.

===Shogi===
{{main|Handicap (shogi)}}
Handicapping in shogi is achieved by removing one or more pieces from the stronger player's side.  Shogi (Japanese chess) and many of its variants have [[Shogi#Player ranking and handicaps|handicaps]].

===Gliding===
{{main|Glider (sailplane)}}

===Polo===
{{main|Handicap (polo)}}
The polo handicap is an estimation of the player's worth to his or her team. It is an overall rating of a player's horsemanship, team play, knowledge of the game, strategy and horses.  The difference between the total of the polo handicaps for the players on each team is then used to determine the minimum score difference for the better team to score to enable them to win.

===Sailing===
{{main|Handicap (sailing)}}
Handicaps for sailing vessels in sailing races have varied throughout history, and they also vary by country, and by sailing organisation. Sailing handicap standards exist internationally, nationally, and within individual sailing clubs.

Sailing race handicaps may be based on vessel capability and-or crew experience, and today typically adjust the time a vessel takes to reach the finish point of the race.

===Tennis===
{{main|Handicap (tennis)}}

===Motor cycle speedway===
[[Calculated Match Average]] is a handicap calculated for every motorcycle speedway rider.

==Outcome prediction==
===Middle and arbitrage bets===
There are strategies that involve differences in the lines on the same event at different books. One bet is called a "middle", which when a player finds two books that offer different point spreads for the same event. They will bet the more favorable spread at both books, and if the final score falls between the two, the bettor will win both bets. On the other hand, if the total falls outside the range of the "middle" the bettor only loses a small percentage of a bet (the "juice" or "vig" taken by the house).

For example, Book 1 has Team A as a 3-point favorite, and Book 2 has team B as a 3-point favorite. If a player bets Team B at Book 1, and Team A at Book 2, he will win both bets if either side wins by 2 or less points, and will win one bet and lose the other (known as a "side") if either team wins by 3 points.

Another strategy, known as arbitrage, or an "arb" or "scalp", involves finding different moneylines for the same event. In this case, the bettor will bet the more favorable line at both books, and have a guaranteed profit. For example, if Book 1 considers Team A to be worth +200 (2 to 1 underdog), and Book 2 considers Team B to be worth +200, a bettor can bet Team A at Book 1, and Team B at Book 2, and guarantee a 100% profit. This is a no-risk bet, as the player is guaranteed a profit no matter the result of the game.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Famous handicappers===
The first very well known sports handicapper in American culture was [[Jimmy Snyder (sports commentator)|Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pace|first=Eric|title=Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder; A Sports Oddsmaker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/22/sports/jimmy-the-greek-snyder-76-is-dead-a-sports-oddsmaker.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his career he worked for [[CBS]] on their Sunday morning show, ''[[The NFL Today]]''. Because sports betting had a social taboo at the time, Snyder was not allowed to mention betting on games specifically. Instead, he would predict the score. Over the years the attitude towards sports betting, and handicapping in general, has changed. [[Billy Walters (gambler)|Billy Walters]] was profiled by ''[[60 Minutes]]'' because of his handicapping abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Logan|first=Lara|title=Sports Betting: Billy Walters|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6FAUQ6SFKM|work=CBSNewsOnline|accessdate=16 Janueary 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billy Walters, and other unknown members of the Computer Group, developed a system for handicapping games and beating [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] sportsbooks. ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' covered [[Jon Price]] a reclusive sports bettor that hires Ph.D's and works off of algorithmic information for his predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jensen|first=David|title=Seeking PHD's Who Minor in Sports|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-jensen/hiring-guru-jon-price-see_b_8166112.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESPN]] wrote an article on [[Haralabos Voulgaris]] naming him as the one of the premier [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] handicappers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eden|first=Scott|title=Meet The World's Top NBA Gambler|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/dollars/post/_/id/2935/meet-the-worlds-top-nba-gambler|work=ESPN The Magazine|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=21 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims to have developed a system that uses advanced statistical analysis to predict the outcomes of games. In the past, very few people did any mathematical calculations when handicapping sporting events. [[Predictions]] were usually made from hunches or information not readily available to the public. However, with the advancement of technology computers powerful enough to run advanced simulation models now frequent homes and offices. Advanced statistics such as DVOA, Win Shares and Points per Possession are talked about in mainstream media. Brian Burke, author of The Fifth Down blog featured in the ''[[New York Times]]'', wrote a formula using advanced statistical techniques that has shown consistency correctly predicting [[National Football League|NFL]] winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Brian|title=Game Probabilities Are Back|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/n-f-l-week-4-game-probabilities-are-back/|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handicapping, as a profession, is very similar to being a [[stock analyst]]. Like [[Wall Street]] did in the 1970s, the sports handicapping industry is undergoing a quantitative revolution. Many successful handicappers also use money management systems similar to financial [[investment]] professionals. The most popular, and mathematically superior, system is the [[Kelly criterion]]. It is a formula for maximizing profits and minimizing losses based on payout odds and win probability of the underlying [[asset]].

==Procedure==
Kinesiological stretching isolates muscles' actions one by one. It concentrates mainly on the muscles which are tighter than the others. This stretching method goes deeper and also helps in acquiring flexibility and strength faster than other methods of stretching.&lt;ref name="EASY"&gt;Paul Zaichik, [https://www.easyflexibility.com/blogs/news/10176749-what-is-the-kinesiological-stretching-technique "What is the Kinesiological Stretching technique?"], ''easyflexibility.com'', November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Muscolino, [https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=08fjDAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Kinesiology+stretching&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y "Kinesiology: The Skeletal System and Muscle Function"], .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and advantages==
The basic use of this technique is to train and stretch a particular muscle, whereas the traditional methods like [[dynamic stretching]], [[static stretching]], [[PNF stretching]] etc. are mostly concerned with more than just one muscle simultaneously.&lt;ref name="ELASTIC"&gt;[http://www.elasticsteel.net/Articles.asp?ID=419 "ElasticSteel Professional Fast Flexibility Training Certification"], ''elasticsteel.net'',.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayne R. Jensen, [https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=hvdqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Kinesiology+stretching&amp;dq=Kinesiology+stretching&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y "Applied Kinesiology and Biomechanics"], .&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinesiological stretching is used to train particular muscles to attain motion beyond the normal range. Generally there are various limiting factors for different muscles to attain a range of motion beyond the normal range, and these limiting factors are known as passive limiting factors. Kinesiological stretching eliminates these passive limiting factors.&lt;ref name="NWA"&gt;Matt Parrott,[http://www.nwaonline.com/news/2016/dec/26/strength-training-stretches-keep-knees-/ "Strength training, stretches keep knees in shape"], ''nwaonline.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Patricia Hamilton, Kathryn Luttgens, [https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=fdELAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Kinesiology+stretching&amp;dq=Kinesiology+stretching&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y "Kinesiology: scientific basis of human motion - Page 414"],.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinesiological stretching is used to avoid the stretch reflex, while increasing the range of motion of a specific muscle. This is strikingly different from previously known stretching techniques, which look to increase the ROM (or [[Range of motion]]) in a specific degree of freedom of a joint or group of joints.&lt;ref name="ELASTIC"/&gt; The stretching method is also used in the treatment of abnormal [[scapulothoracic joint]] combined with the patient's awareness of his/her postural faults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neumann |first=Donald A. |title=Kinesiology of the musculoskeletal system : foundations for rehabilitation|date=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location=St. Louis, Mo. |isbn=0323039898 |edition=2nd |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen S.

==Disadvantages== 
Just like other types of stretching exercises, Kinesiological stretching can lead to injuries especially when performed in a hurry. Engaging in the stretching method without completing the required motion properly can lead to muscle strains or tears.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Crowe,[http://livehealthy.chron.com/disadvantages-stretching-7925.html "The Disadvantages of Stretching"], ''livehealthy.chron.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fitness-science.org/pros-cons-different-stretching-methods/ "The pro’s and cons of different stretching methods"], ''fitness-science.org'',January 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lexa W.

==Blackball and "British-style" eight-ball pool==
&lt;!--The above is NOT a typo; "eight-ball" and "eight-ball pool" are NOT synonymous!--&gt;
This section lists world champions in the recently world-standardized eight-ball variant [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]], and its older competing-standards versions (usually referred to as "eight-ball pool") played at the amateur and semi-professional levels in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and a few European nations. These tournaments are played on a 7-foot [[Billiard table|pool table]] with either the "spots and stripes" numbered balls, or coloured balls - typically yellow and blue, or yellow and red, with a black ball.

The '''North American Association of Sports Economists''' (NAASE) is an organization that promotes and facilitates research and teaching in the economics of sports. NAASE was founded in 2007.  The organization emerged from the many sessions focused on sports economics at the Western Economic Association International (WEAI) meetings held throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.  NAASE maintains a close relationship to the WEAI and the annual NAASE business meeting takes place at this conference.  Although many NAASE members are academics, membership is open to anyone with an interest in sports economics, and NAASE counts undergraduate and graduate students in economics and other related disciplines like sport management as members, as well as non-economists with an interest in sports economics.  Despite the regional scope implied by its name, NAASE has members from around the world, and many past and current officers have been from outside North America. NAASE currently has around 100 members.

==Journals==
The ''[[Journal of Sports Economics]]'' has been published in association with NAASE since 2008, and NAASE members receive discounted subscriptions to the journal.  Beginning in February 2009, the ''Journal of Sports Economics'' began publishing an annual volume dedicated to papers from NAASE sponsored sessions at the Western Economic Association annual conference.

==Officers==

* President: Brad R. Humphreys, [[West Virginia University]]
* Past-President: Dennis Coates, [[UMBC]]
* President-Elect: [[David Berri]], [[Southern Utah University]]
* Secretary: Stacy Brook, [[University of Iowa]]
* Treasurer: John Solow, [[University of Iowa]]
* Vice Presidents: Peter von Allmen, [[Moravian College]], Craig Depken, [[University of North Carolina - Charlotte]], Anthony Krautmann, [[DePaul University]], Michael Leeds, [[Temple University]], Robert Simmons, [[Lancaster University]]

==Activities==
NAASE sponsors sessions at numerous academic conferences, including the Western Economic Association International conference, the [[Southern Economic Association]] conference and the Eastern Economic Association conference.  NAASE also sponsors a listserv to promote interaction among researchers in sports economics.

NAASE, in conjunction with the International Association of Sports Economists, operates a working paper series that is part of Research Papers in Economics ([[Repec]]).

==Awards==
NAASE confers an award every four years, the Larry Hadley Service Award, to recognize outstanding service to the field of sports economics.  The first Larry Hadley Service Award will be given at the WEAI Annual Conference in Portland, Oregon in July 2010.

To be considered "on the bubble", you must be waiting to find out if a player or team has made the final spots in a tournament or on any given sports team roster. On the bubble is most commonly associated with the [[Men's college basketball]] or [[Women's college basketball]] for the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. When you are considered to be on the bubble in the [[NBA]] or [[NFL]] it means you are being considered for one of the last few positions on the roster. For those NCAA tournament the teams that are on the bubble, their names are usually released by [[ESPN College Basketball]]; with the list being updated every few days. The table that ESPN releases consists of eight teams with four of them being in the Last Four In and the First Four teams out of the tournament. Many College Basketball teams pay very close attention to the Bubble in late February and early March right before the NCAA tournament begins.

==NCAA Men's and Women's Division I Basketball Championship==
On the bubble is most popular when talking about the Men's and Women's end of the season tournament. When it comes down to [[Selection Sunday]] at the end of the season there are about five to six teams that are on the bubble of getting in the tournament each and every season. When a team is on the bubble, and they do get into the tournament they are most commonly placed as the 11th seed and will often play another team that was on the bubble in the first game of the tournament as a [[Play-in game]]. If a team that is considered to be on the bubble they are almost always one of the top seeds in the [[National Invitation Tournament]] which consists of all the teams that just were not quite good enough to be in the NCAA Tournament.

==How to be on the bubble==
To be considered on the bubble, there are quite a few different things that have to play out during the season. First of all, you must have to have a record that is respectable. What the [[Selection Committee]] looks at when deciding between the five or six bubble teams each year is [[Strength of schedule]], top 50 wins, and top 100 wins. What hurts the bubble teams that are trying to get into the tournament is a bad loss to a team that is below 150. Each and every year there is at least one or two bubble teams that do not make it into the NCAA tournament that were expected to by college basketball analyst. During the tournament it is very rare to see bubble teams make a deep run in the tournament, but there have been a few [[Cinderella team]]s.

===Recent notable bubble teams===
Almost every season there are two or three really big [[Upset (competition)|Upset ]]s, with at least one of them coming from a team that was considered to be on the Bubble. Listed below are many of the teams that were listed on the bubble, but made a run in the NCAA Tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alsher|first1=Jason|title=7 Craziest Cinderella Stories in March Madness History|url=http://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-7-cinderella-stories-in-march-madness-history.html/?a=viewall|website=Sports Cheat Sheet|publisher=The Cheat Sheet|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Syracuse (2016 NCAA Tournament) Made the 2016 [[Final Four (college basketball)]]
* Virginia Commonwealth University (2011 NCAA Tournament) Made the 2011 Final Four
* Butler University (2010 NCAA Tournament) Made the 2010 Final Four
* Butler University (2011 NCAA Tournament) Made the 2011 Final Four
Many bubble teams have done some damage in the tournament, but have not quite been able to win the National Championship yet.

===On the roster bubble===
The roster bubble deals with rosters from numerous leagues, such as [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), [[National Football League]] (NFL), [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), and [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). Each of these leagues have a certain number of players that are allowed on the roster, which means there are always a few players that do not make the cut. From the four leagues listed above, the one that is talked about the most for being difficult to make the roster is Major League Baseball.

====MLB roster bubble====
MLB has by far the largest number of people that are considered to be on the roster bubble. Each baseball roster can have a maximum of twenty-five players being distributed to nine different positions. There is such a large number of players on the bubble for MLB, because there are so many players on each baseball team. The majority of players on the bubble are in the minor leagues. Coaches use [[spring training]] to figure out which twenty-five players will make the roster. Players that are on the bubble may start the season in [[Minor League Baseball]] in hopes of making the MLB team in the future.

====NFL roster bubble====
The NFL has a few players that are considered to be on the bubble, but not as many as other professional sports. The reason for this is because each NFL roster consists of fifty-three players, which makes the coaches' decision often fairly easy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marcum|first1=Jason|title=NFL Practice Squad 2015: Rules, Eligibility, Salary, Size, and more|url=http://www.cincyjungle.com/2015/9/4/9231277/nfl-practice-squad-2015-rules-eligibility-salary-size|website=SB Nation|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If bubble players do not make the roster, they will oftentimes be signed to the team's [[practice squad]] or may be picked up by a different NFL team if they are talented enough.

====NBA roster bubble====
The NBA has by far the fewest people that are considered to be on the bubble; this is because each team only has thirteen players on the roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Luke|title=NBA Roster Limits|url=http://www.hoopsrumors.com/2013/09/nba-roster-limits.html|website=Hoops Rumors|publisher=Hoops Rumors|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most players that are on the roster bubble will make the NBA team because there are so few players that are actually in the league. The last few men that make the team typically do not get any playing time unless the game is out of hand. If a bubble player does not make the team, they may be sent down to the [[D-League]] in hopes of one day being called up to the professional level.

====NHL roster bubble====
The NHL has anywhere from zero to three or four players that are considered to be on the roster bubble in the fall training camp every year. One NHL roster consists of twenty players that are eighteen skaters and two goaltenders. If bubble players do not make the team, they may start out in the [[American Hockey League]], which is similar to the minor leagues in baseball. Hockey has a little bit bigger of a roster compared to other professional sports, which makes it hard to have so many players on the bubble.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7843">'''Pacing strategies in track and field''' are the varied strategies which runners use to distribute their energy throughout a race. Optimal strategies exist and have been studied for the different events of [[track and field]]. These optimal strategies differ for runners in [[Sprint (running)|sprint events]], such as the [[100 metres]], runners in [[Middle-distance running|middle-distance events]], such as the [[800 meters]] or the [[mile run]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2008.046763 |pmid=18424483 |title=Which lap is the slowest?

A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, pacing typically differs between different styles of races. For instance, in a [[time trial]], where the goal of a racer is simply to run the fastest time, participants will typically employ the aforementioned optimal pacing strategy. However, in a [[championship]] race, where the goal of the racer is to win, the pace is typically slow in the beginning of the race and gradually speeds up for a [[sprint finish]], often meaning the race is run with a [[negative split]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/02640414.2012.701759 |pmid=22738897 |title=Pacing in Olympic track races: Competitive tactics versus best performance strategy |journal=Journal of Sports Sciences |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1107 |year=2012 |last1=Thiel |first1=Christian |last2=Foster |first2=Carl |last3=Banzer |first3=Winfried |last4=De Koning |first4=Jos }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, to run a world record, the runner must employ a near-optimal pacing strategy.&lt;ref name = "rt"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://www.humankinetics.com/acucustom/sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/6067.pdf | pmid=19116437 | accessdate = 13 March 2015| year=2006 | author1=Tucker | first1=R | title=An analysis of pacing strategies during men's world-record performances in track athletics | journal=International journal of sports physiology and performance | volume=1 | issue=3 | pages=233–45 | last2=Lambert | first2=M.

[[Track and field]] racers have a variety of options in the ways they can choose to pace their races.

Even-splitting is a strategy in which the racer attempts to hit the same split in every lap of the race. The racer tries to run an "even" pace during the entire race. In [[long-distance running|long-distance events]], this can often be an optimal strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Describing and Understanding Pacing Strategies during Athletic Competition | journal = Sports Medicine | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 239| doi = 10.2165/00007256-200838030-00004 | pmid = 18278984 | year = 2008 | last1 = Abbiss | first1 = Chris R | last2 = Laursen | first2 = Paul B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive-split ===
Positive-splitting is a racing strategy that involves completing the first half of a race faster than the second half. Typically, the runner goes out at a pace faster than he or she can maintain for the entire race, leading to a slower end of the race. Positive-splitting can be employed as a tactic, or can simply be a byproduct of an overambitious early pace.

=== Negative-split ===

[[Negative split|Negative-splitting]] is a racing strategy that involves completing the second half of a race faster than the first half. The racer runs slow in the beginning, and gradually runs faster as the race progresses. This is typically seen as a conservative racing strategy, but in distance events, many world records have been run with a slight negative split.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.livestrong.com/article/1004687-point-running-negative-splits/ | title = What Is the Point of Running Negative Splits? | accessdate = 13 March 2015|website=livestrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sit-and-kick ===
Sit-and-kick, a related strategy to negative-splitting, is one in which the racer typically sits in the pack of the race, not taking the lead or going very fast, and then attempts to "[[Kick (running)|kick]]" or sprint by the other racers during the last laps of the race. The sit-and-kick can be employed by individual runners or, in the case of many championship races, the entire field may attempt to sit-and-kick,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.athleticsweekly.com/0/admin/blog/sit-and-kick-was-the-best-option-for-farahs-rivals/ | title = Sit and kick was the best option for Farah’s rivals | accessdate = 11 March 2015|website=athleticsweekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus leading to drastically slow times for the first few laps and faster than normal times for the last laps.

== Optimal pacing ==
While all of the above strategies can be employed, certain pacing strategies, for physiological reasons, will yield the fastest times.

=== Sprint events ===
For the 100m and 200m events, pacing is not a factor. Because the race is so short, racers simply run at their top speed for the duration of the race. However, for the 400m at the elite level, the event is almost uniformly run with a positive-split strategy. Runners run the first 200m faster than the final 200m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv = 1204.0313| title = Optimal Pacing for Running 400 m and 800 m Track Races | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 81 | issue = 6 | pages = 428 | last1 =  Reardon | first1 = James C. | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1119/1.4803068 | bibcode = 2013AmJPh..81..428R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = The effect of different first 200-m pacing strategies on blood lactate and biomechanical parameters of the 400-m sprint | journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 111 | issue = 8 | pages = 1579| doi = 10.1007/s00421-010-1772-4 | pmid = 21190037 | year = 2010 | last1 = Saraslanidis | first1 = Ploutarchos J. | last2 = Panoutsakopoulos | first2 = Vassilios | last3 = Tsalis | first3 = George A. | last4 = Kyprianou | first4 = Efthymios }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle-distance events ===
In the [[800 meters]], the fastest times have almost always been achieved with a positive-split strategy. A study of 26 world-record 800m races from 1912 to 1997 showed that in 92% of the fastest 800m races, the first half of the race has been run faster than the second half.&lt;ref name = "rt" /&gt; This implies that the optimal strategy for the 800m is to positive-split.

=== Long-distance events ===
In the [[5000 meters]] and [[10000 meters]], the optimal strategy shifts to even-splitting. An analysis of world-record performances in these events shows a clear pattern: relatively even pacing throughout most of the race, and a slight increase in speed in the last 1000m of both the 5000m and 10000m.&lt;ref name = "rt" /&gt; While one could interpret this concluding increase in speed as evidence of a sit-and-kick strategy, the increase in speed observed in these performances is not nearly as dramatic and pronounced as what is typically observed in a sit-and-kick type race.

The '''International Association of Red Sports and Gymnastics Associations''', commonly known as '''Red Sport International (RSI)''' or '''Sportintern''' was a [[Comintern]]-supported international sports organization established in July 1921. The RSI was established in an effort to form a rival organization to already existing [[bourgeoisie|"bourgeois"]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] international sporting groups. The RSI was part of a [[physical culture]] movement in [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]] linked to the physical training of young people prior to their enlistment in the military. The RSI held 3 summer games and 1 winter games called "[[Spartakiad]]" in competition with the [[Olympic games]] of the [[International Olympic Committee]] before being dissolved in 1937.

==Organizational history==

===Background===

The notion of a separate [[working class]] national athletic federation emerged first in Germany during the decade of the 1890s, when a [[Workers Gymnastics Association]] was established by activists in the [[socialism|socialist]] movement in opposition to the [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[German Gymnastics Society]] ''(Turnen).''&lt;ref name=RK107&gt;James Riordan and Arnd Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century.'' London: Routledge, 1999; pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Other "proletarian" sports organizations emerged soon thereafter in that country, including the Solidarity Worker Cycling Club, the Friends of Nature Rambling Association, the Worker Swimming Association, the Free Sailing Association, and the [[Worker Track and Field Athletics Association]], among others.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; By the time of [[World War I]], the German proletarian sports movement included more than 350,000 participants.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt;

Following the bloodbath of World War I, the German workers' sports movement began to reemerge, with a new competitive orientation beginning to take the place of individualistic club activities.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; The international [[social democracy|social democratic]] movement also experienced a rebirth after its connections had been severed by war. In 1920 the social democrats established an International Association for Sports and Physical Culture, echoing its efforts in the pre-war period.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; This organization was rechristened as the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International]] (SWSI) in 1925.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] the international socialist movement divided into two antagonistic camps, socialist and [[communism|communist]] — a division exacerbated with the establishment of the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) in 1919. Parallel political organizations sprung up in every country and a state of bitter enmity prevailed.

===Establishment===
[[File:Podvoisky 1903.jpg|thumb|right|Nikolai Podvoisky, first head of the Red Sports International, as he appeared as a young man.]]
The idea of a rival Red Sport International (RSI) was the inspiration of [[Nikolai Podvoisky]], who at the [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern]] in the summer of 1920 discussed with a number of delegates from around the world the idea of establishing an organization to coordinate the physical training of youth.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957&gt;E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926: Volume 3, Part 2.'' London: Macmillan, 1964; pg. 957.&lt;/ref&gt; Podvoisky, a military specialist in charge of Soviet Russia's military training organization, believed systematic physical training to be beneficial for the needs of the [[Red Army]] for healthy and fit youth in its ranks.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; An international sports organization was also seen as a potential ideological counterweight to the [[Olympic games]] of the "[[bourgeois]]" [[International Olympic Committee]] as well as the activities of the rival International Association for Sports and Physical Culture of the socialists.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 958.&lt;/ref&gt;

Podvoisky gathered interested delegates who were already in Moscow for the Comintern Congress and the group constituted itself a founding conference for an international sports organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; It is worthy of emphasis that the Comintern did not itself directly found the Red Sport International, the group being established through independent initiative and the Comintern being preoccupied with other affairs.&lt;ref&gt;André Gounot, [http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2001/JSH2801/JSH2801d.pdf "Sport or Political Organization? Structures and Characteristics of the Red Sport International, 1921-1937,"] ''Journal of Sport History,'' vol. 28, no. 1 (Spring 2001), pg. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The group issued a public manifesto declaring the establishment of a Red Sport International and elected a governing Executive Committee, consisting of representatives from Soviet Russia, Germany, [[Czechoslovakia]], France, Sweden, Italy, and [[Alsace-Lorraine]].&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; Podvoisky was elected President of the new organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt;

The establishment of an international sports organization in Soviet Russia in 1921 was not without its utopian elements, since no official Soviet sport organizations existed in famine stricken post-civil war Soviet Russia at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 957-958.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, on the other hand, had a well-developed workers' sport movement at this time.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; Consequently, Sportintern from its outset maintained a strong German flavor and it was there in the city of [[Berlin]] that the 2nd Conference of the organization was held in July 1922.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; The only national "proletarian" sports organization to join the German group at that early date was the [[Czechoslovak Federation of Workers' Gymnastic Leagues]], said to represent 100,000 athletes.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt;

The Comintern moved closer to the fledgling Sportintern in November 1922 when, in conjunction with the [[4th World Congress of the Comintern|4th World Congress]], the governing [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] decided to name a representative to the "independent" proletarian sport organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; The [[Communist International of Youth]] (KIM) did not take action until the meeting of its governing Bureau in Moscow in July 1923, when it issued a general recommendation of support for the Sportintern and the national sports organizations affiliated to it as a useful "proletarian class instrument."&lt;ref name=Carr8-960&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 960.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not, however, delve into the contentious issue of in what manner and to what extent these two international bodies should be related.&lt;ref name=Carr8-960 /&gt;

The governing Executive Committee of Sportintern met in Moscow in February 1923 and decided to establish a satellite bureau of the organization in Berlin, with a view to increasing participation among Western European workers' sports organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 960-961.&lt;/ref&gt; The maneuver proved successful in helping to build the organization, triggering a split of the French Workers Sports Federation later that year and the affiliation of 80% of its membership with the Red Sport International.&lt;ref name=Carr8-961&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 961.&lt;/ref&gt; The RSI's increased place in the public eye motivated the governing body of the rival international socialist sports authority, meeting in [[Zurich]] in August 1923, to discuss issuing an invitation to Sportintern to help organize a joint "Workers' Olympiad" — a proposal which was narrowly defeated, despite indications that a majority of individual members of the socialist organization favored joint participation.&lt;ref name=Carr8-961 /&gt;

===End of autonomy===

In October 1924 the Red Sport International held its 3rd Congress in Moscow.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 963.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the organization decided to enlarge its governing Executive Committee to include four members of the Executive Committee of the Communist International of Youth — an organization which saw the national affiliates of Sportintern as comprised overwhelmingly of young workers and sought to insert its influence in the organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963 /&gt; As the membership of Sportintern was formally "open to all proletarian elements which recognize the class struggle" it was not an explicitly communist organization, a situation which the KIM saw as a significant shortcoming.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963 /&gt;

The RSI was a large and growing organization in this interval, with some 2 million affiliated members in the Soviet Union, joined by others sections in Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, Norway, Italy, Finland, Switzerland, the United States, [[Estonia]], Bulgaria, and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 963-964.&lt;/ref&gt; As the size of the organization grew, so, too, did pressure to bring the organization's [[ideology|ideological]] character under tighter centralized Communist Party control.

Nikolai Podvoisky was himself a voice for such an insertion of such ideological hegemony, declaring in a lengthy speech to the [[5th Enlarged Plenum of the Comintern]], held in the spring of 1925, that Sportintern should henceforth adopt as its motto:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Convert sport and gymnastics into a weapon of the class revolutionary struggle, concentrate the attention of workers and peasants on sport and gymnastics as one of the best instruments, methods, and weapons for their class organization and struggle."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Carr, Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same time the international communist movement moved to further politicize the RSI, efforts were made to make political hay over the refusal of the Socialist Workers' Sport International to conduct joint activities, such as its decision to bar the Red Sport International from participation at the July 1925 "Workers' Olympiad" held in Frankfurt under its auspices.&lt;ref name=Carr8-965&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 965.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this period, 1924 to 1925, that the Red Sport International effectively became an auxiliary of the Communist International.&lt;ref&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This control was effected by the subordinate youth section of the Comintern, the Communist International of Youth, although the Comintern reserved for itself ultimate authority to decide issues of great importance.&lt;ref name=Gounot27&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Comintern was itself in the process of being absorbed as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy in this interval, the RSI likewise gradually lost its ability to function independently as an international entity.&lt;ref name=Gounot27 /&gt;

In the words of French sports historian André Gounot:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...The RSI's dependence on the Comintern was accompanied, almost inevitably, by the Soviet section's dominance within the RSI. The interests of the Soviet Union and Soviet sport were decisive factors in the RSI's decisions and actions — even if, as was frequently the case, they were incompatible with those of European worker sport."&lt;ref name=Gounot27 /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last International Congress of the Red Sport International came in 1928 and was marked by no serious discussion of contemporary sporting issues.&lt;ref name=Gounot28&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the 1928 gathering consisted of a mechanical attempt to apply the Comintern's ultra-radical [[Third Period]] slogan of "Class versus Class" and its corollary theory of [[social fascism]] to world sport — splitting the fissure between the two camps of the European workers' sport movement wider than ever.&lt;ref name=Gounot28 /&gt;

===Social composition===

Membership of the various national sections of the Red Sport International was by no means monolithic. According to the RSI's own study of the issue, members of the organizations were predominantly male, but hailed from a variety of communist, socialist, [[syndicalism|syndicalist]], and [[anarchism|anarchist]] tendencies, including many of whom who were members of no party.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;''Internationaler Arbeitersport: Zeitschrift für Fragen der internationalen revolutionären Arbeitersportbewegung.'' Aug. 1931, pg. 303. Quoted in Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of these were of the working class, also included were white collar employees, students, and government workers.&lt;ref name=IAS /&gt; Membership records of the French section, for example, indicate that approximately 80% of participants were from the working class, with the remaining 20% members of other social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 38, fn. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

No details exist for the exact Communist Party membership of any national section of the RSI, although in the considered opinion of a leading historian on the topic, "it is safe to assume that this group represented a minority of the whole membership of each section."&lt;ref name=Gounot29&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Czechoslovakian federation, thought to include the largest Communist Party contingent from outside the USSR, is believed to have included something in the range of 20 to 30% who were members of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt;

The fact that members of other parties or no parties participated in the national sections of the Red Sport International is testimony to the limited impact that RSI programmatic rhetoric had upon grassroots participants.&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt; It was rather the fun and excitement of training and competition that bound together local groups and their national units more than ideological proclivities.&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt; The difference in perception of the organization between its rank-and-file participants and the Moscow dominated leadership of the organization has led one scholar to conclude that the RSI was a "split organization, living in two universes," bureaucratic in political discourse but remaining well within the less intense social democratic workers' sports tradition at the individual club level.&lt;ref name=Gounot35&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view politics was merely a piece of a broader participatory sports movement.&lt;ref name=Gounot35 /&gt;

===International competitions===

The international workers' sports organizations of the socialist and communist movements did not necessarily object to some of the most noble goals of the International Olympic Committee (IOC),&lt;ref name=RK109&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; but they did each share fundamental reservations about the modern Olympic games that were the inspiration of [[Pierre de Coubertin|Baron Pierre de Coubertin]], a hereditary French nobleman.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Hill, ''Olympic Politics: Athens to Atlanta, 1896-1996.'' Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 1996; pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; First and foremost, the Olympics of the IOC stressed competition between nations — regarded by the radicals as a manifestation of national [[chauvinism]].&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Rather than the accentuation of national rivalry and patriotic feeling, international competition should focus on the actual athletic effort in a setting designed to build the ethic of [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], both the socialists and communists agreed.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt;

The IOC games also were based upon rigid entrance standards, while the international festivals of the worker athletic movement instead attempted to build mass participation through pageantry, artistic and cultural activities, and unifying political presentations.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Moreover, the sort of athletes dominating the IOC games were objectionable to the radicals on the basis of [[social class]], dominated as they were by the privileged children of the rural aristocracy and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Such international competitions should be open to the participation of less privileged national and social groups, without distinction to race or creed, in the view of the radical sports organizations.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt;

Therefore, the Red Sport International and its socialist rival, the organization emerging as the Socialist Workers' Sport International, conducted a series of their own workers' sports festivals in distinction to and competition with the Olympiads of the IOC. Four such events (called Spartakiads in honor of the heroic slave leader, [[Spartacus]]) were sponsored by the RSI. Two of these were held in 1928,  and one each in 1931 and 1937.

While a major national workers' sport festival had already been held in Czechoslovakia in 1921, it was the socialist organization in 1925 that conducted the first pair of Workers' Olympics events — Summer Games in Frankfurt attracting 150,000 spectators and competitors from 19 country, and Winter Games in Schreiberhau (today's [[Szklarska Poręba]], Poland), attended by athletes from 12 countries.&lt;ref name=RK110&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; No national flags or anthems graced the closing or opening ceremonies, replaced instead by universal use of the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] and singing of "[[The Internationale]]."&lt;ref name=RK110 /&gt; "Soviet and other communist athletes were excluded from these games, however, and there was therefore little actual unity of the workers' sports movement for all the universalist pageantry employed.

From the middle 1930s the political line of the world communist movement changed. The so-called [[Popular Front]] against the threat of [[fascism]] rendered cooperation with socialists and others through unified workers' athletic festivals not only a possibility but the tactical order of the day. Plans were laid for a so-called 3rd Workers' Olympiad to be held in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], Spain in June 1936, under joint auspices of the RSI and the SWSI. The time and place proved inauspicious, however, coinciding with outbreak of hostilities in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=RK113&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; This forced postponement of the event, which was rescheduled for the next summer in [[Antwerp]], Belgium.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt;

The 3rd Workers' Olympiad proved to be less successful than previous endeavors, but it still managed to attract 27,000 participating athletes, and put 50,000 people in the stadium for the final day of competition.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt; An estimated 200,000 people turned out for the traditional closing parade through the city.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt;

===Dissolution===

With the Soviet Union becoming immersed in the first months of 1937 in a massive and [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] secret police campaign against perceived underground [[espionage|espionage networks]] remembered as the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]], the Red Sport International was summarily dissolved by the Comintern in April of that year.

The '''Sinclair Coefficients''' are a method to compare different [[weight class]]es in [[olympic weightlifting]]. It replaced Hoffman's formula, which was the first statistical analysis of this type.

The method provides the answer to the question "What would be the total of an athlete weighing ''x'' kg if he/she
were an athlete in the heaviest class of the same level of ability?", given by the formula:
ACTUAL TOTAL × SINCLAIR COEFFICIENT = SINCLAIR TOTAL.

There are eight bodyweight categories for men: 56&amp;nbsp;kg, 62&amp;nbsp;kg, 69&amp;nbsp;kg, 77&amp;nbsp;kg, 85&amp;nbsp;kg, 94&amp;nbsp;kg, 105&amp;nbsp;kg and +105&amp;nbsp;kg, and eight for women: 48&amp;nbsp;kg, 53&amp;nbsp;kg, 58&amp;nbsp;kg, 63&amp;nbsp;kg, 69&amp;nbsp;kg, 75&amp;nbsp;kg, 90&amp;nbsp;kg and +90&amp;nbsp;kg.

There are two types of lifts: [[Snatch (weightlifting)|snatch]], and [[clean and jerk]]. However, at most championships, medals are presented for both lifts and the total (the combined result of the best snatch and the best clean and jerk).

To compare and rank the results, especially between bodyweight categories, the [[International Weightlifting Federation]] uses the Sinclair Coefficients which are derived statistically and calculated for one Olympic cycle (for four years, starting in the Spring of each Olympic year).

The total for each bodyweight category is a projection of the Total for that weightlifter if he/she were a competitor in the heaviest bodyweight category with the same level of ability.

The Sinclair Coefficient is &lt;math&gt;10^{A({\log_{10}{(x/b)}})^2}&lt;/math&gt; if ''x''&amp;lt;''b'' where ''x'' is the weightlifter's bodyweight, ''b'' is the world record holder's bodyweight (in the heaviest category) and ''A'' is the coefficient for this Olympic cycle, or 1.0 if ''x''≥''b''.

Then, the Sinclair Total is simply the obtained total multiplied by the Sinclair Coefficient.

For example, from 2017 to 2020, a calculation of the Sinclair Coefficient is as follows, given A=0.751945030 and b=175.508 kg for men, with A=0.783497476 and b=153.655 kg for women.

Assume that we are assessing a male weightlifter weighing 61.9 kg with a total of 320 kg.

&lt;pre&gt;
Then, x=61.9 kg, and we have
X=log10(x/b)=log10(61.9/175.508)=−0.4526062683
A(X^2)=0.751945030*(-0.4526062683)^2=0.751945030*0.204852431=0.1540377697
10^(A(X^2))=10^0.1540377697=1.4257315812

Sinclair Total = Actual Total x S.C. = 320 kg x 1.4257315812 = 456.234
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Men's Sinclair chart==


To understand the whole idea, here is the chart with the men's bodyweight categories (in kg) and its world record Totals, Sinclair Coefficients, and Sinclair Total.  By looking at the Sinclair Total we can determine the RANK.

==Notable Sinclair Totals throughout the history of modern weightlifting==

[[Naim Süleymanoğlu]] achieved a Sinclair Total of 500.705 at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, an all-time world record.&lt;ref&gt;Ledder, Glenn (2013). "Mathematics for the Life Sciences" p. 16. https://books.google.com/books?id=0VeRAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;ots=QfYf6PjYmn&amp;dq=Sinclair%20Coefficients%20naim%20suleymanoglu&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q=Sinclair%20Coefficients%20naim%20suleymanoglu&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yurik Vardanyan]] set a 489.643 Sinclair Total in 1984 in [[Varna]], Bulgaria.

[[Yury Zakharevich]] set a 489.232 Sinclair Total at the 1988 Olympics in [[Seoul]], South Korea.

The highest women's Sinclair total is 352.622, set by Natalia Zabolotnaya at the 2011 President's Cup in Belgrod, Russia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14438">'''The contested judgment of taekwondo of 2010 Asian Games''', also called "'''Sockgate'''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/11/18/2003488785|title=SOCKGATE: Taiwanese disqualified in sensor spat|publisher=The Taipei Times|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;br&gt;Note: Also called "Sockgate" by at least one local English-language media source.&lt;/ref&gt; is a dispute at the [[2010 Asian Games]] on November 17. [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[taekwondo]] [[sportsperson|athlete]] [[Yang Shu-chun]] was disqualified with twelve seconds remaining in the first round due to "unauthorized" (disputed) sensors on her [[sock]]s.

==The judgment==
Yang was facing [[Vietnam]]ese opponent Vu Thi Hau in the first round of the [[flyweight]] division (under 49 kilogram) of the Asian Games taekwondo competition in [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] on November 17, 2010, when she was accused of using the "unauthorized" sensors. During the pre-match testing of equipment, the referee discovered that Yang had two extra sensors on the heels of each sock, which she was asked to remove. She fought without the two additional sensors on her socks.

However, with twelve seconds remaining in the first round of the bout, when Yang was leading at an advantage of 9–0, [[Asian Taekwondo Union]] vice-president Zhao Lei ({{lang|zh-cn|赵磊}}) of [[People's republic of China|China]] instructed Filipino referee Fernandez S. Estanislaoto&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gz2010.cn/info/ENG_ENG/ZB/ZBB101A_TK@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ENG_number=101835.html FERNANDEZ Stephen Estanislao – Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; to call Yang over to the side and inspected her heels. Finding nothing, the referee then called for the match referee to bring over the two sensors that had already been removed and kept under the chair that Yang's coach was sitting on. Following that, Zhao and the referee had a brief discussion, and the match referee disqualified Yang and awarded Vu a 12–0 victory.&lt;ref name="taipeitimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/11/19/2003488876|title=SOCKGATE: Public cries foul in Games row|publisher=The Taipei Times|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The controversy==
[[Chinese Taipei]] representatives at the taekwondo venue immediately pointed out that the equipment was certified and that both fighters passed a pre-match inspection. Following the disqualification, Yang and her coach both protested on the mat for about an hour. The [[World Taekwondo Federation]] (WTF) authorities then gave the ultimatum for them to leave, or they would suspend every Chinese Taipei taekwondo member in the Game. The WTF Secretary-General Yang Jin-suk initially did not reveal the reason why Yang was disqualified and told the press that it was for the protection of the athlete's personal privacy, but later it was revealed the reason was for the sensors on her socks. Secretary-General later said, "It was clearly a manipulative move with the intent of cheating, and that's the reason why the individual was disqualified."&lt;ref name="violation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/11/19/2003488877/1|title=SOCKGATE:World taekwondo official insists Yang broke rules|publisher=The Taipei Times|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Secretary-General of the WTF, there are two sorts of sensor socks for taekwondo. It is specified that only the newer type is allowed to be used in the 2010 Asian Games, because the older type of sensors are fixed by [[velcro]], which allows athletes to easily add new sensors themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2010.163.com/10/1118/08/6LOP5MBE00864IPP.html|script-title=zh:世界跆拳道联合会秘书长:杨淑君赛前已遭到警告|language=zh|publisher=[[NetEase]]|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensors on the newer type are fixed by stitching and have no possibility to be altered by illegal methods, but the newer type have no sensors on the heel.

Yang's coach, Liu Tsung-da ({{lang|zh-tw|劉聰達}}), said the inspector for the match asked Yang to change her socks due to poor signal response before the match. Yang put on another set of older velcro socks and passed the equipment inspection. During the match, the sensors on the heel area had already been removed, which should not affect the scoring record. Right after the judgment, Liu asked for the testimony of the inspector and the surveillance video as evidence, but the demands were all rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=馬鈺龍、陳東旭|url=http://udn.com/NEWS/NATIONAL/NAT2/5985555.shtml|script-title=zh:偷貼有錄影？ 楊淑君：拿出來|publisher=United Daily News Net|date=2010-11-20|accessdate=2010-11-26|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equipment supplier of the Chinese Taipei team said they had never received an official notification from the WTF about suspending the velcro type socks before the Asian Games. There were many of the older type being used in other matches of different weight classes, but those athletes didn't suffer any punishment before or after their matches. According to the WTF official instruction for taekwondo athletes, the former type is still legal in any international games until [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Olympics in 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=丁泰翔|url=http://tvbstv.com/news/news_list.asp?no=chen198720101119191153|script-title=zh:「楊淑君沒貼錯」　廠商示電子襪說明書|publisher=[[TVBS]]|date=2010-11-20|accessdate=2010-11-26|language=zh|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717114545/http://tvbstv.com/news/news_list.asp?no=chen198720101119191153|archivedate=2011-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=E-Apple|url=http://tw.nextmedia.com/rnews/article/ArtID/91402/IssueID/20101118/SecID/107|script-title=zh:廣州亞運》貼的位置不對！楊淑君失格確定|publisher=[[Apple Daily (Taiwan)|Apple Daily]]|date=2010-11-18|accessdate=2010-11-26|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two "unauthorized" extra sensors proclaimed to be found by the Game officials belong to the original design of the older type by a Korean equipment manufacturer, which is the only manufacturer authorized by the WTF officials for the 2010 Asian Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budomart.com.tw/img/20101120q0120555.jpg|title=經緯武道之聲明稿 (The declaration from the equipment supplier)|publisher=經緯武道館|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=黃邱倫|url=http://news.chinatimes.com/focus/0,5243,50107297x112010112100117,00.html|script-title=zh:賽事主任 曹濤：領隊會議未提禁用貼片|publisher=[[China Times]]|date=2010-11-21|accessdate=2010-11-26|language=zh|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124025614/http://news.chinatimes.com/focus/0%2C5243%2C50107297x112010112100117%2C00.html|archivedate=2010-11-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political reaction==
Political reaction in the Republic of China (Taiwan) came swiftly, with politicians on both sides of the political spectrum rushing to Yang's defense. The [[Kuomintang]] [[Legislative Yuan|legislator]] [[Huang Chih-hsiung]] ({{lang|zh-hant|黃志雄}}), himself an [[Taekwondo at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Olympic taekwondo silver medalist]] at the [[2004 Athens Olympic Games]], stated "the decision was inconceivable and ridiculous." [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[Wu Den-yih]] ({{lang|zh-hant|吳敦義}}) is cited as saying, "From the current information we have, our athlete Yang Shu-chun was wronged. If it is proven that the ruling was unfair, the Asian Games Organizing Committee has to shoulder the biggest responsibility." The [[Sports Affairs Council]] demanded an explanation from the [[Asian Taekwondo Union]] regarding the disqualification.

The [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) legislator Pan Men-an ({{lang|zh-hant|潘孟安}}) claimed at a press conference that the accusation by the Game officials that Yang had cheated was an "insult to everybody around the country," and charged that, "the responsibility should fall on the people that conducted the equipment checks."&lt;ref name="taipeitimes1"/&gt;

However, not all was completely peaceful between the two political sides, as the DPP leaders accused the government of a slow response. The DPP Legislator Chiu Yi-ying ({{lang|zh-hant|邱議瑩}}) complained that: "A large number of officials attended the Games, but all they have done so far is to show up at and take part in the awarding ceremonies when our athletes win. When Yang was disqualified, what did they do? Nothing."

[[Tsai Ing-wen]] ({{lang|zh-hant|蔡英文}}), then-current [[chairperson]] of the DPP and [[Republic of China municipal elections, 2010|a candidate for mayor]] of [[New Taipei City]] in 2010, released a statement saying: "This government has always deferred to China and hasn't emphasized our attitudes enough, especially on [[Sovereignty of Taiwan|sovereignty issues]]." She further stated, "As a result, we think that it is regrettable that frontline officials haven't been protesting strongly enough about this incident."

==Public reaction==
Shortly after the disqualification, Taiwanese [[netizen]]s voiced their dissatisfaction with the judgment. Soon, several [[Facebook group]]s in support of Yang were posted, some with hundreds of thousands of followers. On the pages, outcry toward both [[South Korea]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]] was rampant, with many conjecturing a conspiracy, as Yang was regarded as the primary rival to China's gold medal favorite, [[Wu Jingyu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|吴静钰}}), the eventual winner of the gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/11/19/2003488919|title=SOCKGATE: Netizens voice rage at Games|publisher=Taipei Times|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conspiracy theorized that Zhao Le ({{lang|zh-hans|赵磊}}), Wu Jingyu's long-time mentor, was the invisible hand that deliberately forced Yang's ouster to pave the way for Wu's gold medal.

The [[Taekwondo at the 2006 Asian Games|2006 Asian Games]] gold medalist [[Su Li-wen]] ({{lang|zh-hant|蘇麗文}}) came out in support of Yang in her blog, saying that she has never heard of such a ridiculous accusation and pointed out that eight of Yang's nine points were manually scored without the benefit of the foot sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cheng Yu-chia|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/11/19/2003488922|title=SOCKGATE: Former champion comes out in support of Yang|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=2010-11-19|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yang's father, Yang Chin-hsing ({{lang|zh-hant|楊進興}}), remarked, "The whole thing is utterly unacceptable", and told the press that Yang had spent ten months preparing for this competition and that he suspected that China was behind this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tsai Wei-chi|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/11/19/2003488920|title=SOCKGATE: Athlete's father demands justice after disqualification|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=2010-11-19|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asian Taekwondo Union published a misleading article titled "Shocking Act of Deception by Chinese Taipei" on its website, attempting to deflect South Korea of blame of the incident. The homepage of the website was then hacked by Taiwanese [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]s who added hostile criticism. Later, the homepage was restored, and the misleading article was removed. The Union has reportedly blocked Taiwanese IPs from accessing its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nownews.com/2010/11/22/339-2666586.htm|language=zh|title=亞跆盟官網使賤招？ 用防火牆封鎖台灣 IP 騙說遭駭！ &amp;#124; 3C新聞 &amp;#124; NOWnews 今日新聞網|publisher=Nownews.com|date=|accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Korean protests in Taiwan===
{{Further|Anti-Korean sentiment#In Taiwan}}
Since this is not the first time that Taiwanese athletes have faced controversial judgments in international games, netizens rallied to [[boycott]] Korean merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=陳威廷、楊忠翰|url=http://tw.nextmedia.com/applenews/article/art_id/32973566/IssueID/20101119|script-title=zh:35萬人挺楊 批韓國卑鄙|publisher=[[Apple Daily (Taiwan)|Apple Daily]]|date=2010-11-19|accessdate=2010-11-26|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; A legislator candidate even led the congregation to protest and burn the [[flag of South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=黃奕群、許家瑜|url=http://www.ctitv.com.tw/news_video_c13v22668.html|script-title=zh:"少女時代道歉都無效"!　反韓聲浪高漲|publisher=[[CTi News]]|date=2010-11-18|accessdate = 2010-11-26|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Taipei citizen threw eggs at a Korean immigration school as a protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=E-Apple|url=http://tw.nextmedia.com/applenews/article/art_id/32978151/IssueID/20101121|script-title=zh:蛋洗韓國學校 家長很不安|publisher=[[Apple Daily (Taiwan)|Apple Daily]]|date=2010-11-21|accessdate=2010-11-26|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few restaurants and [[Taxicab|taxi]] drivers announced, "No Service to Koreans."

==Verdict==
On December 21, 2010, Yang was given a three months' suspension for protesting her disqualification during the 2010 Asian Games by the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF). Her coach, Liu Tsung-ta was given a 20 months' suspension while Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA) was fined US$50,000 for "negligence and wrongdoing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wang|first=Chris|title=Taiwan taekwondo athlete Yang suspended for three months (update)|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&amp;ID=201012210039|accessdate=2010-12-22|newspaper=Focus Taiwan News Channel|date=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sports club''' or '''sporting club''', sometimes '''athletics club''' or '''sports society''' or '''sports association''', is a group of people formed for the purpose of playing [[sport]]s.

Sports clubs range from organisations whose members play together, unpaid, and may play other similar clubs on occasion, watched mostly by family and friends, to large commercial organisations with [[Professional sports|professional]] players which have [[Sports team|team]]s which regularly compete against those of other clubs and attract sometimes very large crowds of paying [[Sports fan|spectators]]. Clubs may be dedicated to a single sport or to several ('''multi-sport club''').

The term ''athletics club'' is sometimes used for a general sports club, rather than one dedicated to [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] proper.

== Organization ==
Larger sports clubs are characterized by having professional and amateur departments in various sports such as [[bike polo]], [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[futsal]], [[cricket]], [[volleyball]], [[team handball|handball]], [[roller hockey (Quad)|rink hockey]], [[bowling]],  [[water polo]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[track and field athletics]], [[boxing]], [[baseball]], [[cycling]], [[tennis]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[gymnastics]] and others, including less traditional sports such as [[airsoft]], [[billiards]], [[orienteering]], [[paintball]] or [[roller derby]]. The teams and [[Sportsperson|athlete]]s belonging to a sports club may compete in several different leagues, championships and tournaments wearing the same club colors and using the same club name, sharing also the same club [[fan (person)|fan base]], supporters and facilities. 

Many professional sports clubs have an associate system where the affiliated supporters pay an annuity fee. In those cases, supporters become eligible to attend the club's home matches and exhibitions across the entire season, and have the right to practice almost every kind of sport at the club's facilities. Registered associate member fees, attendance receipts, [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ing contracts, team [[merchandising]], TV rights, and athlete/player [[transfer (football)|transfer fees]], are usually the primary sources of sports club financing. In addition, there are sports clubs, or its teams, which are publicly traded and listed on a [[stock exchange]] - several professional European football clubs belonging to a larger multistports club are examples of this (namely, Portuguese SADs ([[Sociedade Anónima Desportiva]]) such as [[S.L. Benfica|Sport Lisboa e Benfica]] and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]], or Spanish SADs ([[Sociedad Anónima Deportiva]]) [[Real Zaragoza, S.A.D.]] and [[Real Betis Balompié S.A.D.]], as well as Italian clubs like [[S.S. Lazio|Società Sportiva Lazio S.p.A.]]).

Some sports teams are owned and financed by a single non-sports [[company]], for example the several sports teams owned by [[Red Bull GmbH]] and collectively known as [[Red Bull (disambiguation)#Sports teams owned by Red Bull GmbH|Red Bulls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://redbulls.com/ Red Bulls] redbulls.com&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of this are the several sports teams owned by [[Bayer AG]] and [[Philips]] corporations through the [[TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen]] and [[PSV Eindhoven]] respectively, that originally were [[works team]]s, the teams owned by the [[Samsung Group]], and the teams owned by the [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG). They may compete in several different sports and leagues, being headquartered in some cases across several countries.

==Sports clubs around the world==
In many regions of the world like [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], [[Middle East]], [[Indian subcontinent]] or [[Latin America]], sports clubs with several sports departments (multisports clubs) or branches, including highly competitive professional teams, are very popular and have developed into some of the most powerful and representative sports institutions in those places. In general, student sports can be described as composed by multisports clubs, each one representing its educational institution and competing in several sport disciplines.

In the [[United States]] major institutions like [[The New York Athletic Club]] and [[Los Angeles Athletic Club]] serve as athletic clubs that participate in multiple sports. Examples also abound of sports clubs that are in effect one sports team.  Each team from the [[National Football League|NFL]] (American football), [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] (Canadian football), [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] (basketball), [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] (baseball), [[National Hockey League|NHL]] (ice hockey) or [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] (association football) North American [[sports league]]s, can be called sports clubs, but in practice, they focus solely on a single sport. There are some exceptions, especially when multiple such teams are under one ownership structure, in which case the club may be referred to as a "sports and entertainment" company; see, for example, the [[Pegula Sports and Entertainment|One Buffalo]] sports club, which fields an NFL team (the [[Buffalo Bills]]), two hockey teams ([[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Rochester Americans]]), professional lacrosse ([[Buffalo Bandits]]), and general athletics and fitness (Impact Sports and Performance). On the other hand, American [[varsity team]]s are generally organized into a structure forming a true multi-sport club belonging to an educational institution, but varsity collegiate athletics are almost never referred to as clubs; [[college club sports in the United States|"club sports" in American colleges and universities]] refer to sports that are not directly sponsored by the colleges but by student organizations (see [[National Club Football Association]] and [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]] for two leagues consisting entirely of college "club" teams in [[North American football]] and [[ice hockey]], respectively).

In the [[United Kingdom]], almost all major sports organizations are dedicated to a single sport, with a few minor multisport clubs such as Catford Wanderers. In addition, like in several other countries, many universities and colleges develop a wide range of student sport activities including at a professional or semi-professional level. [[Fulham F.C.]] once ran a professional [[rugby league]] team and rowing club, which other football clubs have emulated since. Many football clubs originate from cricket teams. Today, most major cities have separate clubs for each sport (e.g. [[Manchester United]] football club and [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] are based in [[Manchester]]).

Many clubs internationally describe themselves as [[football club]]s ("FC", "Football Club" in British English and "Fußball-Club" in German; "CF", ''Clube de Futebol'' in Portuguese and ''Club de Fútbol'' in Spanish). Generally, British football clubs field only football teams. Their counterparts in several other countries tend to be full multi-sport clubs, even when called football clubs ([[F.C. Porto|Futebol Clube do Porto]]; [[FC Bayern Munich|Fußball-Club Bayern München]]; [[FC Barcelona|Futbol Club Barcelona]]). The equivalent abbreviation "SC" (for "Soccer Club") is occasionally used in North American English (for example, the [[Chicago Fire (MLS)|Chicago Fire S.C.]]), but a general reluctance to North Americanize the sport means that most North American teams, somewhat ambiguously (and perhaps erroneously, as "football" in North American English refers to North American gridiron-style football) still use "F.C." in their name instead (e.g. [[FC Dallas]] or [[Toronto FC]]).

{{Journalism sidebar}}
'''Sports journalism''' is a form of [[writing]] that reports on [[sport]]ing topics and [[sports competition|competitions]]. 

Sports [[journalism]] is the essential element of many [[news media]] organizations. While the sports department (along with [[Entertainment journalism|entertainment news]]) within some [[newspaper]]s has been mockingly called the ''toy department'', because sports [[journalist]]s do not concern themselves with the 'serious' topics covered by the news desk, sports coverage has grown in importance as sport has grown in [[wealth]], [[Economic power|power]], and [[Social influence|influence]].

Also, some media organizations are devoted entirely to sports [[Journalism|reporting]] — newspapers and [[magazine]]s such as ''[[L'Equipe]]'' in [[France]], ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' in [[Italy]], ''[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'' in [[Spain]], the defunct ''[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' in Britain, and American ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and ''[[Sporting News]]''; [[television network]]s such as ''[[Eurosport]]'', ''[[Fox Sports]]'', ''[[ESPN]]''; [[sports radio]] stations such as ''[[BBC Radio 5 Live]]'', ''[[ESPN Radio]]'', ''[[Fox Sports Radio]]'' and ''[[TSN Radio]]''; and ''[[The Sports Network|The Sports Network (TSN)]]''; and websites such as [[ESPN.com]], [[Foxsports.com]], and [[Yahoo! Sports]].

== Socio-political significance ==
[[Major League Baseball]] gave print journalists a special role in its games. They were named [[official scorer]]s and kept statistics that were considered part of the official record of league.  Active sportswriters were removed from this role in 1980.  Although their statistical judgment calls could not affect the outcome of a game in progress, the awarding of errors and wins/saves were seen as powerful influences on pitching staff selections and play lists when coach decisions seemed unusual.  The removal of writers, who could benefit fiscally from sensational sports stories, was done to remove this perception of a [[conflict of interest]], and to increase statistics volume, consistency, and accuracy.

Sports stories occasionally transcend the games themselves and take on socio-political significance: [[Jackie Robinson]] breaking the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]] in baseball is an example of this. Modern controversies regarding the hyper-compensation of top athletes, the use of [[anabolic steroids]] and other, banned [[performance-enhancing drugs]], and the cost to local and national governments to build sports venues and related infrastructure, especially for [[Olympic Games]], also demonstrates how sports can intrude on to the news pages.

Sportswriters regularly face more deadline pressure than other reporters because sporting events tend to occur late in the day and closer to the deadlines many organizations must observe. Yet they are expected to use the same tools as news journalists, and to uphold the same professional and ethical standards. They must take care not to show bias for any team.

== In Europe ==
The tradition of sports reporting attracting some of the finest writers in journalism can be traced to the coverage of sport in Victorian England, where several modern sports – such as association football, [[cricket]], [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]] – were first organized and codified into something resembling what we would recognize today.&lt;!-- Reference?  --&gt;

Andrew Warwick has suggested that [[The Boat Race]] provided the first mass spectator event for journalistic coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Warwick (2003) ''Masters of Theory: Cambridge and the Rise of Mathematical Physics'',  page 213, [[University of Chicago Press]]  {{ISBN|0-226-87374-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Race, an annual [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] event between the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford]], has been held annually from 1856.

[[Cricket]], possibly because of its esteemed place in society, has regularly attracted the most elegant of writers. The ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'', in the first half of the 20th century, employed [[Neville Cardus]] as its cricket correspondent as well as its music critic. Cardus was later knighted for his services to journalism. One of his successors, [[John Arlott]], who became a worldwide favorite because of his radio commentaries on the [[BBC]], was also known for his poetry.

The first [[1908 Summer Olympics|London Olympic Games]] in 1908 attracted such widespread public interest that many newspapers assigned their very best-known writers to the event. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' even had Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] at the [[White City Stadium]] to cover the finish of the [[Marathon]].

Such was the drama of that race, in which [[Dorando Pietri]] collapsed within sight of the finishing line when leading, that Conan Doyle led a public subscription campaign to see the gallant Italian, having been denied the gold medal through his disqualification, awarded a special silver cup, which was presented by [[Queen Alexandra]]. And the public imagination was so well caught by the event that annual races in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, and London, and at future Olympics, were henceforward staged over exactly the same, 26-mile, 385-yard distance used for the [[1908 Olympic Marathon]], and the official length of the event worldwide to this day.

The London race, called the [[Polytechnic Marathon]] and originally staged over the 1908 Olympic route from outside the royal residence at [[Windsor Castle]] to White City, was first sponsored by the ''Sporting Life'', which in those Edwardian times was a daily newspaper which sought to cover all sporting events, rather than just a betting paper for horse racing and greyhounds that it became in the years after the [[Second World War]].

The rise of the radio made sports journalism more focused on the live coverage of the sporting events. The first sports reporter in Great Britain, and one of the first sports reporters in the World, was an English writer [[Edgar Wallace]], who made a report on [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] on June 6, 1923 for the [[British Broadcasting Company]].

In France, ''[[L'Auto]]'', the predecessor of ''L'Equipe'', had already played an equally influential part in the sporting fabric of society when it announced in 1903 that it would stage an annual bicycle race around the country. The [[Tour de France]] was born, and sports journalism's role in its foundation is still reflected today in the leading rider wearing a yellow jersey - the color of the paper on which ''L'Auto'' was published (in Italy, the [[Giro d'Italia]] established a similar tradition, with the leading rider wearing a jersey the same pink color as the sponsoring newspaper, ''La Gazzetta'').

== Sports stars in the press box ==
After the Second World War, the sports sections of British national daily and Sunday newspapers continued to expand, to the point where many papers now have separate standalone sports sections; some Sunday tabloids even have sections, additional to the sports pages, devoted solely to the previous day's football reports. In some respects, this has replaced the earlier practice of many regional newspapers which - until overtaken by the pace of modern electronic media - would produce special results editions rushed out on Saturday evenings.

Some newspapers, such as ''[[Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', with 1924 Olympic 100 metres champion [[Harold Abrahams]], or the London ''Evening News'' using former England cricket captain Sir [[Leonard Hutton]], began to adopt the policy of hiring former sports stars to pen columns, which were often ghost written. Some such ghosted columns, however, did little to further the reputation of sports journalism, which is increasingly becoming the subject of academic scrutiny of its standards.

Many "ghosted" columns were often run by independent sports agencies, based in Fleet Street or in the provinces, who had signed up the sports star to a contract and then syndicated their material among various titles. These agencies included Pardons, or the [[Cricket Reporting Agency]], which routinely provided the editors of the [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]] cricket almanac, and Hayters.

Sportswriting in Britain has attracted some of the finest journalistic talents. The ''Daily Mirror'''s Peter Wilson, [[Hugh McIlvanney]], first at ''The Observer'' and lately at the ''Sunday Times'', [[Ian Wooldridge]] of the ''Daily Mail'' and soccer writer [[Brian Glanville]], best known at the ''Sunday Times'', and columnist Patrick Collins, of the ''Mail on Sunday'', five times the winner of the Sports Writer of the Year Award.

Many became household names in the late 20th century through their trenchant reporting{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} of often earth-shattering events that have transcended the back pages and been reported on the front pages: the [[Munich massacre|Massacre at the Munich Olympics]] in 1972; [[Muhammad Ali]]'s fight career, including his 1974 title bout against [[George Foreman]]; the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster|Heysel]] Stadium disaster; and the career highs and lows of the likes of [[Tiger Woods]], [[George Best]], [[David Beckham]], [[Lester Piggott]] and other high-profile stars.

McIlvanney and Wooldridge, who died in March 2007, aged 75, both enjoyed careers that saw them frequently work in television. During his career, Wooldridge became so famous that, like the sports stars he reported upon, he hired the services of [[IMG (company)|IMG]], the agency founded by the American businessman, [[Mark McCormack]], to manage his affairs. Glanville wrote several books, including novels, as well as scripting the memorable official film to the 1966 World Cup staged in England.

== Investigative journalism and sport ==
Since the 1990s, the growing importance of sport, its impact as a global business and the huge amounts of money involved in the staging of events such as the Olympic Games and football World Cups, has also attracted the attention of investigative journalists. The sensitive nature of the relationships between sports journalists and the subjects of their reporting, as well as declining budgets experienced by most Fleet Street newspapers, has meant that such long-term projects have often emanated from television documentary makers.

[[Tom Bower]], with his 2003 sports book of the year ''Broken Dreams'', which analyzed British football, followed in the tradition established a decade earlier by [[Andrew Jennings]] and [[Vyv Simson]] with their controversial investigation of corruption within the International Olympic Committee. Jennings and Simson's ''The Lords of the Rings'' in many ways predicted the scandals that were to emerge around the staging of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City; Jennings would follow-up with two further books on the Olympics and one on [[FIFA]], the world football body.

Likewise, award-winning writers [[Duncan Mackay (journalist)|Duncan Mackay]], of ''The Guardian'', and [[Steven Downes]] unravelled many scandals involving doping, fixed races and bribery in international athletics in their 1996 book, ''Running Scared'', which offered an account of the threats by a senior track official that led to the suicide of their sports journalist colleague, [[Cliff Temple]].

But the writing of such exposes - referred to as "spitting in the soup" by [[Paul Kimmage]], the former Tour de France professional cyclist, now an award-winning writer for the ''Sunday Times'' – often requires the view of an outsider who is not compromised by the need of day-to-day dealings with sportsmen and officials, as required by "beat" correspondents.
 
The stakes can be high when upsetting sport's powers: in 2007, England's [[the Football Association|FA]] opted to switch its multimillion-pound contract for UK coverage rights of the [[FA Cup]] and England international matches from the BBC to rival broadcasters ITV. One of the reasons cited was that the BBC had been too critical of the performances of the [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/2323773/Exclusive-the-England-players-revolt.html England football team].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Sports books==

Increasingly, sports journalists have turned to [[Long-form journalism|long-form writing]], producing popular books on a range of sporting topics, including biographies, history and investigations. [[Dan Topolski]] was the first recipient of the [[William Hill Sports Book of the Year]] award in 1989, which has continued to reward authors for their excellence in sports literature.

== Organizations ==
Most countries have their own national [[Sports Journalists' Association|association of sports journalists]]. Many sports also have their own clubs and associations for specified journalists. These organizations attempt to maintain the standard of press provision at sports venues, to oversee fair accreditation procedures and to celebrate high standards of sports journalism.

The International Sports Press Association, AIPS, was founded in 1924 during the Olympic Games in Paris, at the headquarters of the Sporting Club de France, by Frantz Reichel, the press chief of the Paris Games, and the Belgian Victor Boin. AIPS operates through a system of continental sub-associations and national associations, and liaises closely with some of the world's biggest sports federations, including the [[International Olympic Committee]], football's world governing body FIFA, and the [[IAAF]], the international track and field body. The first statutes of AIPS mentioned these objectives:
* to enhance the cooperation between its member associations in defending sport and the professional interest of their members.
* to strengthen the friendship, solidarity and common interests between sports journalists of all countries.
* to assure the best possible working conditions for the members.

For horse racing the Horserace Writers and Photographers’ Association was founded in 1927, was revived in 1967, and represents the interests of racing journalists in every branch of the media.

[[File:Press room at the Philips Stadion.jpg|thumb|Press room at the Philips Stadion, home of [[PSV Eindhoven]], prior to a press conference]]

In Britain, the Sports Journalists' Association was founded in 1948. It stages two awards events, an annual Sports Awards ceremony which recognizes outstanding performances by British sportsmen and women during the previous year, and the British Sports Journalism Awards, the industry's "Oscars", sponsored by UK Sport and presented each March. Founded as the Sports Writers' Association, following a merger with the Professional Sports Photographers' Association in 2002, the organization changed its title to the more inclusive SJA. Its president is the veteran broadcaster and columnist [[Sir Michael Parkinson]]. The SJA represents the British sports media on the [[British Olympic Association]]'s press advisory committee and acts as a consultant to organizers of major events who need guidance on media requirements as well as seeking to represent its members' interests in a range of activities. In March 2008, [[Martin Samuel]], then the chief football correspondent of ''The Times'', was named British Sportswriter of the Year, the first time any journalist had won the award three years in succession. At the same awards, [[Jeff Stelling]], of Sky Sports, was named Sports Broadcaster of the Year for the third time, a prize determined by a ballot of SJA members. Stelling won the vote again the following year, when the ''Sunday Times'''s Paul Kimmage won the interviewer of the year prize for a fifth time.

In the United States, the Indianapolis-based [[National Sports Journalism Center]] monitors trends and strategy within the sports media industry. The center is also home to the Associated Press Sports Editors, the largest group of sports media professionals in the country.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In more recent years,{{When|date=May 2015}} sports journalism has turned its attention to online news and press release media and provided services to Associated Press and other major news syndication services. This has become even more apparent with the increase in online social engagement. This has led to an increasing number of freelance journalism in the sports industry and an explosion of sports related news and industry websites.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Fanzines and blogs ==
Through the 1970s and '80s, a rise in "citizen journalism" in Europe was witnessed in the rapid growth in popularity of soccer "fanzines" - cheaply printed magazines written by fans for fans that bypassed often stilted official club match programs and traditional media. Many continue today and thrive.

Some authors, such as [[Jim Munro]], have been adopted by their clubs. Once an editor of the [[West Ham United]] fanzine ''Fortune's Always Dreaming'', Munro was hired by the club to write for its matchday magazine and is now sports editor of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' Online. Other titles, such as the irreverent monthly soccer magazine ''When Saturday Comes'', have effectively gone mainstream.

The advent of the internet has seen much of this fan-generated energy directed into sports blogs. Ranging from team-centric blogs to those that cover the sports media itself, [[Bleacher Report]], [[Deadspin.com]], ProFootballTalk.com, BaseballEssential.com, Tireball Sports, AOL Fanhouse, [http://www.massholesports.com Masshole Sports], the blogs in the [[Yardbarker]] Network, and others have garnered massive followings.

Blogging has also been taken up by former athletes such as [[Curt Schilling]], [[Paula Radcliffe]], [[Greg Oden]], [[Donovan McNabb]], and [[Chris Cooley (American football)|Chris Cooley]].

==Smartphones==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2015}}
Since the beginning of smartphones and the use of applications, sports media has taken off and has become accessible from almost anywhere at any time. Not only can fans check the scores on different apps such as ESPN and Global Sports Media, but people can use social media apps as well to find out different scores. These apps give score updates, rosters, game schedules, injury updates, and much more right when it happens. People can get real time results right from their phone. They do not need to be at the game, or right by their television, to see how their favorite team is doing. Now people can stream games right from their phone.

This type of fast, easy information is very important to sports fans. As stated in a Time magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/01/26/social-media-and-sports-natural-teammates/|title=Social Media and Sports: Natural Teammates|work=TIME.com|accessdate=21 May 2015|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Enthusiastic fans are eager for updates on their favorite teams and the opportunity to rant about what went wrong in the playoffs or why their coach should be fired”. Many people want to discuss matters about sports, teams and games, and this article shows that with the sports apps, the news can be found at a moment’s notice.

Thanks to the smartphone, a fan no longer has to wait for scores or search the web for information on players. All the information is available at the palm of their hand. Sports apps do not always have to be about giving scores, as some applications include workout helpers, rule books, and even games. The workout apps can show how the professionals’ workout and can give inspiration to do the same workout. The rule books are important, because it spreads the knowledge about the game, and it can get people interested in new games. The games apps are a good way of teaching people how the game is played, and can give players a bigger interest in a specific sport. All of these different apps are a part of sports media in the form of using smartphones and apps. This helps spread information about sports to anyone who wants it.

Smartphones can not only be used just for scores, they can also help athletes become known and recruited. These days most everything is caught on camera, and that includes great plays made by athletes. Once a video is taken it will be spread through the social media sites in no time.

==Gender==

The number of women in the sports journalism industry is rapidly growing, and this has caused a lot of controversy in recent years. Many traditionalists believe that the sporting industry should be predominately for men, and female journalists have endured a lot of criticism for breaking the mold.

There has been an ongoing debate as to whether or not female reporters should be allowed in the locker rooms after games. If they are denied access, this gives male reporters a competitive advantage in the field, as they can interview players in the locker room after games. If locker room access is denied to all reporters - male and female - because of this controversy, male journalists would likely resent female reporters for having their access taken away.

Some breakthrough female reporters include [[Adeline Daley]] (whom some consider the "Jackie Robinson of female sportswriters"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kipen|first=David|title=Fact: The Golden State is the epicenter of baseball, a mother lode of sun-ripened talent|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Fact-The-Golden-State-is-the-epicenter-of-2705387.php|accessdate=2014-05-20|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2004-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Anita Martini]], Tracy Dodds, [[Mary Garber]], [[Lesley Visser]] and [[Sally Jenkins]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">A '''sports ticket derivative''' is a type of [[futures contract]] specifically for sports tickets.  Typical terms of a ticket future contract stipulate that a ticket to a specific game (typically a championship game, such as [[Super Bowl]] or [[World Series]]) is delivered to the holder of the contract contingent on a specific team making it to that event.  Ticket futures were first offered by [[yoonew]] in 2004, under the title of '''Team Fantasy Seats'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.forbes.com/home/entrepreneurs/2005/12/21/yoonew-ticketmaster-tickets-cx_bn_1222yoonew.html | title=Forbes - "Final Four Tickets at 80% Off" | date=22 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sports ticket futures were first offered in 2004 by [[yoonew]].  They came in the form of '''Team Fantasy Seats''' which allowed investors and fans to buy a contract for a [[Super Bowl]] or [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]] ticket contingent on a specific team reaching the event.

As of September, 2008, [[yoonew]] has offered '''sports ticket derivatives''' for the [[Super Bowl]], [[NFC Championship Game]], [[AFC Championship Game]], [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Final Four]], College Football [[BCS National Championship Game]], [[NBA Finals]], MLB [[World Series]], [[Stanley Cup Finals]], and [[UEFA European Football Championship]]. Launching in 2011 Ticketscore.com is the current leader within this marketplace offering ticket derivatives for the NFL,MLB,NHL,NBA and major collegiate sports.

==How it works==
For example, you could purchase a Team Fantasy Seat through [[yoonew]] for the [[New York Giants]] at a market-based price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/06/super-bowl-tickets-at-a-fraction-of-the-price-super-deal-or-super-swindle/ | title= Super Bowl Tickets At A Fraction Of The Price: Super Deal Or Super Swindle?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the Giants make it to the [[Super Bowl]], the holder of the contract receives a [[Super Bowl]] ticket at no additional cost. Ticketscore.com allows you to buy into a price reduced team contract and pay over a term of up to 26 weeks.

[[Image:sweatpants.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Three young men wearing [[grey]] sweatpants]]
'''Sweatpants''' are a [[casual attire|casual]] variety of soft [[trousers]] intended for [[comfort]] or [[sportswear (activewear)|athletic]] purposes, although they are now worn in many different situations. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]] they are known as '''[[tracksuit]] bottoms''' or '''joggers'''. In Australia, they are also commonly known as ''' trackpants''', '''trackies''' or '''tracky daks'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In her tracky daks, a Hollywood star turns invisible|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/24/1035416934724.html|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=25 October 2002|author=Lisa Pryor|language=|quote=Naomi Watts: 'I look like a completely different person when I just wake up and get my tracky daks on'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first pair of sweatpants was introduced in the 1920s by [[Émile Camuset]], the founder of [[Le Coq Sportif]]. The sweatpants were simple knitted gray [[Jersey (fabric)|jersey]] pants that allowed athletes to stretch and run comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tonia |last=Kimbrough |url=http://www.asicentral.com/news/magazines/wearables/novdec-2014/sweatpants-the-comfortable-choice/ |title= Sweatpants History: The Comfortable Choice |publisher=The Advertising Specialty Institute (ASI) |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Sweatpants are usually made from [[cotton]] or [[polyester]], often of a heavy knit. They often have elastic in the [[waistband]], drawstrings, and may or may not have pockets. Some sweatpants can also feature elasticized cuffs at the [[hem]] of the leg. Sweatpants are traditionally [[ash gray]] in color but are now available in most colors. Traditionally quite "baggy" and loose, sweatpants are now also available in more form-fitting shapes; moreover they have flexibility and comfort. In addition, this design traps less heat than most conventional, lightweight trousers, which may be a disadvantage in some conditions such as cold [[temperature]]s and an advantage in others such as [[Thermoregulation|body heat]]–increasing [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] activities. Warmer varieties can be made from [[polar fleece]].

==Culture==
Once these practical pants were only worn for sporting events and at home. Now, they are available in many fashionable styles and are worn in a variety of public situations. Because of their comfort and fashion, they have become a popular choice of clothing. The sweatpant may come from many different materials and in many forms including thick and thin. The sweatpant is sometimes associated with certain lifestyles such as gym culture or hip-hop culture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/germany-stuttgart-cafe-bans-sweatpants/a-41504760&lt;/ref&gt; This niche-specific perception of the sweatpant since the 1980s has at times resulted in extensive dress code regulations with some outlets outright banning the wearing of sweatpants on their premises; including some German cafes and a substantial amount of nightclubs worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;McLennan-Dillabough, Sarah. "Mediating Access: The Utilization of Status Evaluation Processes in the Work of Bouncing." The Arbutus Review 4.1 (2013): 45-62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
[[File:Woman fitness training.JPEG|thumb|upright|Woman wearing tearaway pants]]
There are many variations on the sweatpant design that have evolved to define their own categories of athletic pants.  These variations include '''fashion pants''', '''windpants''', '''tearaway pants''', and '''muscle pants'''.

=== Fashion pants ===
'''Fashion pants''' typically refers to [[fashion]] conscious [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]]. These pants are often made from a variety of materials, like [[velvet]] or [[satin]], and in many color combinations or patterns. One distinguishing characteristic is that fashion pants generally lack the elastic band at the ankles.

=== Windpants ===
Windpants are similar to sweatpants but are lighter and shield the wearer from cold [[wind]] rather than insulate.  Windpants are typically made of polyester or [[nylon]], with a liner made of cotton or polyester. The nylon material's natural friction against both itself and human legs makes "swooshing" sounds during walking. Windpants often have zippers on each ankle, letting athletes unzip the end of each leg, allowing the pants to be pulled over their footwear.

==={{visible anchor|Tearaway pants}}===
'''Tearaway pants''', also known as ''breakaway pants'', ''rip-off pants'', or ''popper pants'' are closely related to windpants.  Tearaway pants are windpants with [[snap fastener]]s running the length of  both legs. The snaps allow athletes to remove their tearaway pants in a timely manner to compete in some sports.  [[Basketball]] and [[track and field]] are the two sports most commonly associated with tearaway pants.

'''Technology doping''' is a new term that has been becoming more popular recently in [[sport]]s. Technology doping is the practice of gaining a competitive advantage using sports equipment. The [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) considers prohibiting technologies if they are "performance-enhancing" or "being against the spirit of the sport". In 2006, WADA initiated a consultation on technology doping which is now officially recognised as a threat, whilst the decision to allow or ban a new technology, specifically relating to sports equipment, is the responsibility of each sport’s own governing body.&lt;ref name=sportseng&gt;{{cite web|title=Sports Engineering: An Unfair Advantage?|url=http://www.imeche.org/Libraries/2011_Press_Releases/Sports_Engineering_report_FINAL_1.sflb.ashx|publisher=Institution of Mechanical Engineers|page=15|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grey area ==
Since most sports require equipment of some sort, it can be tricky to determine what is technology doping and what is not.  The [[Sports governing body|governing authorities]] of different sports usually make judgment calls about the technological advances in their sport’s equipment.  Technological advancements are often allowed unless the governing authorities feel they threaten the integrity of the sport. 
A report released immediately before the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] quotes an extensive public survey that shows that people fear that sports engineering could: overshadow the triumph of human spirit and effort, make certain sports easier, create unfairness so the "best athletes" might not win, and ensure that rich athletes and countries have an advantage over the poor ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hsu|first=Jeremy|title=Are Humans or Technology Breaking Olympic Records?|url=http://www.innovationnewsdaily.com/1484-humans-technology-olympic-records.html|publisher=InnovationNewsDail|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples ==

=== LZR racer swimsuit ===
The [[LZR Racer]] has been one of the most discussed technologies accused of being technology doping.  The LZR Racer bodysuit by [[Speedo]] is a high-performance swimsuit.  It is made with a material that was designed to mimic shark skin.  The suit allows for better oxygen flow to the muscles, holds the body in a more [[hydrodynamic]] position, and traps air which adds buoyancy.

At the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]], this suit was worn by many swimmers.  In fact, some swimmers wore two or more of these suits at once to increase buoyancy.  In total, 23 out of the 25 swimming world records broken at the Beijing Olympics were broken by swimmers wearing this suit.

Some people thought these suits might be so technologically advanced that using them in competition was essentially technology doping. After the Beijing Olympics and subsequent swimming events, at which many world records were broken by swimmers wearing the LZR suit, [[FINA]] (Fédération Internationale de Natation) banned all body-length swimsuits.  Men's suits could only maximally cover from the waist to the knee.  Women's suits could only cover from shoulder to knee.  They also stipulated that the fabric used to make the suits must be a “textile” and the suit could not have fastening devices, such as zippers.  These new rules took effect in January 2010.

=== Ionized shirts ===

A New Zealand firm has created “IonX shirts” which are made of a material that claims to contain a negatively charged electromagnetic field.  It further claims that the shirt helps increase blood flow, which in turn helps deliver more oxygen to the muscles and remove lactic acid from the muscles more quickly.  For the moment, this technology is still legal.  The [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] has ruled that since there is no scientific publication that confirms the material actually changes the body’s ion charges or enhances performance and also the material does not contain prohibited substances, this technology is not banned as of now.

=== Interactive materials ===

Researchers at the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]], an Australian science agency, created a garment that can monitor movement and give feedback.  For example, a basketball player can wear the material in the form of a sleeve.  Then sensors in the material send information to a computer when the player takes shots and responds with audible tones.  The material essentially gives the athlete real-time feedback on their movements.  Athletes can learn patterns of tones that indicate successful or unsuccessful movements and use these to make improvements.  The material helps correct the athlete’s movement and helps the athlete gain [[muscle memory]] so they can continue to perform well once the material is taken away.

=== Mechanical doping ===
{{main|Mechanical doping}}

In [[cycling]], mechanical doping is the use of a secret [[motor]] to propel the bicycle. It is banned by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]]. One of the first allegations of mechanical doping was in the [[2010 Tour of Flanders]]. The first confirmed use of mechanical doping was at the [[2016 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships]]. Bike inspections have become commonplace in road racing since the 2015 season. Riders found guilty of mechanical doping are subject to a fine ranging from 20,000 to 200,000 Swiss Francs and a suspension of at least six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/35452791|title=UCI confirms motorised bike at Cyclo-cross World Championships|last=|first=|date=January 31, 2016|website=BBC|publisher=|access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2016 Tour de France]], French officials utilized thermal cameras to enforce their policy against mechanical doping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/tour-de-france-thermal-cameras-detect-mechanical-doping/story?id=40158791|title=Tour de France to Use Thermal Cameras to Detect Mechanical Doping|last=Thorbecke|first=Catherine|date=June 27, 2016|website=ABC News|publisher=|access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artificial limbs ===

Amputees can compete in the [[Paralympic Games]] using artificial limbs. There has been significant [[Oscar Pistorius#Dispute over prosthetics|debate]] on whether the artificial limbs confer an advantage over able-bodied athletes and whether athletes using them can participate in the [[Olympic Games]]. There has also been debate on the effect of the length of the artificial limbs in the Paralympic Games.

== Standardized equipment ==

Many sports set standards for equipment, to prevent unfair advantages between competitors.  This often involves the types of materials the equipment is made from or dimensions/sizes.  For example, [[tennis]] racquets must not exceed the maximum length and width limits.  Soccer balls must not exceed weight limits.  [[Golf clubs]] must fit shape regulations.

'''Tetsuro Kiyooka''' (清岡 哲朗, ''Kiyooka Tetsuro'', July 30, 1970) is a [[Japan]]ese [[entrepreneur]], [[programmer]] and [[FIFA]] Players' Agent ([[Sports agent]]). He holds [[Permanent residency in Canada]], and his ancestors are the [[Shizoku]] in [[Tosa Province]], [[Japan]] as well as a distant relative of [[Roy Kiyooka]].

== Sports agent ==
Kiyooka firmly believed that the [[Japan national football team]] needed players who had experiences playing for clubs in European leagues to develop the national team. In 2006, he passed the FIFA Players' Agent exam and registered with [[The Football Association]] ([[England]]), the [[Royal Dutch Football Association]] ([[Netherlands]]) and the [[Japan Football Association]] as an official agent. After that, he represented top Japanese players such as [[Keisuke Honda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keisuke Honda to play for Dutch side VVV Venlo|url=https://int.soccerway.com/news/2008/January/16/keisuke-honda-to-play-for-dutch-side-vvv-venlo/|website=soccerway.com|publisher=SOCCERWAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keisuke Honda is happy to play for VVV-Venlo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Y9CZoUins&amp;feature=youtu.be|website=youtube.com|publisher=Venlo TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maya Yoshida]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southampton to sign Japan defender, Maya Yoshida|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton/9509866/Southampton-to-sign-Japan-defender-from-Maya-Yoshida-from-Dutch-Eredivisie-club-VVV-Venlo.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=The Telegraph UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led them to the football clubs in European leagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2014/04/03/soccer/venlo-chief-eyes-new-japanese-talent/ Venlo chief eyes new Japanese talent], The Japan Times, 3 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byfarthegreatestteam.com/posts/maya-yoshida-japan-success-story/ Maya Yoshida: Japan’s Premier League Success Story]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Japan Pro-Footballers Association (JPFA) ==
In 2009, Kiyooka was designated as a [[chief operating officer]] of the [[Japan Pro-Footballers Association]] (JPFA) by [[Toshiya Fujita]], a [[chairman]] of the board. He repealed the unfair transfer regulations between the clubs of [[J.League]] and the professional players in 2009 and formed the organization as a trade union in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=FIFPro|title=Japanese association JPFA will form a union|url=https://www.fifpro.org/news/japanese-association-jpfa-will-form-a-union/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he represented the players of the [[Japan national football team]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan national team threatens boycott|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/japan-national-team-threatens-boycott-2165329.html|website=independent.co.uk|publisher=INDEPENDENT UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; to protect their rights and payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFA President, Ogura dares players to boycott|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2010/12/22/soccer/ogura-dares-players-to-boycott/|website=japantimes.co.jp|publisher=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Japan Times|title=Players make cash demand to JFA|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2010/12/21/soccer/j-league/players-make-cash-demand-to-jfa/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Web development  ==
In 2005, Kiyooka collaborated with [[NTT Communications]] to create the football site called Nippon World Soccer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NTT Communications 日本ワールドサッカーサービス開始|url=https://www.ntt.com/release/2005NEWS/0005/0520.html|website=ntt.com|publisher=NTT Communications (in Japanese)}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the mobile internet services ([[i-mode]], [[EZweb]]) in Japan. The mobile football site acquired over one million users a month in 2006 and became the biggest football mobile site in Japan at that time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1558">A '''victory jig''' or '''victory dance''' is a celebration of a victory or success with a dance, shuffle or body movement. It is most commonly used in sports. The term can be used approvingly or abusively.  A victory jig can be engaged in as a genuine celebration or as a means to humiliate or taunt an opponent.

==Examples==
* [[Touchdown celebration]], an example of a victory dance in American and Canadian football
* [[Gatorade shower]], another type of victory dance in American football
* [[Goal celebration]], an example of a victory dance in association football (soccer)

==Notable occurrences==
*The 25 February 1964 fight between [[Cassius Clay]] and [[Sonny Liston]] when Clay did a "Victory jig" to taunt his opponent in the ring.  See main article [[Ali versus Liston]].
*[[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionist]] politician [[David Trimble]]'s victory jig with [[Ian Paisley]] in [[Northern Ireland]] after the 12 July 1995 Drumcree March (Drumcree I).&lt;ref&gt;See comments on David Trimble's "Victory Jig" [http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/05/08/story4619.asp here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117165000/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/05/08/story4619.asp |date=January 17, 2006 }}.

[[File:Training of Seattle Mist Lingerie Football 0154.jpg|thumb|300px|Players of [[Legends Football League]] do a warming up exercise, USA]]

The warming up is a preparation for physical exertion or a performance by exercising or practising gently beforehand.

'''Warming up''' is performed before a performance or practice. Athletes, singers, actors and others warm up before stressing their muscles. It prepares the muscles for vigorous actions.

==Exercise==
[[File:2006Taipei101RunUp Group CHB WarmingUp.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Chang-Hwa Bank warm up to prevent injuries on October 22, 2006.]]
[[File:Steven Gerrard 2010.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Steven Gerrard]] warming up prior to a soccer match in 2010.]]

A warm up generally consists of a gradual increase in intensity in physical activity (a "pulse raiser"), joint mobility exercise, and [[stretching]], followed by the activity. For example, before running or playing an intensive sport, the athlete might slowly jog to warm their muscles and increase their heart rate. It is important that warm ups be specific to the activity, so that the muscles to be used are activated. The risks and benefits of combining stretching with warming up are disputable, although it is generally believed that warming up prepares the athlete both mentally and physically.  In a meta-study of 32 high quality studies, about 4/5 ths of the studies showed improvements in performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fradkin AJ, Zazryn TR, Smoliga JM |title=Effects of warming-up on physical performance: a systematic review with meta-analysis |journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=140–8 |year=2010 |pmid=19996770 |doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181c643a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warm-up programs can improve the strength of the knee muscle, which, in turn, may decrease injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daneshjoo A, Mokhtar AH, Rahnama N, Yusof A |title=The effects of injury preventive warm-up programs on knee strength ratio in young male professional soccer players |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=e50979 |year=2012 |pmid=23226553 |pmc=3513304 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050979 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...750979D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://helsify.com/workouts/gym-workout-tips| publisher = Helsify | title = How to work out at the gym: workout tips for beginners}}&lt;/ref&gt;


A comprehensive warm-up program did not significantly decrease injuries in football compared to a control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Soligard T, Myklebust G, Steffen K, etal |title=Comprehensive warm-up programme to prevent injuries in young female footballers: cluster randomised controlled trial |journal=BMJ |volume=337 |issue= |pages=a2469 |year=2008 |pmid=19066253 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a2469 |url= |pmc=2600961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In baseball, warm up swings using a standard weight bat are effective in increasing batting speed. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCrary|first=J Matt|date=February 2015|title=A systematic review of the effects of upper body warm-up on performance and injury|url=https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2015/02/18/bjsports-2014-094228|journal=BMJ|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stretching==
{{main|Stretching}}
[[File:SMATrinitasGymnastic2.JPG|thumb|left|A group of [[High School]] girls performing a ballistic stretch in a [[Physical Education]] session]]

Stretching is part of some warm up routines, although a study in 2013 indicates that it weakens muscles in that situation.&lt;ref name = "NatPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://life.nationalpost.com/2013/04/05/stretching-before-workouts-may-weaken-muscles-impair-athletic-performance-studies/ |title=Stretching before workout may weaken muscles, impair athletes: studies &amp;#124; Health &amp;#124; Life &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=Life.nationalpost.com |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 3 types of stretches: [[ballistic stretching]], dynamic, and static stretching:

* Ballistic Stretches involve bouncing or jerking. It is purported to help extend limbs during exercise, promoting agility and flexibility.  However, this type of stretching may also cause injury and is not generally recommended.
* Static Stretches involve flexing the muscles. This may help prevent injury and permit greater flexibility and agility.  Note that static stretching for too long may weaken the muscles.&lt;ref name="NatPost"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/sports/playmagazine/112pewarm.html?_r=6&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin NY Times]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dynamic Stretching involves moving the body part in the desired way until reaching the full range of motion, to improve performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rössler|first1=Roland|last2=Junge|first2=Astrid|last3=Bizzini|first3=Mario|last4=Verhagen|first4=Evert|last5=Chomiak|first5=Jiri|last6=aus der Fünten|first6=Karen|last7=Meyer|first7=Tim|last8=Dvorak|first8=Jiri|last9=Lichtenstein|first9=Eric|last10=Beaudouin|first10=Florian|last11=Faude|first11=Oliver|title=A Multinational Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial to Assess the Efficacy of ‘11+ Kids’: A Warm-Up Programme to Prevent Injuries in Children’s Football|journal=Sports Medicine|date=22 December 2017|doi=10.1007/s40279-017-0834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warming up in other countries==
In Germany, Switzerland and Austria they use this noun in a second context: psychologists and similar professionals are working with "warming ups" in therapeutical or learning sessions before starting or after a break; those warming ups are various interaction games, role playing, moving in the class room and so on.

In [[sports]], a '''winning streak''' is a consecutive sequence of won games or competitions. It can be applied to teams in team sports, and individuals in individual sports. In sports where teams or individuals represent groups such as countries or regions, those groups can also be said to have 'winning streaks' if their representatives win consecutive games or competitions, even if the competitors are different. Streaks can also be applied to specific competitions: for example a competitor who wins an event in three consecutive Olympic Games has an Olympic winning streak, even if they have lost other competitions during the period.

==Longest streaks==

The longest recorded winning streak in any professional sports is [[Pakistan]]'s [[Jahangir Khan]]'s 555 consecutive wins in [[squash (sports)|squash]] from 1981 to 1986. In 2013, the Dutch [[wheelchair tennis]] player [[Esther Vergeer]] retired with an active 10-year-long winning streak of 470 matches, including a streak of 250 consecutive sets won.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Rothenberg, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/sports/wheelchair-tennis-champion-esther-vergeer-retires.html Unbeaten Since 2003, Wheelchair Champ Retires], [[New York Times]], February 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Note:  Because of the post-1972 schedule overhaul, NASCAR will differentiate records from pre-1972 and post-1972.  The primary schedule overhaul eliminated midweek races, thus cutting the schedule from 48 to around 30 races (36 currently), and a minimum race distance (first {{convert|250|mi|km}}, later shortened to {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}}).  Since many pre-1972 races were under 100 miles (such as 62.5 mile races held in [[Islip, New York]], and the current non-championship [[Budweiser Duel]] then being a championship race at 100 miles until 1967), some NASCAR records are differentiated that way, similar to the NBA differentiating "fewest points" records with pre and post-1954 records, when the 24-second shot clock was introduced.

;Post–1972
4 wins (tie) (length of shortest race, in miles, in brackets):
* 1976 [[Cale Yarborough]] (216.8)

* 1998 [[Jeff Gordon]] (220.5)
* 2007 [[Jimmie Johnson]] (263)

Note:  In seven of the eight instances, at least one of the wins was in a 500-mile race.  Mark Martin's 1993 streak ended at [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]], where the [[Southern 500 (1950–2004)|Mountain Dew Southern 500]] was stopped 16 laps early because of darkness.
