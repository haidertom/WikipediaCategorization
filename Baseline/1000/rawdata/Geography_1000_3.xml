The '''Age of Sail''' (usually dated as 1571–1862) was a period roughly corresponding to the [[early modern period]] in which [[international trade]] and [[naval warfare]] were dominated by [[sailing ship]]s, lasting from the 16th to the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/history/the-age-of-sail |title=The Age of Sail |publisher=[[HMS Trincomalee|HMS ''Trincomalee'']] |accessdate=12 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316114603/http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/history/the-age-of-sail |archive-date=2016-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition==
Like most [[History by period|periodic eras]] the definition is inexact but close enough to serve as a general description. The age of sail runs roughly from the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, the last significant engagement in which [[oar]]-propelled [[galley]]s played a major role, to the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] in 1862, in which the steam-powered [[ironclad]] [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] destroyed the sailing ships [[USS Cumberland (1842)|USS ''Cumberland'']] and [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']], demonstrating that the advance of [[steam power]] had rendered sail power in warfare obsolete.

The [[Suez Canal]], in the Middle-East, which opened in 1869, was impractical for sailing ships, and made steamboats faster on the [[European-Asian sea route]].

==Golden Age of Sail==
The period between 1850 and the early 20th century when sailing vessels reached their peak of size and complexity is sometimes referred to as the "Golden Age of Sail".&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html "Sailing Ship Rigs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228161737/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html |date=2010-12-28 }}. [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the efficiency and use of commercial sailing vessels was at its peak&amp;mdash;immediately before [[steamboat]]s started to take trade away from sail.

==Decline==
Sailing ships sometimes continued to be an economical way to transport bulk cargo on long voyages into the 1920s, even if steamships also were used for such transports and became more and more common. Sailing ships do not require fuel or complex engines to be powered; thus they tended to be more independent from requiring a dedicated support base on the mainland. Crucially though, steam-powered ships held a speed advantage and were rarely hindered by adverse winds, freeing steam-powered vessels from the necessity of following [[trade wind]]s. As a result, cargo and supplies could reach a foreign port in half the time it took a sailing ship. 

Sailing vessels were pushed into narrower and narrower economic niches and gradually disappeared from commercial trade. Today, sailing vessels are only economically viable for small scale coastal fishing, along with recreational uses such as [[yachting]] and passenger sail excursion ships.

A '''Bachelor of Environmental Science''' is an [[undergraduate]] [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for courses taken in the study of [[environmental science]] or related disciplines, such as sustainable resource development, [[environmental health]], or [[ecological sustainability]], and may also be known as a Bachelor of Environmental Science and Management degree in some schools. This is a interdisciplinary degree course, some universities offers four year honors degree programme  

The Bachelor of Environmental Science degree is frequently abbreviated as '''B.Env.Sc.''', (sometimes B.E.Sc, B.S.E.S, or even B.E.S - the latter of which can cause confusion with a Bachelor of Environmental ''Studies'' degree) especially in the use of post-nominals where an Environmental Studies degree may be either B.S. or B.A.

In Australia, those who graduate with a B.Env.Sc. are eligible for membership in the [[Environment Institutes|Environment Institute of Australian and New Zealand]].

==List of institutions awarding Bachelor of Environmental Science degrees==
&lt;!-- NOTE: Only list institutions that award a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree - those that award BSc's with specialization do not count --&gt;
This listing only includes institutions that award a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree.  Although there are similar programs that are [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees that specialize in Environmental Science or Environmental Studies, they are not included in this list. In many cases, the differences are political or administrative in nature, as opposed to content.

'''Bouldergaine''' is a variant sport combining the disciplines of [[bouldering]] and [[rogaining]].

The sport takes place in a large boulder field, which is mapped in a similar way to a traditional rogaine. Teams of 2 people choose which checkpoints to visit within a time limit with the intent of maximizing their score.

__NOTOC__
[[File:Monument Valley, late afternoon.jpg|thumb|[[West and East Mitten Buttes|The Mittens]] and [[Merrick Butte]] in [[Monument Valley]], [[Arizona]]]]

In [[geomorphology]], a '''butte''' ({{IPAc-en|b|juː|t}}) is an isolated [[hill]] with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top; buttes are smaller [[landform]]s than [[mesa]]s, [[plateau]]s, and [[Table (landform)|tablelands]]. The word "butte" comes from a [[French language|French]] word meaning "small hill"; its use is prevalent in the [[Western United States]], including the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] where "mesa" is used for the larger landform. Because of their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas. In differentiating mesas and buttes, geographers use the [[rule of thumb]] that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mesa and Butte | work=Science Clarified | year=2008 | url=http://www.scienceclarified.com/landforms/Faults-to-Mountains/Mesa-and-Butte.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230831/http://www.scienceclarified.com/landforms/Faults-to-Mountains/Mesa-and-Butte.html|archivedate=2 December 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable buttes==
The [[West and East Mitten Buttes|Mitten Buttes]] of [[Monument Valley]] in [[Arizona]] are two of the most distinctive and widely recognized buttes. Monument Valley and the Mittens provided backgrounds in scenes from many  [[Western (genre)|western-themed]] [[film]]s, including seven movies directed by [[John Ford]].{{refn|name=note1|group=note|The John Ford westerns with location work shot in Monument Valley were ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'' (1949), ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Sergeant Rutledge]]'' (1960), and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1964).}} The [[Devils Tower]] in northeastern [[Wyoming]] is a [[laccolith]]ic butte composed of [[igneous rock]] rather than [[sandstone]], [[limestone]] or other [[sedimentary rock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Devils Tower National Monument - Geologic Formations | url=http://www.nps.gov/deto/naturescience/geologicformations.htm | publisher=National Park Service | date=10 Mar 2014 | accessdate=13 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B D - Devil's Tower select (3) 1.1 (by).jpg|thumb|left|[[Devils Tower]] in [[Wyoming]]]]

Three other notable formations that are either named ''butte'' or may be considered buttes even though they do not conform to the formal geographer's rule are [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]] in [[Nebraska]] which is actually a collection of five bluffs, [[Crested Butte]] which is a {{convert|12168|ft|m|abbr=on}} mountain in [[Colorado]], and [[Elephant Butte Dam|Elephant Butte]] which is now an island in Elephant Butte Reservoir in [[New Mexico]].

Among the well-known non-flat-topped buttes in the United States are [[Bear Butte]], [[South Dakota]], [[Black Butte (Oregon)|Black Butte]], [[Oregon]], and the [[Sutter Buttes]] in [[California]]. In many cases, buttes have been given other names that do not use the word ''butte'', for example, [[Courthouse Rock]], Nebraska.  Also, some large hills that are technically not buttes have names using the word ''butte'', examples of which are [[Kamiak Butte]] and Chelan Butte in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]].

==Formation==
Buttes form by [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] when hard [[caprock]] overlies a layer of less resistant [[rock (geology)|rock]] that is eventually worn away. The harder rock on top of the butte resists erosion. The caprock provides protection for the less resistant rock below from wind abrasion which leaves it standing isolated. As the top is further eroded by abrasion and weathering, the excess material that falls off adds to the [[scree]] or talus slope around the base. On a much smaller scale, the same process forms [[Hoodoo (geology)|hoodoo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Davis, George Herbert|year=1999|title=Structural Geology of the Colorado Plateau Region of Southern Utah, with Special Emphasis on Deformation Bands|series=G.S.A.

The '''clock code''' is a method of mentally computing the [[sine]] of an angle between zero and sixty [[degree (angle)|degrees]]. [[Aviator|Pilot]]s sometimes need to do this to estimate the heading correction due to the wind, and [[sailor]]s may find it useful to do the same thing to allow for the current due to the [[tide]]s.

The basic assumption is that for angles up to around 60°, it is adequately accurate to assume that sine(A) = A, when A is expressed as a fraction of 60. Thus, the sine of 30° = 30/60 = 1/2 = 0.5.

The clock code is a further method of visualising fractions of 60, since we are very used to expressing fractions of an hour (60 minutes) when telling the time.

Thus:

* 10/60 = 1/6 = 0.167 (true sine = 0.1736, error = -4%)
* 15/60 = 1/4 = 0.25 (0.259, -3.4%)
* 20/60 = 1/3 = 0.33 (0.342, -3.5%)
* 30/60 = 1/2 = 0.5 (0.5, 0%)
* 40/60 = 2/3 = 0.66 (0.643, +2.6%)
* 45/60 = 3/4 = 0.75 (0.707, +5.7%)
* 50/60 = 5/6 = 0.8 (0.766, +4.2%)
* 60/60 = 1/1 = 1.0 (0.866, +13.4%)

The angle is the angle of the wind or tide as it presents itself relative to the ship or aircraft, so if the wind is coming from the left at a relative angle of 30°, we use a sine of 0.5. Once the sine has been estimated, the drift due to wind or tide can be estimated accordingly by resolving the velocity of the wind or tide into a forward component and a sideways component. The sideways component is the windspeed x the sine, and the forward component is (1 - the sine) x windspeed (i.e. the [[cosine]]). Naturally we must apply these corrections to our groundspeed in the appropriate  direction according to logic - a wind from the left will blow us off course in that direction; a headwind will slow our progress, a tailwind will increase it. Converting this back to a heading correction can be done using the [[1 in 60 rule]].

For wind angles greater than 60°, it is adequate to assume it's at 90°, i.e. a side wind.

More accurate corrections are done when possible, but in the particular case of a [[Visual flight rules|VFR]] pilot mentally calculating an unexpected diversion, using tables or the [[E6B]] slide rule in flight is usually not an option, so the clock code is one method of handling the required calculation without excessive error. In practice the wind strength can only be guessed or based on earlier reports, and the error due to the sine calculation will usually be much less than that due to the wind itself. Fine tuning of the heading can be done en route using the usual methods for doing so.

The [http://archives.syr.edu Syracuse University Archives] preserve documents and photographs related to the history of the organization because the long-standing Executive Director, David J. Robinson, is a professor at that university.


==Awards==
Each year CLAG makes several awards to distinguished Latin Americanist geographers and others.

*Preston E. James Eminent Latin Americanist Career Award
*[[Carl O. Sauer]] Distinguished Scholarship Award
*Outstanding Service to CLAG
*Private Sector and Government Award
*Enlaces Award


CLAG also makes awards to graduate students to support research and conference travel.


==Conferences==
CLAG organizes a conference on a regular basis. The conference typically takes place in [[the Americas]] but in 2001 met in [[Benicassim]], [[Spain]].

{{Other uses|Frame of reference (disambiguation)}}
{{Classical mechanics |Fundamentals}}

In [[physics]], a '''frame of reference''' (or '''reference frame''') consists of an abstract [[coordinate system]] and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements.

In n dimensions, n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates]], a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes.

In [[Theory of relativity|Einsteinian relativity]], reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes "'''observational frame of reference'''" (or "'''observational reference frame'''"), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the [[coordinate time]], which does not correspond across different frames [[relative motion|moving relatively]] to each other. The situation thus differs from [[Galilean relativity]], where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.

== Different aspects of "frame of reference" ==
The need to distinguish between the various meanings of "frame of reference" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in ''Cartesian frame of reference''. Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in ''[[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]]''. Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in ''[[Galilean frame of reference]]''. Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in ''macroscopic'' and ''microscopic frames of reference''.&lt;ref name=macroscopic&gt;The distinction between macroscopic and microscopic frames shows up, for example, in electromagnetism where [[Constitutive equation|constitutive relations]] of various time and length scales are used to determine the current and charge densities entering [[Maxwell's equations]]. See, for example, {{cite book |title=Electromagnetic and Optical Pulse Propagation 1: Spectral Representations in Temporally Dispersive Media |author=Kurt Edmund Oughstun |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=behRnNRiueAC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame++electromagnetism|isbn=0-387-34599-X |year=2006 |publisher=Springer}}. These distinctions also appear in thermodynamics. See {{cite book |title=Classical Theory |author=Paul McEvoy |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj0wFIxn-PoC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame#PPA205,M1 |isbn=1-930832-02-8 |year=2002 |publisher=MicroAnalytix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article, the term ''observational frame of reference'' is used when emphasis is upon the ''state of motion'' rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus. In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a ''coordinate system'' may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs ''[[generalized coordinates]]'', ''[[normal modes]]'' or ''[[eigenvectors]]'', which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:

*An observational frame (such as an [[inertial frame]] or [[non-inertial frame of reference]]) is a physical concept related to state of motion.
*A coordinate system is a mathematical concept, amounting to a choice of language used to describe observations.&lt;ref name =Pontriagin&gt;

In very general terms, a coordinate system is a set of arcs ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (''t'') in a complex [[Lie group]]; see {{cite book |author=Lev Semenovich Pontri͡agin |title=L.S. Pontryagin: Selected Works Vol. 2: Topological Groups |page= 429 |year=  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JU0DT_wXu2oC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=2-88124-133-6 |publisher=Gordon and Breach|edition=3rd }}. Less abstractly, a coordinate system in a space of n-dimensions is defined in terms of a basis set of vectors {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,… '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}; see {{cite book |title=Linear Algebra: A Geometric Approach |author1=Edoardo Sernesi |author2=J. Montaldi |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dZOuFo1QYMC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=0-412-40680-2 |year=1993 |publisher=CRC Press   }} As such, the coordinate system is a mathematical construct, a language, that may be related to motion, but has no necessary connection to motion.

&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, an observer in an observational frame of reference can choose to employ any coordinate system (Cartesian, polar, curvilinear, generalized, …) to describe observations made from that frame of reference. A change in the choice of this coordinate system does not change an observer's state of motion, and so does not entail a change in the observer's ''observational'' frame of reference. This viewpoint can be found elsewhere as well.&lt;ref name=Johansson&gt;
{{cite book |title=Unification of Classical, Quantum and Relativistic Mechanics and of the Four Forces |author1=J X Zheng-Johansson |author2=Per-Ivar Johansson |page=13 
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1FU37uru6QC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=frame+coordinate+johansson|isbn=1-59454-260-0 
|publisher=Nova Publishers 
|year=2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Which is not to dispute that some coordinate systems may be a better choice for some observations than are others.

*Choice of what to measure and with what observational apparatus is a matter separate from the observer's state of motion and choice of coordinate system.

Here is a quotation applicable to moving observational frames &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; and various associated Euclidean three-space coordinate systems [''R'', ''R′'', ''etc.'']:&lt;ref name=Lyle &gt;{{cite book  |title=Handbook of Continuum Mechanics: General Concepts, Thermoelasticity |page= 9 |author1=Jean Salençon |author2=Stephen Lyle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3xIED8ctfUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=physical+%22frame+of+reference%22|isbn=3-540-41443-6 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|We first introduce the notion of ''reference frame'', itself related to the idea of ''observer'': the reference frame is, in some sense, the "Euclidean space carried by the observer". Let us give a more mathematical definition:… the reference frame is... the set of all points in the Euclidean space with the rigid body motion of the observer. The frame, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, is said to move with the observer.… The spatial positions of particles are labelled relative to a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; by establishing a ''coordinate system'' ''R'' with origin ''O''. The corresponding set of axes, sharing the rigid body motion of the frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, can be considered to give a physical realization of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;. In a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, coordinates are changed from ''R'' to ''R′'' by carrying out, at each instant of time, the same coordinate transformation on the components of ''intrinsic'' objects (vectors and tensors) introduced to represent physical quantities ''in this frame''.| Jean Salençon, Stephen Lyle ''Handbook of Continuum Mechanics: General Concepts, Thermoelasticity'' p. 9}}

{{Cquote|The idea of a reference frame is really quite different from that of a coordinate system.

So the ideas of a space, a time, of rest and simultaneity, go inextricably together with that of frame. However, a mere shift of origin, or a purely spatial rotation of space coordinates results in a new coordinate system.

where ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''etc.'' are the ''n'' Cartesian coordinates of the point. Given these functions,  '''coordinate surfaces''' are defined by the relations:

As is apparent from these remarks, a coordinate system is a [[Model theory|mathematical construct]], part of an [[axiomatic system]]. There is no necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion (or any other aspect of reality). However, coordinate systems can include time as a coordinate, and can be used to describe motion. Thus, [[Lorentz transformation]]s and [[Galilean transformation]]s may be viewed as [[Coordinate system#Transformations|coordinate transformation]]s.

General and specific topics of coordinate systems can be pursued following the [[#See also|See also]] links below.

===Observational frames of reference===

An '''observational frame of reference''', often referred to as a ''physical frame of reference'', a ''frame of reference'', or simply a ''frame'', is a physical concept related to an [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the observer's state of motion. Here we adopt the view expressed by Kumar and Barve: an observational frame of reference is characterized ''only by its state of motion''.&lt;ref name=Kubar&gt;See {{cite book |author1=Arvind Kumar |author2=Shrish Barve |page=115 |title=How and Why in Basic Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czlUPz38MOQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22characterized+only+by+its+state+of+motion%22+inauthor:Kumar|isbn=81-7371-420-7 |year= 2003 |publisher =Orient Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is lack of unanimity on this point. In special relativity, the distinction is sometimes made between an ''observer'' and a ''frame''. According to this view, a ''frame'' is an ''observer'' plus a coordinate lattice constructed to be an orthonormal right-handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector. See Doran.&lt;ref name=Doran&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780521715959&amp;qt=owc_search |title=Geometric Algebra for Physicists |author1=Chris Doran |author2=Anthony Lasenby |page= §5.2.2, p. 133 |isbn=978-0-521-71595-9 |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This restricted view is not used here, and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity.&lt;ref name=Moller&gt;For example, Møller states: "Instead of Cartesian coordinates we can obviously just as well employ general curvilinear coordinates for the fixation of points in physical space.…we shall now introduce general "curvilinear" coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; in four-space…." {{cite book |author=C.

|page=211 |isbn=0-8247-1749-X |year=1983 |publisher=CRC Press   }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

There are two types of observational reference frame: [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] and [[non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial]]. An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In [[special relativity]] these frames are related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which are parametrized by [[rapidity]]. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that [[Newton's first law]] holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a [[free particle]] travels in a [[straight line]] at constant [[speed]], or is at rest. These frames are related by [[Galilean transformation]]s. These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of [[Representation theory|representations]] of the [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Poincaré group]] and of the [[Representation theory of the Galilean group|Galilean group]].

In contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which [[fictitious force]]s must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the [[Coriolis force]], [[centrifugal force]], and [[gravitational force]]. (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)

===Measurement apparatus===
A further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the [[metrology|measurement apparatus]] (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see [[measurement problem]]).

In physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the [[laboratory frame]] or simply "lab frame." An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the [[center of momentum frame]] "COM frame" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.

In this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect [[metrology]] that is connected to the nature of the [[vacuum]], and uses [[atomic clocks]] that operate according to the [[standard model]] and that must be corrected for [[gravitational time dilation]].&lt;ref name= Wolfson&gt;{{cite book |author=  Richard Wolfson |title=Simply Einstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUJWKdlFKeQC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=%22gravitational+time+dilation+%22|page=216 |isbn=0-393-05154-4 |publisher=W W Norton &amp; Co. |year=2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[second]], [[meter]] and [[kilogram]]).

In fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.&lt;ref name=Rizzi&gt;See {{cite book |title=Relativity in rotating frames |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PGrlCLkkIgC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=centrifugal+%22+%22+relativity+OR+relativistic#PPA33,M1

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

=== Simple example ===
[[File:Two reference frames.PNG|thumb|320px|Figure 1: Two cars moving at different but constant velocities observed from stationary inertial frame ''S'' attached to the road and moving inertial frame ''S′'' attached to the first car.]]
Consider a situation common in everyday life. Two cars travel along a road, both moving at constant velocities. See Figure 1. At some particular moment, they are separated by 200 metres. The car in front is travelling at 22 metres per second and the car behind is travelling at 30 metres per second. If we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first, there are three obvious "frames of reference" that we could choose.

First, we could observe the two cars from the side of the road. We define our "frame of reference" ''S'' as follows. We stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us, which happens to be when they are a distance ''d'' =  200 m apart. Since neither of the cars is accelerating, we can determine their positions by the following formulas, where &lt;math&gt;x_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position in meters of car one after time ''t'' in seconds and &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position of car two after time ''t''.

:&lt;math&gt; x_1(t)= d + v_1 t = 200\ + \ 22t\ ; \quad x_2(t)=  v_2 t = 30t &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that these formulas predict at ''t'' = 0 s the first car is 200 m down the road and the second car is right beside us, as expected. We want to find the time at which &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we set &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;200 + 22 t = 30t \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;8t = 200 \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = 25 \quad \mathrm{seconds}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could choose a frame of reference ''S′'' situated in the first car. In this case, the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of {{math|1=''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 m / s}}. In order to catch up to the first car, it will take a time of {{math|1={{sfrac|''d''|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{sfrac|200|8}} s}}, that is, 25 seconds, as before. Note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference. The third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car. That example resembles the case just discussed, except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at 8 m / s.

It would have been possible to choose a rotating, accelerating frame of reference, moving in a complicated manner, but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily. It is also necessary to note that one is able to convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another. For example, suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time. If you know that this is the case, when somebody asks you what time it is, you are able to deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch in order to obtain the correct time. The measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer's frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three, when in fact it arrived at three).

===Additional example===
[[File:Wikipage pic.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Simple-minded frame-of-reference example]]
For a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers, consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a north-south street. See Figure 2. A car drives past them heading south.  For the person facing east, the car was moving towards the right.  However, for the person facing west, the car was moving toward the left.  This discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system.

For a more complex example involving observers in relative motion, consider Alfred, who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right.  In his frame of reference, Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin, the road as the x-axis and the direction in front of him as the positive y-axis.  To him, the car moves along the ''x'' axis with some [[velocity]] ''v'' in the positive x-direction. Alfred's frame of reference is considered an [[inertial frame of reference]] because he is not accelerating (ignoring effects such as Earth's rotation and gravity).

Now consider Betsy, the person driving the car. Betsy, in choosing her frame of reference, defines her location as the origin, the direction to her right as the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction in front of her as the positive ''y''-axis.  In this frame of reference, it is Betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving – for instance, as she drives past Alfred, she observes him moving with velocity ''v'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  If she is driving north, then north is the positive ''y''-direction; if she turns east, east becomes the positive ''y''-direction.

Finally, as an example of non-inertial observers, assume Candace is accelerating her car.  As she passes by him, Alfred measures her [[acceleration]] and finds it to be ''a'' in the negative x-direction.  Assuming Candace's acceleration is constant, what acceleration does Betsy measure?  If Betsy's velocity ''v'' is constant, she is in an inertial frame of reference, and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference, ''a'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  However, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction (in other words, slowing down), she will find Candace's acceleration to be ''a′'' = ''a'' − ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction - a smaller value than Alfred has measured.  Similarly, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the positive y-direction (speeding up), she will observe Candace's acceleration as ''a′'' = ''a'' + ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction – a larger value than Alfred's measurement.

Frames of reference are especially important in [[special relativity]], because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light, then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference.

===Remarks===
{{see also|Special theory of relativity|General theory of relativity}}
It is important to note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames of reference. Newton, for instance, employed universal time, as explained by the following example. Suppose that you own two clocks, which both tick at exactly the same rate. You synchronize them so that they both display exactly the same time. The two clocks are now separated and one clock is on a fast moving train, traveling at constant velocity towards the other. According to Newton, these two clocks will still tick at the same rate and will both show the same time. Newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another. That is, there exists a "universal" time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity. This concept of time and simultaneity was later generalized by Einstein in his [[special theory of relativity]] (1905) where he developed transformations between inertial frames of reference based upon the universal nature of physical laws and their economy of expression ([[Lorentz transformations]]).

It is also important to note that the definition of inertial reference frame can be extended beyond three-dimensional Euclidean space. Newton's assumed a Euclidean space, but [[general relativity]] uses a more general geometry. As an example of why this is important, let us consider the [[geometry]] of an ellipsoid. In this geometry, a "free" particle is defined as one at rest or traveling at constant speed on a [[geodesic]] path. Two free particles may begin at the same point on the surface, traveling with the same constant speed in different directions. After a length of time, the two particles collide at the opposite side of the ellipsoid. Both "free" particles traveled with a constant speed, satisfying the definition that  no forces were acting. No acceleration occurred and so Newton's first law held true. This means that the particles were in inertial frames of reference. Since no forces were acting, it was the geometry of the situation which caused the two particles to meet each other again. In a similar way, it is now common to describe&lt;ref name="caveatondescription"&gt;That is, both descriptions are equivalent and can be used as needed.  This equivalence does not hold outside of general relativity, e.g., in [[entropic gravity]].&lt;/ref&gt; that we exist in a four-dimensional geometry known as [[spacetime]]. In this picture, the curvature of this 4D space is responsible for the way in which two bodies with mass are drawn together even if no forces are acting. This curvature of spacetime replaces the force known as gravity in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.

==Non-inertial frames==
{{main|Fictitious force|Non-inertial frame|Rotating frame of reference}}
Here the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered. The basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces, as described below.

An accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the "primed" frame, and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes, e.g. ''x′'', ''y′'', ''a′''.

The vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as  '''R'''.  Given a point of interest that exists in both frames, the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called '''r''', and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called '''r′'''.
From the geometry of the situation, we get
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf R + \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the first and second derivatives of this with respect to time, we obtain
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = \mathbf V + \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf A + \mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;
where '''V''' and '''A''' are the velocity and acceleration of the accelerated system with respect to the inertial system  and '''v''' and '''a''' are the velocity and acceleration of the point of interest with respect to the inertial frame.

These equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems; for example, we can now write [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s second law|Newton's second law]] as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F = m\mathbf a = m\mathbf A + m\mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;

When there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia. If an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking, the batteries are recharged, illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia. However, the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration), for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force. Seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal]] direction, or in a direction orthogonal to an object's motion, the [[Coriolis effect]]).

A common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried). This arrangement leads to the equation (see [[Fictitious force]] for a derivation):

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf a' + \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' + 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' + \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') + \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

or, to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a' = \mathbf a - \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' - 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' - \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') - \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying through by the mass ''m'' gives
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F' = \mathbf F_\mathrm{physical} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{centripetal} - m\mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} = -m\dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt; ([[Euler force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} = -2m\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;  ([[Coriolis force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{centrifugal} = -m\boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r')=m(\omega^2 \mathbf r'- (\boldsymbol\omega \cdot \mathbf r')\boldsymbol\omega) &lt;/math&gt;  ([[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]])

The '''GPS-aided GEO augmented navigation''' ('''GAGAN''') is an implementation of a regional [[satellite-based augmentation system]] (SBAS) by the [[Government of India|Indian government]]. It is a system to improve the accuracy of a [[Global navigation satellite system|GNSS receiver]] by providing reference signals.&lt;ref name="ASM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asmmag.com/news/india-approves-gagan-system |title=India Approves Gagan System |date=15 September 2008 |work=Magazine article |publisher=Asian Surveying and Mapping |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519215721/http://www.asmmag.com/news/india-approves-gagan-system |archivedate=19 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Airports Authority of India|AAI]]'s efforts towards implementation of operational SBAS can be viewed as the first step towards introduction of modern [[Communication, navigation and surveillance]]/[[Air Traffic Management]] system over Indian airspace.&lt;ref name="mycoordinates.org"&gt;[http://www.mycoordinates.org/gagan-update-arjunsingh-mar-06.php GAGAN Update Dr. Arjin Singh, Additional GM, Directorate of Global Navigation System, Airport Authority of India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828035632/http://www.mycoordinates.org/gagan-update-arjunsingh-mar-06.php |date=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has established 15 Indian reference stations, 3 Indian navigation land uplink stations, 3 Indian mission control centers, and installation of all associated software and communication links.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gagan-system-ready-for-operations/article5565700.ece&lt;/ref&gt; It will be able to help pilots to navigate in the Indian airspace by an accuracy of 3 m. This will be helpful for landing aircraft in marginal weather and difficult approaches like [[Mangalore Airport (India)|Mangalore]] and [[Kushok Bakula Rimpochhe Airport|Leh]] airports.

==Implementation==
The {{INRConvert|7.74|b|0}} project was created in three phases through 2008 by the [[Airports Authority of India|Airport Authority of India]] with the help of the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]]'s (ISRO) technology and space support.&lt;ref name=Isro&gt;{{cite news|title=Satellite Navigation – GAGAN|url=http://www.isro.org/scripts/futureprogramme.aspx#Satellite|accessdate=13 June 2012|newspaper=ISRO website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to provide navigation system for all phases of flight over the Indian airspace and in the adjoining area. It is applicable to safety-to-life operations, and meets the performance requirements of international civil aviation regulatory bodies.

The space component  became  available after the launch of the GAGAN payload on the GSAT-8 communication satellite, which was successfully launched. This payload was also part of the GSAT-4 satellite that was lost when the geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) failed during launch in April 2010. A final system acceptance test was conducted during June 2012 followed by system certification during July 2013.&lt;ref name=Isro/&gt;

== Technology ==

To begin implementing a satellite-based augmentation system over the Indian airspace, [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] ([[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]]) codes for L1 frequency and L5 frequency were obtained from the [[United States Air Force]] and [[United States|U.S]] [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] on November 2001 and March 2005.&lt;ref name="mycoordinates.org" /&gt; The system will use eight reference stations located in [[Delhi]], [[Guwahati]], [[Kolkata]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Bangalore]], [[Jammu]] and [[Port Blair]], and a master control center at [[Bangalore]]. US defense contractor [[Raytheon]] has stated they will bid to build the system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-defence.com/reports-3966 Raytheon to bid for geosynchronous augmented navigation system (GAGAN) Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology demonstration ==

A national plan for satellite navigation including implementation of technology demonstration system (TDS) over the Indian air space as a proof of concept had been prepared jointly by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and ISRO. TDS was successfully completed during 2007 by installing eight Indian Reference Stations (INRESs) at eight Indian airports and linked to the Master Control Center (MCC) located near Bangalore. Preliminary system acceptance testing has been successfully completed in December 2010.&lt;ref name=Isro/&gt; The [[ground segment]] for GAGAN, which has been put up by the Raytheon, has 15 reference stations scattered across the country. Two mission control centres, along with associated uplink stations, have been set up at Kundalahalli in Bangalore. One more control centre and uplink station are to come up at Delhi. As a part of the programme, a network of 18 total electron content (TEC) monitoring stations were installed at various locations in India to study and analyse the behaviour of the ionosphere over the Indian region.

GAGAN's TDS signal in space provides a three-metre accuracy as against the requirement of 7.6 metres. Flight inspection of GAGAN signal is being carried out at [[Kozhikode]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Nagpur]] and [[Bangalore]] airports and the results have been satisfactory so far.

=== Study of Ionosphere ===
One essential component of the GAGAN project is the study of the ionospheric behaviour over the Indian region. This has been specially taken up in view of the uncertain nature of the behaviour of the ionosphere in the region. The study will lead to the optimisation of the algorithms for the ionospheric corrections in the region.

To study the ionospheric behaviour more effectively over entire Indian airspace, Indian universities and R&amp;D labs, which are involved in the development of regional based ionotropic model for GAGAN, have suggested nine more TEC stations.&lt;ref name="mycoordinates.org"/&gt;

== Technology Integration ==

GAGAN after its final operational phase completion, will be compatible with other SBAS systems such as the [[wide-area augmentation system]] (WAAS), the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS) and the [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System]] (MSAS) and will provide seamless air navigation service across regional boundaries. While the ground segment consists of eight reference stations and a master control center, which will have sub systems such as data communication network, [[SBAS]] correction and verification system, operations and maintenance system, performance monitoring display and payload simulator, Indian land uplinking stations will have dish antenna assembly. The space segment will consist of one geo-navigation transponder.

== Effective flight-management system ==

A flight-management system based on GAGAN will then be poised to save operators time and money by managing climb, descent and engine performance profiles. The FMS will improve the efficiency and flexibility by increasing the use of operator-preferred trajectories.
It will improve airport and airspace access in all weather conditions, and the ability to meet the environmental and obstacle clearance constraints. It will also enhance reliability and reduce delays by defining more precise terminal area procedures that feature parallel routes and environmentally optimised airspace corridors.

* GAGAN will increase safety by using a three-dimensional approach operation with course guidance to the runway, which will reduce the risk of controlled flight into terrain i.e., an accident whereby an airworthy aircraft, under pilot control, inadvertently flies into terrain, an obstacle, or water.
* GAGAN will also offer high position accuracies over a wide geographical area like the Indian airspace. These positions accuracies will be simultaneously available to 80 civilian and more than 200 non-civilian airports and airfields and will facilitate an increase in the number of airports to 500 as planned. These position accuracies can be further enhanced with ground-based, augmentation system.

== Developments ==

The first GAGAN transmitter was integrated into the [[GSAT-4]] [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] satellite, and had a goal of being operational in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-defence.com/reports/2239 ISRO, Raytheon complete tests for GAGAN satellite navigational system.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205075702/http://www.india-defence.com/reports/2239 |date=5 December 2006 }} India Defense Website. 20 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.N.

In 2009, Raytheon had won an 82 million dollar contract. It was mainly dedicated to modernise Indian air navigation system.&lt;ref name="GovCon"/&gt; The vice president of Command &amp; Control Systems, Raytheon Network Centric Systems, Andy Zogg commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;GAGAN will be the world's most advanced air navigation system and further reinforces India's leadership in the forefront of air navigation. GAGAN will greatly improve safety, reduce congestion and enhance communications to meet India's growing air traffic management needs&lt;ref name="GovCon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Raytheon Wins $82M Air Navigation Contract From India|url=http://www.govconwire.com/2009/07/raytheon-wins-82m-air-navigation-contract-from-india/|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=GovCon Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2012, the [[DRDO|Defence Research and Development Organisation]] received a "miniaturised version" of the device with all the features from [[global positioning systems]] (GPS) and [[global navigation satellite systems]] (GNSS). The module weighing just 17 gm, can be used in multiple platforms ranging from aircraft (e.g. winged or rotor-craft) to small boats, ships. Reportedly, it can also assist "survey applications". It is a cost-efficient device and can be of "tremendous" civilian use. The navigation output is composed of GPS, GLONASS and GPS+GLONASS position, speed and time data. According to a statement released by the DRDO, G3oM is a state-of-the-art technology receiver, integrating Indian GAGAN as well as both global positioning system and GLONASS systems.&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;

According to Deccan chronicle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[G. Satheesh Reddy]], associate director of the city-based Research Centre Imarat, said the product is bringing about a quantum leap in the area of GNSS technology and has paved the way for highly miniaturised GNSS systems for the future.&lt;ref name=DC&gt;[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/17-gm-device-guide-missiles-968 17-gm device to guide missiles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905014057/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/17-gm-device-guide-missiles-968 |date=5 September 2012 }} Deccan Chronicle.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 30 December 2012, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), India provisionally certified the GPS-aided geo-augmented navigation (GAGAN) system to RNP0.1 (Required Navigation Performance, 0.1 Nautical Mile) service level. The certification enabled aircraft fitted with SBAS equipment to use GAGAN signal in space for navigation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isro.org/pressrelease/scripts/pressreleasein.aspx?Jan03_2014 | title=GAGAN System Certified for RNP0.1 Operations | date=3 January 2014 | accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellites===

'''GSAT-8''' is an Indian geostationary satellites, which was successfully launched using [[Ariane 5]] on 21 May 2011 and is positioned in geosynchronous orbit at 55 degrees E longitude.

'''GSAT-10''' is envisaged to augment the growing need of Ku and C-band transponders and carries 12 Ku Band, 12 C Band and 12 Extended C Band transponders and a GAGAN payload. The spacecraft employs the standard I-3K structure with power handling capability of around 6&amp;nbsp;kW with a lift off mass of 3400&amp;nbsp;kg. GSAT-10 was successfully launched by [[Ariane 5]] on 29 September 2012.&lt;ref name=Isro/&gt;

'''GSAT-15''' carries 24 Ku band transponders with India coverage beam and a GAGAN payload. was successfully launched on 10 November 2015, 21:34:07 UTC, completing the constellation.

===Indian regional navigation satellite system===
{{main|Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System}}
The Indian government has stated that it intends to use the experience of creating the GAGAN system to enable the creation of an autonomous regional navigation system called the '''I'''ndian '''R'''egional '''N'''avigation '''S'''atellite '''S'''ystem [[IRNSS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isro.org/newsletters/spaceindia/aprsep2006/Satnavindustry.htm SATNAV Industry Meet 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331145825/http://www.isro.org/newsletters/spaceindia/aprsep2006/Satnavindustry.htm |date=31 March 2007 }}. ISRO Space India Newsletter. April – September 2006 Issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

IRNSS-1
Indian regional navigational satellite system (IRNSS)-1, the first of the seven satellites of the [[IRNSS]] constellation, carries a navigation payload and a C-band ranging transponder. The spacecraft employs an optimised I-1K structure with a power handling capability of around 1660W and a lift off mass of 1425&amp;nbsp;kg, and is designed for a nominal mission life of 10 years. The first satellite of IRNSS constellation was launched onboard PSLV (C22) on 1 July 2012. While the full constellation was planned to be realised during 2014 time frame, launch of subsequent satellites got delayed.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Currently all 7 satellites are in orbit but in 2017 it was announced that all three&amp;nbsp;[[rubidium]]&amp;nbsp;[[atomic clock]]s&amp;nbsp;on board&amp;nbsp;[[IRNSS-1A]]&amp;nbsp;had failed, mirroring similar failures in the&amp;nbsp;[[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] constellation. The first failure occurred in July 2016, following which two other clocks also failed. This rendered the satellite somewhat redundant and required replacement. Although the satellite still performs other functions, the data is coarse, and thus cannot be used for accurate measurements.&amp;nbsp;ISRO plans to replace it with IRNSS-1H in July or August 2017.

Two more clocks in the navigational system had started showing signs of abnormality, thereby taking the total number of failed clocks to five.

As a precaution to extend the operational life of navigation satellite, ISRO is running only one rubidium atomic clock instead of two in the remaining six satellites.&amp;nbsp;Each satellite has three clocks, therefore a total of 27 clocks for all satellites in the system (including standby satellites). The clocks of both IRNSS and GALILEO were supplied by SpectraTime. ISRO replaced the atomic clocks in two standby NavIC satellites.&amp;nbsp;The setback comes at a time when IRNSS is yet to start commercial operations.

== Applications ==

Karnataka Forest Department has used GAGAN to build a new, accurate and publicly available satellite based database of its forestlands. This is a followup to the Supreme Court directive to states to update and put up their respective forest maps. The geospatial database of forestlands pilot has used data from the Cartosat-2 satellite. The maps are meant to rid authorities of ambiguities related to forest boundaries and give clarity to forest administrators, revenue officials as also the public, according to R.K. Srivastava, chief conservator of forests (headquarters).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gagan-kicks-off-new-forest-database/article7118060.ece?w=city GAGAN kicks off new forest database].

Various Indian manufactured missiles including the [[BrahMos]] will use GAGAN for guidance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/Desi-G3OM-Makes-BrahMos-Smarter/2014/07/09/article2320976.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GeoNames''' is a [[geographical database]] available and accessible through various [[web service]]s, under a [[Creative Commons]] attribution license.

==Database and web services==
The GeoNames database contains over 25,000,000 [[toponymy|geographical names]] corresponding to over 11,800,000 unique features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geonames.org |title=GeoNames web site |publisher=Geonames.org |date= |accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; All features are categorized into one of nine feature classes and further subcategorized into one of 645 feature codes. Beyond names of places in various languages, data stored include [[latitude]], [[longitude]], [[elevation]], population, administrative subdivision and [[postal code]]s. All [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] use the World [[Geodetic system|Geodetic]] System 1984 ([[WGS84]]).

Those data are accessible free of charge through a number of Web services and a daily database export.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programmableweb.com/api/geonames |title=GeoNames API |publisher=ProgrammableWeb |date= |accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wiki interface==
The core of GeoNames database is provided by official public sources, the quality of which may vary. Through a [[wiki]] interface, users are invited to manually edit and improve the database by adding or correcting names, move existing features, add new features, etc.&lt;ref name="gn-help"&gt;{{cite web |title=How can I help ? |url=http://forum.geonames.org/gforum/posts/list/25.page |website=GeoNames Forum |publisher=GeoNames |accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantic Web integration==
Each GeoNames feature is represented as a [[web resource]] identified by a stable [[URI]]. This URI provides access, through [[content negotiation]], either to the HTML wiki page, or to a [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] description of the feature, using elements of the GeoNames [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html |title=GeoNames ontology |publisher=Geonames.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ontology describes the GeoNames features properties using the [[Web Ontology Language]], the feature classes and codes being described in the [[SKOS]] language.
Through Wikipedia articles URL linked in the RDF descriptions, GeoNames data are linked to [[DBpedia]] data and other RDF [[Linked Data]].

==Accuracy and improvements==
As in other [[crowdsourcing]] schemes, GeoNames edit interface allows everyone to sign in and edit the database, hence false information can be entered and such information can remain undetected especially for places that are not accessed frequently. {{harvtxt|Ahlers|2013}} studies these inaccuracies and classifies them into loss in the granularity of coordinates (e.g., due to truncation and low-resolution geocoding in some cases), wrong feature codes, near-identical places, and the placement of places outside their designated countries.
Manually correcting these inaccuracies is both tedious and error prone (due to the database size) and may require experts.

The literature provides very few works on automatically resolving them either.
{{harvtxt|Singh|Rafiei|2018}} study the problem of automatically detecting the scope of locations in a geographical database and its applications in identifying inconsistencies and improving the quality of the database.
Computing the boundary information can help detect inconsistencies such as near-identical places and the placement of locations such as cities under wrong parents such as provinces or countries. Singh and Rafiei show that the boundary information derived in their work can move more than 20% of locations in GeoNames to better positions in the spatial hierarchy and the  accuracy of those moves is over 90%.

A '''geodetic datum''' or '''geodetic system''' is a [[coordinate system]], and a set of reference points, used to locate places on the [[Earth]] (or similar objects).  An approximate definition of [[sea level]] is the datum [[World Geodetic System|WGS 84]], an [[reference ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], whereas a more accurate definition is Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008), using at least 2,159 [[spherical harmonics]]. Other datums are defined for other areas or at other times; [[ED50]] was defined in 1950 over Europe and differs from WGS 84 by a few hundred meters depending on where in Europe you look. 
[[Mars]] has no [[oceans]] and so no sea level, but at least two [[Geography of Mars#Zero elevation|martian datums]] have been used to locate places there.

Datums are used in [[geodesy]], [[navigation]], and [[surveying]] by [[cartographer]]s and [[satellite navigation system]]s to translate positions indicated on [[map]]s (paper or digital) to their real position on [[Earth]]. Each starts with an [[ellipsoid]] (stretched sphere), and then defines [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[altitude]] coordinates.  One or more locations on the Earth's surface are chosen as anchor "base-points".

The difference in co-ordinates between datums is commonly referred to as ''datum shift''. The datum shift between two particular datums can vary from one place to another within one country or region, and can be anything from zero to hundreds of meters (or several kilometers for some remote islands). The [[North Pole]], [[South Pole]] and [[Equator]] will be in different positions on different datums, so [[True North]] will be slightly different. Different datums use different interpolations for the precise shape and size of the Earth ([[reference ellipsoid]]s).

Because the Earth is an imperfect ellipsoid, localised datums can give a more accurate representation of the area of coverage than WGS 84. [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|OSGB36]], for example, is a better approximation to the [[geoid]] covering the British Isles than the global WGS 84 ellipsoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/geoid.htm|title=Geoid—Help {{!}} ArcGIS for Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202054013/http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/geoid.htm|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the benefits of a global system outweigh the greater accuracy, the global WGS 84 datum is becoming increasingly adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/datums.htm|title=Datums—Help {{!}} ArcGIS for Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202052131/http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/datums.htm|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizontal datums are used for describing a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface, in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or another coordinate system. Vertical datums  measure elevations or depths.

== Definition ==

In [[surveying]] and [[geodesy]], a ''datum'' is a reference system or an approximation of the Earth's surface against which positional measurements are made for computing locations. Horizontal datums are used for describing a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface, in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or another coordinate system. Vertical datums are used to measure elevations or underwater depths.

=== Horizontal datum ===
The horizontal datum is the model used to measure positions on the Earth. A specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates, depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of local horizontal datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The [[WGS 84]] datum, which is almost identical to the [[NAD83]] datum used in North America and the [[ETRS89]] datum used in Europe, is a common standard datum.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

For example, in Sydney there is a 200 metres (700&amp;nbsp;feet) difference between GPS coordinates configured in GDA (based on global standard WGS 84) and AGD (used for most local maps), which is an unacceptably large error for some applications, such as [[surveying]] or site location for [[scuba diving]].&lt;ref&gt;McFadyen, [http://www.michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=80 GPS and Diving] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819064902/http://michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=80 |date=2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertical datum ===
{{further|Chart datum}}

[[File:Vertical references in Europe.svg|thumbnail|Vertical datums in Europe]]
A vertical datum is used as a reference point for [[elevation]]s of surfaces and features on the Earth including terrain, bathymetry, water levels, and man-made structures. Vertical datums are either: tidal, based on [[sea level]]s; gravimetric, based on a [[geoid]]; or geodetic, based on the same ellipsoid models of the Earth used for computing horizontal datums.

In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above [[sea level]], although what “sea level” actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, [[tide]]s, topography, and even differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of mountains etc.

For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is [[mean sea level]] (MSL).  This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard “sea level” for all mapping and surveying in that country.  (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at [[Newlyn]] in [[Cornwall]] between 1915 and 1921).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} However, zero elevation as defined by one country is not the same as zero elevation defined by another (because MSL is not the same everywhere), which is why locally defined vertical datums differ from one another.

A different principle is used when choosing a datum for [[nautical charts]].  For safety reasons, a mariner must be able to know the minimum depth of water that could occur at any point.  For this reason, depths and tides on a nautical chart are measured relative to [[chart datum]], which is defined to be a level below which tide rarely falls.  Exactly how this is chosen depends on the tidal regime in the area being charted and on the policy of the hydrographic office producing the chart in question; a typical definition is Lowest Astronomical Tide (the lowest tide predictable from the effects of gravity), or Mean Lower Low Water (the average lowest tide of each day), although MSL is sometimes used in waters with very low tidal ranges.

Conversely, if a ship is to safely pass under a low bridge or overhead power cable, the mariner must know the minimum clearance between the masthead and the obstruction, which will occur at high tide.  Consequently, bridge clearances etc. are given relative to a datum based on high tide, such as Highest Astronomical Tide or Mean High Water Springs.

Sea level does not remain constant throughout [[geological time]], and so tidal datums are less useful when studying very long-term processes. In some situations sea level does not apply at all — for instance for [[Geography of Mars|mapping Mars' surface]] — forcing the use of a different "zero elevation", such as mean radius.

A geodetic vertical datum takes some specific zero point, and computes elevations based on the geodetic model being used, without further reference to sea levels. Usually, the starting reference point is a tide gauge, so at that point the geodetic and tidal datums might match, but due to sea level variations, the two scales may not match elsewhere.  An example of a gravity-based geodetic datum is [[NAVD88]], used in North America, which is referenced to a point in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].  Ellipsoid-based datums such as [[WGS 84]], [[GRS80]] or [[NAD83]] use a theoretical surface that may differ significantly from the [[geoid]].

== Geodetic coordinates ==
{{Main|Reference ellipsoid#Coordinates}}
[[File:Geocentric vs geodetic latitude.svg|thumb|right|300px|The same position on a [[spheroid]] has a different angle for latitude depending on whether the angle is measured from the normal line segment ''CP'' of the [[ellipsoid]] (angle ''α'') or the line segment ''AP'' from the center (angle ''β''). Note that the "[[flatness]]" of the spheroid (orange) in the image is greater than that of the Earth; as a result, the corresponding difference between the "geodetic" and "geocentric" latitudes is also exaggerated.]]

In geodetic coordinates, the Earth's surface is approximated by an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and locations near the surface are described in terms of [[latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), [[longitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;), and height (&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref group="footnotes"&gt;About the right/left-handed order of the coordinates, i.e., &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\phi, \lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, see [[Spherical coordinate system#Conventions]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geodetic versus geocentric latitude ===
Geodetic [[latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), resp. [[altitude]], is different from geocentric latitude (&lt;math&gt;\phi'&lt;/math&gt;), resp. altitude. Geodetic latitude is determined by the angle between the [[equator]]ial plane and [[surface normal|normal]] to the ellipsoid, whereas geocentric latitude is determined by the angle between the equatorial plane and line joining the point to the centre of the ellipsoid (see figure). Unless otherwise specified, latitude is geodetic latitude.

== Earth reference ellipsoid ==

=== Defining and derived parameters ===
{{Main|Reference ellipsoid#Ellipsoid parameters}}

The ellipsoid is completely parameterised by the semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the flattening &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

From &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; it is possible to derive the semi-minor axis &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, first eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and second eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e'&lt;/math&gt; of the ellipsoid

== Conversion calculations ==
{{further|Geographic coordinate conversion}}

Datum conversion is the process of converting the coordinates of a point from one datum system to another. Datum conversion may frequently be accompanied by a change of [[Map projection|grid projection]].

== Reference datums ==
{{see also|Reference ellipsoid}}

A reference datum is a known and constant surface which is used to describe the location of unknown points on the Earth. Since reference datums can have different radii and different center points, a specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of locally developed reference datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The most common reference Datums in use in [[North America]] are NAD27, NAD83, and [[WGS 84]].

The [[North American Datum]] of 1927 (NAD 27) is "the horizontal control datum for the United States that was defined by a location and azimuth on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, with origin at (the survey station) [[Meades Ranch Triangulation Station|Meades Ranch (Kansas)]]." ... The geoidal height at Meades Ranch was assumed to be zero, as sufficient gravity data was not available, and this was needed to relate surface measurements to the datum. "Geodetic positions on the North American Datum of 1927 were derived from the (coordinates of and an azimuth at Meades Ranch) through a readjustment of the triangulation of the entire network in which Laplace azimuths were introduced, and the Bowie method was used." (http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatDatum )  NAD27 is a local referencing system covering North America.

The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) is "The horizontal control datum for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America, based on a geocentric origin and the Geodetic Reference System 1980 ([[GRS80]]). "This datum, designated as NAD 83 ...is based on the adjustment of 250,000 points including 600 satellite Doppler stations which constrain the system to a geocentric origin." NAD83 may be considered a local referencing system.

WGS 84 is the [[World Geodetic System]] of 1984. It is the reference frame used by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) and is defined by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) (formerly the Defense Mapping Agency, then the National Imagery and Mapping Agency). WGS 84 is used by DoD for all its mapping, charting, surveying, and navigation needs, including its [[GPS]] "broadcast" and "precise" orbits. WGS 84 was defined in January 1987 using Doppler satellite surveying techniques. It was used as the reference frame for broadcast GPS Ephemerides (orbits) beginning January 23, 1987. At 0000 GMT January 2, 1994, WGS 84 was upgraded in accuracy using GPS measurements. The formal name then became WGS 84 (G730), since the upgrade date coincided with the start of GPS Week 730. It became the reference frame for broadcast orbits on June 28, 1994. At 0000 GMT September 30, 1996 (the start of GPS Week 873), WGS 84 was redefined again and was more closely aligned with [[International Earth Rotation Service]] (IERS) frame [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRF]] 94. It was then formally called WGS 84 (G873). WGS 84 (G873) was adopted as the reference frame for broadcast orbits on January 29, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84|title=National Geodetic Survey - Frequently Asked Questions FAQ|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Geodetic|last=Survey|date=|website=www.ngs.noaa.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019024226/https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84|archivedate=2011-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another update brought it to WGS84(G1674).

The WGS 84 datum, within two meters of the NAD83 datum used in North America, is the only world referencing system in place today. WGS 84 is the default standard datum for coordinates stored in recreational and commercial GPS units.

Users of GPS are cautioned that they must always check the datum of the maps they are using. To correctly enter, display, and to store map related map coordinates, the datum of the map must be entered into the GPS map datum field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12569">'''Geovisualization''' or '''Geovisualisation''', short for ''Geographic Visualization'', refers to a set of tools and techniques supporting the analysis of [[geospatial data]] through the use of [[interactive visualization]].

Like the related fields of [[scientific visualization]]&lt;ref name= "ME97"&gt;MacEachren, A.M. and Kraak, M.J. 1997 Exploratory cartographic visualization: advancing the agenda. Computers &amp; Geosciences, 23(4), pp. 335-343.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[information visualization]] &lt;ref name= "Card99"&gt;[[Stuart K. Card]], Mackinlay, J.D., and Shneidermann, B. 1999. Reading in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think. San Francisco: Morgan Kaumann Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  geovisualization emphasizes knowledge construction over knowledge storage or information transmission.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt; To do this, geovisualization communicates geospatial information in ways that, when combined with human understanding, allow for data exploration and decision-making processes.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang2005"&gt;Jiang, B., and Li, Z. 2005. Editorial: Geovisualization: Design, Enhanced Visual Tools and Applications. The Cartographic Journal, 42(1), pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "ME04"&gt;[[Alan MacEachren|MacEachren, A.M.]] 2004. Geovisualization for knowledge construction and decision support. IEEE computer graphics and applications, 24(1), pp.13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional, static maps have a limited exploratory capability; the graphical representations are inextricably linked to the geographical information beneath. [[GIS]] and geovisualization allow for more interactive maps; including the ability to explore different layers of the map, to zoom in or out, and to change the visual appearance of the map, usually on a computer display.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"&gt;Jiang, B., Huang, B., and Vasek, V. 2003. Geovisualisation for Planning Support Systems. In Planning Support Systems in Practice, Geertman, S., and Stillwell, J. (Eds.). Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Geovisualization represents a set of cartographic technologies and practices that take advantage of the ability of modern microprocessors to render changes to a map in real time, allowing users to adjust the mapped data on the fly.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;

==History==
The term visualization is first mentioned in the cartographic literature at least as early as 1953, in an article by [[University of Chicago]] geographer Allen K. Philbrick. New developments in the field of computer science prompted the [[National Science Foundation]] to redefine the term in a 1987 report which placed visualization at the convergence of computer graphics, image processing, computer vision, computer-aided design, signal processing, and user interface studies &lt;ref&gt;McCormick, B.H., DeFanti, T.A., and Brown, M.D. (Eds.). 1987. Visualization in Scientific Computing. Computer Graphics, 21(6). p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasized both the knowledge creation and hypothesis generation aspects of scientific visualization.&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt;

Geovisualization developed as a field of research in the early 1980s, based largely on the work of French graphic theorist [[Jacques Bertin]].&lt;ref name= "ME04"/&gt; Bertin’s work on cartographic design and information visualization share with the National Science Foundation report a focus on the potential for the use of “dynamic visual displays as prompts for scientific insight and on the methods through which dynamic visual displays might leverage perceptual cognitive processes to facilitate scientific thinking”.&lt;ref name= "ME04"/&gt;

Geovisualization has continued to grow as a subject of practice and research. The [[International Cartographic Association]] (ICA) established a Commission on Visualization &amp; Virtual Environments in 1995.

==Related Fields==
Geovisualization is closely related to other visualization fields, such as [[scientific visualization]]&lt;ref name= "ME97"/&gt; and [[information visualization]].&lt;ref name= "Card99"/&gt; Owing to its roots in [[cartography]], geovisualization contributes to these other fields by way of the map metaphor, which “has been widely used to visualize non-geographic information in the domains of information visualization and [[domain knowledge]] visualization."&lt;ref name="Jiang2005"/&gt;  It is also related to [[UrbanSim|urban simulation]].

==Practical Applications==
Geovisualization has made inroads in a diverse set of real-world situations calling for the decision-making and knowledge creation processes it can provide. The following list provides a summary of some of these applications as they are discussed in the geovisualization literature.
E

=== Wildland fire fighting ===
Firefighters have been using sandbox environments to rapidly and physically model topography and fire for wildfire incident command strategic planning. The SimTable is a 3D interactive fire simulator, bringing sandtable exercises to life. The SimTable uses advanced computer simulations to model fires in any area, including local neighborhoods, utilizing actual slope, terrain, wind speed/direction, vegetation, and other factors. SimTable Models were used in Arizona's largest fire on record, the [[Wallow Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kob.com/article/stories/S2149915.shtml?cat=0&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forestry ===
Geovisualizers, working with European foresters, used CommonGIS and Visualization Toolkit ([[VTK]]) to visualize a large set of spatio-temporal data related to European forests, allowing the data to be explored by non-experts over the Internet. The report summarizing this effort “uncovers a range of fundamental issues relevant to the broad field of geovisualization and information visualization research”.&lt;ref name= "GA07"&gt;Andrienko, G., Andrienko, N., Jankowski, P, Keim, D., Kraak, M.-J., MacEachren, A.M., and Wrobel, S. 2007. Geovisual analytics for spatial decision support: Setting the research agenda. International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 21(8), pp. 839-857.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research team cited the two major problems as the inability of the geovisualizers to convince the foresters of the efficacy of geovisualization in their work and the foresters’ misgivings over the dataset’s accessibility to non-experts engaging in “uncontrolled exploration”. While the geovisualizers focused on the ability of geovisualization to aid in knowledge construction, the foresters preferred the information-communication role of more traditional forms of cartographic representation.&lt;ref name= "GA07"/&gt;

===Archaeology===
Geovisualization provides archaeologists with a potential technique for mapping unearthed archaeological environments  as well as for accessing and exploring archaeological data in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Watters, M. 2005. Geovisualization: an Example from the Catholme Ceremonial Complex. Archaeological Prospection, 13, pp. 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications of geovisualization for archaeology are not limited to advances in archaeological theory and exploration but also include the development of new, collaborative relationships between archaeologists and computer scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Watters, M. 2005. Review of Exploring Geovisualization , Dykes, J., MacEachren, A.M., and Kraak, M.J. (Eds.). Amsterdam: Elsevier Science, 2004. In Archaeological Prospection, 12, pp. 265-266.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Studies===
Geovisualization tools provide multiple stakeholders with the ability to make balanced environmental decisions by taking into account “the complex interacting factors that should be taken into account when studying environmental changes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gasco|first=Luis|last2=Asensio|first2=Cesar|last3=de Arcas|first3=Guillermo|date=2017-05-15|title=Communicating airport noise emission data to the general public|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717303042|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=586|pages=836–848|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.02.063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geovisualization users can use a [[georeference]]d model to explore a complex set of environmental data, interrogating a number of scenarios or policy options to determine a best fit.&lt;ref&gt;Danada, J., Dias, E., Romao, T., Correia, N., Trabuco, A., Santos, C., Serpa, J., Costa, M., Camara, A. 2005. Mobile Environmental Visualization. The Cartographic Journal, 42(1), pp. 61-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban Planning===
Both planners and the general public can use geovisualization to explore real-world environments and model ‘what if’ scenarios based on spatio-temporal data. While geovisualization in the preceding fields may be divided into two separate domains—the private domain, in which professionals use geovisualization to explore data and generate hypotheses, and the public domain, in which these professionals present their “visual thinking” to the general public&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt;—planning relies more heavily than many other fields on collaboration between the general public and professionals.

Planners use geovisualization as a tool for modeling the environmental interests and policy concerns of the general public. Jiang et al.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt; mention two examples, in which “3D photorealistic representations are used to show urban redevelopment [and] dynamic computer simulations are used to show possible pollution diffusion over the next few years.” The widespread use of the Internet by the general public has implications for these collaborative planning efforts, leading to increased participation by the public while decreasing the amount of time it takes to debate more controversial planning decisions.&lt;ref name= "Jiang03"/&gt;

The '''Hellenic Military Geographical Service''' or '''HMGS''' ({{lang-el|Γεωγραφική Υπηρεσία Στρατού}} or Γ.Υ.Σ.), is the [[Hellenic Army|Greek military]] mapping agency.

==History==
Established in 1889 as the “Geodetic Mission” with the purpose of compiling the “Topographic and Cadastral Map of the Country”, the service acquired its current name in 1926. Today it supports both the [[Greek Army]] and the general public with cartographic products.&lt;ref&gt;a brief history of GYS can be found in the Service's website (in Greek/English), http://web.gys.gr/portal/page?_pageid=33,36335&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1966 until the 1980s, the service housed the [[Armed Forces Information Service]], Greece's second state-run broadcaster alongside the [[National Radio Foundation]].

==Maps==

===City plans===

HMGS supplies City Plans of scales 1:5.000, 1:10.000 and 1:25.000 in Greek and Latin series

*1:5.000 scale: covers 20 cities in [[Greece]]
*1:10.000 scale: covers 16 cities in [[Greece]]

===Topographic maps===

HMGS produces and supplies topographic maps of various scales that cover the whole country and occasionally parts of neighbouring countries. It should be emphasised that not all maps noted below are available to public, since part of them is confidential and available only upon approval of HMGS. Although not a state monopoly and not very famous among hikers, certainly HMGS maps have a much wider coverage in small scales than commercial leisure maps. The maps used the [[Hellenic Geodetic Reference System 1987]] (HGRS87 or ΕΓΣΑ'87) which specifies a Transverse Mercatorial Projection mapping Greece in one zone. 

*1:25.000 scale - 26 maps available for regions near [[Athens]]
*1:50.000 scale - approximately 385 maps
*1:100.000 scale - around 130 maps available
*1:250.000 scale - 32 maps available
*1:500.000 scale - 10 maps available
*1:1.000.000 scale - 5 maps available

==Availability==
The products and services of HMGS are not available in the market. They can either be purchased using the e-shop of the service or collected from the offices of the service upon submitting the relevant request form.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.gys.gr/portal/page?_pageid=33,36288&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13750">The '''intercept method''', also known as '''Marcq St. Hilaire method''', is an astronomical [[navigation]] method of calculating an observer's position on earth. It was originally called the ''azimuth intercept'' method because the process involves drawing a line which intercepts the [[azimuth]] line. This name was shortened to ''intercept'' method and the ''intercept distance'' was shortened to 'intercept'.

The method yields a line of position (LOP) on which the observer is situated. The intersection of two or more such lines will define the observer's position, called a "fix".  Sights may be taken at short intervals, usually during hours of twilight, or they may be taken at an interval of an hour or more (as in observing the Sun during the day).  In either case, the lines of position, if taken at different times, must be advanced or retired to correct for the movement of the ship during the interval between observations.  If observations are taken at short intervals, a few minutes at most, the corrected lines of position by convention yield a "fix".  If the lines of position must be advanced or retired by an hour or more, convention dictates that the result is referred to as a "running fix".

== Summary ==
The intercept method is based on the following principle.
The actual distance from the observer to the geographical position ('''GP''') of a celestial body (that is, the point where it is directly overhead) is "measured" using a [[sextant]]. The observer has already estimated his position by [[dead reckoning]] and calculated the distance from the estimated position to the body's GP; the difference between the "measured" and calculated distances is called the intercept.
[[Image:Diagram showing GP distance = ZD.jpg|thumb|right|500px]]
The diagram on the right shows why the zenith distance of a celestial body is equal to the angular distance of its GP from the observer's position.

The rays of light from a celestial body are assumed to be parallel (unless the observer is looking at the moon, which is too close for such a simplification). The angle at the centre of the Earth that the ray of light passing through the body's GP makes with the line running from the observer's [[zenith]] is the same as the zenith distance. This is because they are [[corresponding angles]]. In practice it is not necessary to use zenith distances, which are 90° minus altitude, as the calculations can be done using observed altitude and calculated altitude.

Taking a sight using the intercept method consists of the following process:
* Observe the altitude above the horizon '''Ho''' of a celestial body and note the time of the observation.
* Assume a certain geographical position (lat., lon.), it does not matter which one so long as it is within, say, 50 NM of the actual position (or even 100 NM would not introduce too much error). Compute the altitude '''Hc''' and azimuth '''Zn''' with which an observer situated at that assumed position would observe the body.
* If the actual observed altitude Ho is smaller than the computed altitude Hc this means the observer is farther away from the body than the observer at the assumed position, and vice versa. For each minute of arc the distance is one NM and the difference between Hc and Ho expressed in minutes of arc (which equal NM) is termed the "intercept". The navigator now has computed the intercept and azimuth of the body.
* On the chart he marks the assumed position '''AP''' and draws a line in the direction of the azimuth Zn. He then measures the intercept distance along this azimuth line, towards the body if Ho&gt;Hc and away from it if Ho&lt;Hc. At this new point he draws a perpendicular to the azimuth line and that is the line of position '''LOP''' at the moment of the observation.
* The reason that the chosen AP is not important (within limits) is that if a position closer to the body is chosen then Hc will be greater but the distance will be measured from the new AP which is closer to the body and the end resulting LOP will be the same.

==Methodology==
[[Image:Intercept Sight Reduction-00.png|thumb|304px|right|Diagram illustrating the intercept sight reduction process]]
Suitable bodies for celestial sights are selected, often using a Rude Star Finder.  Using a [[sextant]], an altitude is obtained of the sun, the moon, a star or a planet.  The name of the body and the precise time of the sight in [[UTC]] is recorded.  Then the sextant is read and the altitude (''Hs'') of the body is recorded.  Once all sights are taken and recorded, the navigator is ready to start the process of [[sight reduction]] and plotting.

The first step in sight reduction is to correct the sextant altitude for various errors and corrections.  The instrument may have an error, IC or index correction (See article on [[Sextant adjustment|adjusting a sextant]]).  Refraction by the atmosphere is corrected for with the aid of a table or calculation and the observer's height of eye above sea level results in a "dip" correction, (as the observer's eye is raised the horizon dips below the horizontal).  If the Sun or Moon was observed, a semidiameter correction is also applied to find the centre of the object.  The resulting value is "observed altitude" (''Ho'').

Next, using an accurate clock, the observed celestial object's geographic position (''GP'') is looked up in an almanac. That's the point on the Earth's surface directly below it (where the object is in the [[zenith]]). The latitude of the geographic position is called declination, and the longitude is usually called the [[hour angle]].

Next, the altitude and azimuth of the celestial body are computed for a selected position (assumed position or AP).  This involves resolving a spherical triangle.  Given the three magnitudes: local hour angle (''LHA''), observed body's declination (''dec''), and assumed latitude (''lat''), the altitude ''Hc'' and azimuth ''Zn'' must be computed. The local hour angle, ''LHA'', is the difference between the AP [[longitude]] and the hour angle of the observed object. It is always measured in a westerly direction from the assumed position.

The relevant formulas (derived using the [[spherical trigonometric identities]]) are:

: &lt;math&gt;\sin(Hc) = \sin(lat) \cdot \sin(dec) + \cos(lat) \cdot \cos(dec) \cdot \cos(LHA) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\tan(Zn) = \frac{\sin(LHA)}{\sin(lat) \cdot \cos(LHA) - \cos(lat) \cdot \tan(dec)}&lt;/math&gt;

or, alternatively,

: &lt;math&gt;\cos(Zn) = \frac{\sin(dec) - \sin(lat) \cdot \sin(Hc)}{\cos(lat) \cdot \cos(Hc)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where

:''Hc'' = Computed altitude
:''Zn'' = Computed azimuth
:''lat'' = Latitude
:''dec'' = Declination
:''LHA'' = Local Hour Angle

These computations can be done easily using electronic calculators or computers but traditionally there were methods which used logarithm or haversine tables. Some of these methods were H.O. 211 (Ageton), Davies, [[haversine]], etc.  The relevant [[haversine formula]] for ''Hc'' is

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{hav}(\overline{Hc}) = \operatorname{hav}(LHA) \cdot cos(lat) \cdot cos(dec) + \operatorname{hav}(lat \pm dec) &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''{{overline|Hc}}'' is the zenith distance, or complement of ''Hc''.

''{{overline|Hc}}'' = 90° - ''Hc''.

The relevant formula for Zn is

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{hav}(Zn) = \frac{ \cos(lat - Hc) - \sin(dec)}{2 \cdot \cos(lat) \cdot \cos(Hc)}&lt;/math&gt;

When using such tables or a computer or scientific calculator, the navigation triangle is solved directly, so any assumed position can be used.  Often the dead reckoning DR position is used. This simplifies plotting and also reduces any slight error caused by plotting a segment of a circle as a straight line.

With the use of astral navigation for air navigation, faster methods needed to be developed and tables of precomputed triangles were developed.  When using precomputed sight reduction tables, selection of the assumed position is one of the trickier steps for the fledgling navigator to master.  Sight reduction tables provide solutions for navigation triangles of integral degree values.  When using precomputed sight reduction tables, such as H.O. 229, the assumed position must be selected to yield integer degree values for ''LHA'' (local hour angle) and latitude.  West longitudes are subtracted and east longitudes are added to ''GHA'' to derive ''LHA'', so AP's must be selected accordingly. When using precomputed sight reduction tables each observation and each body will require a different assumed position.

Professional navigators are divided in usage between sight reduction tables on the one hand, and handheld computers or scientific calculators on the other.  The methods are equally accurate.  It is simply a matter of personal preference which method is used. An experienced navigator can reduce a sight from start to finish in about 5 minutes using nautical tables or a scientific calculator.

The precise location of the assumed position has no great impact on the result, as long as it is reasonably close to the observer's actual position. An assumed position within 1 degree of arc of the observer's actual position is usually considered acceptable.

The calculated altitude (''Hc'') is compared to the observed altitude (''Ho'', sextant altitude (''Hs'') corrected for various errors).  The difference between ''Hc'' and ''Ho'' is called "intercept" and is the observer's distance from the assumed position.  The resulting line of position (''LOP'') is a small segment of the [[circle of equal altitude]], and is represented by a straight line perpendicular to the azimuth of the celestial body. When plotting the small segment of this circle on a chart it is drawn as a straight line, the resulting tiny errors are too small to be significant.

Navigators use the memory aid "computed greater away" to determine whether the observer is farther from the body's geographic position (measure intercept from ''Hc'' away from the azimuth).  If the ''Hc'' is less than ''Ho'', then the observer is closer to the body's geographic position, and intercept is measured from the AP toward the azimuth direction.

The last step in the process is to plot the lines of position ''LOP'' and determine the vessel's location.  Each assumed position is plotted first.  Best practise is to then advance or retire the assumed positions to correct for vessel motion during the interval between sights.  Each LOP is then constructed from its associated AP by striking off the azimuth to the body, measuring intercept toward or away from the azimuth, and constructing the perpendicular line of position.

To obtain a fix (a position) this ''LOP'' must be crossed with another ''LOP'' either from another sight or from elsewhere e.g. a bearing of a point of land or crossing a depth contour such as the 200 metre depth line on a chart.

==Sights==
Until the age of satellite navigation ships usually took sights at dawn, during the forenoon, at noon (meridian transit of the Sun) and dusk. The morning and evening sights were taken during twilight while the [[horizon]] was visible and the stars, planets and/or moon were visible, at least through the telescope of a [[sextant]]. Two observations are always required to give a position accurate to within a mile under favourable conditions. Three are always sufficient.

==Running fix==
A fix is called a ''running fix'' when one or more of the LOPs used to obtain it is an LOP advanced or retrieved over time.  In order to get a fix the LOP must cross at an angle, the closer to 90° the better.  This means the observations must have different azimuths.  During the day, if only the Sun is visible, it is possible to get an LOP from the observation but not a fix as another LOP is needed.  What may be done is take a first sight which yields one LOP and, some hours later, when the Sun's azimuth has changed substantially, take a second sight which yields a second LOP.  Knowing the distance and course sailed in the interval, the first LOP can be advanced to its new position and the intersection with the second LOP yields a ''running fix''.

Any sight can be advanced and used to obtain a ''running fix''. It may be that the navigator due to weather conditions could only obtain a single sight at dawn. The resulting LOP can then be advanced when, later in the morning, a Sun observation becomes possible.  The precision of a running fix depends on the error in distance and course so, naturally, a running fix tends to be less precise than an unqualified fix and the navigator must take into account his confidence in the exactitude of distance and course to estimate the resulting error in the running fix.

Determining a fix by crossing LOPs and advancing LOPs to get running fixes are not specific to the intercept method and can be used with any sight reduction method or with LOPs obtained by any other method (bearings, etc.).

'''Long Range Kinematic (LRK)''' technology is a sophisticated kinematic method developed by Magellan (formerly Thales) Navigation that optimises the advantages of dual-frequency [[GPS]] operation. Other conventional methods use the dual-frequency only during initialisation. LRK makes solving ambiguities during initialisation easy and continuous dual-frequency kinematic operation possible at distances up to 40 kilometres.

Conventional dual-frequency kinematic operation is limited to about 10 kilometres, using a combined observation on GPS L1 and L2 frequencies to produce an initial wide lane solution, ambiguous to around 86 centimetres. During a second phase, the conventional kinematic method uses measurements from the L1 frequency only. This method only allows for kinematic operation as long as the de-correlation of atmospheric errors is compatible with a pure phase single-frequency solution.

Similar to the [[Kinematic Applications in Real Time|KART]] process, LRK is a simple and reliable method that allows any initialisation mode, from a static or fixed reference point, to On The Fly ambiguity resolution, when performing dual-frequency GPS positioning. LRK technology reduces initialisation times to a few seconds by efficiently using L2 measurements in every mode of operation. LRK maintains optimal real-time positioning accuracy to within a centimetre at a range up to 40-50 kilometres, even with a reduced number of visible satellites.

A '''land ethic''' is a philosophy or theoretical framework about how, ethically, humans should regard the land. The term was coined by [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1948) in his ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949), a classic text of the environmental movement. There he argues that there is a critical need for a "new ethic," an "ethic dealing with human's relation to land and to the animals and plants which grow upon it".&lt;ref name=Leopold1949&gt;Leopold, A. 1949. ''A Sand County Almanac''. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} 

Leopold offers an ecologically based land ethic that rejects strictly human-centered views of the environment and focuses on the preservation of healthy, self-renewing ecosystems. ''A Sand County Almanac'' was the first systematic presentation of a holistic or ecocentric approach to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, Joseph R. ''Environmental Ethics: An Introduction to Environmental Philosophy'', 5th ed. Boston: Wadsworth, 2013, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Although Leopold is credited with coining the term "land ethic," there are many philosophical theories that speak to how humans should treat the land. Some of the most prominent land ethics include those rooted in economics, utilitarianism, libertarianism, egalitarianism, and ecology.

==Economics-based land ethic==

This is a land ethic based wholly upon economic self-interest.&lt;ref name=Leopold1949/&gt;  Leopold sees two flaws in this type of ethic. First, he argues that most members of an ecosystem have no economic worth. For this reason, such an ethic can ignore or even eliminate these members when they are actually necessary for the health of the biotic community of the land. And second, it tends to relegate conservation necessary for healthy ecosystems to the government and these tasks are too large and dispersed to be adequately addressed by such an institution. This ties directly into the context within which Leopold wrote ''A Sand County Almanac.''

For example, when the [[US Forest Service]] was founded by [[Gifford Pinchot]], the prevailing ethos was economic and [[utilitarian]]. Leopold argued for an [[ecological]] approach, becoming one of the first to popularize this term coined by [[Henry Chandler Cowles]] of the [[University of Chicago]] during his early 1900s research at the [[Indiana Dunes]]. Conservation became the preferred term for the more anthropocentric model of [[resource management]], while the writing of Leopold and his inspiration, [[John Muir]], led to the development of [[environmentalism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Utilitarian-based land ethic==

Utilitarianism was first put forth by British philosophers [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Though there are many varieties of [[utilitarianism]], generally it is the view that a morally right action is an action that produces the maximum good for people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''/ "History of Utilitarianism"]&lt;/ref&gt; Utilitarianism has often been used when deciding how to use land and it is closely connected with an economic-based ethic. For example, it forms the foundation for industrial farming; an increase in yield, which would increase the number of people able to receive goods from farmed land, is judged from this view to be a good action or approach. In fact, a common argument in favor of [[industrial agriculture]] is that it is a good practice because it increases the benefits for humans; benefits such as food abundance and a drop in food prices. However, a utilitarian-based land ethic is different from a purely economic one as it could be used to justify the limiting of a person's rights to make profit. For example, in the case of the farmer planting crops on a slope, if the runoff of soil into the community creek led to the damage of several neighbor's properties, then the good of the individual farmer would be overridden by the damage caused to his neighbors. Thus, while a utilitarian-based land ethic can be used to support economic activity, it can also be used to challenge this activity.

==Libertarian-based land ethic==

Another philosophical approach often used to guide actions when making (or not making) changes to the land is [[libertarianism]]. Roughly, libertarianism is the ethical view that agents own themselves and have particular moral rights, including the right to acquire property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/libertarianism/ Vallentyne, Peter, "Libertarianism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; In a looser sense, libertarianism is commonly identified with the belief that each individual person has a right to a maximum amount of freedom or liberty when this freedom does not interfere with other people's freedom. A well-known libertarian theorist is [[John Hospers]]. For libertarians, property rights are natural rights. Thus, it would be acceptable for the above farmer to plant on a slope as long as this action does not limit the freedom of his or her neighbors.

This view is closely connected to utilitarianism. Libertarians often use utilitarian arguments to support their own arguments. For example, in 1968, [[Garrett Hardin]] applied this philosophy to land issues when he argued that the only solution to the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]" was to place soil and water resources into the hands of private citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, Garrett. (1968) "The Tragedy of the Commons." ''Science'', 162, 1243-1248&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin supplied utilitarian justifications to support his argument. However, it can be argued that this leaves a libertarian-based land ethics open to the above critique lodged against economic-based approaches. Even excepting this, the libertarian view has been challenged by the critique that numerous people making self-interested decisions often cause large ecological disasters, such as the [[Dust Bowl]] disaster.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Paul 2010"&gt;Thompson, Paul. (2010) "Land." ''Life Science Ethics.'' ed. Gary L. Comstock. Raleigh: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, libertarianism is a philosophical view commonly held within the United States and, especially, held by U.S. ranchers and farmers.

{{Dubious |Libertarian based |reason= Libertarianism is generally agreed to be a philosophy of the individual and the morality of ownership.  The Land Ethic, as described by Aldo Leopold, is a philosophy of community and interdependence.  These two ideas remain mutually exclusive despite the dogmatic attempt by the former to redefine the later.  |date=June 2013}}

==Egalitarian-based land ethic==

Egalitarian-based land ethics are often developed as a response to libertarianism. This is because, while libertarianism ensures the maximum amount of human liberty, it does not require that people help others. In addition, it also leads to the uneven distribution of wealth. A well-known egalitarian philosopher is [[John Rawls]]. When focusing on land use, egalitarianism evaluates its uneven distribution and the uneven distribution of the fruits of that land.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Paul 2010"/&gt; While both a utilitarian- and libertarian-based land ethic could conceivably rationalize this mal-distribution, an egalitarian approach typically favors equality, whether that be equal entitlement to land and/or access to food.&lt;ref&gt;Arneson, Richard, "Egalitarianism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also the question of negative rights when holding to an egalitarian-based ethic. In other words, if it is recognized that a person has a right to something, then someone has the responsibility to supply this opportunity or item; whether that be an individual person or the government. Thus, an egalitarian-based land ethic could provide a strong argument for the preservation of soil fertility and water because it links land and water with the right to food, with the growth of human populations, and the decline of soil and water resources.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Paul 2010"/&gt;

==Ecologically based land ethic==

Land ethics may also be based upon the principle that the land (and the organisms that live off the land) has intrinsic value. These ethics are, roughly, based on an ecological or systems view. This position was first put forth by Ayers Brinser in ''Our Use of the Land'', published in 1939. Brinser argued that white settlers brought with them "the seeds of a civilization which has grown by consuming the land, that is, a civilization which has used up the land in much the same way that a furnace burns coal.”{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Later, [[Aldo Leopold]]'s posthumously published ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949) popularized this idea. 

Another example is the [[deep ecology]] view, which argues that human communities are built upon a foundation of the surrounding ecosystems or the biotic communities, and that all life is of inherent worth.&lt;ref&gt;Naess, Arne (1973) "The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement." ''Inquiry'' 16: 95-100&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to egalitarian-based land ethics, the above land ethics were also developed as alternatives to utilitarian and libertarian-based approaches. Leopold's ethic is one of the most popular ecological approaches in the early 21st century. Other writers and theorists who hold this view include [[Wendell Berry]] (b. 1934), [[N. Scott Momaday]], [[J. Baird Callicott]], [[Paul B. Thompson (philosopher)|Paul B. Thompson]], and [[Barbara Kingsolver]].

==Aldo Leopold's land ethic==
In his classic essay, "The Land Ethic," published posthumously in ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949), Leopold proposes that the next step in the evolution of ethics is the expansion of ethics to include nonhuman members of the [[biotic community]],&lt;ref name=Leopold1949/&gt; collectively referred to as "the land." Leopold states the basic principle of his land ethic as: "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise."

He also describes it in this way: "The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land . . . [A] land ethic changes the role of ''Homo sapiens'' from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such."{{page needed|date=April 2018}}

Leopold was a naturalist, not a philosopher. There is much scholarly debate about what exactly Leopold's land ethic asserts and how he argues for it. At its core, the land ethics claims (1) that humans should view themselves as plain members and citizens of biotic communities, not as "conquerors" of the land; (2) that we should extend ethical consideration to ecological wholes ("soils, waters, plants, and animals"), (3) that our primary ethical concern should not be with individual plants or animals, but with the healthy functioning of whole biotic communities, and (4) that the "summary moral maxim" of ecological ethics is that we should seek to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. Beyond this, scholars disagree about the extent to which Leopold rejected traditional human-centered approaches to the environment and how literally he intended his basic moral maxim to be applied. They also debate whether Leopold based his land ethic primarily on human-centered interests, as many passages in ''A Sand County Almanac'' suggest, or whether he placed significant weight on the intrinsic value of nature. One prominent student of Leopold, [[J. Baird Callicott]], has suggested that Leopold grounded his land ethics on various scientific claims, including a Darwinian view of ethics as rooted in special affections for kith and kin, a Copernican view of humans as plain members of nature and the cosmos, and the finding of modern ecology that ecosystems are complex, interrelated wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird. ''In Defense of the Land Ethic: Essays in Environmental Philosophy''. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989, pp. 75-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this interpretation has recently been challenged by [[Roberta Millstein]], who has offered evidence that Darwin's influence on Leopold was not related to Darwin's views about moral sentiments, but rather to Darwin's views about interdependence in the struggle for existence.&lt;ref&gt;Millstein, Roberta L. (2015) “Re-examining the Darwinian Basis for Aldo Leopold’s Land Ethic,” Ethics, Policy &amp; Environment 18: 301-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions of Leopold's land ethic==

Leopold's ecocentric land ethic is popular today with mainstream environmentalists for a number of reasons. Unlike more radical environmental approaches, such as [[deep ecology]] or [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]], it does not require huge sacrifices of human interests. Leopold does not, for example, believe that humans should stop eating or hunting or experimenting on animals. Nor does he call for a massive reduction in human population, or for permitting humans to interfere with nature only to satisfy vital human needs (regardless of economic or other human costs). As an environmental ethic, Leopold's land ethic is a comparatively moderate view that seeks to strike a balance between human interests and a healthy and biotically diverse natural environment. Many of the things mainstream environmentalists favor--preference for native plants and animals over invasive species, hunting or selective culling to control overpopulated species that are damaging to the environment, and a focus on preserving healthy, self-regenerating natural ecosystems both for human benefit and for their own intrinsic value--jibe with Leopold's ecocentric land ethic.

A related understanding has been framed as [http://www.nature.com/news/govern-land-as-a-global-commons-1.22065 global land as a commons]. In this view biodiversity and terrestrial carbon storage - an element of climate change mitigation - are global public goods. Hence, land should be governed on a global scale as a commons, requiring increased international cooperation on nature preservation &lt;ref&gt;Creutzig, F. [http://www.nature.com/news/govern-land-as-a-global-commons-1.22065 Govern land as a global commons]. Nature 546:7656 pp. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==

Some critics fault Leopold for lack of clarity in spelling out exactly what the land ethic is and its specific implications for how humans should think about the environment.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, ''Environmental Ethics'', pp. 186-88.&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Leopold did not intend his basic normative principle ("A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community") to be regarded as an ethical absolute. Thus construed, it would prohibit clearing land to build homes, schools, or farms, and generally require a "hands-off" approach to nature that Leopold plainly did not favor. Presumably, therefore, his maxim should be seen as a general guideline for valuing natural ecosystems and striving to achieve what he terms a sustainable state of "harmony between men and land." But this is vague and, according to some critics, not terribly helpful.

A second common criticism of Leopold is that he fails to state clearly why we should adopt the land ethic.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, pp. 185-88.&lt;/ref&gt; He often cites examples of environmental damage (e.g., soil erosion, pollution, and deforestation) that result from traditional human-centered, "conqueror" attitudes towards nature. But it is unclear why such examples support the land ethic specifically, as opposed to biocentricism or some other nature-friendly environmental ethic. Leopold also frequently appeals to modern ecology, evolutionary theory, and other scientific discoveries to support his land ethic. Some critics have suggested that such appeals may involve an illicit move from facts to values.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, pp. 185-88.&lt;/ref&gt; At a minimum, such critics claim, more should be said about the normative basis of Leopold's land ethic.

Other critics object to Leopold's ecological holism. According to animal rights advocate, Tom Regan, Leopold's land ethic condones sacrificing the good of individual animals to the good of the whole, and is thus a form of "environmental fascism."&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Tom. ''The Case for Animal Rights''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983, pp. 361-62.&lt;/ref&gt; According to these critics, we rightly reject such holistic approaches in human affairs. Why, they ask, should we adopt them in our treatment of non-human animals?

Finally, some critics have questioned whether Leopold's land ethic might require unacceptable interferences with nature in order to protect current, but transient, ecological balances.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; If the fundamental environmental imperative is to ''preserve'' the integrity and stability of natural ecosystems, wouldn't this require frequent and costly human interventions to prevent naturally occurring changes to natural environments? In nature, the "stability and integrity" of ecosystems are disrupted or destroyed all the time by drought, fire, storms, pests, newly invasive predators, etc. Must humans act to prevent such ecological changes, and if so, at what cost? Why should we place such high value on current ecological balances? Why think it is our role to be nature's steward or policeman? According to these critics, Leopold's stress on preserving existing ecological balances is overly human-centered and fails to treat nature with the respect it deserves.

A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined [[landform]]s such as (ice-capped) [[mountains]], [[hills]], [[water bodies]] such as [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, ponds and the [[sea]], living elements of [[land cover]] including indigenous [[vegetation]], human elements including different forms of [[land use]], buildings and [[structure]]s, and transitory elements such as [[lighting]] and [[weather]] conditions.

Combining both their physical origins and the [[Culture|cultural]] overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and [[national identity]]. The character of a landscape helps define the self-image of the people who inhabit it and a sense of place that differentiates one region from other regions. It is the dynamic backdrop to people’s lives. Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a [[English landscape park|landscape park]], or [[wilderness]].

The [[Earth]] has a vast range of landscapes, including the icy landscapes of [[polar region]]s, [[mountain]]ous landscapes, vast arid [[desert]] landscapes, [[island]]s and [[coast]]al landscapes, densely [[forest]]ed or [[wooded]] landscapes including past [[boreal forests]] and [[tropical rainforests]], and [[agricultural]] landscapes of [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] regions.

The activity of modifying the visible features of an area of land is referred to as ''[[landscaping]]''.

==Definition and etymology==
[[File:Stanisław Masłowski (1853-1926), Autumn landscape in Rybiniszki, 1902.jpeg|left|thumb|Autumn landscape in [[Riebini|Rybiniszki]], [[Latvia]], [[watercolor]] by [[Stanisław Masłowski]], 1902 ([[National Museum in Warsaw]], Poland)]]
There are several definitions of what constitutes a landscape, depending on context. In common usage however, a landscape refers either to all the visible features of an area of land (usually rural), often considered in terms of [[aesthetic]] appeal, or to a pictorial representation of an area of countryside, specifically within the genre of [[landscape painting]]. When people deliberately improve the aesthetic appearance of a piece of land—by changing contours and vegetation, etc.—it is said to have been [[Landscaping|landscaped]],&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; though the result may not constitute a landscape according to some definitions.

The word ''landscape'' (''landscipe'' or ''landscaef'') arrived in [[England]]—and therefore into the [[English language]]—after the fifth century, following the arrival of the [[Anglo-Saxons]]; these terms referred to a system of human-made spaces on the land. The term ''landscape'' emerged around the turn of the sixteenth century to denote a painting whose primary subject matter was natural scenery.&lt;ref name="olw1"&gt;[[Kenneth Olwig|Olwig K.R.]], Recovering the Substantive Nature of Landscape, ''Annals of the A.A.G''(1996),86,4,630-653&lt;/ref&gt; ''Land'' (a word from Germanic origin) may be taken in its sense of something to which people belong (as in England being the land of the English).&lt;ref name= "olwig3" /&gt; The suffix ''&amp;#8209;scape'' is equivalent to the more common English suffix ''&amp;#8209;ship.''&lt;ref name="olwig3"&gt;Olwig K.R., Representation and Alienation in the Political Landscape, ''cultural geographies'' (2005)12,19-40&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of ''&amp;#8209;ship'' are etymologically akin to Old English ''sceppan'' or ''scyppan'', meaning ''to shape''. The suffix ''&amp;#8209;schaft'' is related to the verb ''schaffen'', so that ''&amp;#8209;ship'' and ''shape'' are also etymologically linked. The modern form of the word, with its connotations of scenery, appeared in the late sixteenth century when the term ''landschap'' was introduced by Dutch painters who used it to refer to paintings of inland natural or rural scenery. The word ''landscape'', first recorded in 1598, was borrowed from a Dutch painters' term.&lt;ref&gt;Makhzoumi J. and Pungetti G., Ecological Landscape Design and Planning, Spon Routledge,(1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The popular conception of the ''landscape'' that is reflected in dictionaries conveys both a particular and a general meaning, the particular referring to an area of the Earth's surface and the general being that which can be seen by an observer. An example of this second usage can be found as early as 1662 in the [[Book of Common Prayer]]:
::Could we but climb where Moses stood,
::And view the landscape over.
::: (General Hymns, verse 536).&lt;ref&gt;Found via Google Ngram&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Kukle,Czech Republic..jpg|thumb|163x163px|Kukle, Czech Republic.]]

There are several words that are frequently associated with the word landscape:
* Scenery: The natural features of a landscape considered in terms of their appearance, esp. when picturesque: spectacular views of mountain scenery.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt;
* [[Setting (narrative)|Setting]]: In works of narrative (especially [[fiction]]al), it includes the [[time|historical moment in time]] and [[location (geography)|geographic location]] in which a [[storytelling|story]] takes place, and helps initiate the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] for a story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, p. 1, 65, 115, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Picturesque]]: The word literally means "in the manner of a picture; fit to be made into a picture", and used as early as 1703 (''Oxford English Dictionary''), and derived from an Italian term ''pittoresco'', "in the manner of a painter". [[William Gilpin (priest)|Gilpin]]’s ''Essay on Prints'' (1768) defined ''picturesque'' as "a term expressive of that peculiar kind of beauty, which is agreeable in a picture" (p. xii).
* A view: "A sight or prospect of some landscape or extended scene; an extent or area covered by the eye from one point" (OED).
* [[Wilderness]]: An uncultivated, uninhabited, and inhospitable region.&lt;ref name="New Oxford American Dictionary"/&gt; See also [[Natural landscape]].
* [[Cityscape]] (also townscape): The urban equivalent of a landscape. In the [[visual arts]] a cityscape (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[Publishing|print]] or [[photograph]], of the physical aspects of a [[city]] or urban area.
* [[Seascape]]: A [[photograph]], [[painting]], or other [[work of art]] which depicts the [[sea]], in other words an example of [[marine art]].

==Physical landscape==

===Geomorphology: The physical evolution of landscape===
[[Geomorphology]] is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of [[topographic]] and [[bathymetric]] features  created by physical or chemical processes operating at or near Earth's surface. Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and [[landscape evolution model|numerical modeling]]. Geomorphology is practiced within [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[geodesy]], [[engineering geology]], [[archaeology]] and [[geotechnical engineering]]. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, M.A., 1991, ''Global Geomorphology'', Pearson Education Ltd,  {{ISBN|0-582-30156-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of [[Earth]] is modified by a combination of surface processes that sculpt landscapes, and geologic processes that cause [[tectonic uplift]] and [[subsidence]], and shape the [[coastal geography]]. Surface processes comprise the action of [[water]], [[wind]], [[ice]], [[wildfire|fire]], and living things on the surface of the Earth, along with chemical reactions that form [[soil]]s and alter material properties, the stability and rate of change of [[topography]] under the force of [[gravity]], and other factors, such as (in the very recent past) human alteration of the landscape. Many of these factors are strongly mediated by [[climate]]. Geologic processes include the uplift of [[mountain range]]s, the growth of [[volcano]]es, [[isostasy|isostatic]] changes in land surface elevation (sometimes in response to surface processes), and the formation of deep [[sedimentary basins]] where the surface of Earth drops and is filled with material [[erosion|eroded]] from other parts of the landscape.  The Earth surface and its topography therefore are an intersection of climatic, [[hydrology|hydrologic]], and [[biology|biologic]] action with geologic processes.

===Landscape ecology===
[[Landscape ecology]] is the science of studying and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems. This is done within a variety of landscape scales, development spatial patterns, and organizational levels of research and policy.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and sustainability science. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2008. Landscape ecology. In: S. E. Jorgensen (ed), Encyclopedia of Ecology. Elsevier, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape is a central concept in landscape ecology. It is, however, defined in quite different ways. For example:&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T., Trepl, L. and V. Vicenzotti, V. 2012: What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions. Landscape Research online first.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carl Troll]] conceives of landscape not as a mental construct but as an objectively given ‘organic entity’, a ‘‘harmonic individuum of space’’.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, C. 2007: The geographic landscape and its investigation. In: Wiens, J.A., Moss, M.R., Turner, M.G. &amp; Mladenoff, D.J. (eds): Foundation papers in landscape ecology. New York, Columbia University Press:71–101 [First published as: Troll, C. 1950: Die geographische Landschaft und ihre Erforschung. Studium Generale 3(4/5):163–181].&lt;/ref&gt;

GeoJournal 7(2):107–119.&lt;/ref&gt; defines landscapes as sections within the uninterrupted earth-wide interconnection of geofactors which are defined as such on the basis of their uniformity in terms of a specific land use, and are thus defined in an anthropocentric and relativistic way.

According to [[Richard Forman]] and [[Michael Godron]],&lt;ref&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron, M. 1981: Patches and structural components for a landscape ecology. BioScience 31(10):733–740; Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron 1986: Landscape ecology. Wiley, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; a landscape is a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems that is repeated in similar form throughout, whereby they list woods, meadows, marshes and villages as examples of a landscape’s ecosystems, and state that a landscape is an area at least a few kilometres wide.

===Integrated landscape management===
[[Integrated landscape management]] is a way of managing a landscape that brings together multiple stakeholders, who collaborate to integrate policy and practice for their different land use objectives, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes.&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=J|last2=Deakin|first2=E|last3=Sunderland|first3=T|title=What are ‘Integrated Landscape Approaches’ and how effectively have they been implemented in the tropics: a systematic map protocol|journal=Environmental Evidence|date=2015|volume=4:2|url=http://www.cifor.org/library/5422/what-are-integrated-landscape-approaches-and-how-effectively-have-they-been-implemented-in-the-tropics-a-systematic-map-protocol/|issn=2047-2382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LSLB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denier|first1=L|last2=Scherr|first2=S|last3=Shames|first3=S|last4=Chatterton|first4=P|last5=Hovani|first5=L|last6=Stam|first6=N|title=The Little Sustainable Landscapes Book|date=2015|publisher=Global Canopy Programme|location=Oxford|url=http://globalcanopy.org/sustainablelandscapes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognises that, for example, one river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for smallholders and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; the way in which each one of these sectors pursues its goals can have impacts on the others. The intention is to minimise conflict between these different land use objectives and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; This approach draws on landscape ecology, as well as many related fields that also seek to integrate different land uses and users, such as [[watershed management]].&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt;

Proponents of integrated landscape management argue that it is well-suited to address complex global challenges, such as those that are the focus of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="SDG briefing"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landscapes for People Food and Nature|title=Integrated Landscape Management: The Means of Implementation for the Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Landscapes for People Food and Nature briefing|date=2015|url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ILM-for-the-SDGs-Two-Page-Statement-Sept-21-2015-FINAL-FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated landscape management is increasingly taken up at the national,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GMS Workshop on Landscape Approaches|url=http://www.gms-eoc.org/events/gms-workshop-on-landscape-approaches|website=Greater Mekong Subregion - Core Environment Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IINDC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Republic of Indonesia|title=Intended Nationally Determined Contribution|url=http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Indonesia/1/INDC_REPUBLIC%20OF%20INDONESIA.pdf|website=UNFCCC submissions}}&lt;/ref&gt; local&lt;ref&gt;Landscapes for People Food and nature case studies http://peoplefoodandnature.org/analysis/all-publications/case-studies/&lt;/ref&gt; and international level, for example the [[UN Environment Programme]] states that "UNEP champions the landscape approach de facto as it embodies the main elements of integrated ecosystem management".

===Landscape archaeology===

Landscape archaeology or [[landscape history]] is the study of the way in which humanity has changed the physical appearance of the environment - both present and past. Landscape generally refers to both natural environments and environments constructed by human beings.&lt;ref name="Nicole"&gt;Branton, Nicole (2009) Landscape Approaches in Historical Archaeology: The Archaeology of Places. In International Handbook of Historic Archaeology, Majewski, Teresita and David Gaimster, eds. Springer:&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Natural landscape]]s are considered to be environments that have not been altered by humans in any shape or form.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;Hood, Edward J. (1996)  "Social Relations and the Cultural Landscape". In Landscape Archaeology:Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. Yamin, Rebecca and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds. Knoxville:The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cultural landscapes]], on the other hand, are environments that have been altered in some manner by people (including temporary structures and places, such as campsites, that are created by human beings).&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Spencer-Wood, Suzanne M. and Sherene Baugher. (2010) "Introduction to the Historical Archaeology of Powered Cultural Landscapes." International Journal of Historical Archaeology 14, pp. 463-474.&lt;/ref&gt; Among archaeologists, the term landscape can refer to the meanings and alterations people mark onto their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garden" /&gt;  As such, landscape archaeology is often employed to study the human use of land over extensive periods of time.&lt;ref name="garden"&gt;Gleason, Kathryn L.

Landscape archaeology can be summed up by Nicole Branton's statement: 
:"the landscapes in landscape archaeology may be as small as a single household or garden or as large as an empire", and "although resource exploitation, class, and power are frequent topics of landscape archaeology, landscape approaches are concerned with spatial, not necessarily ecological or economic, relationships. While similar to [[settlement archaeology]] and ecological archaeology, landscape approaches model places and spaces as dynamic participants in past behavior, not merely setting (affecting human action), or artifact (affected by human action)".&lt;ref name="Nicole" /&gt;

===Cultural landscape===
[[File:Inside the Batad rice terraces.jpg|thumb|The Batad rice terraces, The [[Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras]], the first site to be included in the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] cultural landscape category in 1995.&lt;ref name=not-danger&gt;{{cite news|last=Malig|first=Jojo|title=Philippine rice terraces no longer in danger|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/06/26/12/philippine-rice-terraces-no-longer-danger|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The concept of [[cultural landscapes]] can be found in the European tradition of [[landscape art|landscape painting]].&lt;ref&gt;PANNELL, S (2006) Reconciling Nature and Culture in a Global Context: Lessons form the World Heritage List. James Cook University. Cairns, Australia. Page 62&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 16th century onwards, many European artists painted landscapes in favor of people, diminishing the people in their paintings to figures subsumed within broader, regionally specific landscapes.&lt;ref name="GIBS1989"&gt;GIBSON, W.S (1989) Mirror of the Earth: The World Landscape in Sixteenth-Century Flemish Painting.  Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographer [[Otto Schlüter]] is credited with having first formally used  "cultural landscape" as an academic term in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Schlüter argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) this would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ELKINS, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. ENTRIKEN, J. Nicholas &amp; BRUNN, Stanley D (Eds) Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC. Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;  He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (transl. original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (transl. 'cultural landscape') a landscape created by human culture. The major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.''

It was [[Carl O. Sauer]], a [[human geography|human geographer]], who was probably the most influential in promoting and developing the idea of cultural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York. Page 321-324.&lt;/ref&gt; Sauer was determined to stress the agency of culture as a force in shaping the visible features of the Earth’s surface in delimited areas. Within his definition, the physical environment retains a central significance, as the medium with and through which human cultures act.&lt;ref name ="SAUE1925"&gt;SAUER, C (1925) ''The Morphology of Landscape''. University of California Publications in Geography. Number 22. Pages 19-53&lt;/ref&gt;  His classic definition of a 'cultural landscape' reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultural landscape is fashioned from a [[natural landscape]] by a cultural group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape is the result.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A cultural landscape, as defined by the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Committee]], is the "cultural properties [that] represent the combined works of nature and of man."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2012) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention [http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide12-en.pdf]. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage Committee identifies three categories of cultural landscape, ranging from (i) those landscapes most deliberately 'shaped' by people, through (ii) full range of 'combined' works, to (iii) those least evidently 'shaped' by people (yet highly valued).  The three categories extracted from the Committee's Operational Guidelines, are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2005) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "A landscape designed and created intentionally by man";
# an "organically evolved landscape" which may be a "[[relict (geology)|relict (or fossil) landscape]]" or a "continuing landscape"; and
# an "associative cultural landscape" which may be valued because of the "religious, artistic or cultural associations of the natural element".

===Landscape gardens===

{{See also|Landscaping|Landscape design|Landscape architecture|Garden|Park}}
The [[Chinese garden]] is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the Imperial Family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world.  They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Baridon, ''Les Jardins - paysagistes, jardiners, poḕts''. p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, [[scholar's rock]]s, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Records of the 21st conference of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, describing Classical Chinese garden design and the gardens of Suzhou.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English landscape garden]], also called English landscape park or simply the 'English garden', is a style of parkland garden intended to look as though it might be a natural landscape, although it may be very extensively re-arranged.  It emerged in England in the early 18th century, and spread across Europe, replacing the more formal, symmetrical ''[[jardin à la française]]'' of the 17th century as the principal style for large parks and gardens in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe'', Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The English garden (and later [[French landscape garden]]) presented an idealized view of nature. It drew inspiration from paintings of landscapes by [[Claude Lorraine]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]], and from the classic [[Chinese gardens]] of the East,&lt;ref name=Boults/&gt; which had recently been described by European travellers and were realized in the Anglo-Chinese garden,&lt;ref name=Boults&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated History of Landscape Design|author=Boults, Elizabeth and Chip Sullivan|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2010|isbn=0-470-28933-3|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712 – 1778).

The English garden usually included a lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. The work of [[Capability Brown|Lancelot "Capability" Brown]] and [[Humphry Repton]] was particularly influential. By the end of the 18th century the English garden was being imitated by the French landscape garden, and as far away as St. Petersburg, Russia, in [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], the gardens of the future [[Emperor Paul]]. It also had a major influence on the form of the [[public parks]] and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Impelluso, ''Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes'', Mondatori Electra, Milan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape architecture===
[[File:Central park manhattan 2 New York photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Central Park]], [[New York City]], US, designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. ]]
[[Landscape architecture]] is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of [[botany]], [[horticulture]], the [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[geology]] and the [[earth sciences]], [[environmental psychology]], [[geography]], and [[ecology]]. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil [[infrastructure]] and the management of large [[wilderness]] areas or [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of degraded landscapes such as mines or [[landfill]]s. Landscape architects work on all types of structures and external space&amp;nbsp;– large or small, [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] and [[rural]], and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while paying attention to ecological [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].

For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and [[garden design]] for [[manor houses]], [[palace]]s and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] and at the [[Palace of Versailles]] for King [[Louis XIV of France]]. The first person to write of making a landscape was [[Joseph Addison]] in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in 1828 and was first used as a professional title by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in 1863. During the latter 19th century, the term [[landscape architect]] became used by professional people who designed landscapes. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] used the term 'landscape architecture' as a profession for the first time when designing [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], US. Here the combination of traditional landscape gardening and the emerging field of city planning gave landscape architecture its unique focus. This use of the term landscape architect became established after [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and others founded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) in 1899.

===Landscape and literature===
{{See also|Pastoral|British regional literature|American literary regionalism}}

====The earliest landscape literature====
[[File:Damarri001.jpg|thumb|The [[Djabugay people|Djabugay]] language group's mythical being, ''Damarri'', transformed into a mountain range, is seen lying on his back above the [[Barron Gorge National Park|Barron River Gorge]], looking upwards to the skies, within north-east Australia's wet tropical forested landscape]]
Possibly the earliest landscape literature is found in [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|Australian aboriginal myths]]  (also known as [[Dreamtime]] or Dreaming stories, [[songlines]], or Aboriginal [[oral literature]]), the stories [[ritual|traditionally performed]] by [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. (1994) "Oral Literature" in Horton, David (General Editor)&lt;/ref&gt; within each of the [[language group]]s across Australia. All such myths variously tell significant truths within each Aboriginal group's local [[cultural landscape|landscape]]. They effectively layer the whole of the Australian continent's topography with cultural nuance and deeper meaning, and empower selected audiences with the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of Australian Aboriginal ancestors back to [[time immemorial]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. (1995) "An Approach to Ensure Continuity and Transmission of the Rainforest Peoples' Oral Tradition", in Fourmile, H; Schnierer, S.; &amp; Smith, A. (Eds) ''An Identification of Problems and Potential for Future Rainforest Aboriginal Cultural Survival and Self-Determination in the Wet Tropics.'' Centre for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Participation Research and Development. Cairns, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western culture|West]] [[pastoral]] poetry represent the earliest form of landscape literature, though this literary genre presents an idealized landscape peopled by shepherds and shepherdesses, and creates "an image of a peaceful uncorrupted existence; a kind of [[fall of man|prelapsarian]] world".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, P. 644.&lt;/ref&gt; The pastoral has its origins in the works of the Greek poet [[Theocritus]] (c. 316 - c. 260 BC). The [[Romanticism|Romantic period]] poet [[William Wordsworth]] created a modern, more realistic form of pastoral with ''[[Michael (poem)|Michael, A Pastoral Poem]]'' (1800).&lt;ref&gt;Peter V. Marinetti, ''Pastoral''. London: Methuen, 1971, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early form of landscape poetry, [[Shanshui poetry]], developed in China during the third and fourth centuries A.D.&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"&gt;Yip, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hambledon Hill towards Stourton Tower 20070730.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Vale of Blackmore]], the main setting for [[Thomas Hardy]]'s novel ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]''. [[Hambledon Hill]] towards [[King Alfred's Tower|Stourton Tower]] ]]

====Topographical poetry====
[[Topographical poetry]]  is a [[genre]] of poetry that describes, and often praises, a landscape or place. [[John Denham (poet)|John Denham]]'s 1642 poem "Cooper's Hill" established the genre, which peaked in popularity in 18th-century England. Examples of [[Topography|topographical]] verse date, however, to the [[Late Classical]] period, and can be found throughout the [[Medieval]] era and during the [[Renaissance]]. Though the earliest examples come mostly from continental Europe, the topographical poetry in the tradition originating with Denham concerns itself with the classics, and many of the various types of topographical verse, such as river, ruin, or hilltop poems were established by the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Aubin, Robert Arnold. ''Topographical Poetry in XVIII-Century England''. New York: The Modern Language Association of America, 1936, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Pope]]'s "Windsor Forest" (1713) and [[John Dyer]]'s "[[Grongar Hill]]' (1762) are two other familiar examples. [[George Crabbe]], the [[Suffolk]] regional poet, also wrote topographical poems, as did  [[William Wordsworth]], of which ''[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]]'' is an obvious example.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Cuddon, ''Dictionary of Literary Terms''. London: Penguin, 1999, p. 922&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Matthew Arnold]]'s "[[The Scholar Gipsy]]" (1853) praises the [[Oxfordshire]] countryside, and [[W. H. Auden]]'s "[[In Praise of Limestone]]" (1948) uses a [[limestone]] landscape as an allegory.&lt;ref name="France"&gt;{{cite journal|author=France, Alan W.|title=Gothic North and the Mezzogiorno in Auden's 'In Praise of Limestone'|journal=[[Renascence (journal)|Renascence]]|volume=42|issue=3|year=1990|pages=141–148|doi=10.5840/renascence199042319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subgenres of topographical poetry include the [[country house poems|country house poem]], written in 17th-century England to compliment a wealthy patron, and the [[prospect poem]], describing the view from a distance or a temporal view into the future, with the sense of opportunity or expectation.  When understood broadly as landscape poetry and when assessed from its establishment to the present, topographical poetry can take on many formal situations and types of places. Kenneth Baker, in his "Introduction to ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry'', identifies 37 varieties and compiles poems from the 16th through the 20th centuries—from [[Edmund Spenser]] to [[Sylvia Plath]]—correspondent to each type, from "Walks and Surveys," to "Mountains, Hills, and the View from Above," to "Violation of Nature and the Landscape," to "Spirits and Ghosts."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Kenneth, ed. ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry.'' New York: Faber and Faber, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common aesthetic registers of which topographical poetry makes use include [[pastoral]] imagery, the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], and the [[picturesque]], which include images of rivers, ruins, moonlight, birdsong, and clouds, peasants, mountains, caves, and waterscapes.

Though describing a landscape or scenery, topographical poetry often, at least implicitly, addresses a political issue or the meaning of [[nationalism|nationality]] in some way.  The description of the landscape therefore becomes a poetic vehicle for a political message.  For example, in John Denham's "Cooper's Hill," the speaker discusses the merits of the recently executed [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref&gt;John Denham, "Cooper's Hill", (ll.111-119)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Vision on Mount [[Snowdon]]'''

…………………………...and on the shore
I found myself of a huge sea of mist,
Which meek and silent rested at my feet.
A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved
All over this still ocean, and beyond,
Far, far beyond, the vapours shot themselves
In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes, Into the sea, the real sea, that seemed
To dwindle and give up its majesty,
Usurped upon as far as sight could reach.

}}
One important aspect of British [[Romantic poetry|Romanticism]]&amp;nbsp;– evident in painting and literature as well as in politics and philosophy&amp;nbsp;– was a change in the way people perceived and valued the landscape. In particular, after [[William Gilpin (priest)|William Gilpin]]'s ''Observations on the River Wye'' was published in 1770, the idea of the [[picturesque]] began to influence artists and viewers. Gilpin advocated approaching the landscape "by the rules of picturesque beauty,"&lt;ref&gt;Gilpin, William, quoted in Baker, Kenneth, ed. ''The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry.'' New York: Faber and Faber, 2000, p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasized contrast and variety. [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1757) was also an influential text, as was [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]' ''On the Sublime'' (early A.D., Greece), which was translated into English from the French in 1739. From the 18th century, a taste for the sublime in the natural landscape emerged alongside the idea of the sublime in language; that is elevated rhetoric or speech.&lt;ref&gt;In the late 17th century in England, [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]] brought attention to Longinus' argument for the emotive power of figurative language in poetry.&lt;/ref&gt; A topographical poem that influenced the Romantics, was [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]'s ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'' (1726–30).&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, Tim. ''Landscape, LIberty, and Authority: Poetry, Criticism, and Politics from Thomson to Wordsworth.''  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996., p.21'&lt;/ref&gt;
The changing landscape, brought about by the [[Industrial revolution|industrial]] and [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]]s, with the expansion of the city and depopulation of the countryside, was another influences on the growth of the [[Romantic movement]] in Britain. The poor condition of workers, the new class conflicts, and the pollution of the environment all led to a reaction against urbanism and industrialisation and a new emphasis on the beauty and value of [[nature]] and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. "Romanticism". Retrieved 30 January 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Britannica.com. Retrieved 24 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], as well a reaction against the scientific [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Casey, (October 30, 2008). ""Grecian Grandeurs and the Rude Wasting of Old Time": Britain, the Elgin Marbles, and Post-Revolutionary Hellenism". ''Foundations''. Volume III, Number 1. Retrieved 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[William Wordsworth]] was a major contributor to the literature of landscape,&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Drabble, ''A Writer's Britain'' (originally subtitled "Landscape in literature", 1979).  New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; as was his contemporary poet and novelist [[Walter Scott]]. Scott's influence was felt throughout Europe, as well as on major [[Victorian novel]]ists in Britain, such as [[Emily Bronte]], [[Mrs Gaskell]], [[George Eliot]], and [[Thomas Hardy]], as well as [[John Cowper Powys]] in the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottsabbotsford.co.uk/history/ |title=Walter Scott was the foremost literary figure of his days |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drabble,, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Drabble]] in ''A Writer's Britain'' suggests that Thomas Hardy "is perhaps the greatest writer of rural life and landscape" in English.&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
Among European writers influenced by Scott were Frenchmen [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]] and Italian [[Alessandro Manzoni]].&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p. 166; [http://www.france.fr/en/literature-and-french-language/alexandre-dumas-1802-1870.html/ "Alexandre Dumas": The official French site]&lt;/ref&gt; Manzoni's famous novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' was inspired by [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;From Georg Lukàcs, "The Historical Novel" (1969): "In Italy Scott found a successor who, though in a single, isolated work, nevertheless broadened his tendencies with superb originality, in some respect surpassing him. We refer, of course, to Manzoni's ''I Promessi Sposi'' (The Betrothed). Scott himself recognized Manzoni's greatness. When in Milan Manzoni told him that he was his pupil, Scott replied that in that case Manzoni's was his best work. It is, however, very characteristic that while Scott was able to write a profusion of novels about English and Scottish society, Manzoni confined himself to this single masterpiece."&lt;/ref&gt;

====North America====
Also influenced by Romanticism's approach to landscape was the American novelist [[Fenimore Cooper]], who was admired by [[Victor Hugo]] and Balzac and characterized as the "American [[Walter Scott|Scott]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Phillips|Phillips, 1913]], p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
Landscape in [[Chinese poetry]] has often been closely tied to Chinese landscape painting, which developed much earlier than in the West. Many poems evoke specific paintings, and some are written in more empty areas of the scroll itself. Many painters also wrote poetry, especially in the [[scholar-official]] or literati tradition.  Landscape images were present in the early ''[[Shijing]]'' and the ''[[Chuci]]'', but in later poetry the emphasis changed, as in painting]] to the ''[[Shan shui]]'' ({{zh|山水}} lit. "mountain-water") style featuring wild mountains, rivers and lakes, rather than landscape as a setting for a human presence.&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"/&gt;  [[Shanshui poetry]] {{CJKV|t=山水詩|s=山水诗}} developed in China during the third and fourth centuries AD&lt;ref name="Yip, 130"&gt;Yip, 130&lt;/ref&gt; and left most of the varied landscapes of China largely unrepresented. ''Shan shui'' painting and poetry shows imaginary landscapes, though with features typical of some parts of South China; they remain popular to the present day.

[[Fields and Gardens poetry]] ({{zh|t=田園詩|s=田园诗|p=tiányuán shī|w=t'ien-yuan-shih|l=fields and gardens poetry}}), in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]]) was a contrasting poetic movement which lasted for centuries, with a focused on the nature found in gardens, in backyards, and in the cultivated countryside. Fields and Gardens poetry is one of many [[Classical Chinese poetry genres]].  One of the main practitioners of the Fields and Gardens poetry genre was Tao Yuanming (also known as [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] (365–427), among other names or versions of names).&lt;ref&gt;Yip, 163-169&lt;/ref&gt; Tao Yuanming has been regarded as the first great poet associated with the Fields and Gardens poetry genre.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

====Landscape photography====

[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|''The Tetons and the Snake River'' (1942) photograph by [[Ansel Adams]]]]
Many landscape photographs show little or no human activity and are created in the pursuit of a pure, unsullied depiction of [[nature]]&lt;ref name="Photography: A Cultural History 136"&gt;Mary Warner Marien (2006). ''Photography: A Cultural History''. Laurence King Publishing. Page 136.&lt;/ref&gt; devoid of human influence, instead featuring subjects such as strongly defined landforms, weather, and ambient light. As with most forms of art, the definition of a landscape photograph is broad, and may include urban settings, industrial areas, and [[nature photography]]. Notable landscape photographers include [[Ansel Adams]], [[Galen Rowell]], [[Edward Weston]], [[Ben Heine]], Mark Gray and [[Judges Postcards|Fred Judge]].

====Landscape painting====
{{Main article|Landscape painting|Aerial landscape art}}
[[File:Salomon van Ruisdael Deventer.jpg|left|thumb|[[Salomon van Ruisdael]], "View of Deventer" (1657). ]]
The earliest forms of art around the world depict little that could really be called [[Landscape painting|landscape]], although ground-lines and sometimes indications of mountains, trees or other natural features are included. The earliest "pure landscapes" with no human figures are [[fresco]]s from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Greece]] of around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 53. The only very complete example is now in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hunting scenes, especially those set in the enclosed vista of the reed beds of the [[Nile Delta]] from Ancient Egypt, can give a strong sense of place, but the emphasis is on individual plant forms and human and animal figures rather than the overall landscape setting. For a coherent depiction of a whole landscape, some rough system of perspective, or scaling for distance, is needed, and this seems from literary evidence to have first been developed in [[Ancient Greece]] in the [[Hellenistic]] period, although no large-scale examples survive. More [[Ancient Roman art|ancient Roman]] landscapes survive, from the 1st century BCE onwards, especially frescos of landscapes decorating rooms that have been preserved at archaeological sites of [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]] and elsewhere, and [[mosaic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese [[Ink and wash painting|ink painting]] tradition of [[shan shui]] ("mountain-water"), or "pure" landscape, in which the only sign of human life is usually a sage, or a glimpse of his hut, uses sophisticated landscape backgrounds to figure subjects, and landscape art of this period retains a classic and much-imitated status within the Chinese tradition.

Both the Roman and Chinese traditions typically show grand panoramas of imaginary landscapes, generally backed with a range of spectacular mountains – in China often with waterfalls and in Rome often including sea, lakes or rivers. These were frequently used to bridge the gap between a foreground scene with figures and a distant panoramic vista, a persistent problem for landscape artists.

A major contrast between landscape painting in the West and East Asia has been that while in the West until the 19th century it occupied a low position in the accepted [[hierarchy of genres]], in East Asia the classic Chinese mountain-water ink painting was traditionally the most prestigious form of visual art. However, in the West, history painting came to require an extensive landscape background where appropriate, so the theory did not entirely work against the development of landscape painting – for several centuries landscapes were regularly promoted to the status of history painting by the addition of small figures to make a narrative scene, typically religious or mythological.

[[Dutch Golden Age painting]] of the 17th century saw the dramatic growth of landscape painting, in which many artists specialized, and the development of extremely subtle realist techniques for depicting light and weather. The popularity of landscapes in the [[Netherlands]] was in part a reflection of the virtual disappearance of religious painting in a [[Calvinist]] society, and the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe combined with [[Romanticism]] to give landscapes a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century art than they had assumed before.

In England, landscapes had initially been mostly backgrounds to portraits, typically suggesting the parks or estates of a landowner, though mostly painted in London by an artist who had never visited the site. the English tradition was founded by [[Anthony van Dyck]] and other, mostly [[Flemish people|Flemish]], artists working in England. By the beginning of the 19th century the English artists with the highest modern reputations were mostly dedicated landscapists, showing the wide range of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] interpretations of the English landscape found in the works of [[John Constable]], [[J.M.W. Turner]] and [[Samuel Palmer]]. However all these had difficulty establishing themselves in the contemporary art market, which still preferred history paintings and portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74-75, 85-87&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State 1836.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Cole]] "The Course of Empire The Arcadian or Pastoral State", US, 1836. ]]

In Europe, as [[John Ruskin]] said,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Modern Painters]]'', volume three, "Of the novelty of landscape".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] confirmed, landscape painting was the "chief artistic creation of the nineteenth century", and "the dominant art", with the result that in the following period people were "apt to assume that the appreciation of natural beauty and the painting of landscape is a normal and enduring part of our spiritual activity"&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romantic movement intensified the existing interest in landscape art, and remote and wild landscapes, which had been one recurring element in earlier landscape art, now became more prominent.  The German [[Caspar David Friedrich]] had a distinctive style, influenced by his [[Art of Denmark|Danish training]]. To this he added a quasi-mystical Romanticism. French painters were slower to develop landscape painting, but from about the 1830s [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and other painters in the [[Barbizon School]] established a French landscape tradition that would become the most influential in Europe for a century, with the [[Impressionist]]s and [[Post-Impressionist]]s for the first time making landscape painting the main source of general stylistic innovation across all types of painting.

In the [[United States]], the [[Hudson River School]], prominent in the middle to late 19th century, is probably the best-known native development in landscape art. These painters created works of mammoth scale that attempted to capture the epic scope of the landscapes that inspired them. The work of [[Thomas Cole]], the school's generally acknowledged founder, has much in common with the philosophical ideals of European landscape paintings — a kind of secular faith in the spiritual benefits to be gained from the contemplation of natural beauty. Some of the later Hudson River School artists, such as [[Albert Bierstadt]], created less comforting works that placed a greater emphasis (with a great deal of Romantic exaggeration) on the raw, even terrifying power of nature. The best examples of Canadian landscape art can be found in the works of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], prominent in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;"Landscapes" in [http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=Landscape&amp;PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454 Virtual Vault], an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Carr]] was also closely associated with the Group of Seven, though was never an official member. Although certainly less dominant in the period after World War I, many significant artists still painted landscapes in the wide variety of styles exemplified by [[Neil Welliver]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Milton Avery]], [[Peter Doig]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[David Hockney]] and [[Sidney Nolan]].

The term [[neo-romanticism]] is applied in British art history, to a loosely affiliated school of landscape painting that emerged around 1930 and continued until the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;It was first labeled in March 1942 by the critic [[Raymond Mortimer]] in the ''New Statesman''.&lt;/ref&gt; These painters looked back to 19th-century artists such as [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]], but were also influenced by French cubist and post-cubist artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[André Masson]], and [[Pavel Tchelitchew]] ({{harvnb|Clark and Clarke|2001}}; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2001}}). This movement was motivated in part as a response to the threat of invasion during World War II. Artists particularly associated with the initiation of this movement included [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Ivon Hitchens]], and especially [[Graham Sutherland]]. A younger generation included [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], [[Michael Ayrton]], [[John Craxton]], [[Keith Vaughan]], [[Robert Colquhoun]], and [[Robert MacBryde]] {{harv|Button|1996}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7108">'''Landscape engineering''' is the application of [[mathematics]] and [[science]] to shape land and waterscapes. It can also be described as [[Sustainable engineering|green engineering]], but the design professionals best known for landscape engineering are [[landscape architecture|landscape architects]]. Landscape engineering is the interdisciplinary application of [[engineering]] and other [[applied science]]s to the design and creation of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] landscapes. It differs from, but embraces traditional [[land reclamation|reclamation]]. It includes scientific disciplines: [[Agronomy]], [[Botany]], [[Ecology]], [[Forestry]], [[Geology]], [[Geochemistry]], [[Hydrogeology]], and [[Wildlife biologist|Wildlife Biology]]. It also draws upon applied sciences: Agricultural &amp; Horticultural Sciences, Engineering [[Geomorphology]], landscape architecture, and [[Mining]], [[Geotechnical]], and Civil, Agricultural &amp; [[Irrigation]] Engineering.

Landscape engineering builds on the engineering strengths of declaring goals, determining initial conditions, iteratively designing, predicting performance based on knowledge of the design, monitoring performance, and adjusting designs to meet the declared goals. It builds on the strengths and history of reclamation practice. Its distinguishing feature is the marriage of landforms, substrates, and vegetation throughout all phases of design and construction, which previously have been kept as separate disciplines.

Though landscape engineering embodies all elements of traditional engineering (planning, investigation, design, construction, operation, assessment, research, management, and training), it is focused on three main areas. The first is closure planning – which includes goal setting and design of the landscape as a whole. The second division is landscape design more focused on the design of individual landforms to reliably meet the goals as set out in the closure planning process. Landscape performance assessment is critical to both of these, and is also important for estimating liability and levels of financial assurance. The iterative process of planning, design, and performance assessment by a multidisciplinary team is the basis of landscape engineering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4159">'''Landscaping''' refers to any activity that modifies the visible features of an area of land, including:

# living [[organism|elements]], such as [[flora]] or [[fauna]]; or what is commonly called [[gardening]], the art and craft of growing plants with a goal of creating a beauty within the [[landscape]].
# natural elements such as [[landform]]s, [[terrain]] shape and elevation, or [[water body|bodies of water]]; and
# abstract elements such as the [[weather]] and lighting conditions.
Landscaping requires expertise in [[horticulture]] and artistic design.

== Understanding the land ==

Construction requires study and observation. It is not the same in different parts of the world. Landscaping varies according to different [[region]]s.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diekelmann|first1=John|last2=Schuster|first2=Robert M.|title=Natural Landscaping: Designing with Native Plant Communities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmajmru4g98C|year=2002|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-17324-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, normally local natural experts are recommended if it is done for the first time. Understanding of the site is one of the chief essentials for successful landscaping. Different natural features like terrain, [[topography]], [[soil quality|soil qualities]], prevailing winds, depth of the [[frost line]], and the system of [[Native plant|native flora]] and fauna must be taken into account.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingels|first=Jack|title=Landscaping Principles and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ8XYcUOdI0C|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-4283-7641-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the land is not fit for landscaping. In order to landscape it, the land must be reshaped. This reshaping of land is called [[Grading (engineering)|grading]].&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;

[[Earth mover|Removal of earth]] from the land is called cutting while when earth is added to the slope, it is called filling. Sometimes the grading process may involve removal of excessive waste ([[landfill]]s), [[soil]] and rocks, so designers should take into account while in the planning stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slack|first=William|title=Landscaping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwUTtPGct40C|year=1998|publisher=Oxmoor House|isbn=978-0-8487-2251-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Rita|title=Taylor's Master Guide to Landscaping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-NnzL1gJeIC|year=2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-05590-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==

In the start, the [[landscaping contractor]] makes a letter which is a rough design and layout of what could be done with the land in order to achieve the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; Different pencils are required to make graphics of the picture. Landscaping has become more technological than natural, as few projects begin without [[bulldozers]], [[lawnmowers]], or [[chainsaws]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Different areas have different qualities of plants.  When growing new grass, it should ideally be done in the spring and the fall seasons to maximize growth and to minimize the spread of weeds. It is generally agreed that [[Fertilizers]] are required for good plant growth. Some landscapers prefer to use mix [[gravel]] with rocks of varying sizes to add interest in large areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sharon Cohoon and Jim McCausland |url=http://www.landscapingorlandopros.com/ |title=How to Landscape Gravel - Page 2 |publisher=Sunset.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319025558/http://www.sunset.com/garden/landscaping-design/landscaping-with-gravel-00400000011687/page2.html |archivedate=March 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Station number on a silt fence, Floyd County, GA.jpg|thumb|A station number written on a [[silt fence]] at a construction site]]
'''Linear referencing''' (also called '''linear reference system''' or '''linear referencing system''' or '''LRS'''), is a method of [[spatial referencing]], in which the locations of features are described in terms of measurements along a linear element, from a defined starting point, for example a [[milestone]] along a [[road]]. Each feature is located by either a point (e.g. a signpost) or a line (e.g. a no-passing zone). The system is designed so that if a segment of a route is changed, only those milepoints on the changed segment need to be updated.
Linear referencing is suitable for management of data related to linear features like [[road]]s, [[railway]]s, oil and gas transmission [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, power and [[data transmission]] lines, and [[river]]s.

==Motivation==
A system for identifying the location of pipeline features and characteristics is by measuring distance from the start of the pipeline. An example linear reference address is: Engineering Station 1145&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;86 on pipeline Alpha&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;114,586&amp;nbsp;feet from the start of the pipeline. With a [[reroute]], cumulative stationing might not be the same as engineering stationing, because of the addition of the extra pipeline. Linear referencing systems compute the differences to resolve this dilemma.

Linear referencing is one of a family of methods of expressing location. Coordinates such as [[latitude and longitude]] are another member of the family, as are [[landmark]] references such as "5 km south of Ayers Rock."  Linear referencing has traditionally been the expression of choice in engineering applications such as road and pipeline maintenance.  One can more realistically dispatch a worker to a bridge 12.7&amp;nbsp;km along a road from a reference point, rather than to a pair of coordinates or a landmark.  The road serves as the reference frame, just as the earth serves as the reference frame for latitude and longitude.

==Benefits==
Linear referencing can be used to define points along a linear feature with just a small amount of information such as the name of a road and the distance and bearing from a landmark along the road. This information can be communicated concisely via plaintext. For example: "State route 4, 20 feet east of mile marker 187." Giving a latitude and longitude coordinate to a work crew is not meaningful unless the coordinate is plotted on a map. Often work crews work in remote areas without wireless connectivity which makes on-line digital maps not practical, and the relatively higher effort of providing offline maps or printed maps is not as economical as simply stating locations as offsets, or ranges of offsets, along a linear feature.

Linear referencing systems can also be made to be both very precise and very accurate at a much lower cost than is needed to collect latitude and longitude coordinates with high accuracy, especially when the goal is sub-meter accuracy. This is highly dependent upon the width of the linear feature, its centerline, and the visibility of the landmarks and markers that are used to define linear reference offsets.

Often, roads are created by engineers using CAD tools that have no geospatial reference at all, and LRS is the preferred method of defining data for linear features.

==Limitations==
Consequently, a major limitation of linear referencing is that specifying points that are not on a linear feature is troublesome and error-prone, though not entirely impossible.  Consider for example a ski lodge located 100 meters to the right of the road, traveling north.  The linear referencing system can be extended by specifying a lateral offset, but the absolute location (i.e. coordinates) of the lodge cannot be determined unless coordinates are specified for the road; that process is prone to error particularly on curved roads.

Another major drawback of linear referencing is that a modification in the alignment of a road (e.g. constructing a bypass around a town) changes the measurements that reference all downstream points.  The system requires an extensive network of reference stations, and constant maintenance.  In an era of mobile maps and GPS, this maintenance overhead for linear referencing systems challenges its long-term viability. (But see below for US Federal Highway Administration requirement that all State DOTs use LRS.)

Nonetheless, travel along a road is a linear experience, and at the very least, linear referencing will continue to have a conversational role. Linear referencing systems are recognized by the US Federal government as a valuable tool for specifying right of way data, and are now actually required for the States. Therefore, it is not likely to see LRS usage decline any time soon.

==ARNOLD: US Federal Requirements for Highways==

The US Federal Highway Administration is pushing states to move closer to standardization of LRS data with the ARNOLD requirement. To wit:

"On August 7, 2012, FHWA announced that the HPMS is expanding the requirement for State
Departments of Transportation (DOTs) to submit their LRS to include all public roads. This requirement
will be referred to as the All Road Network of Linear Referenced Data (ARNOLD)" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Road Network of Linear Referenced Data (ARNOLD) Reference Manual|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms/documents/arnold_reference_manual_2014.pdf|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ARNOLD requirement sets the stage for systems that utilize both LRS and coordinates. Both systems are useful in different contexts, and while using latitude and longitude is becoming very popular due to the availability of practical and affordable devices for capturing and displaying global coordinate data, the use of LRS has widely been adopted for planning, engineering, and maintenance.

==Tors in Great Britain==

===Dartmoor===
{{details|topic=Dartmoor's tors|List of Dartmoor tors and hills}}
[[File:Saddle tor to Hey tor pano.jpg|Panorama of some of Dartmoor's tors in the snow|right|thumb]]
Dartmoor represents one of the largest areas of exposed granite in the United Kingdom, covering an area of 368 square miles (954 square kilometres).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/index/aboutus.htm Dartmoor National Park Authority website. Retrieved 12 October 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805074307/http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/index/aboutus.htm |date=5 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a chain of granite stretching through Cornwall, as far as the [[Isles of Scilly]].

Some of the more durable granite survived to form the rocky crowns of Dartmoor tors. One of the best known is at [[Haytor]], on the eastern part of the moor, whose granite is of unusually fine quality and was quarried from the hillside below the tor during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Its stone was used to construct the pillars outside the [[British Museum]] in London, and to build [[London Bridge]]. The last granite to be quarried there was used to build [[Exeter]] War Memorial in 1919.

[[Ten Tors]] is an annual weekend [[hiking|hike]] on Dartmoor.

==On the use of country codes==
The use of country codes in conjunction with postal codes started as a recommendation from CEPT ([[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations]]) in the 1960s. In the original CEPT-recommendation the [[List of international license plate codes|distinguishing signs of motor vehicles in international traffic]] ("car codes") were placed before the postal code, and separated from it by a "-" (dash).  Codes were only used on international mail and were hardly ever used internally in each country.

Since the late 1980s, however, a number of postal administrations have changed the recommended codes to the two-letter country codes of [[ISO 3166]]. This would allow a universal, standardized code set to be used, and bring it in line with country codes used elsewhere in the UPU ([[Universal Postal Union]]). Attempts were also made (without success) to make this part of the official address guidelines of the UPU. Recently introduced postal code systems where the UPU has been involved have included the [[ISO 3166]] country code as an integral part of the postal code.

At present there are no universal guidelines as to which code set to use, and recommendations vary from country to country. In some cases, the applied country code will differ according to recommendations of the sender's postal administration. UPU recommends that the country name always be included as the last line of the address.

In the list above, the following principles have been applied:

* Integral country codes have been included in the code format, in bold type and without brackets. These are also used on internal mail in the respective countries.
* The [[ISO 3166]] codes is used alone for countries that have explicitly recommended them.
* Where there is no explicit recommendation for [[ISO 3166]] codes and the codes differ, both "car codes" and [[ISO 3166]] codes are listed, with the "car code" listed first.

:'' Redirected here: '''feet above sea level'''
'''Metres above mean sea level''' ('''MAMSL''') or simply '''metres above sea level''' ('''MASL''' or '''m a.s.l.''') is a [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|standard]] [[metric system|metric]] [[measurement]] in [[metres]] of the [[elevation]] or [[altitude]] of a location in reference to a historic mean [[sea level]]. Mean sea levels are affected by [[climate change]] and other factors and change over time. For this and other reasons, recorded measurements of elevation above sea level might differ from the actual elevation of a given location over sea level at a given moment.

== Uses ==

Metres above sea level is the standard measurement of the elevation or altitude of:
* [[Geographic location]]s such as [[town]]s, [[mountain]]s and other [[landmark]]s.
* The top of [[building]]s and other [[nonbuilding structure|structure]]s.
* Flying objects such as [[airplane]]s or [[helicopters]].

== How it is determined ==

The elevation or altitude in metres above sea level of a location, object, or point can be determined in a number of ways. The most common include:
* [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), which triangulates a location in reference to multiple [[Artificial Satellite|satellite]]s.
* [[Altimeter]]s. They typically measure [[atmospheric pressure]], which decreases as altitude increases.
* [[Aerial photography]].
* [[Surveying]].

Accurate measurement of historical mean sea levels is complex. Land mass subsidence (as occurs naturally in some islands) can give the appearance of rising sea levels. Conversely, markings on land masses that are uplifted due to geological processes can suggest a lowering of mean sea level.

== Other measurement systems ==

[[Foot (length)|Feet]] above sea level is the most common analogue for metres above sea level in the US customary measurement system.

== Abbreviations ==

Metres above sea level is commonly abbreviated mamsl or MAMSL, based on the abbreviation AMSL for [[above mean sea level]]. Other abbreviations are m.a.s.l.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ricardo Bressani | first = Ricardo |author2=Carlos Chon | year = 1996 | title = Effects of altitude above sea level on the cooking time and nutritional value of common beans | journal = Plant Foods for Human Nutrition (Formerly Qualitas Plantarum) | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–61 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/index/H05M8274480PJTM4.pdf | accessdate = 2007-05-06 | doi = 10.1007/BF01092522}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MASL.&lt;ref name ="TD"&gt;{{cite web | title = Meters above Sea Level - What does MSL stand for?

'''[[Olfactory]] navigation''' is a hypothesis put forward to explain navigation and homing of [[pigeons]], in particular the [[homing pigeon]].

There are two principal versions. Papi’s mosaic model proposes that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental odours, within a radius of 70-100 kilometres. Wallraff’s gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation by proposing the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients. However, the evidence to suggest that pigeons use an ‘olfactory map’ in order to home is not conclusive.

==Background==
[[Homing (biology)|Homing]] can be defined as the ability to return to a set point from potentially anywhere on the earth’s surface, including destinations that are unfamiliar.  There are two criteria needed to coordinate this task, a [[compass]] sense (a sense of direction) and a [[map]] sense (a sense of location).  It is the ability to return from unfamiliar locations that posed the question of what sensory cues are used to determine locational information as well as directional information.  It has been proposed that the compass sense can be derived from a number of perspectives. [[Homing (biology)#Magnetic orientation|Magnetic orientation]] as a mechanism for directional sense was first put forward in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Von Middendorff|first=A.|year=1859|title=Die Isepiptesen Rußlands|journal=Mémoires de l'Académie impériale des sciences de St. Pétersbourg |series=Series VI |volume=8|pages=1–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viguier |first=C.|year=1882|title= Le sens de l’orientation et ses organes chez les animaux et chez l’homme|journal=Rev. phil. France Etranger|volume=14|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wil96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiltschko|first=W.|author2=Wiltschko, R.|year=1996|title=Magnetic orientation in birds |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |pages=29–38 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/199/1/29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, the sun could be used as a compass in order to navigate home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kramer | first1 = G | year = 1959 | title = Recent experiments on bird orientation | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.1959.tb02396.x | journal = Ibis | volume = 101 | issue = | pages = 399–416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, however, Papi and his contemporaries reported that [[anosmic]] pigeons (''Columbia livia'') were severely impaired in orientation and homing performance.&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt;  On the basis of their results, the hypothesis of ‘olfactory navigation’ was proposed.

==Olfactory map==
Two models for olfactory navigation have been proposed, Papi’s ‘mosaic’ model&lt;ref name=papi90&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ioalè |first=P. |author2=Nozzolini, M. |author3=Papi, F.|year=1990|title=Homing pigeons do extract directional information from olfactory stimuli|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=26|pages=301–305|doi=10.1007/bf00171094}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wallraff’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans G. Wallraff|title=Das Navigationssystem der Vögel: ein theoretischer Beitrag zur Analyse ungeklärter Orientierungsleistungen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7w1AAAAMAAJ|date=January 1974|publisher=R. Oldenbourg |location=München, Wien|isbn=978-3-486-39631-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘gradient’ model.  Papi’s mosaic hypothesis advocates that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental [[odours]], within a radius of 70-100 kilometres.&lt;ref name=good01&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodenough|first=J.|year=2001|title=Perspectives on Animal Behaviour|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this information, it is possible to derive the ‘home’ direction when encountering these odours at a release site.  An example of associated wind-borne scents would be pine forests, coastlines and pollution from cities.  It is argued that pigeons first learn to associate specific odours with particular locations during exercise and training flights.  This model has the advantage that it requires the bird only to detect the presence or absence of a range of odours.  Therefore, homing is viable only if the release sites are within a proximity that can provide reliable wind-borne cues,&lt;ref name=hudson03&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=M.|year=2003|title=What evidence is there to support pigeons (''Columbia livia'') use an ‘olfactory map’ in order to home?|publisher=Sussex University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Papi (1990),&lt;ref name=papi90/&gt; argues the utilisation of olfactory information obtained during the outward journey.

Wallraff’s gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation via different means.  It proposes the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients.  The foundation for this navigational map is a spatial representation in which two or more environmental odours have a particular intensity.  Odour gradient differs along dissimilar directional axes and, therefore, the pigeon can compare the intensity of the scent at a particular location to its concentration at the home loft.  This mechanism in principle could operate over vast distances, but would require the detection and interpretation of minute differences in odour concentration.  However, a more poignant question is the existence of predictable odour gradients.  Meteorologists&lt;ref&gt;Becker &amp; van Raden (1986). cited in {{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = R | year = 1996 | title = The Function of Olfactory Input in Pigeon Orientation: Does it Provide Navigational Information or Play Another Role? | url = | journal = J. Exp. Biol. | volume = 199 | issue = | pages = 113–119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; deny that odour gradients, as required by this hypothesis, exist in nature.

==Empirical evidence==
The olfactory navigation hypothesis states that pigeons learn an odour map by associating smells perceived at the [[Dovecote|home loft]] with the directions from which they are carried by winds.  Therefore, attempts to manipulate the development of that have involved changing the direction of wind, shielding birds from winds of a certain direction and exposing the pigeons to artificial odorants.  The predication is that the experimental pigeons should learn an altered map and thus when released, they should fly according to their distorted perception.

Such an experiment was conducted,&lt;ref&gt;Papi F, Ioalé P, Fiaschi V, Benvenuti S, Baldaccini NE (1974) Olfactory navigation of pigeons: The effect of treatment with odorous air currents. J Comp Physiol 94:187–193&lt;/ref&gt; where two groups of pigeons were reared in separate, although identical [[Aviary|aviaries]] composed of bamboo.  Group one had air blown from the south containing olive oil and air from the north containing synthetic turpentine.  This was reversed for group two.  The pigeons were then released east of the loft; half had a drop of synthetic turpentine added to the bill, while the others were given a drop of olive oil.  Pigeons from group one exposed to olive oil flew north, contrary to birds sentient to synthetic turpentine, which flew south.  Consistent, but reversed results were found in group two.

However, it is important to note that there has been a failure to replicate these results in other countries, such as Germany, Italy and the United States, even when considerable effort has been made to employ identical procedures.&lt;ref name=able96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Able|first=K.P.|year=1996|title=The debate over olfactory navigation by homing pigeons |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |pages=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, further experiments&lt;ref&gt;Baldaccini, NE, Benvenuti S, Fiaschi V, Ioale P, Papi F (1978) Investigation of pigeon homing by means of deflector cages. In: Schmidt-Koenig K, [[William Tinsley Keeton|Keeton WT]] (eds) Animal migration, navigation, and homing. Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York, pp 78–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kiepenheuer|first1=J. |year=1978 |title=Pigeon homing: A repetition of the deflector loft experiment |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=393–395 |doi=10.1007/BF00303201 |jstor=4599182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waldvogel JA 1978"&gt;Waldvogel JA, Benvenuti S, Keeton WT, Papi F (1978) Homing pigeon orientation influenced by deflected winds at home loft. J Comp Physiol 128:297–301&lt;/ref&gt; applied two different methods – namely the placement of fans near the home coop in order to reverse wind direction and usage of deflector lofts to shift the apparent direction of the wind by 90°.  Deflector lofts comprised wooden or glass baffles, which deflected wind course and therefore any signature odours.  Findings were that pigeons raised in such lofts oriented themselves with a magnitude of a 90° error, known as the ‘deflector loft effect’.  The wind reversed experiments, too, exhibited results that favoured the olfactory hypothesis, with experimentals on average flying in the opposing direction of home, while the controls took the correct flight path, when released from the same site.

In replication of the deflector loft experiments, similar findings were produced,&lt;ref name="Waldvogel JA 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kiepenheuer |first1=J.|year=1979 |title=Pigeon homing: deprivation of olfactory information does not affect the deflector effect |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=11–22 |doi=10.1007/BF00293240}}&lt;/ref&gt; though when [[anosmic]] pigeons where employed, they displayed the same degree of error in orientation as had previously been observed.  Therefore, suggesting that the detection of odours may not have been associated with the defector loft effect.  Indeed, the flight directions could simply reflect a directional response to wind experienced in the loft or by “other non-odorous factors”, such as light reflection.&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt;&lt;ref name=able96/&gt;  Researchers support these suggestions&lt;ref&gt;Bang (1971) and Wenzel (1972) cited in Baker, R.R. (1984) Bird Navigation: The Solution of a Mystery. Hodder and Stoughton Educational&lt;/ref&gt; by noting the lack of highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions in seed-eating birds such as pigeons.  It could be argued, therefore, that pigeons are not dominated by olfactory landmarks when constructing a navigatory map.

Conflicting evidence, however, was produced&lt;ref name=papi90/&gt; when pigeons were housed in open cages and exposed to a fan produced air current carrying the scent of [[benzaldehyde]].  When released with exposure only to the natural air during transport and at the release site, both experimentals and controls were homeward oriented.  Contrary if their response were simply to wind direction.

A consistent feature of the olfaction experiments is that anosmic pigeons that are released from familiar sites are essentially unaffected.&lt;ref name=able96/&gt;  Perhaps a common fault of the olfactory mosaic and gradient model of olfactory navigation is that each model is over simplistic and that they do not sufficiently take account of other cues that may be of importance.

==Other sensory cues==
The Earth’s magnetic field is a potential map cue as the field varies in both strength and direction over the Earth’s surface&lt;ref name=walcott96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walcott|first=C.|year=1996|title=Pigeon homing: observations, experiments and confusions|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manipulations of the ambient magnetic field are rather difficult, although [[William Tinsley Keeton|Keeton]] (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keeton | first1 = W. T. | year = 1971 | title = Magnets interfere with pigeon homing | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 102–106 | doi=10.1073/pnas.68.1.102 | pmid=5276278 | pmc=391171}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ioalé (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ioalé |first=P. |year=1984 |title=Magnets and pigeon orientation |journal=Monitore Zoologico Italiano |volume=18 |pages=347–358 |doi=10.1080/00269786.1984.10736466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt; did report that magnets caused disorientation in pigeons when they were released under total overcast.  This first indication for magnetic compass orientation in homing was later supported by other studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walcott | first1 = C. | last2 = Green | first2 = R. P. | year = 1974 | title = Orientation of homing pigeons altered by a change in the direction of the applied magnetic field | url = | journal = Science | volume = 184 | issue = | pages = 180–182 | doi=10.1126/science.184.4133.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Visalberghi | first1 = E. | last2 = Alleva | first2 = E. | year = 1979 | title = Magnetic influences on pigeon homing | url = | journal = Biologica Bulletino | volume = 125 | issue = | pages = 246–256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which reversed the field around the head of the pigeon using battery operated [[magnetic coil|coils]].  Though the coils had little effect in clear conditions, their effect under overcast conditions was dependent on the direction of the current.  Another observation consistent with the idea of a geomagnetic map is the shift in the initial bearings of pigeons that occurs when the field increases during magnetic storms.&lt;ref name=good01/&gt;  In [[magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] too, pigeons are disoriented, even under sunny conditions.&lt;ref name=walcott96/&gt;

The predictable 15° movement per hour of the sun from east to west, signifies its potential as a celestial compass.  This is possible providing the time of day is known and is achievable by birds due to their internal biological clock.&lt;ref name=hudson03/&gt;  Experiments to test this hypothesis, using the migratory [[European Starling|European starling]], indicated that the direction of migration could be manipulated by reflecting the angle of the sun.&lt;ref name=good01/&gt;  This effect was reproduced using homing pigeons. Although this study is of value in demonstrating mechanisms other than olfaction in bird navigation, it does not refer to pigeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt-Koenig |first=K. |year=1958 |title=Experimentelle Einflußnahme auf die 24-Stunden-Periodik bei Brieftauben und deren Auswirkung unterbesonderer Berücksichtigung des Heimfindevermögens |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |volume=15 |pages=301–331 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1958.tb00568.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inconclusive evidence==
The fundamental question of olfaction map sense in pigeons is ‘can they smell?’  Available evidence suggests that pigeons lack highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions – yet empirical evidence has shown that the homing ability of pigeons can be compromised by interfering with the olfactory environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Having the nerve to home: trigeminal magnetoreceptor versus olfactory mediation of homing in pigeons |year=2006 |first1=A. |last1=Gagliardo |first2=P. |last2=Ioale |first3=M.

The difference in longitude Δ''λ&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;'' is unknown and has to be calculated using [[meridional parts]] as in [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] sailing.

Both spellings ("plane" and "plain") have been in use for several centuries,&lt;ref&gt;"A Token for Ship-Boys, or Plain Sailing made more plain" (Adam Martindale, 1683, ''A Collection of Letters for Improvement of Husbandry &amp; Trade'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The rudiments, which would no sooner be run over, than the rest would become plain sailing." (Fanny Burney, 1796, ''Camilla'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Plane sailing is based on the assumption that the meridian through the point of departure, the parallel through the destination, and the course line form a right triangle in a plane, called the "plane sailing triangle".

The expressions "plane sailing" (or more commonly "plain sailing") has, by analogy, taken on a more general meaning of any activity that is relatively straightforward.

'''Plantmaps.com''' is reference  website that contains several interactive maps and tools to assist gardeners, botanists, farmers and horticulturalists.  By entering a ZIP code, users can find the USDA hardiness zone, first and last frost dates, heat zones, drought conditions and annual climatology for their area.

==Website tools==

===Interactive USDA Hardiness Zone map===
[[File:California-usda-hardiness-zones.png|frame|110px|right|alt=California USDA Hardiness Zone Map|California USDA Hardiness Zone Map&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-california-usda-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php |title=California USDA Hardiness Zone Map |publisher=Plantmaps |date= |accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
built using the google maps api, plantmaps.com has the only fully interactive [[USDA]] [[hardiness zones]] map available on the web.  In addition to plant hardiness zone map covering the [[continental United States]], there are detailed interactive hardiness zone maps for each individual state.  Plantmaps allows the user to locate their hardiness zone based on current US Postal Service ZIP codes.  The [[ZIP code]] search will zoom to the coverage area of the selected ZIP code.

===Hardiness Zone to ZIP code search===
Plantmaps allows other websites to embed the USDA hardiness zone to ZIP code search tool in their websites by adding an [[iframe]] widget to their site, allowing visitors to easily find their local hardiness zone.

===Plantmaps zones===
[[File:Georgia-plantmaps-hardiness-zones.png|frame|110px|right|alt=2009 Plantmaps Hardiness Zone Map for Georgia|2009 Plantmaps Hardiness Zone Map for Georgia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-georgia-plant-maps-zone-hardiness-map.php |title=Interactive Plantmaps 2009 Plant Hardiness Zone Map for Georgia |publisher=Plantmaps |date= |accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
In response to the latency of the current official USDA hardiness zone map (produced in 1990 using data from 1974 to 1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ |title=US National Arboretum |publisher=US National Arboretum |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; plantmaps has created a new hardiness zone map using historical data from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] that covers longer time periods and uses [[climate]] record data from as recently as 2009.  There is an updated plantmaps hardiness zones map for each individual state in the Continental US.

===Interactive first and last frost maps===
Using long term climatology data from the National Climatology Data Center, Plantmaps has created interactive average annual first frost and average annual last frost date maps for each individual state.  These maps break the average frost dates into 10 day/date increments.

===Interactive drought monitor===
Using [[shapefile]] data available from the National Drought Mitigation Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drought.unl.edu/dm/monitor.html |title=US Drought Monitor |publisher=National Drought Mitigation Center |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; plantmaps has created statewide interactive Drought Monitor Maps that are updated weekly with the latest drought monitor conditions throughout the US.

===Interactive Palmer Drought Index map===
Plantmaps provides an interactive [[Palmer Drought Index]] map for each state.  The interactive drought index maps use the latest data supplied by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and allows the map user to select and highlight the specific climate divisions in each state.

===Interactive ecoregions===
Plantmaps has created interactive versions of all available level IV [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] ecoregion maps that allow the user to zoom to identify each individual region. Ecoregions denote areas within which ecosystems (and the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions.htm |title=US EPA Ecoregions |publisher=EPA |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, level IV maps are available for all states except Arizona, California, Hawaii and Alaska.

===Interactive heat zone maps===
Plantmaps contains interactive heat zone maps for each state.  Heat zones display the average frequency of annual days where the temperature exceeds 86 degrees [[fahrenheit]].  Heat zones are useful for determining the survivability of specific plants and trees  in extreme temperature conditions.  It is also useful for determining suitability for plants and trees such as palm trees that require warm temperatures for growth.

===Interactive tree and plant distribution maps===
Plantmaps has interactive plant and tree distribution maps for 800 North American flora.  The distribution maps contain overlays of USDA hardiness zones for analysis of plant and tree range versus hardiness zone.

===Canada Hardiness Zone Map===
In January 2011, Plantmaps released an interactive Canada plant hardiness zone map using up to date climatology data from Canadian National Climate Data Archive.

[[File:Poifile.jpg|right|thumb|Viewing POI points on a [[Garmin]] GPS]]

A '''point of interest''', or '''POI''', is a specific point location that someone may find useful or interesting.  An example is a point on the [[Earth]] representing the location of the [[Space Needle]], or a point on [[Mars]] representing the location of the [[mountain]], [[Olympus Mons]]. Most consumers use the term when referring to hotels, campsites, fuel stations or any other categories used in modern [[Automotive navigation system|(automotive) navigation systems]]. 

Users of a [[mobile device]]s can be provided with geolocation and time aware POI service&lt;ref&gt;Yuan, Q., Cong, G., Ma, Z., Sun, A., &amp; Thalmann, N. M. (2013, July). Time-aware point-of-interest recommendation. In Proceedings of the 36th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval (pp. 363-372). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;, that recommends geolocations nearby and with a temporal relevance (e.g. POI to special services in a ski resort are available only in winter).

In medical fields such as [[histology]]/[[pathology]]/[[histopathology]], points of interest are selected from the general background in a [[field of view]]; for example, among hundreds of normal [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, the pathologist may find 3 or 4 [[neoplastic]] cells that stand out from the others upon [[staining]].

A [[region of interest]] (ROI) and a volume of interest (VOI) are similar in concept, denoting a region or a volume (which may contain various individual POIs).

The term is widely used in [[cartography]], especially in electronic variants including [[GIS]], and [[GPS navigation software]]. In this context the synonym [[waypoint]] is common.

A GPS point of interest specifies, at minimum, the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the POI, assuming a certain [[map datum]].  A name or description for the POI is usually included, and other information such as altitude or a telephone number may also be attached.  GPS applications typically use [[computer icon|icons]] to represent different categories of POI on a map graphically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.garmin.com/products/poiloader/|title=Garmin POI Loader|publisher=[[Garmin]]|accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==POI collections==
[[File:BMWPoiMap.jpg|right|thumb|Custom [[speed camera]] POI overlaid on a [[BMW]] navigation map]]

Digital maps for modern GPS devices typically include a basic selection of POI for the map area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poi66.com/tomtom|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616100017/http://www.poi66.com/tomtom|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-06-16|publisher=POI66|title=TomTom Points of Interest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However websites exist that specialize in the collection, verification, management and distribution of POI which [[end-user]]s can load onto their devices to replace or supplement the existing POI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waypointer.info|publisher=Waypointer|title=Waypointer - online POI manager|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219233045/http://waypointer.info/|archivedate=2014-12-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pintica.com|publisher=Pintica|title=Pintica - online POI manager}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of these websites are generic, and will collect and categorize POI for any interest, others are more specialized in a particular category (such as speed cameras) or [[GPS]] device (e.g. [[TomTom]]/[[Garmin]]).  End-users also have the ability to create their own custom collections.

Commercial POI collections, especially those that ship with digital maps, or that are sold on a [[subscription]] basis are usually protected by [[copyright]]. However, there are also many websites from which [[royalty-free]] POI collections can be obtained, e.g. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160506072606/http://gis.zcu.cz/spoi/ SPOI - Smart Points of Interest], which is distributed under [[ODbL]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Čerba|first1=Otakar|title=SPOI|url=http://gis.zcu.cz/spoi/doc/SPOI.pdf|publisher=SDI4Apps|accessdate=28 March 2016|pages=4|format=PDF|date=23 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701141304/http://gis.zcu.cz/spoi/doc/SPOI.pdf|archive-date=2016-07-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The applications for POI are extensive.  As GPS-enabled devices as well as software applications that use digital maps become more available, so too the applications for POI are also expanding.  Newer [[digital camera]]s for example can automatically [[geocoded photograph|tag]] a photograph using [[Exif]] with the GPS location where a picture was taken; these pictures can then be overlaid as POI on a digital map or [[satellite imagery|satellite image]] such as [[Google Earth]].  [[Geocaching]] applications are built around POI collections.  In [[Vehicle tracking system]]s POIs are used to mark destination points and/or offices to that users of [[GPS tracking software]] would easily monitor position of vehicles according to POIs.

==File formats==
Many different [[file format]]s, including [[proprietary format]]s, are used to store point of interest data, even where the same underlying [[WGS84]] system is used.

Reasons for variations to store the same data include:
* A lack of [[Technical standard|standards]] in this area ([[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]] is a notable attempt to address this).
* Attempts by some software vendors to protect their data through [[security through obscurity|obfuscation]].
* [[Licensing]] issues that prevent companies from using competitor's file specifications.
* [[Computer storage|Memory]] saving, for example, by converting [[floating point]] latitude and longitude co-ordinates into smaller [[integer]] values.
* Speed and battery life (operations using [[integer]] latitude and longitude values are less [[Central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive than those that use [[floating point]] values).
* Requirements to add custom fields to the data.
* Use of older reference systems that predate [[GPS]] (for example [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]] or the [[British national grid reference system]])
* Readability/possibility to edit (plain text files are human-readable and may be edited)

The following are some of the file formats used by different vendors and devices to exchange POI (and in some cases, also [[track (navigation)|navigation tracks]]):

* [[ASCII]] Text (.asc .txt .csv .plt)
* Topografix [[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]] (.gpx)
* [[Garmin]] Mapsource (.gdb)
* [[Google Earth]] [[Keyhole Markup Language]] (.kml .kmz)
* Pocket Street Pushpins (.psp)
* Maptech Marks (.msf)
* Maptech Waypoint (.mxf)
* [[Microsoft MapPoint]] Pushpin (.csv)
* [[OziExplorer]] (.wpt)
* [[TomTom]] Overlay (.ov2) and TomTom plain text format (.asc)
* [[OpenStreetMap]] data (.osm)

[[Third-party developer|Third party]] and vendor-supplied utilities are available to convert point of interest data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CamperVanNZ|url=http://www.gps-data-team.com/convert.php|title=Convert POI (Online)}}&lt;/ref&gt; between different formats to allow them to be exchanged between otherwise incompatible GPS devices or systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RJ Davies|url=http://rjdavies.users.btopenworld.com/html/poiconverter.html|title=POIConverter|accessdate=2008-01-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229233124/http://rjdavies.users.btopenworld.com/html/poiconverter.html|archivedate=2007-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, many applications will support the generic [[ASCII]] text file format, although this format is more prone to error due to its loose structure as well as the many ways in which GPS co-ordinates can be represented (e.g. decimal vs degree/minute/second). POI format converters are often named after the POI file format they convert and convert to, such as KML2GPX (converts KML to GPX) and KML2OV2 (converts KML to OV2).

'''Precise Point Positioning''' (PPP) is a [[Global Navigation Satellite System]] (GNSS) [[GNSS positioning calculation|positioning method to calculate]] very precise positions up to few centimeter level using a single (GNSS) receiver in a dynamic and global reference framework like [[International Terrestrial Reference System]] (ITRS). PPP methods are different from ([[Differential GPS|DGNSS]]) positioning methods which differentiate errors using one or more reference stations with known positions. The PPP approach combines precise clocks and orbits, so-called precise ephemeris,  calculated from a global network to calculate a precise position with a single receiver, which can be double or single frequency.

Historically precise positioning was associated with [[surveying]] and [[geodesy]]. It makes use of carrier-phase observables, allowing positioning precisions of a fraction of a carrier wavelength, 19 or 24 cm. It also makes use of precise ephemeris, generated by the geodetic community -- the IGS, [http://www.igs.org/ International GNSS Service] -- from measurements by a global network of tracking stations. Recently, the dissemination over the Internet in low-latency real time -- e.g., [http://apps.gdgps.net/ APPS], the Automatic Precise Positioning Service of NASA JPL -- has made possible to do such precise positioning also in real time, giving us the PPP technique.  

With the advent of [[Global Navigation Satellite System]]s (GNSS) such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), precise positioning has been incorporated into production processes in mining, agriculture and construction. The main application has been in [[machine guidance]] and machine automation which require high levels of precision.

Precise positioning is also increasingly used in the fields of [[robotics]] and autonomous navigation.

A '''principal meridian''' is a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] used for survey control in a large region.

==Canada==
The [[Dominion Land Survey]] of [[Western Canada]] took its origin at the First (or Principal) Meridian, located at 97°27′28.41″ west of [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich]], just west of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]. This line is exactly ten miles west of the Red River at the Canada-United States border.

Six other meridians were designated at four-degree intervals westward, with the seventh located in British Columbia; the second and fourth meridians form the general eastern border and the western border of [[Saskatchewan]].

==United States==
[[File:Meridians-baselines.png|thumb|300px|right|This [[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] map depicts the principal meridians and [[baseline (surveying)|baselines]] used for surveying states (colored) in the PLSS.]]
In the [[United States]] [[Public Land Survey System]], a principal meridian is the principal north-south line used for survey control in a large region, and which  divides townships between east and west. The meridian meets its corresponding [[baseline (surveying)|baseline]] at the point of origin, or [[initial point]], for the land survey. For example, the [[Mount Diablo Meridian]], used for surveys in California and Nevada, runs north-south through the summit of [[Mount Diablo State Park|Mount Diablo]].

Often, meridians are marked with roads, such as the Meridian Avenue in [[San Jose, California]], Meridian Road in [[Vacaville, California]], both on the [[Mount Diablo Meridian]], Meridian Road in [[Wichita, Kansas]] on the Sixth Principal Meridian, and Meridian Avenue in several western Washington counties generally following the Willamette Meridian.  Baseline Road or Base Line Street extends for about 40 miles from [[Highland, California]] east of San Bernardino to [[La Verne, California]] where it meets Foothill Boulevard.

The '''quantitative revolution''' ('''QR''')[[#References|&lt;sup&gt;[n]&lt;/sup&gt;]] was a [[paradigm shift]] that sought to develop a more rigorous and systematic methodology for the discipline of geography. It came as a response to the inadequacy of regional geography to explain general spatial dynamics. The main claim for the quantitative revolution is that it led to a shift from a descriptive ([[idiographic]]) geography to an empirical law-making ([[nomothetic]]) geography. The quantitative revolution occurred during the 1950s and 1960s and marked a rapid change in the method behind geographical research, from [[regional geography]] into a [[spatial science]].&lt;ref name="UA"&gt;
   "The ‘Quantitative Revolution’", GG3012(NS) Lecture 4,
   University of Aberdeen, 2011, webpage:
   [http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/n.spedding/pages/gg3012/qrev.html  AB12].

In the history of [[geography]], the quantitative revolution was one of the four major turning-points of modern geography – the other three being [[environmental determinism]], [[regional geography]] and [[critical geography]]).

The quantitative revolution had occurred earlier in [[economics]] and [[psychology]] and contemporaneously in [[political science]] and other [[social sciences]] and to a lesser extent in [[history]].

==Antecedents==

During the late 1940s and early 1950s:
* The closing of many geography departments and courses in universities took place, e.g. the abolition of the geography program at [[Harvard University]] (a highly prestigious institution) in 1948.
* There was continuing division between [[Human geography|human]] and [[physical geography]] – general talk of [[human geography]] becoming an autonomous subject.
*Geography was regarded as overly descriptive and ''unscientific'' – it was claimed that there was no explanation of ''why'' processes or phenomena occurred.
*Geography was seen as exclusively educational – there were few if any applications of contemporary geography.
*Continuing debates regarding what geography is – [[science]], [[art]], humanity or [[social science]] – took place.
*After World War II, technology became increasingly important in society, and as a result, [[nomothetic]]-based sciences gained popularity and prominence.

All of these events presented a threat to geography's position as an academic subject, and thus geographers began seeking new methods to counter critique.

==The Revolution==

The quantitative revolution responded to the regional geography [[paradigm]] that was dominant at the time. Debates raged predominantly (although not exclusively) in the U.S., where [[regional geography]] was the major philosophical school. In the early 1950s, there was a growing sense that the existing [[paradigm]] for geographical research was not adequate in explaining how physical, economic, social, and political processes are spatially organized, ecologically related, or how outcomes generated by them are evidence for a given time and place. A growing number of geographers started to express their dissatisfaction with the traditional [[paradigm]] of the discipline and its focus on regional geography, deeming the work as too descriptive, fragmented, and non-generalizable. To address these concerns, early critics such as Ackerman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ackerman|first1=E.A.|title=Geographic training, wartime research, and immediate professional objectives|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|date=1945|volume=35|pages=121–43|doi=10.1080/00045604509357271}}--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). ''Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945'' (7th ed). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested the systematization of the discipline. Soon thereafter, a series of debates regarding methodological approaches in geography took place. One of the first illustrations of this was the [[Fred K. Schaefer|Schaefer]] vs. [[Richard Hartshorne|Hartshorne]] debate. In 1953 ''Exceptionalism in geography: A Methodological Examination'' was published. In this work, [[Fred K. Schaefer|Schaefer]] rejected [[Richard Hartshorne|Hartshorne]]’s [[Exceptionalism|exceptionalist]] interpretations about the discipline of geography and having the region as its central object of study. Instead, [[Fred K. Schaefer|Schaefer]] envisioned as the discipline’s main objective the establishment of morphological laws through scientific inquiry, i.e. incorporating laws and methods from other disciplines in the social sciences that place a greater emphasis on processes. [[Richard Hartshorne|Hartshorne]], on the other hand, addressed [[Fred K. Schaefer|Schaefer]]’s criticism in a series of publications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartshorne|first1=Richard|title=Comment on 'Exceptionalism in geography'|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|date=1954|volume=38|pages=108–9|doi=10.2307/2561120}}--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016).

New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartshorne|first1=Richard|title='Exceptionalism in Geography' re-examined|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|date=1955|volume=45|pages=205–44|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1955.tb01671.x}}--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016).

''Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945'' (7th ed). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartshorne|first1=Richard|title=Perspective on the Nature of Geography|date=1959|publisher=Rand McNally|location=Chicago}}--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). ''Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945'' (7th ed). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; where he dismissed [[Fred K. Schaefer|Schaefer]]’s views as subjective and contradictory. He also stressed the importance of describing and classifying places and phenomena, yet admitted that there was room for employing laws of generic relationships in order to maximize scientific understanding. In his view, however, there should be no hierarchy between these two approaches.

While debates about methods carried on, the institutionalization of systematic geography was taking place in the U.S. academy. The geography programs at the [[University of Iowa]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]], and [[University of Washington|Washington]] were pioneering programs in that respect. At the [[University of Iowa]], Harold McCarty led efforts to establish laws of association between geographical patterns. At the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], [[Arthur H. Robinson]] led efforts to develop statistical methods for map comparison. And at the [[University of Washington]], [[Edward Ullman]] and [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]] worked on developing the field of [[Economic geography|economic]] and [[urban geography]], and [[central place theory]]. These institutions engendered a generation of geographers that established spatial analysis as part of the research agenda at other institutions including [[University of Chicago]], [[Northwestern University]], [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]], [[The Ohio State University]], the [[University of Michigan]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Ron|last2=Sidaway|first2=James|title=Geography &amp; Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=64–76|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Dictionary of Human Geography"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Derek|last2=Johnston|first2=Ron|last3=Pratt|first3=Geraldine|last4=Watts|first4=Michael J.|last5=Whatmore|first5=Sarah|title=The Dictionary of Human Geography|date=2009|publisher=Willey-Blackwell|location=USA &amp; UK|pages=611–12|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes introduced during the 1950s and 1960s under the banner of bringing 'scientific thinking' to geography led to an increased use of technique-based practices, including an array of mathematical techniques and computerized [[Statistical technique|statistics]] that improved precision, and theory-based practices to conceptualize location and space in geographical research.&lt;ref name="The Dictionary of Human Geography"/&gt;

Some of the techniques that epitomize the quantitative revolution include:&lt;ref name=UA/&gt;
* [[Descriptive statistics]];
* [[Inferential statistics]];
* Basic mathematical equations and models, such as [[trip distribution#Gravity model|gravity model]] of social physics, or the Coulomb equation;
* [[Stochastic model]]s using concepts of [[probability]], such as spatial diffusion processes;
* [[Deterministic model]]s, e.g. [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen|Von Thünen's]] and [[Alfred Weber|Weber's]] [[Location theory|location models]].

The common factor, linking the above techniques, was a preference for numbers over words, plus a belief that numerical work had a superior scientific pedigree.&lt;ref name=UA/&gt;

==Epistemological underpinnings==

The new method of inquiry led to the development of generalizations about spatial aspects in a wide range of natural and cultural settings.  Generalizations may take the form of tested [[hypotheses]], [[Conceptual model|model]]s, or [[theories]], and the research is judged on its scientific validity, turning geography into a [[nomothetic]] science.

One of the most significant works to provide a legitimate theoretical and philosophical foundation for the reorientation of geography into a spatial science was [[David Harvey]]’s book, ''Explanation in Geography'', published in 1969. In this work, [[David Harvey|Harvey]] laid out two possible methodologies to explain geographical phenomena: an inductive route where generalizations are made from observation; and a deductive one where, through empirical observation, testable models and hypothesis are formulated and later verified to become scientific laws.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (1969). ''Explanation in Geography''. London: Edward Arnold --as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). ''Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945'' (7th ed). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; He placed preference on the latter method. This [[Positivism|positivist]] approach was countered by [[critical rationalism]], a philosophy advanced by [[Karl Popper]] who rejected the idea of verification and maintained that hypothesis can only be falsified. Both epistemological philosophies, however, sought to achieve the same objective: to produce scientific laws and theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Ron|last2=Sidaway|first2=James|title=Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=77–80|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[paradigm]] shift had its strongest repercussions in the sub-field of [[Economic geography|economic]] and [[urban geography]], especially as it pertains to [[location theory]]. However, some geographers–such as Ian Burton–expressed their dissatisfaction with quantification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burton|first1=I.|title=The quantitative revolution and theoretical geography|journal=Canadian Geographer|date=1963|volume=7|pages=151–62|doi=10.1111/j.1541-0064.1963.tb00796.x}}--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). ''Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945'' (7th ed). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; while others – such as [[Emrys Jones (geographer)|Emrys Jones]], Peter Lewis, and Golledge and Amedeo – debated the feasibility of law-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Emrys|title=Cause and effect in human geography|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|date=1956|volume=46|pages=369–77|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1956.tb01515.x}}--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016).

''Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945'' (7th ed). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as F. Luckermann, criticized the scientific explanations offered in geography as conjectural and lacking empirical basis. As a result, even models that were tested failed to accurately depict reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luckermann|first1=F.|title=Geography: De facto or de jure|journal=Journal of the Minnesota Academy of Science|date=1965|volume=32|pages=189–96}}--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). ''Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945'' (7th ed). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s the quantitative revolution had successfully displaced regional geography from its dominant position and the paradigm shift was evident by the myriad of publications in geographical academic journals and geography textbooks. The adoption of the new paradigm allowed the discipline to be more serviceable to the public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Ron|last2=Sidaway|first2=James|title=Geography &amp; Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=64–76|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-revolution geography==

The quantitative revolution had enormous implications in shaping the discipline of geography into what it looks like today given that its effects led to the spread of positivist (post-positivist) thinking and counter-positivist responses.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). ''Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945'' (7th ed). New York: Routledge. Ch. 3-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The rising interest in the study of distance as a critical factor in understanding the spatial arrangement of phenomena during the revolution led to formulation of the [[first law of geography]] by Waldo Tobler. The development of spatial analysis in geography led to more applications in planning process and the further development of [[theoretical geography]] offered to geographical research a necessary theoretical background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Derek|last2=Johnston|first2=Ron|last3=Pratt|first3=Geraldine|last4=Watts|first4=Michael J.|last5=Whatmore|first5=Sarah|title=The Dictionary of Human Geohraphy|date=2009|publisher=Willey-Blackwell|location=USA &amp; UK|page=608|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greater use of computers in geography also led to many new developments in [[geomatics]], such as the creation and application of [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and [[remote sensing]]. These new developments allowed geographers for the first time to assess complex models on a full-scale model and over space and time and the relationship between spatial entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Derek|last2=Johnston|first2=Ron|last3=Pratt|first3=Geraldine|last4=Watts|first4=Michael J.|last5=Whatmore|first5=Sarah|title=The Dictionary of Human Geohraphy|date=2009|publisher=Willey-Blackwell|location=USA &amp; UK|pages=277–79|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To some extent, the development of [[geomatics]] helped obscure the binary between [[Physical geography|physical]] and [[human geography]] to some extent, as the complexities of the human and natural environments could be assessed on new computable models.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). ''Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945'' (7th ed). New York: Routledge. P.84&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming focus on statistical modelling would, eventually, be the undoing of the quantitative revolution. Many geographers became increasingly concerned that these techniques simply put a highly sophisticated technical gloss on an approach to study that was barren of fundamental theory. Other critics argued that it removed the 'human dimension' from a discipline that always prided itself on studying the human and natural world alike. As the 1970s dawned, the quantitative revolution came under direct challenge.&lt;ref name=UA/&gt; The counter-positivist response came as geographers began to expose the inadequacy of quantitative methods to explain and address issues regarding race, gender, class and war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Derek|last2=Johnston|first2=Ron|last3=Pratt|first3=Geraldine|last4=Watts|first4=Michael J.|last5=Whatmore|first5=Sarah|title=The Dictionary of Human Geohraphy|date=2009|publisher=Willey-Blackwell|location=USA &amp; UK|page=612|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that regard, David Harvey disregarded earlier works where he advocated for the quantitative revolution and adopted a [[Marxist]] theoretical framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=David|title=Social Justice and the City|date=1973|publisher=Edward Arnold|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=David|title=Revolutionary and counter revolutionary theory in geography and the problem of ghetto formation|date=1972|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.1972.tb00486.x|volume=4|journal=Antipode|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon new subfields would emerge in [[human geography]] to contribute a new vocabulary for addressing these issues, most notably [[critical geography]] and [[feminist geography]].

[[File:Radio acoustic ranging graphic.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A 1931 U.S. Coast and Geodetic survey illustration of radio acoustic ranging using anchored station ships.]]

'''Radio acoustic ranging''', occasionally written as "'''radio-acoustic ranging'''" and sometimes abbreviated '''RAR''', was a method for determining a ship's precise location at sea by detonating an explosive charge underwater near the ship, detecting the arrival of the underwater sound waves at remote locations, and radioing the time of arrival of the sound waves at the remote stations to the ship, allowing the ship's crew to use [[triangulation]] to determine the ship's position. Developed by the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] in 1923 and 1924 for use in accurately fixing the position of [[survey ship]]s during [[hydrographic survey]] operations, it was the first [[navigation]] technique in human history other than [[dead reckoning]] that did not require visual observation of a landmark, marker, light, or [[celestial body]], and the first non-visual means to provide precise positions. First employed operationally in 1924, radio acoustic ranging remained in use until 1944, when new [[radio navigation]] techniques developed during [[World War II]] rendered it obsolete.

To fix their position using radio acoustic ranging, a ship's crew first ascertained the temperature and [[salinity]] of sea water in the vicinity of the ship to determine an accurate velocity of sound through the water. The crew then threw a small [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] bomb off the ship's stern. It exploded at a depth of about {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and a [[chronograph]] aboard the ship automatically recorded the time the explosion was heard at the ship. The sound traveled outward from the explosion, eventually reaching [[hydrophone]]s at known locations – shore stations, anchored manned station ships, or unmanned moored [[buoy]]s – at a distance from the ship. Each hydrophone was connected to a radio transmitter that automatically sent a signal indicating the time its hydrophone detected the sound. At the distances involved – generally less than {{convert|200|nmi|km}} – each of these radio signals arrived at the ship at essentially the same instant that each of the remote hydrophones detected the sound of the explosion. The ship's chronograph automatically recorded the time each radio signal arrived at the ship. By subtracting the time of the explosion from the time of radio signal reception, the ship's crew could determine the length of time the sound wave required to travel from the point of the explosion to each remote hydrophone and, knowing the speed of sound in the surrounding sea water, could multiply the sound's travel time by the velocity of sound in sea water to determine the distance between the explosion and the hydrophone. By determining the distance to at least two remote hydrophones in known locations, the ship's crew could use [[triangulation]] to fix the ship's position.&lt;ref name=theberge20091202&gt;[https://www.hydro-international.com/content/article/system-without-fixed-points Theberge, Alfred E., "System Without Fixed Points: Development of the Radio-Acoustic Ranging Navigation Technique (Part 1)," hydro-international.com, December 2, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rudemay1935&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PfM1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA68&amp;lpg=RA4-PA68&amp;dq=%22radio+acoustic+ranging%22+fifty+feet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JSxZo5V2TM&amp;sig=-GjCKkk_oG-n-Woucpb1s_URjto&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj48v69jJPQAhVC2GMKHfZkCbwQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radio%20acoustic%20ranging%22%20fifty%20feet&amp;f=false Rude, Gilbert T., "The Modern Chart," ''Motor Boating'', May 1935, pp. 35, 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In deep waters, such as those that prevailed in the [[Pacific Ocean]] along the [[United States West Coast]], the Coast and Geodetic Survey could rely upon shore stations to support radio acoustic ranging because the deep water allowed sound to travel to the coast. Along the [[United States East Coast]], where shallower waters prevailed, sound had greater difficulty in reaching the coast, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey relied more heavily on anchored manned station ships, and later unmanned moored buoys, to support radio acoustic ranging.&lt;ref name=theberge20091202/&gt;

Chronographs recorded times to the hundredth of a second, and the crew of a ship using radio acoustic ranging could determine their ship's distance from the remote hydrophone stations to within {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, allowing them to plot their ship's position with great accuracy for the time. With sound waves traveling from the point of the explosion to the distant hydrophones at about {{convert|0.8|nmi/s|km/s}}, ships occasionally used radio acoustic ranging at distances of over {{convert|200|nmi|km|abbr=off}} between ship and hydrophone station, and distances of {{convert|75|to|100|nmi|km}} were common.&lt;ref name=rudemay1935/&gt;

==Development history==
===Precursors===
Radio acoustic ranging had its origins in a growing understanding of underwater acoustics and their practical application during the early decades of the 20th century, and developed in parallel with [[echo sounding]]. The first step took place in the early 1900s, when the [[Submarine Signal Company]] invented a submarine bell signalling device and a hydrophone that could serve as a receiver of the underwater sounds the bells generated. The crew of a ship equipped with the receiving hydrophone could plot their ship's distance from the submarine bell mechanism and plot intersecting lines from two or more bells to determine the ship's position. The bells were installed at [[lighthouse]]s, aboard [[lightvessel]]s, and on buoys along the coasts of [[North America]] and [[Europe]], and receiving hydrophones were mounted aboard hundreds of ships. It was history's first practical use of acoustics in an ocean environment.&lt;ref name=theberge20091202/&gt;

The [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking]] of {{RMS|Titanic}} in 1912 spurred the [[Canada|Canadian]] inventor [[Reginald Fessenden]] (1866–1932) to begin work on a long-distance underwater sound transmission and reception system that could detect hazards in the path of a ship. This led to the invention of the [[Fessenden oscillator]], an electro-acoustic [[transducer]] which by 1914 had a proven ability to transmit and receive sound at a distance of 31 miles across [[Massachusetts Bay]] and to detect an [[iceberg]] ahead of a ship at a range of two miles by bouncing sound off it and detecting the echo, as well as an occasional ability to detect the reflection of sound off the ocean bottom. Further impetus to developing practical applications of underwater acoustics came from [[World War I]], which prompted the [[Royal Navy]], [[United States Navy]], and [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps]] to experiment with sound as a means of detecting submerged [[submarine]]s. In postwar experiments, the Coast Artillery Corps's Subaqueous Sound Ranging Section conducted experiments in shallow water in [[Vineyard Sound]] off [[Massachusetts]] in which it detonated explosive charges underwater at the ends of established [[Baseline (surveying)|baselines]] and measured the amount of time it took for the sound to arrive at hydrophones at the other ends of the baselines in order to establish very accurate measurements of the speed of sound through water.&lt;ref name=theberge20091202/&gt; And in 1923, the Submarine Signal Company improved upon its underwater signaling devices by equipping them with radio transmitters that sent signals both to identify the particular device and to indicate to approaching ships that it would generate an acoustic signal at a specific time interval after it sent the radio signal, allowing ships to identify the specific [[navigational aid]] they were approaching and to take advantage of a one-way ranging capability that let their crews determine their direction and distance from the navigational aid.&lt;ref name="discovery"&gt;[http://www.hydro-international.com/content/article/the-discovery-of-long-distance-sound-transmission-in-the-ocean hydro-international.com The Discovery of Long-Distance Sound Transmission in the Ocean]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nicholas Heck===
[[File:Nicholas H. Heck.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nicholas H. Heck, photographed ca. 1940.]]Realizing the potential of these applications of acoustics to [[hydrographic survey]]ing and [[navigation]], particularly along the United States West Coast, where [[fog]] frequently interfered with attempts to fix ship positions accurately, [[Ernest Lester Jones]] (1876–1929), then Director of the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]], in consultation with [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps]] [[Commissioned officer|officers]], decided to investigate the use of acoustics in both depth finding and navigation. [[Nicholas H. Heck]] (1882–1953), a Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officer, had been assigned from 1917 to 1919 to World War I service with the [[United States Naval Reserve Force]], during which he had researched the use of underwater acoustics in [[antisubmarine warfare]]. He was the obvious choice to lead the new effort.&lt;ref name=start/&gt;

By January 1923, the Coast and Geodetic Survey had decided to install a Hayes sonic rangefinder – an early [[echo sounder]] – aboard the survey ship [[USC&amp;GS Guide (1918)|USC&amp;GS ''Guide'']], which the Coast and Geodetic Survey planned to commission into its fleet later that year; successful operation of the sonic rangefinder would require a precise understanding of the speed of sound through water. When Heck contacted E. A. Stephenson of the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps to inform him of this plan and to inquire further about the Vineyard Sound experiments, Stephenson suggested that a system of hydrophones detecting the sound of underwater explosions could allow Coast and Geodetic Survey ships to fix their position while conducting surveys. Heck agreed, but believed that existing navigation aids would not meet the needs of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in terms of the immediacy and accuracy of position fixes.&lt;ref name="start"&gt;[http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/acoustic.html NOAA History: The Start of the Acoustic Work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey]&lt;/ref&gt; He envisioned improving on the Submarine Signal Company's system of underwater noise generators and attached radio transmitters,&lt;ref name="discovery"/&gt; as well as other previous concepts, by creating what would become known as the radio acoustic ranging method. Like echosounding, this method required an accurate calculation of the speed of sound through water.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt;&lt;ref name=popmech&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e9wDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA828&amp;lpg=PA828&amp;dq=radio+acoustic+ranging&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EV8p-JgNc-&amp;sig=nQRMebdKPf1B0VQ0ACD69GsrlGM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ3Ju7y83LAhWDs4MKHSCEDjQ4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=radio%20acoustic%20ranging&amp;f=false Anonymous, "Ocean's Depth Measured By Radio Robot," ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1938, pp. 828-830.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heck oversaw tests at Coast and Geodetic Survey headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]], that demonstrated that shipboard recording of the time of an explosion could be performed accurately enough for his concept to work.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt; He worked with Dr. E. A. Eckhardt, a [[Physics|physicist]], and M. Keiser, an [[electrical engineer]], of the [[National Bureau of Standards]] to develop a hydrophone system that could automatically send a radio signal when it detected the sound of an underwater explosion.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt; When the Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned ''Guide'' in 1923, Heck had her based at [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], [[Connecticut]]. Under his direction, ''Guide'' both tested her new echo sounder's ability to make accurate depth soundings and conducted radio acoustic ranging experiments in cooperation with the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps. Despite many difficulties, testing of both echo sounding and radio acoustic ranging wrapped up successfully in November 1923.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt;

===The cruise of the ''Guide''===
[[File:USC&amp;GS Guide (1918).jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[USC&amp;GS Guide (1918)|USC&amp;GS ''Guide'']] was a [[survey ship]] in commission in the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet from 1923 to 1941. She was the first ship to employ radio acoustic ranging operationally.]]
In late November 1923, with Heck aboard, ''Guide'' began a voyage from New London via [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Panama Canal]] to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]], where she would be based in the future, with her route planned to take her over a wide variety of ocean depths so that she could continue to test her echo sounder.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt; ''Guide'' made history during the voyage, becoming the first Coast and Geodetic Survey ship to use echo sounding to measure and record the depth of the sea at points along her course; she also measured water temperatures and took water samples so that the Scripps Institution for Biological Research (now the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]) at [[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]], California, could measure [[salinity]] levels.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt; She also compared echo sounder soundings with those made by lead lines, discovering that using a single speed of sound through water, as had been the previous practice by those conducting echo sounding experiments, yielded acoustic depth-finding results that did not match the depths found by lead lines.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt; Before she reached San Diego in December 1923, she had accumulated much data beneficial to the study of the movement of sound waves through water and measuring their velocity under varying conditions of salinity, [[density]], and temperature, information essential both to depth-finding and radio acoustic ranging.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt;

Upon arriving in California, Heck and ''Guide'' personnel in consultation with the Scripps Institution developed formulas that allowed accurate echo sounding of depths in all but the shallowest waters and installed hydrophones at La Jolla and [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]], California, to allow experimentation with radio acoustic ranging.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt; Under Heck's direction, ''Guide'' then conducted experiments off the coast of California during the early months of 1924 that demonstrated that accurate echo sounding was possible using the new formulas. Experiments with radio acoustic ranging, despite initial difficulties, demonstrated that the method also was practical, although difficulty with getting some of the explosive charges to detonate hampered some of the experimental program.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt; In April 1924, the Coast and Geodetic Survey concluded that both echo sounding and radio acoustic ranging were fundamentally sound, with no foundational problems left to solve, and that all that remained necessary was continued development and refinement of both techniques during their operational use. Heck turned over continued development of echo sounding and radio acoustic ranging to ''Guide'''s commanding officer, [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Robert Luce, and returned to his duties in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="start"/&gt;

She flies the [[Flag of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey|United States Coast and Geodetic Survey flag]] from her mast and the [[national ensign]] at her stern.]]
Operating in the [[Pacific Ocean]] off [[Oregon]] in 1924, ''Guide'' became the first ship to employ radio acoustic ranging operationally. Off Oregon that year, she successfully employed the technique at a distance of {{convert|206|nmi|km|abbr=off}} between the ranging explosion and the remote hydrophones detecting its sound and in the process achieved the first observed indication of the ocean sound layer that was later called the [[SOFAR channel|sound fixing and ranging (SOFAR) channel]] or deep sound channel (DSC).&lt;ref name=theberge20091202/&gt;&lt;ref name="discovery"/&gt; In 1928, French investigators extended this range, detonating a 30-kg (66-pound) explosive in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] between [[Algiers]] in [[French Algeria]] and [[Toulon]], [[France]], and detecting the sound at a range of {{convert|400|nmi|km|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name="discovery"/&gt;

Initially, Heck and others involved in the development of radio acoustic ranging thought the technique would prove least effective along the coast of the [[Pacific Northwest]], where they assumed that the sound of wave action along the coast and the difficulty of setting up shore stations and cables would reduce the success of radio acoustic ranging; in contrast, they thought that conditions along the [[United States East Coast]] would pose no challenges. In fact, the opposite proved true: Among other problems, the relatively shallow water along the U.S. East Coast attenuated the sound of ranging explosions and [[shoal]]s often blocked the sound from reaching shore at all. To overcome these difficulties, the Coast and Geodetic Survey anchored manned vessels well offshore along the U.S. East Coast to serve as hydrophone stations.&lt;ref name=theberge20091202/&gt; In 1931, the Coast and Geodetic Survey proposed replacing the manned station ships with "radio-sonobuoys", and in July 1936 it began to place radio-sonobuoys in service. The 700-pound (317.5-kg) unmanned buoys –  equipped with subsurface hydrophones, batteries, and radio transmitters that automatically sent a radio signal when their hydrophones detected the sound of a ranging explosion – could be deployed or recovered by Coast and Geodetic Survey ships in five minutes.&lt;ref name=theberge20091202/&gt;&lt;ref name=popmech/&gt;&lt;ref name=HollerJan2014&gt;[http://www.navairdevcen.org/PDF/THE EVOLUTION OF THE SONOBUOY.pdf Holler, Roger A., "The Evolution of the Sonobuoy From World War II to The Cold War," ''U.S. Navy Journal of Underwater Acoustics'', January 2014, p. 323.]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the buoys spread to the U.S. West Coast as well because they were cheaper to set up and operate than a shore station.&lt;ref name=popmech/&gt;

Radio acoustic ranging had limitations and drawbacks. Local peculiarities in the propagation of acoustic waves in the water column could degrade its accuracy, there were problems with maintaining hydrophone stations, and handling explosive charges posed a considerable danger to personnel and ships.&lt;ref name=Theberge20090327&gt;[https://www.hydro-international.com/content/article/first-developments-of-electronic-navigation-systems hydro-international.com Theberge, Albert E., "First Developments of Electronic Navigation Systems," 27 March 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion a Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] on board the survey ship [[USS Hydrographer (AGS-2)|USC&amp;GS ''Hydrographer'']] inserted a radio acoustic ranging bomb in the mouth of a [[shark]] and released the shark, only to watch in horror as it swam back to the ship and exploded next to ''Hydrographer''′s [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]; the explosion rocked the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/schanck.html history.noaa.gov "A Letter From the Front"]&lt;/ref&gt; Aboard ''Guide'' in 1927, tragedy almost struck when a [[petty officer]] handling a bomb lit its fuse and then fell when the ship lurched; he dropped the bomb, which rolled into a gutter. The petty officer fell again before finally reaching the bomb and heaving it overboard just in time; it exploded alongside the ship just as it hit the water. The concussion prompted half the crew to rush up from below decks to find out what had happened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/ak3.html history.noaa.gov "The First Year"]&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as 1942, radio acoustic ranging remained important enough to the Coast and Geodetic Survey for it to devote just over 100 pages of its ''Hydrographic Manual'' to it. However, [[World War II]], which by then had been raging for three years, gave impetus to the rapid development of purely radio-based navigation systems to assist [[bomber]]s in finding their targets in darkness and bad weather. Such [[radio navigation]] systems were easier to maintain than hydrophone stations and did not require the handling of explosives&lt;ref name=Theberge20090327/&gt; and, as the new systems matured, the Coast and Geodetic Survey began to apply them to maritime navigation. Radio acoustic ranging appears not to have been used after 1944,&lt;ref name=theberge20091202/&gt; and by 1946, Coast and Geodetic Survey ships had switched over to the new [[SHORAN]] electronic navigation technology to fix their positions.&lt;ref name=Theberge20090327/&gt;

==Legacy==
The first non-visual method of precise navigation in human history, and the first that could be used at any time of day or night and in any weather conditions, radio acoustic ranging was a major step forward in the development of modern navigation systems. Nicholas Heck revolutionized oceanic surveying through the use of radio electronic ranging to establish ship locations, one of his major contributions to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref name="Arlington"/&gt;&lt;ref name="discovery"/&gt; His work related to the technique also helped to develop underwater sound velocity tables allowing the establishment of "true depths" of up to {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} using echo sounding.&lt;ref name="NOAAbio"&gt;[http://www.history.noaa.gov/cgsbios/bioh14.html NOAA History: Profiles in Time – C&amp;GS Biographies: Nicholas Hunter Heck]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arlington"&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/nhheck.htm Arlington National Cemetery Website: Nicholas H. Heck]&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio acoustic ranging was an early step along the path to modern electronic navigation systems, oceanographic [[Telemetry|telemetering]] systems, and the development of marine seismic surveying. The technique also laid the groundwork for the development of [[sonar]]s capable of looking ahead of and to the sides of vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/hydro_survey/welcome.html#methods celebrating200years.noaa.gov Top Tens: Breakthroughs: Hydrographic Survey Techniques: Acoustic Survey Methods: Radio Acoustic Ranging]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coast and Geodetic Survey's radio-sonobuoys, developed to support radio acoustic ranging, were the ancestors of the [[sonobuoy]]s used by ships and aircraft in antisubmarine warfare and underwater acoustic research today.&lt;ref name=HollerJan2014/&gt;

{{short description|Any system that uses satellite radio signals to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning}}

A '''satellite navigation''' or '''satnav''' system is a system that uses [[satellite]]s to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small [[electronics|electronic]] receivers to determine their location ([[longitude]], [[latitude]], and [[altitude]]/[[elevation]]) to high precision (within a few metres) using [[time signal]]s transmitted along a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] by [[radio]] from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated.

A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a '''global navigation satellite system''' ('''GNSS'''). {{As of|2018|10}}, the [[United States]]' [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and [[Russia]]'s [[GLONASS]] are fully operational GNSSs, with [[China]]'s [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System]] (BDS) and the [[European Union]]'s [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] scheduled to be fully operational by 2020.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/china-military-news/2010-05/20/content_4222569.htm |title=Beidou satellite navigation system to cover whole world in 2020 |publisher=Eng.chinamil.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-4366_en.htm |title=Galileo goes live! |publisher=europa.eu |date=2016-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], [[France]] and [[Japan]] are in the process of developing regional navigation and augmentation systems as well.

Global coverage for each system is generally achieved by a [[satellite constellation]] of 18–30 [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO) satellites spread between several [[orbital planes]]. The actual systems vary, but use [[orbital inclination]]s of &gt;50° and [[orbital period]]s of roughly twelve hours (at an altitude of about {{convert|20000|km|mi|disp=or}}).

Satellite navigation systems that provide enhanced accuracy and integrity monitoring usable for civil navigation are classified as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifatca.org/system/files/public_docs/gnss.pdf |publisher=IFATCA |title=A Beginner's Guide to GNSS in Europe |format=PDF |accessdate=20 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''GNSS-1'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} is the first generation system and is the combination of existing satellite navigation systems (GPS and GLONASS), with [[Satellite Based Augmentation System]]s (SBAS) or [[Ground Based Augmentation System]]s (GBAS). In the United States, the satellite based component is the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), in Europe it is the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS), and in Japan it is the [[Multi-Functional Transport Satellite|Multi-Functional Satellite Augmentation System]] (MSAS). Ground based augmentation is provided by systems like the [[Local Area Augmentation System]] (LAAS).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
* '''GNSS-2'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} is the second generation of systems that independently provides a full civilian satellite navigation system, exemplified by the European Galileo positioning system. These systems will provide the accuracy and integrity monitoring necessary for civil navigation; including aircraft. Initially, this system consisted of only Upper L-Band frequency sets (L1 for GPS, E1 for Galileo, G1 for GLONASS). In recent years, GNSS systems have begun activating Lower L-Band frequency sets (L2 and L5 for GPS, E5a and E5b for Galileo, G3 for GLONASS) for civilian use; they feature higher aggregate accuracy and less problems with signal reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php/Galileo_General_Introduction|title=Galileo General Introduction - Navipedia|website=gssc.esa.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php/GNSS_signal|title=GNSS signal - Navipedia|website=gssc.esa.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2018, a few consumer grade GNSS devices are being sold that leverage both, and are typically called "Dual band GNSS" or "Dual band GPS" devices.
* Core Satellite navigation systems, currently GPS (United States), GLONASS (Russian Federation), Galileo (European Union) and Compass (China).

* Local GBAS typified by a single GPS reference station operating [[Real Time Kinematic]] (RTK) corrections.

== History and theory ==
[[File:Accuracy of Navigation Systems.svg|thumb]]
Ground based [[radio navigation]] has long been practiced.  The [[Decca Navigator System|DECCA]], [[LORAN]], [[Gee (navigation)|GEE]] and [[Omega Navigation System|Omega]] systems used terrestrial [[longwave]] radio [[transmitter]]s which broadcast a radio pulse from a known "master" location, followed by a pulse repeated from a number of "slave" stations.  The delay between the reception of the master signal and the slave signals allowed the receiver to deduce the distance to each of the slaves, providing a [[fix (position)|fix]].

The first satellite navigation system was [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]], a system deployed by the US military in the 1960s. Transit's operation was based on the [[Doppler effect]]: the satellites travelled on well-known paths and broadcast their signals on a well-known [[radio frequency]].  The received frequency will differ slightly from the broadcast frequency because of the movement of the satellite with respect to the receiver. By monitoring this frequency shift over a short time interval, the receiver can determine its location to one side or the other of the satellite, and several such measurements combined with a precise knowledge of the satellite's orbit can fix a particular position. Satellite orbital position errors are induced by variations in the gravity field and radar refraction, among others. These were resolved by a team led by Harold L Jury of Pan Am Aerospace Division in Florida from 1970-1973. Using real-time data assimilation and recursive estimation, the systematic and residual errors were narrowed down to a manageable level to permit accurate navigation. &lt;ref&gt;Jury, H, 1973, Application of the Kalman Filter to Real-time Navigation using Synchronous Satellites, Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium on Space Technology and Science, Tokyo, 945-952. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Part of an orbiting satellite's broadcast included its precise orbital data. In order to ensure accuracy, the [[US Naval Observatory|US Naval Observatory (USNO)]] continuously observed the precise orbits of these satellites. As a satellite's orbit deviated, the USNO would send the updated information to the satellite. Subsequent broadcasts from an updated satellite would contain its most recent [[ephemeris]].

Modern systems are more direct.  The satellite broadcasts a signal that contains orbital data (from which the position of the satellite can be calculated) and the precise time the signal was transmitted.  The orbital [[ephemeris]] is transmitted in a data message that is superimposed on a code that serves as a timing reference. The satellite uses an [[atomic clock]] to maintain synchronization of all the satellites in the constellation. The receiver compares the time of broadcast encoded in the transmission of three (at sea level) or four different satellites, thereby measuring the time-of-flight to each satellite. Several such measurements can be made at the same time to different satellites, allowing a continual fix to be generated in real time using an adapted version of [[trilateration]]: see [[GNSS positioning calculation]] for details.

Each distance measurement, regardless of the system being used, places the receiver on a spherical shell at the measured distance from the broadcaster. By taking several such measurements and then looking for a point where they meet, a fix is generated. However, in the case of fast-moving receivers, the position of the signal moves as signals are received from several satellites. In addition, the radio signals slow slightly as they pass through the ionosphere, and this slowing varies with the receiver's angle to the satellite, because that changes the distance through the ionosphere. The basic computation thus attempts to find the shortest directed line tangent to four oblate spherical shells centred on four satellites. Satellite navigation receivers reduce errors by using combinations of signals from multiple satellites and multiple correlators, and then using techniques such as [[Kalman filter]]ing to combine the noisy, partial, and constantly changing data into a single estimate for position, time, and velocity.

==Applications==
{{Main article|GNSS applications}}
{{further|Automotive navigation system}}
[[File:Satellite-navigation.jpg|thumb|Satellite navigation using a [[laptop]] and a [[GPS]] receiver]]
The original motivation for satellite navigation was for military applications. Satellite navigation allows precision in the delivery of weapons to targets, greatly increasing their lethality whilst reducing inadvertent casualties from mis-directed weapons. (See [[Guided bomb]]). Satellite navigation also allows forces to be directed and to locate themselves more easily, reducing the [[fog of war]].

The ability to supply satellite navigation signals is also the ability to deny their availability. The operator of a satellite navigation system potentially has the ability to degrade or eliminate satellite navigation services over any territory it desires.

===GPS===
{{Main article|Global Positioning System}}

The United States' Global Positioning System (GPS) consists of up to 32 [[medium Earth orbit]] satellites in six different [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]s, with the exact number of satellites varying as older satellites are retired and replaced. Operational since 1978 and globally available since 1994, GPS is the world's most utilized satellite navigation system.

===GLONASS===
{{Main article|GLONASS}}
The formerly [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], and now [[Russia]]n, '''''Glo'''bal'naya '''Na'''vigatsionnaya '''S'''putnikovaya '''S'''istema'', (GLObal NAvigation Satellite System or GLONASS), is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides a civilian radionavigation-satellite service and is also used by the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces. GLONASS has full global coverage with 24 satellites.

===Galileo===
{{Main article|Galileo (satellite navigation)}}
The [[European Union]] and [[European Space Agency]] agreed in March 2002 to introduce their own alternative to GPS, called the [[Galileo positioning system]]. Galileo became operational on 15 December 2016 (global Early Operational Capability (EOC)) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=europa.eu |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-4366_en.htm |title=Galileo goes live!|date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At an estimated cost of €3 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5286200.stm |title=Boost to Galileo sat-nav system |date=25 August 2006 |accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the system of 30 [[Medium Earth orbit|MEO]] satellites was originally scheduled to be operational in 2010. The original year to become operational was 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/7&amp;language=en |title= Commission awards major contracts to make Galileo operational early 2014 |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first experimental satellite was launched on 28 December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/The_future_-_Galileo/First_Galileo_Launch/GIOVE-A_launch_news|title=GIOVE-A launch News|date=2005-12-28|accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo is expected to be compatible with the [[GPS modernization|modernized GPS]] system. The receivers will be able to combine the signals from both Galileo and GPS satellites to greatly increase the accuracy. Galileo is expected to be in full service in 2020 and at a substantially higher cost.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Augmentation==
[[GNSS augmentation]] is a method of improving a navigation system's attributes, such as accuracy, reliability, and availability, through the integration of external information into the calculation process, for example, the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]], the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]], the [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System]], [[Differential GPS]], [[GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation]] (GAGAN) and [[inertial navigation system]]s.

===DORIS===
{{Main article|DORIS (geodesy)}}
Doppler Orbitography and Radio-positioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) is a [[France|French]] precision navigation system. Unlike other GNSS systems, it is based on static emitting stations around the world, the receivers being on satellites, in order to precisely determine their orbital position. The system may be used also for mobile receivers on land with more limited usage and coverage. Used with traditional GNSS systems, it pushes the accuracy of positions to centimetric precision (and to millimetric precision for altimetric application and also allows monitoring very tiny seasonal changes of Earth rotation and deformations), in order to build a much more precise geodesic reference system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/doris.html |title=DORIS information page |publisher=Jason.oceanobs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low Earth orbit satellite phone networks==
The two current operational low Earth orbit [[satellite phone]] networks are able to track transceiver units with accuracy of a few kilometers using doppler shift calculations from the satellite. The coordinates are sent back to the transceiver unit where they can be read using [[AT command]]s or a [[graphical user interface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://common.globalstar.com/doc/common/en/products/gsp1700_usermanual.pdf |title=Globalstar GSP-1700 manual |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyhelp.net/acrobat/jan_05/Iridium%20SBD-FAQ%201-05.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109014357/http://www.skyhelp.net/acrobat/jan_05/Iridium%20SBD-FAQ%201-05.pdf |date=November 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be used by the gateway to enforce restrictions on geographically bound calling plans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48004">'''Sustainable cities''', '''urban sustainability''', or '''eco-city''' (also "ecocity") is a city designed with consideration for [[Sustainability|social, economic, environmental impact &lt;ref&gt;Ranasinghe ,WC and Hemakumara, GPTS(2018),  Spatial modelling of the householders' perception and assessment of the potentiality to improve the urban green coverage in residential areas: A case study from Issadeen Town Matara, Sri Lanka, Ruhuna Journal of Science,Vol 9(1); http://rjs.ruh.ac.lk/index.php/rjs/article/view/174&lt;/ref&gt;]], and resilient habitat for existing populations, without compromising the ability of future generations to experience the same. These cities are inhabited by people whom are dedicated towards minimization of required inputs of energy, water, food, waste, output of heat, [[air pollution]] - [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[methane]], and water pollution. Richard Register first coined the term "ecocity" in his 1987 book, ''Eco city Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy Future''. Other leading figures who envisioned the sustainable city are [[architect]] [[Paul F Downton]], who later founded the company Ecopolis Pty Ltd, as well as authors [[Timothy Beatley]] and [[Steffen Lehmann]], who have written extensively on the subject. The field of [[industrial ecology]] is sometimes used in planning these cities.

There remains no completely agreed upon definition for what a sustainable city should be or completely agreed upon paradigm for what components should be included. Generally, developmental experts agree that a sustainable city should meet the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The ambiguity within this idea leads to a great deal of variation in terms of how cities carry out their attempts to become sustainable.

Ideally, a sustainable city creates an enduring way of life across the four domains of ecology, economics, politics and culture. However, minimally a sustainable city should firstly be able to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding countryside. Secondly, it should be able to power itself with renewable sources of energy. The core of this is to create the smallest conceivable [[ecological footprint]], while producing the lowest quantity of [[pollution]] achievable. All while efficiently using the land; composting used materials, and recycling or converting [[waste-to-energy]]. All of these contributions will lead to the city's overall impacts on [[climate change]] to be minimal and with as little impact. The Adelaide City Council states that socially sustainable cities should be equitable, diverse, connected, and democratic and provide a good quality of life. 

A sustainable city can feed itself with minimal reliance on the surrounding countryside, and power itself with renewable sources of energy. The crux of this is to create the smallest possible [[ecological footprint]], and to produce the lowest quantity of [[pollution]] possible, to efficiently use land; compost used materials, recycle it or convert waste-to-energy, and thus the city's overall contribution to [[climate change]] will be minimal, if such practices are adhered to. 

It is estimated that over 50% of the world’s population now lives in cities and urban areas. These large communities provide both challenges and opportunities for [[environmentally-conscious]] developers. There are distinct advantages to further defining and working towards the goals of sustainable cities. Humans are social creatures and thrive in urban spaces that foster social connections. Richard Florida, an urban studies theorist, focuses on the social impact of sustainable cities and states that cities need to be more than a competitive business climate; they need to be a great people climate that appeals to individuals and families of all types. Because of this, a shift to more dense, urban living would provide an outlet for social interaction and conditions under which humans can prosper. These types of urban areas would also promote the use of public transit, walkability and biking which would benefit citizens health wise but also be environmentally beneficial.

Contrary to common belief, urban systems can be more environmentally sustainable than rural or suburban living. With people and resource located so close to one another it is possible to save energy for transportation and mass transit systems, and resources such as food. Cities benefit the economy by locating human capital in one relatively small geographic area where ideas can be generated. Having a more dense, urban space would also increase people's efficiency since they wouldn't have to spend as much time commuting to places if resources are located close together, which in turn would benefit the economy since people can use this extra time on other matters; like work.

==Practical achievement==
These ecological cities are achieved through various means, such as:
*Different [[Agriculture|agricultural systems]] such as agricultural plots within the city ([[suburbs]] or [[City center|centre]]).&lt;!-- British form of 'center' --&gt; This reduces the distance food has to travel from [[food miles|field to fork]]. Practical work out of this may be done by either small scale/private farming plots or through larger scale agriculture (e.g. [[Vertical farming|farmscrapers]]).
*[[Renewable energy]] sources, such as [[wind turbines]], [[solar panel]]s, or [[bio-gas]] created from [[sewage]]. Cities provide [[economies of scale]] that make such energy sources viable. 
*Various methods to reduce the need for [[air conditioning]] (a massive energy demand), such as planting trees and lightening surface colors, [[Natural ventilation|natural ventilation systems]], an increase in water features, and green spaces equaling at least 20% of the city's surface. These measures counter the "[[heat island effect]]" caused by an abundance of tarmac and asphalt, which can make urban areas several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas&amp;mdash;as much as six degrees Celsius during the evening.
*Improved [[public transport]] and an increase in pedestrianization to reduce car emissions. This requires a radically different approach to city planning, with integrated business, industrial, and residential zones. Roads may be designed to make driving difficult.
*Optimal building density to make public transport viable but avoid the creation of [[urban heat island]]s.
*Solutions to decrease [[urban sprawl]], by seeking new ways of allowing people to live closer to the workspace.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Since the workplace tends to be in the city, downtown, or urban center, they are seeking a way to increase density by changing the antiquated attitudes many suburbanites have towards inner-city areas.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} One of the new ways to achieve this is by solutions worked out by the [[Smart Growth]] Movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
*[[Green roof]]s alter the surface energy balance and can help mitigate the urban heat island effect. Incorporating [[Green roof|eco roofs]] or green roofs in your design will help with air quality, climate and water runoff.
*[[Zero-emission transport]]
*[[Zero-energy building]]
*[[Sustainable urban drainage systems]] or SUDS
*[[Energy conservation|energy conservation systems/devices]]
*[[Xeriscaping]] - garden and landscape design for water conservation
*[[Sustainable transport]], incorporates five elements: fuel economy, occupancy, electrification, pedal power, and urbanization.
*[[Key Performance Indicator|Key Performance Indicators]] - development and operational management tool providing guidance and M&amp;V for city administrators
*Sustainable Sites Initiative or SSI,Voluntary national guidelines and performance benchmarks for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. Key areas of focus are soil, vegetation, hydrology, materials, and human health and well being.
*Increase of [[Cycling infrastructure]] would increase cycling within cities and reduce the amount of cars being driven and in turn reduce car emissions. This would also benefit the health of citizens as they would be able to get more exercise through cycling.
*Educating residents of cities about the positive impacts of living in a more sustainable city and why it is important would increase the initiative to have sustainable developments and push people to live in a more sustainable way.

== Architecture ==
Buildings provide the infrastructure for a functioning city and allow for many opportunities to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. A commitment to sustainable architecture encompasses all phases of building including the planning, building, and restructuring. Sustainable Site Initiatives is used by landscape architects, designers, engineers, architects, developers, policy-makers and others to align land development and management with innovative sustainable design.

=== Eco-industrial park ===
The purpose of an eco-industrial park is to connect a number of firms and organizations to work together to decrease their environmental impact while simultaneously improving their economic performance. The community of businesses accomplishes this goal through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues, such as energy, water, and materials. The components for building an eco-industrial park include natural systems, more efficient use of energy, and more efficient material and water flows Industrial parks should be built to fit into their natural settings in order to reduce environmental impacts, which can be accomplished through plant design, landscaping, and choice of materials. For instance, there is an industrial park in Michigan built by Phoenix Designs that is made almost entirely from recycled materials. The landscaping of the building will include native trees, grasses, and flowers, and the landscaping design will also act as climate shelter for the facility. In choosing the materials for building an eco-industrial park, designers must consider the life-cycle analysis of each medium that goes into the building to assess their true impact on the environment and to ensure that they are using it from one plant to another, steam connections from firms to provide heating for homes in the area, and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power. In terms of material flows, the companies in an eco-industrial park may have common waste treatment facilities, a means for transporting by-products from one plant to another, or anchoring the park around [[resource recovery]] companies that are recruited to the location or started from scratch. To create more efficient water flows in industrial parks, the processed water from one plant can be reused by another plant and the parks infrastructure can include a way to collect and reuse storm water runoff.

=== Urban farming ===
See also: [[Urban Agriculture]]

[[Urban farming]] is the process of growing and distributing food, as well as raising animals, in and around a city or in urban area. According to the RUAF Foundation, urban farming is different from rural agriculture because "it is integrated into the urban economic and ecological system: urban agriculture is embedded in -and interacting with- the urban ecosystem. Such linkages include the use of urban residents as labourers, use of typical urban resources (like organic waste as compost and urban wastewater for irrigation), direct links with urban consumers, direct impacts on urban ecology (positive and negative), being part of the urban food system, competing for land with other urban functions, being influenced by urban policies and plans, etc." There are many motivations behind urban agriculture, but in the context of creating a sustainable city, this method of food cultivation saves energy in food transportation and saves costs. In order for urban farming to be a successful method of sustainable food growth, cities must allot a common area for community gardens or farms, as well as a common area for a farmers market in which the foodstuffs grown within the city can be sold to the residents of the urban system.
Berms of fava beans have been planted at Hayes Valley Farm, a community-built farm on the former Central freeway ramps of San Francisco.

=== Urban infill ===
Many cities are currently in a shift from the suburban sprawl model of development to a return to urban dense living. This shift in geographic distribution of population leads to a denser core of city residents. These residents provide a growing demand in many sectors that is reflected in the architectural fabric of the city. This new demand can be supplied by new construction or historic rehabilitation. Sustainable cities will opt for historical rehabilitation wherever possible. Having people live in higher densities not only gives economies of scale but also allows for infrastructure to be more efficient.

=== Walkable urbanism ===
Walkable urbanism is a development strategy in opposition to suburban sprawl. It advocates housing for a diverse population, a full mix of uses, walkable streets, positive [[public space]], integrated civic and commercial centers, transit orientation and accessible open space. It also advocates for density and accessibility of commercial and government activity.

==== New Urbanism ====
The most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the Charter of [[New Urbanism]]. It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve smart cities which support [[sustainable transport]]. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs. The concept of [[circular flow land use management]] has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl.

In [[sustainable architecture]] the recent movement of [[New Classical Architecture]] promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], walkability, [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]]. This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as opposing solitary [[Housing estate|housing estates]] and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Both trends started in the 1980s.

=== Individual buildings (LEED) ===
Main article: [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]]

The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System® encourages and accelerates global adoption of sustainable green building and development practices through the creation and implementation of universally understood and accepted tools and performance criteria.

LEED, or [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]], is an internationally recognized [[green building]] certification system. LEED recognizes whole building sustainable design by identifying key areas of excellence including: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, Locations &amp; Linkages, Awareness and Education, Innovation in Design, Regional Priority. In order for a building to become LEED certified sustainability needs to be prioritized in design, construction, and use. One example of sustainable design would be including a [[certified wood]] like bamboo. Bamboo is fast growing and has an incredible replacement rate after being harvested. By far the most credits are rewarded for optimizing energy performance. This promotes innovative thinking about alternative forms of energy and encourages increased efficiency.

=== Sustainable Sites Initiative (SSI) ===
Sustainable Sites Initiative, a combined effort of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at The [[University of Texas at Austin]], and the [[United States Botanic Garden]], is a voluntary national guideline and performance benchmark for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. The building principles of SSI are to design with nature and culture, use a decision-making hierarchy of preservation, conservation, and regeneration, use a system thinking approach, provide regenerative systems, support a living process, use a collaborative and ethical approach, maintain integrity in leadership and research, and finally foster [[environmental stewardship]]. All of these help promote solutions to common environmental issues such as [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases]], [[urban climate]] issues, [[water pollution]] and waste, [[energy consumption]], and health and wellbeing of site users. The main focus is hydrology, soils, vegetation, materials, and human health and well being.

In SSI, the main goal for [[hydrology]] in sites is to protect and restore existing hydrologic functions. To design storm water features to be accessible to site users, and manage and clean water on site. For site design of [[soil]] and [[vegetation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;many steps can be done during the construction process to help minimize the [[urban heat island]] effects, to and minimize the building heating requirements by using plants.

== Transportation ==
As major focus of the sustainable cities, [[sustainable transportation]] attempts to reduce a city’s reliance and use of greenhouse emitting gases by utilizing eco friendly [[urban planning]], low environmental impact vehicles, and residential proximity to create an urban center that has greater environmental responsibility and [[social equity]].

Due to the significant impact that transportation services have on a city’s energy consumption, the last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on sustainable transportation by developmental experts. Currently, transportation systems account for nearly a quarter of the world’s energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission. In order to reduce the environmental impact caused by transportation in metropolitan areas, sustainable transportation has three widely agreed upon pillars that it utilizes to create more healthy and productive urban centers.

The [[Carbon Trust]] states that there are three main ways cities can innovate to make transport more sustainable without increasing journey times - better land use planning, modal shift to encourage people to choose more efficient forms of transport, and making existing transport modes more efficient.

=== Car free city ===
The concept of [[Carfree city|car free cities]] or a city with large [[Pedestrian area|pedestrian areas]] is often part of the design of a sustainable city. A large part of the [[carbon footprint]] of a city is generated by cars so the car free concept is often considered an integral part of the design of a sustainable city.

=== Emphasis on proximity ===
Created by eco friendly urban planning, the concept of urban proximity is an essential element of current and future sustainable transportation systems. This requires that cities be built and added onto with appropriate population and landmark density so that destinations are reached with reduced time in transit. This reduced time in transit allows for reduced fuel expenditure and also opens the door to alternative means of transportation such as bike riding and walking.

Furthermore, close proximity of residents and major landmarks allows for the creation of efficient public transportation by eliminating long sprawled out routes and reducing commute time. This in turn decreases the social cost to residents who choose to live in these cities by allowing them more time with families and friends instead by eliminating part of their commute time.

=== Diversity in modes of transportation ===
Sustainable transportation emphasizes the use of a diversity of [[fuel-efficient]] transportation vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse emissions and diversity fuel demand. Due to the increasingly expensive and volatile cost of energy, this strategy has become very important because it allows a way for city residents to be less susceptible to varying highs and lows in various energy prices.

Among the different [[Modes of transport|modes of transportation]], the use alternative energy cars and widespread installation of refueling stations has gained increasing importance, while the creation of centralized [[Bike path|bike]] and [[Walking path|walking paths]] remains a staple of the sustainable transportation movement.

=== Access to transportation ===
In order to maintain the aspect of [[social responsibility]] inherent within the concept of sustainable cities, implementing [[sustainable transportation]] must include access to transportation by all levels of society. Due to the fact that car and fuel cost are often too expensive for lower income urban residents, completing this aspect often revolves around efficient and accessible public transportation.

In order to make public transportation more accessible, the cost of rides must be affordable and stations must be located no more than walking distance in each part of the city. As studies have shown, this accessibility creates a great increase in social and productive opportunity for city residents. By allowing lower income residents cheap and available transportation, it allows for individuals to seek employment opportunities all over the urban center rather than simply the area in which they live. This in turn reduces unemployment and a number of associated social problems such as crime, drug use, and violence.

== Urban strategic planning ==
Although there is not an international policy regarding sustainable cities and there are not established international standards, there is an organization, the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG) that is working to establish universal urban strategic guidelines. The UCLG a democratic and decentralized structure that operates in Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Europe, Latin America, North America, Middle East, West Asian and a Metropolitan section work to promote a more sustainable society. The 60 members of the UCLG committee evaluate urban development strategies and debate theses experiences to make the best recommendations. Additionally, the UCLG accounts for differences in regional and national context. All the organizations are making a great effort to promote this concept by media and internet, and in conferences and workshops. An International conference was held in Italy at Università del Salento and Università degli Studi della Basilicata, called 'Green Urbanism', from 12–14 October 2016.

=== Development ===
Recently, local and national governments and regional bodies such as the European Union have recognized the need for a holistic understanding of [[urban planning]]. This is instrumental to establishing an international policy that focuses on cities challenges and the role of the local authorities responses. Generally, in terms of urban planning, the responsibility of local governments are limited to [[land use]] and infrastructure provision excluding inclusive urban development strategies. The advantages of urban strategic planning include an increase in governance and cooperation that aids local governments in establishing performance based-management, clearly identifying the challenges facing local community and more effectively responding on a local level rather than national level, and improves institutional responses and local decision making. Additionally, it increases dialogue between stakeholders and develops consensus-based solutions, establishing continuity between sustainability plans and change in local government; it places environmental issues as the priority for the sustainable development of cities and serves as a platform to develop concepts and new models of housing, energy and mobility.

=== Obstacles ===
The City Development Strategies (CDS) addresses new challenges and provides space for innovative policies that involves all stakeholders. The inequality in spatial development and socio-economic classes paired with concerns of [[poverty reduction]] and [[climate change]] are factors in achieving global sustainable cities. According to the [[UCLG]] there are differences between regional and national conditions, framework and practice that are overcome in the international commitment to communication and negotiation with other governments, communities and the private sector to continual to develop through innovative and participatory approaches in strategic decisions, building consensus and monitoring performance management and raising investment.

=== Social factors of sustainable cities ===
According to [[UN Habitat]], around half of the world's population is concentrated in cities, which is set to rise to 60% within a couple decades. The UCLG has specifically identified 13 global challenges to establishing sustainable cities: demographic change and migration, globalisation of the job market, poverty and unmet Millennium Development Goals, segregation, spatial patterns and urban growth, metropolisation and the rise of urban regions, more political power for local authories, new actors for developing a city and providing services, decline in public funding for development, the environment and climate change, new and accessible building technologies, preparing for uncertainty and limits of growth and global communications and partnerships.

==Examples==
===Australia===

==== Adelaide ====
'''Urban forests'''

In [[Adelaide]], South Australia (a city of 1.3 million people) Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area. The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days. Sites include parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity. Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C02 a year. He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss.

'''Solar power'''

The Rann government also launched an initiative for Adelaide to lead Australia in the take-up of solar power. In addition to Australia's first 'feed-in' tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs, the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as the museum, art gallery, Parliament, Adelaide Airport, 200 schools and Australia's biggest rooftop array on the roof of Adelaide Showgrounds' convention hall which was registered as a power station.

'''Wind power'''

South Australia went from zero wind power in 2002 to wind power, making up 26% of its electricity generation by October 2011. In the five years preceding 2011 there was a 15% drop in emissions, despite strong economic growth.

'''Waste recycling'''

For Adelaide the South Australian government also embraced a Zero Waste recycling strategy, achieving a recycling rate of nearly 80% by 2011 with 4.3 million tonnes of materials diverted from landfill to recycling. On a per capita basis this was the best result in Australia, the equivalent of preventing more than a million tonnes of C02 entering the atmosphere. In the 1970s container deposit legislation was introduced. Consumers are paid a 10 cent rebate on each bottle, can, or container they return to recycling. In 2009 non-reusable plastic bags used in supermarket checkouts were banned by the Rann Government, preventing 400 million plastic bags per year entering the litter stream. In 2010 Zero Waste SA was commended by a UN Habitat Report entitled 'Solid Waste Management in the World Cities'.

=== Brazil ===
'''Belo Horizonte, Brazil''' was created in 1897 and is the third largest metropolis in Brazil, with 2.4 million inhabitants. The Strategic Plan for Belo Horizonte (2010–2030) is being prepared by external consultants based on similar cities' infrastructure, incorporating the role of local government, state government, city leaders and encouraging citizen participation. The need for environmental sustainable development is led by the initiative of new government following planning processes from the state government. Overall, the development of the metropolis is dependent on the land regularization and infrastructure improvement that will better support the cultural technology and economic landscape.Southern cities of [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Curitiba]] are often cited as examples of urban sustainability.

=== Cameroon ===

* [[Bafut, Cameroon|Bafut]], is a town and traditional kingdom which is working towards becoming an eco-city by 2020, through the Bafut Council Eco-city Project.

===Canada===

* [[Vancouver]] had 2016's highest green score for '''large''' cities.
* [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]] had 2016's highest green score for '''medium''' cities.
* [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] had 2016's highest green score for '''small''' cities.

Most cities in Canada have sustainability action plans which are easily searched and downloaded from city websites.

In 2010, [[Calgary]] ranked as the top eco-city in the planet for it's, "excellent level of service on waste removal, sewage systems, and water drinkability and availability, coupled with relatively low air pollution.”  The survey was performed in conjunction with the reputable [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] Quality of Living Survey.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercer.com/qualityoflivingpr#Ranking_Eco_CitiesGF Quality of Living worldwide city rankings 2010 – Mercer survey&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark ===
Two comprehensive studies were carried out for the whole of Denmark in 2010 (The IDA Climate Plan 2050) and 2011 (The Danish Commission on Climate Change Policy). The studies analysed the benefits and obstacles of running Denmark on [[100% renewable energy]] from the year 2050. There is also a larger, ambitious plan in action: the Copenhagen 2025 Climate Plan.

On a more local level, the [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|industrial park in Kalundborg]] is often cited as a model for industrial ecology. However, projects have been carried out in several Danish cities promoting 100% renewable energy. Examples include [[Aalborg]], [[Ballerup]] and [[Frederikshavn]]. [[Aalborg University]] has launched a master education program on sustainable cities (Sustainable Cities @ Aalborg University Copenhagen). See also the Danish Wikipedia.

* [[Copenhagen]]: [[Cycling in Copenhagen]]: One of the most bicycle-friendly city's in the world where over 50% of the population get around on bikes. The city has infrastructure that caters to cycling with hundreds of kilometres of curb segregated bike lanes to separate cyclists and car traffic. A notable feature is The Cycle Super Highways that feature elevated bike lanes which ensures fast, unhindered travel between destinations.

[[Freiburg im Breisgau]] is often referred to as green city. It is known for its strong solar economy. [[Vauban, Freiburg]] is a sustainable model district. All houses are built to a low energy consumption standard and the whole district is designed to be carfree. 

=== Finland ===
The Finnish city of [[Turku]] has adopted a "Carbon Neutral Turku by 2040" strategy to achieve [[carbon neutrality]] via combining the goal with [[circular economy]].

=== Germany ===
No other country has built more eco-city projects than Germany.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] is often referred to as a green city. It is one of the few cities with a [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]] mayor and is known for its strong solar energy industry. [[Vauban, Freiburg]] is a sustainable model district. All houses are built to a low energy consumption standard and the whole district is designed to be carfree. Another green district in Freiburg is Rieselfeld, where houses generate more energy than they consume. There are several other green sustainable city projects such as Kronsberg in Hannover and current developments around Munich, Hamburg and Frankfurt.

* [[Berlin]]: The [[Tiergarten (park)]] is a large park that takes up 520 acres and is an example of social sustainability where it is a green space but also used for transportation. The Tiergarten has inter paths where people can safely bike and walk without the disturbance of cars. Paths connect to notable areas within the city, such as government buildings, shopping areas and monuments.

=== Hong Kong ===
The government portrays the proposed [[Hung Shui Kiu]] [[new town]] as an eco-city. The same happened with the urban development plan on the site of the former [[Kai Tak Airport]].

=== Ireland ===
South Dublin County Council announced plans in late 2007 to develop Clonburris, a new suburb of Dublin to include up to 15,000 new homes, to be designed to achieve the highest of international standards. The plans for Clonburris include countless green innovations such as high levels of energy efficiency, mandatory renewable energy for heating and electricity, the use of recycled and sustainable building materials, a district heating system for distributing heat, the provision of allotments for growing food, and even the banning of tumble driers, with natural drying areas being provided instead.

In 2012 a energy plan was carried out by the Danish [[Aalborg University]] for the municipalities of [[Limerick]] and [[County Clare|Clare]]. The project was a short-term 2020 renewable energy strategy giving a 20% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions are beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy.

===India===
[[India]] is working on [[Gujarat International Finance Tec-City]] or GIFT which is an under-construction world-class city in the Indian state of [[Gujarat]]. It will come up on 500 acres (2.0&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) land.&lt;ref&gt;http://giftgujarat.in/ Gujarat International Finance Tec-City plans&lt;/ref&gt; It will also be first of its kind fully Sustainable City.
Auroville was founded in 1968 with the intention of realizing human unity, and is now home to approximately 2,000 individuals from over 45 nations around the world. Its focus is its vibrant community culture and its expertise in renewable energy systems, habitat restoration, ecology skills, mindfulness practices, and holistic education.
Andhra Pradesh state New capital also coming up with a future sustainable city.

===Kenya===
Hacienda - [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]]. It is the largest development of eco-friendly residential properties in [[East Africa]]; construction is currently ongoing, and it will eventually be one of Africa’s first self-sustaining estates.

=== Korea ===
[[Songdo International Business District|Songdo IBD]] is a planned city in [[Incheon]] which has incorporated a number of eco-friendly features. These include a central park irrigated with seawater, a subway line, bicycle lanes, rainwater catchment systems, and pneumatic waste collection system. 75% of the waste generated by the construction of the city will be recycled.

Gwanggyo City Centre is another planned sustainable city.

=== Malaysia ===
As of 2014 a Low Carbon Cities programme is being piloted in Malaysia by KeTTHA, the Malaysian Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water, Malaysian Green Technology Corporation (GreenTech Malaysia) and the [[Carbon Trust]].

[[Malacca]] has a stated ambition to become a carbon-free city, taking steps towards creating a smart electricity grid. This is being done as part of an initiative to create a Green Special Economic Zone, where it is intended that as many as 20 research and development centers will be built focusing on renewable energy and clean technology, creating up to 300,000 new green jobs. 

The Federal Department of Town and Country Planning (FDTCP) in peninsular Malaysia is a focal point for the implementation of the Malaysian Urban Rural National Indicators Network for Sustainable Development (MURNInets)MURNInets includes 36 sets of compulsory indicators grouped under 21 themes under six dimensions. Most of the targets and standards for the selected indicators were adjusted according to hierarchy of local authorities. In MURNInets at least three main new features are introduced. These include the Happiness Index, an indicator under the quality of life theme to meet the current development trend that emphasizes on the well-being of the community. Another feature introduced is the customer or people satisfaction level towards local authorities' services. Through the introduction of these indicators the bottom-up approach in measuring sustainability is adopted.

=== New Zealand ===
The city of [[Waitakere]], the Western part of the greater [[Auckland]] urban region, was [[New Zealand]]'s first eco-city, working from the Greenprint, a guiding document that the City Council developed in the early 1990s.

=== Philippines ===
[[Clark Freeport Zone]] is a former United States Air Force base in the Philippines. It is located on the northwest side of Angeles City and on the west side of Mabalacat City in the province of Pampanga, about 40 miles (60 km) northwest of Metro Manila. A multi-billion project will convert the 36,000 hectare former Clark Air Force Base into a mix of industrial, commercial and institutional areas of green environment. The heart of the project is a 9,450-hectare metropolis dubbed as the "[[Clark Green City]]". Builders will use the green building system for environmentally-friendly structures. Its facilities will tap renewable energy such as solar and hydro power.

=== Portugal ===
The organization Living PlanIT is currently constructing a city from scratch near Porto, Portugal. Buildings will be electronically connected to vehicles giving the user a sense of personal eco-friendliness.

=== Spain ===

* [[Bilbao]]: The city faced economic turmoil following the decline of the steel and port industries but through communication between stakeholders and authorities to create inner-city transformation, the local government benefited from the increase in land value in old port areas. The Strategic Plan for the Revitalisation of Metropolitan Bibao was launched in 1922 and have flourished regenerating old steel and port industries. The conversion from depleted steel and port industries to one of Europe’s most flourishing markets is a prime example of a sustainable project in action.
* [[Barcelona]]: The city is planning an urban redesign of civic super blocks, they plan to convert nine-block areas into unified mega block neighbourhoods. The aim is to decrease car related traffic, noise and pollution by over 20% and to free up to 60% of road areas for reuse as citizen spaces. This is being done because they realized that people in Barcelona die prematurely due to poor air quality and everyday noise levels are deemed harmful. By converting roads to spaces for festivals, farmer markets, bikes, and walkability it promotes a healthier lifestyle and potentially a happier one. 

=== Sweden ===

* Norra Älvstranden (Swedish), in [[Gothenburg]] by the river [[Göta älv]], is an example of a sustainable city in Sweden.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; It has low environmental impact, and contains passive houses, recycling system for waste, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">The '''Tellurometer''' was the first successful microwave [[electronic distance measurement]] equipment. The name derives from the Latin ''tellus'', meaning Earth.

[[File:Line of sight to Plynlimon - geograph.org.uk - 963435.jpg|thumb|Typical distance measurements were between mountain tops]]

==History==
The original Tellurometer, known as the Micro-Distancer MRA 1, was introduced in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/distance_tools/tellurometermra1.html Tellurometer MRA 1]&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented by [[Trevor Wadley|Dr. Trevor Lloyd Wadley]] of the Telecommunications Research Laboratory of the [[South Africa]]n [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR), also responsible for the [[Wadley Loop]] receiver, which allowed precision tuning over wide bands, a task that had previously required switching out multiple [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsl.net/vk3jeg/b_wadley.html Wadley Loop HF receivers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The Tellurometer emits an electronic wave: the remote station reradiates the incoming wave in a similar wave of more complex [[modulation]], and the resulting phase shift was a measure of the distance travelled. The results appear on a [[cathode ray tube]] with circular sweep. This instrument penetrates haze and mist in daylight or darkness and has a normal range of 30–50&amp;nbsp;km but can extend up to 70&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.fig.net/pub/fig2008/papers/hs01/hs01_03_sturman_wright_2833.pdf History of the Tellurometer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
The Tellurometer design yields high accuracy distance measurements over [[geodesy|geodetic]] distances, but it is also useful for second order survey work, especially in areas where the terrain was rough and/or the temperatures extreme.

Examples of remote locations mapped using Tellurometer surveys are [[Adams Bluff]], [[Churchill Mountains]], [[Cook Mountains]], [[Jacobsen Glacier]], [[Mount Albright]], [[Mount Predoehl]], [[Mount Summerson]], [[Queen Elizabeth Range (Antarctica)|Sherwin Peak]] and [[Vogt Peak]].

The MRB2 or Hydrodist was a marine version&lt;ref name=history /&gt; that was used in coastal surveys and calibrating ships using other survey navigation systems.

They were used by the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ham (Editor)|first=Paul|title=Captain Bullen's War|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|location=Australia|isbn=978 0 7322 8843 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial exploitation==
[[Plessey]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] electronics company, formed a new subsidiary known as ''Tellurometer (Pty) Limited'' in the 1960s to manufacture the product and to develop and sell derivatives.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;  The Company subsequently introduced numerical displays, solid state transmitters, integrated circuits and eventually [[microprocessor]]s for the product.

[[File:Trinity House Maritime Museum - geograph.org.uk - 626296.jpg|thumb|Trinity House, Leith]]
'''Trinity House''', 99 Kirkgate, is a category A [[listed building]]&lt;ref name= "historic scotland"&gt;[http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING:27834 Historic Scotland - Listed Buildings - 99 New Kirkgate, Trinity House]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Leith]], Edinburgh, Scotland, which was a [[guild hall]], [[customs house]], and centre for maritime administration and [[poor relief]]. In the [[Scotland in the Late Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages]] and [[Scotland in the Early Modern Era|Early Modern Era]] it also served as an [[almshouse]] and [[Hospital#Medieval Europe|hospital]]. Now in [[Historic Scotland|state care]], it houses a [[maritime museum]].

Trinity House was the headquarters of the Incorporation of Masters and Mariners, a [[Guild|trade incorporation]] and charitable organisation founded in the 14th century when the shipowners and shipmasters of Leith formed a [[Fraternity]] (from which the name, ''Trinity'', may derive). The present Trinity House is a Category A [[Listed building|listed]] [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] house, designed by [[Thomas Brown (architect)|Thomas Brown]] and built in 1816-8, using the existing basement and vaults of the former Trinity House and mariners' hospital of 1555.&lt;ref name= "historic scotland" /&gt;

Concerned to improve safety at sea, Trinity House established the first formal [[Seamanship|nautical training]] in the country and licensed [[Maritime pilot|pilot]]s for the [[Firth of Forth|Forth]] and around the [[Geography of Scotland|Scottish coast]]. By collecting Licht Money (light money), by the 17th century they were maintaining primitive coal-fired lights in the Forth. In the 19th century, Trinity House was involved in the planning and funding of new and more reliable [[lighthouse]]s that took advantage of improvements in technology. These included the [[Bell Rock lighthouse]], [[Fidra lighthouse]] and the [[Isle of May lighthouse]].

The Masters and Mariners invested in land, which became known as Trinity Mains, near the village of [[Newhaven, Edinburgh|Newhaven]]. This land later developed into a suburb of Leith and is now the modern-day district of [[Trinity, Edinburgh|Trinity]].

The medieval Incorporation served as a blueprint for the establishment of Trinity Houses in other maritime centres, including Dundee, [[Hull Trinity House|Hull]], [[Trinity House, London|London]] and [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne Trinity House|Newcastle-upon-Tyne]].

==History==
[[File:Convening Room Trinity House, Leith N wall.JPG|thumb|Convening Room Trinity House]]
The Masters and Mariners of the Trinity House in the Kirkgate was the oldest and wealthiest of the [[trade guild]]s of Leith. The guilds were divided into four groups:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/leith/11.htm The Story of Leith - The Trade Guilds of Leith]&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Sea captain|skipper]]s and [[Sailor|mariner]]s of the Trinity House
# [[Maltman|maltmen]], [[brewer]]s, and [[sled]]ders or [[cart]]ers
# [[Artisan|craftsmen]] and meal men (''[[Cereal|corn merchants]]'')
# traffickers (''[[merchant]]s''), and all other gentlemen and residents of Leith not members of any of the other corporations

In 1380 [[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]] granted the Incorporation of Master and Mariners of Leith the right to levy a [[Duty (economics)|duty]], called prime gilt, of 12 [[Scottish coinage|pennies]] on each [[ton]] of goods landed at Leith. An additional voluntary contribution, called crown money, was also collected. Trade was largely conducted over the [[North Sea]], with the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] and [[Baltic region]]s, the [[Low Countries]] and France. The funds raised by the prime gilt and crown money were then used for the [[Poor relief|relief]] of the sick, the poor and the widows and orphans of lost or captured mariners; and to care for aged mariners.

In 1555 the Incorporation had sufficient funds to build a hospital at the Kirkgate. The basement of this building survives under the current Trinity House.

Following a series of disputes over payments, in 1566 [[Mary Queen of Scots]] confirmed the right of the Incorporation to collect payments: ratifying "the gift, foundation, erection and institution of the hospital and of the prime gilt". Refusal to pay would result in the [[confiscation]] of sails and anchor.

In 1680, funded by fees and by a levy on Leith shipmasters, the Masters and Mariners appointed a professor to teach the mathematics of navigation to the sons and apprentices of shipmasters. This training for future officers was subsequently extended across Scotland.

On 29 June 1797 the Corporation of the Trinity House of Leith was granted a [[royal charter]].

As a result of the requirement for formal qualifications stipulated in the [[Merchant Seamen Act 1844]], in 1855 Trinity House and other Leith organisations founded the Leith Navigational School (also called the Government Navigation School), based at a room at [[St Ninian's Church, Leith|St Ninian's Church]] (also called the Mariners' Church), on Commercial Street. In 1903 Leith Navigation School came under the control of the [[Scottish Education Department]], and the name was changed to [[Leith Nautical College]] (since merged to become part of [[Jewel &amp; Esk College]], which in 2012 merged to become [[Edinburgh College]]).

Prime gilt was abolished in 1862, so Trinity House had to depend on property income to meet pension payments.

Currently Trinity House is in the care of [[Historic Environment Scotland]].

'''UN-SPIDER ("United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response")''' is a platform which facilitates the use of space-based technologies for disaster management and emergency response.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal http://www.un-spider.org/"&lt;/ref&gt; It is a programme under the auspices of the [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]] (UNOOSA).

==Space technology for disaster risk management and emergency response==
Global vulnerability to natural disasters is likely to increase as the impact of climate change and land degradation processes continues to rise along with rapidly growing populations. Earthquakes, floods, storms, and other natural hazards cause massive disruption to societies and overburden national economic systems. Considerable losses of life and property, however, could be avoided through better information about the risk and onset of disasters, improved risk assessment, early warning, and disaster monitoring. In recognition of these needs the [[United Nations General Assembly]], in its [http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/gares/ARES_61_110E.pdf resolution 61/110] of 14 December 2006, acknowledged that use of existing space technology, such as [[earth observation]] and [[meteorological satellites]], [[communication satellites|communication]] and [[navigation satellite]]s can play a major role in supporting disaster management by providing accurate and timely information for decision making. Space-based information are relevant in all phases of the disaster management cycle from disaster risk reduction&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER March 2015 Newsletter: Space-based Information for Disaster Risk Reduction http://www.un-spider.org/news-and-events/newsletter/un-spider-newsletter-115-space-based-information-disaster-risk-reduction&lt;/ref&gt; to disaster response and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER June 2013 Newsletter: Earth Observation for Disaster Response http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/UN-SPIDER_NL_EO_online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, world leaders convened in Sendai, Japan to agree on a new global framework for disaster risk reduction for the period 2015 through 2030. The outcome document refers to the importance of Space-based and geospatial information in several paragraphs, highlighting, among others, the importance to "develop, update periodically and disseminate, as appropriate, location-based disaster risk information, including risk maps, to decision makers, the general public and communities at risk to disaster in an appropriate format by using, as applicable, geospatial information technology".&lt;ref&gt;Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 http://www.wcdrr.org/uploads/Sendai_Framework_for_Disaster_Risk_Reduction_2015-2030.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In its [http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/gares/ARES_61_110E.pdf resolution 61/110] of 14 December 2006, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] agreed to establish UN-SPIDER as a new [[United Nations]] programme, with the following mission statement: "Ensure that all countries and international and regional organizations have access to and develop the capacity to use all types of space-based information to support the full disaster management cycle".&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 61/110 http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/gares/ARES_61_110E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, UN-SPIDER aims at three goals: being a gateway to space information for disaster management support; serving as a bridge to connect the disaster management and space communities; and being a facilitator of capacity-building and institutional strengthening.

UN-SPIDER has three offices in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]] and in [[Beijing]], [[China]].

The UN-SPIDER Vienna office is located at UNOOSA's headquarters in the [[Vienna International Centre]]. Its staff members are in charge of general UN-SPIDER coordination, fund-raising, Regional Support Office (RSO) coordination and Technical Advisory Support. The office is supported by the government of Austria.

[[Image:Bonn Langer Eugen Rheinseite 2009-06-01.JPG|thumb|right|United Nations, Bonn]]

The UN-SPIDER Bonn Office was established in October 2007 with the support from the [[German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]] (BMWi) and the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR). The UN-SPIDER Bonn Office is responsible for UN-SPIDER's knowledge management. The goal is to make sure that all relevant information is easily accessible and disseminated to all stakeholders in the areas of disaster management and emergency and humanitarian response. This is done mainly via UN-SPIDER's Knowledge Portal, which is managed by the Bonn staff. The Bonn Office is also dealing with Technical Advisory Support in Latin America and the Caribbean.

The Beijing office opened on November 9, 2010, and is supported by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Beijing Office is mainly dealing with Technical Advisory Support in the Asia and Pacific region and the coordination of UN-SPIDER's network of National Focal Points.

==UN-SPIDER activities==

===Knowledge Management===
The acquisition, processing and transfer of knowledge is the central element of UN-SPIDER's activities. A knowledge base on space-based information and solutions to support risk and disaster management are therefore made available through the UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER February 2013 Newsletter: Knowledge Management http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/UN-SPIDER%20Newsletter%20Knowledge%20Management_online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.un-spider.org/ UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal] is central to all knowledge management activities carried out within the framework of UN-SPIDER, as it provides the hosting environment and the dissemination tool for all resulting outputs and products. The Knowledge Portal went online in June 2009 and has been continuously improved and amended ever since. Its main tool is the [http://www.un-spider.org/space-application-matrix Space Application Matrix], a sophisticated search engine to make available research papers and case studies on the application of different space-based resources in all phases of the disaster management cycle. The Portal also features the latest news from the disaster and risk management and the space communities, information on workshops, trainings and events as well as profile details on UN-SPIDER's network partners.

UN-SPIDER's knowledge management activities are accompanied by its awareness-raising efforts. Since awareness-raising is a process by which the level of understanding among the persons targeted is raised, fostering change in attitudes and behaviour, it is central to the success of promoting the use of space-based information. In the framework of UN-SPIDER, awareness-raising is designed as an ongoing process accompanying, facilitating and preparing activities, as new audiences are addressed, new partnerships are formed and new technological solutions are developed, offering new opportunities for existing and new target groups. UN-SPIDER implements its awareness-raising activities mainly via its publications such as the monthly [https://web.archive.org/web/20120625153634/http://www.un-spider.org/about/updates Updates] and the biannual [https://web.archive.org/web/20120625155446/http://www.un-spider.org/about/newsletter Newsletter] as well as via its Knowledge Portal.

===Outreach===
Experience shows that the conduction of activities targeting the full disaster management cycle spans a variety of agencies from the public and the private sector, at different levels, and is best conducted through a coordinated approach. UN-SPIDER's outreach activities contribute to involving practitioners and experts from the disaster management and space communities in UN-SPIDER activities with the end-goal to promote the use of space-based information to support the full disaster management cycle. 

UN-SPIDER's outreach activities include the organization of workshops, seminars and expert meetings in all regions as well as the support to similar events organized by its partners. UN-SPIDER staff furthermore participates in relevant events all over the world to raise awareness about UN-SPIDER's activities and the opportunities that space-based information offers for disaster and risk management.

===Technical Advisory Support===
Technical Advisory Support (TAS) is one of the prime activities of the UN-SPIDER programme at the national level. It serves to identify the existing capacity to use space-based information, to analyze the institutional framework to support disaster management through spacebased information and to identify the limitations that inhibit the use of such information. TAS attempts to enable Member States to overcome these limitations through international cooperation and regional opportunities, networking with regional institutions, and setting up disaster management plans. It covers region-specific aspects such as trans-boundary issues, emergency response, risk assessment, 
GIS-based disaster management systems, and disaster-risk reduction. TAS efforts range from a simple consultative phone call to the facilitation of technical support, missions, trainings and workshops. UN-SPIDER's TAS has three pilars: Technical Advisory Missions, Capacity Building and Facilitation of Emergency Support/Technical Support.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER May 2012 Newsletter: Technical Advisory Support http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/UN-SPIDER%20Newsletter%20Technical%20Advisory%20Support.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technical Advisory Missions''' (TAMs) are an instrument to identify the needs of Member States regarding their capacities to fully take advantage of space-based information. TAMs are officially requested by the respective national government and are conducted by a team of experts. The team meets with key disaster management and development authorities in the Government, United Nations organizations, regional and international organizations/initiatives and private entrepreneurs to discuss the topic in depth. It makes recommendations focusing on how to improve the access to and use of space-based information in risk and disaster management. Since 2008 various missions have been carried out to countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and the Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER's Technical Advisory Mission http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/advisory-missions&lt;/ref&gt;

UN-SPIDER defines its '''Capacity Building''' as the process of facilitating the strengthening of the competency of individuals, teams, and agencies to use space-based information to prevent, mitigate, and respond effectively to the challenges posed by natural hazards and related humanitarian crises. UN-SPIDER capacity building efforts include 
four complementary types of activities: Providing policy-relevant advice to institutions and governments regarding the use of space-based (spatial) information to support the full disaster management cycle, facilitating access to space-based data and services, facilitating the training of individuals on access to and use of such data and facilitating access to infrastructure, hardware, and software, and services for spacebased applications. Therefore, UN-SPIDER's capacity building simultaneously aims at institutions, individuals and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER's training activities http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/training-activities&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of emergencies and disasters, UN-SPIDER provides '''Emergency Support'''by taking the role of a bridge linking the disaster management agencies in charge of response operations with space agencies or the mechanisms which have been established by the space community such as the International Charter: Space and Major Disasters. UN-SPIDER provides this support through the activation of its network of Regional Support Offices (RSO) and through links with specific space agencies.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER's Emergency Support http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/emergency-support&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN-SPIDER's network==
UN-SPIDER created a global network in order to foster and strengthen strategic alliances and partnerships on a global and regional scale. There are two types of networks: Regional Support Offices (RSOs) and National Focal Points (NFP).

===Regional Support Offices===
A Regional Support Office is a regional or national center of expertise that is set up within an existing entity by a Member State.&lt;ref&gt;UN-SPIDER November 2014 Newsletter: Regional Support Offices http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/Newsletter_online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a network of Regional Support Offices was agreed upon by the United Nations General Assembly in its Resolution 61/110. UN-SPIDER currently has Regional Support Offices in Algeria, Argentina, Japan, Colombia, Hungary, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Romania, Russia, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, and West Indies. Detailed information on all UN-SPIDER Regional Support Offices can be found in the  [https://web.archive.org/web/20100525234115/http://www.un-spider.org/regional-support-offices UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal]

Regional Support Offices communicate and coordinate with UN-SPIDER staff on regular basis, covering the three following realms:
* Outreach and Capacity Building activities
* Horizontal Cooperation (Communities of Practice, Knowledge Management, contributions to the Knowledge Portal)
* Technical Advisory Support

===National Focal Points===
As defined by the United Nations General Assembly, a National Focal Point is a national institution, nominated by the government of the respective country, representing the disaster management and space applications communities. Among them are for example members of the space - or civil protection agencies. UN-SPIDER networks with all countries through the National Focal Points.

A national Focal Point works with UN-SPIDER staff to achieve the following goals:
* promoting access to and the use of space-based solutions for disaster management in the respective country
* strengthening national disaster management planning and policies
* implementing specific national activities that incorporate space-based technology solutions in support of disaster management

An '''underwater acoustic positioning system'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dosits.org/gallery/tech/n/at1.htm University of Rhode Island: Discovery of Sound in the Sea]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underwater Acoustic Positioning Systems, P.H. '''Milne''' 1983, {{ISBN|0-87201-012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a system for the tracking and navigation of underwater vehicles or divers by means of acoustic distance and/or direction measurements, and subsequent position triangulation. Underwater acoustic positioning systems are commonly used in a wide variety of underwater work, including oil and gas exploration, [[Oceanography|ocean sciences]], salvage operations, [[Maritime archaeology|marine archaeology]], law enforcement and military activities.

==Method of operation==
Figure 1 describes the general method of operation of an acoustic positioning system,&lt;ref&gt;The ROV Manual, Robert D. '''Christ''' and Robert L. '''Wernli''' Sr 2007, pages 96-103, {{ISBN|978-0-7506-8148-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is an example of a long baseline (LBL) positioning system for [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]

[[Image:LBL Acoustic Positioning Aquamap ROV.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Figure 1: Method of the operation of a Long Baseline (LBL) acoustic positioning system for ROV]]

;Baseline station deployment and survey

Acoustic positioning systems measure positions relative to a framework of baseline stations, which must be deployed prior to operations.  In the case of a long-baseline (LBL) system, a set of three or more baseline transponders are deployed on the sea floor.  The location of the baseline transponders either [[local coordinates|relative to each other]] or in [[Geographic coordinate system|global coordinates]] must then be measured precisely. Some systems assist this task with an automated acoustic self-survey, and in other cases [[GPS]] is used to establish the position of each baseline transponder as it is deployed or after deployment.

;Tracking or navigation operations

Following the baseline deployment and survey, the acoustic positioning system is ready for operations.  In the long baseline example (see figure 1), an interrogator (A) is mounted on the ROV that is to be tracked.  The interrogator transmits an acoustic signal that is received by the baseline transponders (B, C, D, E). The reply of the baseline transponders is received again at the ROV. The signal time-of-flight or the corresponding distances A-B, A-C, A-D and A-E are transmitted via the ROV umbilical (F) to the surface, where the ROV position is computed and displayed on a tracking screen.  The acoustic distance measurements may be augmented by [[Pressure sensor|depth sensor data]] to obtain better positioning accuracy in the three-dimensional underwater space.

Acoustic positioning systems can yield an accuracy of a few centimeters to tens of meters and can be used over operating distance from tens of meters to tens of kilometers.  Performance depends strongly on the type and model of the positioning system, its configuration for a particular job, and the characteristics of the underwater acoustic environment at the work site.

==Classes==

Underwater acoustic positioning systems are generally categorized into three broad types or classes&lt;ref&gt;'''Milne''', chapters 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Christ and Wernli''', sections 4.2.6-4.2.7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Long Baseline Acoustic Positioning System|Long-baseline (LBL) systems]], as in figure 1 above, use a sea-floor baseline transponder network.  The transponders are typically mounted in the corners of the operations site.  LBL systems yield very high accuracy of generally better than 1 m and sometimes as good as 0.01m along with very robust positions&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/deeparch/www/research/precisionnav.html MIT Deepwater Archaeology Research Group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/deeparch/www/publications/papers/FoleyMindell2002.pdf B.P. Foley and D.A. Mindell, "Precision Survey and Archaeological Methodology in Deep Water," ENALIA The Journal of the Hellenic Institute of Marine Archaeology, Vol. VI, 49-56, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that the transponders are installed in the reference frame of the work site itself (i.e. on the sea floor), the wide transponder spacing results in an ideal geometry for position computations, and the LBL system operates without an acoustic path to the (potentially distant) sea surface.
     
[[Ultra-short baseline|Ultra-short-baseline (USBL) systems]]  and the related super-short-baseline (SSBL) systems rely on a small (ex. 230&amp;nbsp;mm across), tightly integrated transducer array that is typically mounted on the bottom end of a strong, rigid transducer pole which is installed either on the side or in some cases on the bottom of a surface vessel.&lt;ref&gt;'''Milne''', chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Christ and Wernli''', section 4.2.6.3&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike LBL and SBL systems, which determine position by measuring multiple distances, the USBL transducer array is used to measure the target ''distance'' from the transducer pole by using signal run time, and the target ''direction'' by measuring the [[phase shift]] of the reply signal as seen by the individual elements of the transducer array.  The combination of distance and direction fixes the position of the tracked target relative to the surface vessel.  Additional sensors including GPS, a gyro or electronic compass and a vertical reference unit are then used to compensate for the changing position and orientation (pitch, roll, bearing) of the surface vessel and its transducer pole.  USBL systems offer the advantage of not requiring a sea floor transponder array.  The disadvantage is that positioning accuracy and robustness is not as good as for LBL systems. The reason is that the fixed angle resolved by a USBL system translates to a larger position error at greater distance. Also, the multiple sensors needed for the USBL transducer pole position and orientation compensation each introduce additional errors. Finally, the non-uniformity of the underwater acoustic environment cause signal refractions and reflections that have a greater impact on USBL positioning than is the case for the LBL geometry.

[[Short Baseline Acoustic Positioning System|Short-baseline (SBL) systems]] use a baseline consisting of three or more individual sonar transducers that are connected by wire to a central control box. Accuracy depends on transducer spacing and mounting method. When a wider spacing is employed as when working from a large working barge or when operating from a dock or other fixed platform, the performance can be similar to LBL systems.  When operating from a small boat where transducer spacing is tight, accuracy is reduced.  Like USBL systems, SBL systems are frequently mounted on boats and ships, but specialized modes of deployment are common too. For example, the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] uses a SBL system to position the [[Jason (ROV)|Jason]] deep-ocean ROV relative to its associated MEDEA [[depressor weight]] with a reported accuracy of 9&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/mindell/www/Publications/MTSsharpspaper.pdf Integrating Precision Relative Positioning Into JASON/MEDEA ROV Operations, Bingham et al., MTS Journal Spring 2006 (Volume 40, Number 1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GPS intelligent buoys]] (GIB) systems are inverted LBL devices where the transducers are replaced by floating buoys, self-positioned by GPS. The tracked position is calculated in realtime at the surface from the Time-Of-Arrival (TOAs) of the acoustic signals sent by the underwater device, and acquired by the buoys. Such configuration allow fast, calibration-free deployment with an accuracy similar to LBL systems. At the opposite of LBL, SBL or USBL systems, GIB systems use one-way acoustic signals from the emitter to the buoys, making it less sensitive to surface or wall reflections. GIB systems are used to track AUVs, torpedoes, or divers, may be used to localize airplanes black-boxes, and may be used to determine the impact coordinates of inert or live weapons for weapon testing and training purposes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tridentresearch.com/pubs/Weapon_Scoring_Results_from_GPS_Acoustic_System.pdf Kayser, J.R., Cardoza, M.A., et. al., "Weapon Scoring Results from a GPS Acoustic Weapons Test and Training System", Institute of Navigation National Technical Meeting, San Diego, CA, 24-26 January 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tridentresearch.com/pubs/InsideGNSS_8x11.pdf Cardoza, M.A., Kayser, J.R., &amp; Wade, B.

==History and examples of use==

[[Image:USNS Mizar.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Figure 2a: An acoustic short baseline (SBL) positioning system was installed on the ''USNS Mizar'' during the search dives to the wreckage of the submarine ''USS Thresher'']]
[[Image:Bathyscaphe Trieste.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Figure 2b: The bathyscaphe ''Trieste'' was guided by that acoustic positioning system to the ''Thresher'']]

An early use of underwater acoustic positioning systems, credited with initiating the modern day development of these systems,&lt;ref&gt;'''Milne''', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; involved the loss of the American nuclear submarine [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)|USS ''Thresher'']] on 10 April 1963 in a water depth of 2560m.&lt;ref&gt;'''Christ and Wernle''', page 96&lt;/ref&gt;  An acoustic short baseline (SBL) positioning system was installed on the oceanographic vessel [[USNS Mizar (T-AGOR-11)|USNS ''Mizar'']].  This system was used to guide the bathyscaphe [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste 1]] to the wreck site.  Yet, the state of the technology was still so poor that out of ten search dives by Trieste 1, visual contact was only made once with the wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;'''Milne''', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Acoustic positioning was again used in 1966, to aid in the search and subsequent recovery of a nuclear bomb lost [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash|during the crash of a B-52 bomber]] at sea off the coast of Spain.

In the 1970s, oil and gas exploration in deeper waters required improved underwater positioning accuracy to place drill strings into the exact position referenced earlier thorough seismic instrumentation&lt;ref&gt;'''Christ and Wernli''', section 4.2.1&lt;/ref&gt; and to perform other underwater construction tasks.

[[Image:Mir front.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Figure 3: The Russian deep sea submersibles ''MIR-1'' and ''MIR-2'' searched the wreck site of the Japanese submarine ''I-52'' in 1998. A LBL positioning system was used to guide and document the progressing search over multiple dives]]

But, the technology also started to be used in other applications.  In 1998, salvager Paul Tidwell and his company Cape Verde Explorations led an expedition to the wreck site of the World War 2 [[Japanese submarine I-52 (1943)|Japanese cargo submarine I-52]] in the mid-Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Dive, National Geographic Magazine October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Resting at a depth of 5240 meters, it had been located and then identified using side scan sonar and an underwater tow sled in 1995. War-time records indicated the I-52 was bound for Germany, with a cargo including 146 gold bars in 49 metal boxes.  This time, Mr. Tidwell's company had hired the Russian oceanographic vessel, the ''Akademik Mstislav Keldysh'' with its two manned deep-ocean  submersibles ''MIR-1'' and ''MIR-2'' (figure 3). In order to facilitate precise navigation across the debris field and assure a thorough search, ''MIR-1'' deployed a long baseline transponder network on the first dive. Over a series of seven dives by each submersible, the debris field was progressively searched. The LBL positioning record indicated the broadening search coverage after each dive, allowing the team to concentrate on yet unsearched areas during the following dive.  No gold was found, but the positioning system had documented the extent of the search.

In recent years, several trends in underwater acoustic positioning have emerged.  One is the introduction of compound systems such the combination of LBL and USBL in a so-called LUSBL&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dynamic-positioning.com/dp2002/acoustics_flexible_davis.pdf Flexible Acoustic Positioning System Architecture, Davis, MTS Dynamic Positioning Conference 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; configuration to enhance performance. These systems are generally used in the offshore oil &amp; gas sector and other high-end applications.  Another trend is the introduction of compact, task optimized systems for a variety of specialized purposes. For example, the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] commissioned a system (figure 4), which continually measures the opening area and geometry of a fish sampling net during a trawl. That information helps the department improve the accuracy of their fish stock assessments in the [[Sacramento River Delta]].

[[Image:NetTrack Operation.jpg|thumb|640px|center|Figure 4: NetTrack is an example of a special-purpose underwater acoustic positioning system of the SBL type, designed to measure the opening geometry and area of a trawl net for accurate fish stock assessment purposes. Left: Four small responders (A, B, C, D) are mounted in the corners of the trawl net opening and wired via junction bottle (E) and umbilical (F) to a surface station computer. Center: The net is deployed. Right: The surface station computer sends instructions to one responder (ex. A) to transmit, while instructing the other responders (ex. B, C, D) to receive. By this method all six distances (A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D) are measured. The four sides of the opening and one diagonal are used to triangulate the trawl net opening geometry and area. The second diagonal is available to compute a measurement error metric for data quality verification.]]

The libraries in Reston and Menlo Park have been designated as official Federal Government Depositories providing public access to selected U.S. Government publications.

==U.S. Geological Survey Library Classification System==
The newly revised classification system presented in this report is designed for use in the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) Library and other earth science libraries. Prior to the administration of Fred Boughton Weeks, 1903-1908, the library lacked a classification scheme. The Dewey Decimal system for geologic material was not sufficiently developed to accommodate the range of specialized material collected at the USGS Library, and The [[Library of Congress Classification]] System had not yet been published. The library staff and patrons were concerned about continued development of the collection without an acceptable classification scheme.
Mr. Weeks and bibliographer John M. Nickles of the library staff, with the assistance of three
consultants from the New York Public Library, developed the USGS classification system designed specifically for an earth science library.
The U.S. Geological Survey Library classification system has been designed for earth science
libraries. It is a tool for assigning call numbers to earth science and allied pure science materials in order to collect these materials into related subject groups on the library shelves and arrange them alphabetically by author and title. The classification can be used as a retrieval system to access materials through the subject and geographic numbers.
The classification scheme has been developed over the years since 1904 to meet the ever-changing needs of increased specialization and the development of new areas of research in the earth sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Sasscer, R.

==Special Library Collections==

===Field Records Collection — Denver, Colorado===
The [http://www.cr.usgs.gov/fieldrecords/ Field Records Collection] is an archive of unpublished field notes, correspondence, manuscripts, maps, analysis reports and other data created or collected by USGS geologists during field studies and other project work. The majority of the collection dates from 1879 and relates to work done in the contiguous United States. Materials in the collection represent almost 130 years of scientific investigations by the USGS, from the earliest days of the agency to recently completed projects. Records contributed by approximately 1,200 USGS scientists are presently archived. Located in the Central Region Library in Denver, Colorado, the collection is available for on-premises examination during normal library hours.
Field records and project archives on [[Alaska]] are kept in the Alaska Technical Data Unit Field Records Archive.

===Rare Books and Maps===
The Rare Book Collection of the USGS Library comprises unusual publications, rare books, and maps collected since 1879. Included are historical maps and publications of the Survey, as well as early publications of many federal, state and other geological surveys. Records of select geological societies are also maintained in the collection, such as the [[Geological Society of Washington]], which was founded by [[John Wesley Powell]] and other noted scientists after the Civil War. Of special note are many 19th century maps with topics such as American political boundaries, transportation, geology, and mining.

===Desnoyers Collection===
At an auction in Paris, France, pieces of M. [[Jules Desnoyers]]'s (1800–1887) library were purchased in 1885 by the USGS Library to start the foreign country collection. M. Desnoyers was a founder and later Secretary of the [[Société Géologique de France]], and in 1834 he was appointed librarian of the [[Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]] in Paris.

===William R. Halliday Collection===
William R. Halliday, M.D. (b. 1926), joined the [[National Speleological Society]] in 1947. By the late 1950s he was director of the [[Western Speleological Survey]]. His works include Adventure Is Underground (1959), Caves of California (1962), Caves of Washington (1963), Depths of the Earth (1966), Caves and Cavers of the United States (1966), American Caves and Caving (1974), Discovery and Exploration of the Oregon Caves: [[Oregon Caves National Monument]] (with [[Frank K. Walsh]]; 1976) and, [[Floyd Collins]] of Sand Cave: A Photographic Memorial (1998). He donated his private collection of rare and out-of-print books and pamphlets on caves, caving and speleology to the USGS Library in 2000.

Dr. Halliday has also donated several collections of private papers, correspondence and research to the [[University of Washington]] Library and to the [[J. Willard Marriott Library]] of the [[University of Utah]].

===Kunz Collection===
In 1933, the Library acquired the [[George F. Kunz]] collection for $1.00 from the estate of the former USGS employee and Vice-President of [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]]  The George F. Kunz Collection is a significant special collection on gems and minerals including rare books on gemology, the folklore of gemstones through history, lapidary arts and archival gem trade records important to the provenance of named stones such as the "[[Hope Diamond]]." Kunz was a former USGS employee, a vice-president of Tiffany &amp; Co., and one of the world's preeminent gem experts. The collection was acquired through the genroisty of Dr. Kunz's heirs, Mrs. [[Opal Kunz]] and Mrs. [[Hans Zinsser]]. Mr. Walter E. Reid, mining consultant and strong friend of the library, was largely instrumental in securing the Kunz collection.&lt;ref&gt;Heers, William H. 1937. "The U.S. Geological Survey Library." The Mineralogist. Volume V (6), pages 3-4, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The George F. Kunz Collection is a significant special collection of many rare books, pamphlets, and other unique materials on the acquisition, collecting and lore of jewels and precious stones. Acquired by the US Geological Survey Library in 1933 after the death of George F. Kunz, a noted mineralogist and vice-president of the Tiffany &amp; Co. of New York, the Kunz Collection today is fairly unknown outside of a small circle of gemologists, historians, and art collectors. In this paper, a short biography of George F. Kunz is given, as well as a description of the contents and scope of his collection held in the USGS Library. Some examples of the unique materials held in the collection are shown. How the Kunz Collection is used by library patrons and museums is also discussed. Appended to the paper is a bibliography of the works by and about Dr. Kunz."&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. [http://rock.geosociety.org/absindex/annual/1999/50292.htm "George F. Kunz Collection."] Denver, Colorado: Geoscience Information Society, 34th annual meeting, 1999. Includes bibliographic references (p. 142-146). Paper presented to the Geological Society of America Annual Convention in Denver, CO.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Map Collection===
The library's map collections have provided invaluable aid to authorities and scientists in times of crisis (the California Northridge earthquake in 1994 and major fires in the nation's forests). Topographic maps have also been used for genealogy research to pinpoint where ancestors lived, locate forgotten cemeteries, provide information on boundary changes, and research natural and man-made changes to areas over time. Planners have used the foreign map collections to study foreign terrain, geologic conditions and natural resources. During WWII, The [[New York Times]] (June 11, 1944) reported "A 'Commando' raid by a group of civilian scientists, a search through obscure seventeenth century French manuscripts, months of study of geological reports, experiments with model beaches – all these were part of the Allied preparations for the invasion of Normandy … The dramatic story of the preparations, which began in … libraries, shifted to laboratories and ended on the shell-swept beaches …". The collections were consulted for the military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Library maps have provided aid in international disaster areas such as the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch and volcanoes worldwide. A brief mention of a diamond found in the 1906 annual report of the USGS began a trail of research and investigation that led one geologist to prospect for diamonds in Canada.

===Topographic Map Archive===
Responsibility for the Topographic Map Archive was formally transferred to the USGS Library in Reston, Virginia, in March 2003. The Archive includes each U.S. state and territory, in all scales, editions and various printings. With coverage dating from the 1880s when the USGS began publishing standard topographic quadrangles; the Archive is the most complete collection of USGS topographic maps.

===Heringen Collection===
The Heringen Collection, is a group of military texts and maps, looted by the Nazis from European libraries, universities, geological societies, private businesses, homes and offices. Hidden in a potash mine in [[Heringen]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], they were transported by the U.S. military at the end of WWII as captured war materials. Some 23,000 reports, books and maps were accepted by the USGS Library and integrated into the main collection. The materials are consulted for research ranging from European road development, water resources use or mining and construction. In 1946, the Heringen Collection was transferred from the U.S. Geological Survey's [[Military Geology Unit]] to the Library.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. "The Heringen Collection." Information Bulletin. Western Association of Map Libraries (WAML). Volume 40 (1), November 2008. {{ISSN|0049-7282}}. Page 15.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published in journal, Earth Sciences History, the author says that the results of the German theft of Russian maps influenced the way they made maps for the next two generations. "The Heringen Collection at the US Geological Survey is a special collection of maps, books and reports stolen by units of the German Wehrmacht (armed forces) as they invaded and occupied countries during World War II. The materials in the Collection came from private, society and public library collections, and were used by military geologists in each German army to help protect its soldiers, to advance their invasion, and to consolidate their occupation. They used the maps of the occupied countries against their peoples. For a generation after the invasion of the Soviet Union, this influenced the way Russian maps were drawn and printed."&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA496551  "The Heringen Collection of the US Geological Survey Library of Reston, Virginia."] Earth Sciences History, Volume 27, Number 2. Page 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Antarctic Resource Center===
The U.S. Antarctic Resource Center (USARC) in Reston, Virginia, is our Nation's depository for [[Antarctic]] maps, charts, geodetic ground control, satellite images, aerial photographs, publications, slides, and video tapes. These resources are produced by [[Antarctic Treaty]] nations in support of their activities in Antarctica and provided to the USARC in compliance with a standing resolution of the treaty providing for exchange of information. The USGS maintains these materials through an interagency cooperative agreement with the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), which also supports the USGS Antarctic Mapping Program.

===USGS Photographic Collection===
The [http://libraryphoto.cr.usgs.gov Photographic Library] is an archive of still photographs and original sketches dating from the 1870s and taken by USGS scientists as part of their field studies. Topics include USGS personnel, earthquakes, volcanoes, geologic hazards and other phenomena, historical mining operations, and earth science photographs. The works of pioneer photographers such as [[William Henry Jackson]], [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]], [[Carleton Watkins]], [[John Karl Hillers]], [[Thomas Moran]], [[Andrew J. Russell]], [[E. O. Beaman]] and [[William Bell (photographer)]] are represented in the collection. Some photographs have been used to illustrate publications, but most have never been published.

==History==
Congress authorized a Library for the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) in 1879. The library was formally established in 1882, with the naming of the first librarian, Charles C. Darwin, and began with a staff of 3 and a collection of 1,400 books. The Act of Congress establishing the USGS authorized the creation of a program for exchanging copies of USGS reports for publications of state, national, and international organizations. The exchange program was modeled after a program used by Dr. [[Ferdinand V. Hayden]] when he was head of the Interior Department's U.S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories (1867–1879). The U.S. Geological Survey Library inherited 1,000 volumes of serials from Dr. Hayden's former exchange program, which he had based on the program begun by the Smithsonian Institution in 1846.
After Dr. Hayden died in 1887, his widow donated his personal collection to the U.S. Geological Survey Library. Other early gifts were made by Major [[John Wesley Powell]], second Director of the US Geological Survey, who donated his collection of State Geological Survey reports and the family of Dr. [[Isaac Lea]] (Philadelphia publisher and gem collector whose family donated nearly 600 items of his personal library). Dr. William Halliday, a world-renowned speleologist began donating his cave collection in 2003.

In a review of the USGS Library operations in 1937, William Heers, the Chief Librarian, noted that the library had more than 200,000 books and reports, about 60,000 pamphlets, and also about 60,000 maps, most of these obtained by gift and exchange. Fully half of those researchers who used the library were outside of the US Geological Survey. In service to those outside the government, between 8-10,000 books were loaned out each year through [[interlibrary loan]]s, both within the continental US and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Heers, William H. 1937. "The U.S. Geological Survey Library." The Mineralogist. Volume V (6), pages 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the USGS Library during its centennial, it was noted that in 1978 the library had acquired nearly 116,000 new items. About 75% of these were journals, of which 10,000 serial, magazine, and other periodical titles were received. In 1978, the library also circulated 105,000 items, made 17,700 [[interlibrary loan]]s and answered some 27,000 requests for information.&lt;ref&gt;"Books, Maps..." Geotimes. March 1979. Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the USGS Library joined the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/general_pages/2012BHLMembership.pdf Press Release: Biodiversity Heritage Library Adds Two Partners. Smithsonian Libraries. March 5, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of contributing important historical works related to taxonomy as well as relevant USGS publications.

The U.S. Geological Survey Library system has become the largest earth science library in the world. Materials within the library system include books and maps dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries. Other materials include a nearly complete set of the various State Geological Survey publications and a virtually complete set of USGS topographic maps.
The original collection was based on exchange partnerships with domestic and international scientific organizations.

In [[astronomy]], [[geography]], and related sciences and contexts, a ''[[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]]'' or ''[[plane (geometry)|plane]]'' passing by a given point is said to be '''vertical''' if it contains the local [[gravity direction]] at that point.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, a direction or plane is said to be '''horizontal''' if it is perpendicular to the vertical direction.

The usage of the inter-related terms '''horizontal''' and '''vertical''' as well as their symmetries and asymmetries vary with context (e.g. two vs. three dimensions).
In general, something that is vertical can be drawn from up to down (or down to up), such as the y-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==Historical definition==
[[Girard Desargues]] defined the vertical to be [[horizon#Projective geometry|perpendicular to the horizon]] in his ''Perspective'' of 1636.

The word "horizontal" is derived from "[[horizon]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|horizontal}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas "vertical" originates in the late [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|verticalis}}'', which is from the same root as ''[[Vertex (disambiguation)|vertex]]'' 'highest point'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|vertical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geophysical definition==

===The plumb line and spirit level===
[[File:Bubble on a marble shelf.PNG|thumb|Spirit level bubble on a marble shelf tests for horizontality]]
In physics, in engineering, and in construction, the direction designated as vertical is usually that along which a [[plumb-bob]] hangs. Alternatively, a [[spirit level]] that exploits the buoyancy of an air bubble and its tendency to go vertically upwards may be used to test for horizontality. Modern rotary laser levels that can level themselves automatically are robust sophisticated instruments and work on the same fundamental principle.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.laser-level.co.uk/products/stabila-rotary-lasers/stabila-lar200.html Laser Levels]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For how a spirit level works, see http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=562730&lt;/ref&gt;

===The flat earth approximation===
In the flat earth scenario,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Theory and Problems of Theoretical Mechanics" by Murray R Spiegel, 1987, pg 62&lt;/ref&gt; where the earth is notionally a large (infinite) flat surface with gravitational field at a right angle to the surface, the earth surface is horizontal and any plane parallel to the earth surface is also horizontal.  Vertical planes, e.g., walls, may be parallel to each other or they may intersect at a vertical line. Horizontal surfaces do not intersect. Furthermore, a  plane cannot both be a horizontal plane at one place and a vertical plane somewhere else.

===The spherical Earth===
[[File:Vertical wall are never parallel.PNG|thumb|Strictly, vertical walls are never parallel on the surface of a spherical planet]]
When the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the concepts of vertical and horizontal take on yet another meaning. On the surface of a smoothly spherical, homogenous, non-rotating planet, the plumb bob picks out as vertical the radial direction. Strictly speaking, it is now no longer possible for vertical walls to be parallel: ''all'' verticals intersect. This fact has real practical applications in construction and civil engineering, e.g., the tops of the towers of a suspension bridge are further apart than at the bottom. 
&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia.com. In very long bridges, it may be necessary to take the earth's curvature into account when designing the towers. For example, in the New York's Verrazano Narrows Bridge, the towers, which are 700 ft (215 m) tall and stand 4260 ft (298 m) apart, are about 1.75 in (4.5 cm) farther apart at the top than they are at the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Horizontal planes can intersect.PNG|thumbnail|On a spherical planet, horizontal planes intersect. In the example shown, the blue line represents the tangent plane at the North pole, the red the tangent plane at an equatorial point. The two intersect at a right angle.]]
Also, horizontal planes can intersect when they are [[tangent]] planes to separated points on the surface of the earth. In particular, a plane tangent to a point on the equator intersects the plane tangent to the [[North Pole]] at a [[right angle]]. (See diagram).
Furthermore, the [[equator]]ial plane is parallel to the tangent plane at the North Pole and as such has claim to be a horizontal plane. But it is. at the same time, a vertical plane for points on the equator. In this sense, a plane can, arguably, be ''both'' horizontal and vertical, horizontal ''at one place'', and vertical ''at another''.

=== Further complications===
{{Main Article|Vertical deflection}}
For a spinning earth, the plumb line deviates from the radial direction as a function of latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://faculty.trinityvalleyschool.org/hoseltom/handouts/Chap%2014-Ax-Plumb-bob%20Deviation%20w%20Latitude-34PbyE.pdf|title= Working in the Rotating Reference Frame of the Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only at the North and South Poles does the plumb line align with the local radius. The situation is actually even more complicated because earth is not a [[homogeneous]] smooth sphere. It is a non homogeneous, non spherical, knobby planet in motion, and the vertical not only need not lie along a radial, it may even be curved and be varying with time. On a smaller scale, a mountain to one side may deflect the plumb bob away from the true [[zenith]].&lt;ref&gt;Such a deflection was measured by [[Nevil Maskelyne]]. See Maskelyne, N. (1775). "An Account of Observations Made on the Mountain Schiehallion for Finding Its Attraction". Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. 65 (0): 500–542. doi:10.1098/rstl.1775.0050. [[Charles Hutton]] used the observed value to determine the density of the earth.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a larger scale the gravitational field of the earth, which is at least approximately radial near the earth, is not radial when it is affected by the moon at higher altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Walls and floors ===
[[File:Brick wall close-up view.jpg|thumb|Brick wall showing horizontal mortar courses and vertical perpendiculars. By contrast, a level floor only contains horizontal lines.]] 
On a (horizontal) floor, one can draw a horizontal line but not a vertical line in the sense of a plumb bob line. But on a (vertical) wall, one can draw both vertical ''and'' horizontal lines. In this sense, a vertical wall allows more options. This is reflected in the tools a bricklayer uses: a plumb line for verticality and a spirit level to check that the mortar courses are horizontal.
On the other hand, in contrast to a wall a horizontal floor allows more options when one considers compass directions. One can draw on a floor lines going north, south, east, and west, in fact, along any compass direction. A wall allows fewer options.

=== Independence of horizontal and vertical motions ===
Neglecting the curvature of the earth, horizontal and vertical motions of a projectile moving under gravity are independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Salters Hornerns Advanced Physics Project, As Student Book, Edexcel Pearson, London,  2008, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical displacement of a projectile is not affected by the horizontal component of the launch velocity, and, conversely, the horizontal displacement is unaffected by the vertical component.  The notion dates at least as far back as Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;See Galileo's discussion of how bodies rise and fall under gravity on a moving ship in his ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems''(trans. S. Drake). University of California Press, Berkeley, 1967, pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the independence of the two motion does ''not'' hold. For example, even a projectile fired in a horizontal direction (i.e., with a zero vertical component) may leave the surface of the spherical earth and indeed escape altogether.&lt;ref&gt;See Harris Benson ''University Physics'', New York 1991, page 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical definition==

===In two dimensions===
[[File:Vertical horizontal.PNG|thumb|In two dimensions. 1. The vertical direction is designated. 2. The horizontal is normal to the vertical. Through any point P, there is exactly one vertical and exactly one horizontal. Alternatively, one can start by designating the horizontal direction.]]

In the context of a two-dimensional orthogonal [[Cartesian coordinate system]] on  a Euclidean plane, to say that a line is horizontal or vertical, an initial designation has to be made. One can start off by designating the vertical direction, usually labelled  the Y direction.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of identification of the ''y''-axis with the vertical, and the ''x''-axis with the horizontal, see G.S.Rehill's ''Interactive Maths Series, "Building a Strong foundation in Mathematics"'', accessible on http://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year8/ch15_graphs/05_hor/ver.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The horizontal direction, usually labelled the X direction,&lt;ref&gt;For a definition of "Horizontal axis" see Math Dictionary at http://www.icoachmath.com/math_dictionary/Horizontal_Axis.html&lt;/ref&gt; is then automatically determined. Or, one can do it the other way around, i.e., nominate the ''x''-axis, in which case the ''y''-axis is then automatically determined. There is no special reason to choose the horizontal over the vertical as the initial designation: the two directions are on par in this respect.

The following hold in the two-dimensional case:
# Through any point P in the plane, there is one and only one ''vertical line'' within the plane and one and only one ''horizontal line'' within the plane. This symmetry breaks down as one moves to the three-dimensional case.
# A  ''vertical line'' is any line parallel to the vertical direction. A ''horizontal line'' is any line normal to a vertical line.
# Horizontal lines do not cross each other.
#Vertical lines do not cross each other.

Not all of these elementary geometric facts are true in the 3-D context.

===In three dimensions===
In the three-dimensional case, the situation is more complicated as now one has horizontal and vertical planes in addition to horizontal and vertical lines. Consider a point P and designate a direction through P as vertical. A plane which contains P and is normal to the designated direction is the ''[[horizontal plane]]'' at P. Any plane going through P, normal to the horizontal plane is a  ''[[vertical plane]]'' at P. Through any point P, there is one and only one horizontal plane but a ''multiplicity'' of vertical planes. This is a new feature that emerges in three dimensions. The symmetry that exists in the two-dimensional case no longer holds.

=== In the classroom===
[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The ''y''-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal]]
In the 2-dimension case, as mentioned already, the usual designation of the vertical coincides with the [[y-axis]] in co-ordinate geometry. This convention can cause confusion in the classroom. For the teacher, writing perhaps on a white board, the ''y''-axis really is  vertical in the sense of the plumbline verticality but for the student the axis may well lie on a horizontal table.

Although the word horizontal is commonly used in daily life and language (see below), it is subject to many misconceptions.

* The concept of horizontality only makes sense in the context of a clearly measurable gravity field, i.e., in the 'neighborhood' of a planet, star, etc. When the gravity field becomes very weak (the masses are too small or too distant from the point of interest), the notion of being horizontal loses its meaning.
[[File:Verticals at separate points.PNG|thumb|Verticals at two separate points are not parallel. The same holds for their associated horizontal planes]]
* A plane is horizontal only at the chosen point. Horizontal planes at two separate points are not parallel, they intersect.
* In general, a horizontal plane will only be perpendicular to a [[vertical direction]] if both are specifically defined with respect to the same point: a direction is only vertical at the point of reference. Thus both horizontality and verticality are strictly speaking local concepts, and it is always necessary to state to which location the direction or the plane refers to. Note that (1) the same restriction applies to the straight lines contained within the plane: they are horizontal only at the point of reference, and (2) those straight lines contained in the plane but not passing by the reference point are not necessarily horizontal anywhere.
[[File:Gravitational field due to knobbly planet.PNG|thumb|field lines for a non homogeneous knobbly planet in motion may be curved. The white, red and hlue bits illustrate the planet's heterogeneity.]]
* In reality, the gravity field of a heterogeneous planet such as [[Earth]] is deformed due to the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of materials with different [[density|densities]]. Actual horizontal planes are thus not even parallel even if their reference points are along the same vertical line, since a vertical line is slightly curved.
* At any given location, the total gravitational force is not quite constant over [[time]], because the objects that generate the gravity are moving. For instance, on Earth the horizontal plane at a given point (as determined by a pair of [[spirit level]]s) changes with the position of the Moon (air, sea and land [[tide]]s).
* On a rotating planet such as Earth, the strictly gravitational pull of the planet (and other celestial objects such as the Moon, the [[Sun]], etc.) is different from the apparent net force (e.g., on a free-falling object) that can be measured in the laboratory or in the field. This difference is the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] associated with the planet's rotation. This is a [[fictitious force]]: it only arises when calculations or experiments are conducted in [[Inertial frame of reference|non-inertial frames of reference]], such as the surface of the Earth.

In general, something that is horizontal can be drawn from left to right (or right to left), such as the x-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Practical use in daily life===

The concept of a horizontal plane is thus anything but simple, although, in practice, most of these effects and variations are rather small: they are measurable and can be predicted with great accuracy, but they may not greatly affect our daily life.

This dichotomy between the apparent simplicity of a concept and an actual complexity of defining (and measuring) it in scientific terms arises from the fact that the typical linear scales and dimensions of relevance in daily life are 3 [[orders of magnitude]] (or more) smaller than the size of the Earth. Hence, the world appears to be flat locally, and horizontal planes in nearby locations appear to be parallel. Such statements are nevertheless approximations; whether they are acceptable in any particular context or application depends on the applicable requirements, in particular in terms of accuracy.
[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The y-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal.]]
In graphical contexts, such as [[Technical drawing|drawing and drafting]] and Co-ordinate geometry on rectangular paper, it is very common to associate one of the dimensions of the paper with a horizontal, even though the entire sheet of paper is standing on a flat horizontal (or slanted) table. In this case, the horizontal direction is typically from the left side of the paper to the right side. This is purely conventional (although it is somehow 'natural' when drawing a natural scene as it is seen in reality), and may lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions, especially in an educational context.
