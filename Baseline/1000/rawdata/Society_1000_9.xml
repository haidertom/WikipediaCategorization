      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7141">'''Alsager Hay Hill''' (1 October 1839 &amp;ndash; 2 August 1906) was an English [[Reform movement|social reform]]er active during the late 19th century, influential on poor law reform and employment issues. He founded one of the first [[labour exchange]]s and a newspaper, ''Labour News'' that is still published today, albeit under a new title: ''[[Construction News]]''.

==Early life==
Hill was born at [[Gressenhall]] Hall in [[Norfolk]], the second son in a family of five sons and six daughters of John David Hay Hill, lord of the manor of Gressenhall, and Margaret (second daughter of the hop merchant and former MP for [[Cashel (UK Parliament constituency)|Cashel]], [[Ebenezer John Collett]]).&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;Owen, William Benjamin (1912). "Hill, Alsager Hay". In Lee, Sidney. ''Dictionary of National Biography'', 1912 supplement. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill was educated at [[Brighton College]] (1850–54) and at [[Cheltenham College]] (1854–57).&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; In 1857 he obtained an exhibition at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Caius College]], [[Cambridge]], migrating as scholar to [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]], where he graduated LLB in 1862.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; Becoming a student of the [[Inner Temple]] in October 1860, he was [[call to the bar|called to the bar]] in January 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Calls to the Bar, ''Reading Mercury'', Saturday 30 January 1864. Berkshire, England&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social reform==
He joined the south-eastern circuit, but soon devoted his energies to journalism and to literature, interesting himself especially in poor law and labour questions, and working as almoner to the Society for the Relief of Distress in the East of London.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; In letters to the press during 1868 Hill called attention to weaknesses in the [[poor laws]], and urged a more scientific classification of paupers (''[[The Times]]'', 9 January 1868). His pamphlet on ''Our Unemployed,'' prepared for the [[National Association for the Promotion of Social Science]], and published in 1867, was one of the first to call public attention to the problem of [[unemployment]], and to suggest a national system of labour registration.

Other pamphlets followed: ''Lancashire Labour and the London Poor'' (1871), ''Impediments to the Circulation of Labour, with a Few Suggestions for their Removal'' (1873), ''The Unemployed in Great Cities, with Suggestions for the Better Organisation of Labourers'' (1877), and ''Vagrancy'' in 1881.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt;

Hill was also a supporter of the role of women in public life, supporting campaigns to elect prominent women such as Maria Grey and [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]] to the [[London School Board]] in 1870,&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Jane|title=Women and the Politics of Schooling in Victorian and Edwardian England|date=1999|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-0718500535|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognising the potential benefits of education on relieving poverty.

Hill was a pioneer of the system of [[labour exchange]]s in England, and in 1871 established in [[Greek Street]], [[Soho]], 'The Employment Inquiry Office and Labour Registry,' which was subsequently transferred to 15 Russell Street, [[Covent Garden]], as the 'Central Labour Exchange, Employment, Emigration, and Industrial Intelligence Office.'&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; There as director Hill advised applicants for assistance, and founded and edited ''Labour News'' to improve communication between masters and men seeking work. Hill had agents and correspondents in the chief industrial centres, who sent notes on the condition of the local labour markets (Hill's venture, which was not profitable, impaired his health; on his retirement a committee of working men managed the paper, and contributed from the profits to Hill's maintenance).&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; The publication, founded in 1871, survived to become ''Construction and Labour News'' (1963) and then, in April 1964, ''[[Construction News]]''.&lt;ref name=CNHistory&gt;{{cite news|title=History in the making|url=http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/history-in-the-making/949883.article|accessdate=20 February 2015|work=Construction News|date=5 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1877 onwards Hill also edited ''The Industrial Handbook'' and superintended the publication in 1881 of ''The Industrial Index to London,'' by H. Llewelyn Williams, as well as ''Business Aspects of Ladies' Work''.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; He also edited (1870–71) a series of penny ''Statutes for the People'', intended to give the labouring class cheap legal advice ([[legal aid]]). He was prominent, from its foundation in 1869, in the work of the [[Charity Organization Society|Charity Organisation Society]], as a 1914 history of the Society made clear:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Alsager Hay Hill joined the Society in its first year. He was one of its first Hon. Secretaries, and the life and soul of Council meetings in the early days of struggle. A man of rare natural wit, something of a poet, and the brightest of companions, he threw himself eagerly into the Society's work, and more particularly devoted his time and energy to an attempt to deal with the problems of unemployment. His 'Labour News' of thirty years ago anticipated the Labour Exchanges of today.&lt;ref&gt;Bosanquet, Helen (1914), ''Social work in London, 1869 to 1912: A History of the Charity Organisation Society''. New York, E P Button &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hill was honorary secretary of the council until July 1870, and remained an active member of the council until 1880.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt; Hill also supported the [[Working Men's Club and Institute Union]].

==Personal life==
A published writer of poetry and verse throughout his life, Hill was praised in ''[[The Spectator]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;For besides writing poetry, Mr. Alsager Hill is a well-known philanthropist, and [when] his experience and his sympathies meet, he produces some telling verses. Of these, "Lilies in the City," "Mrs. Grundy's Sunday," and "The Great God Gin," are good examples. ...

Among flowers and books also Mr. Hill can take his ease, and forgets, as his preface tells us, that there are newspapers to edit and philanthropy to organise.&lt;ref name=Spectator&gt;{{cite news|title=Current literature|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/16th-april-1881/22/current-literature|accessdate=21 February 2015|work=The Spectator|date=16 April 1881|ref=p.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hill suffered from ill health and poverty in his later years, living in retirement at [[Boston, Lincolnshire]]. He died there unmarried on 2 August 1906, and was buried at Gressenhall.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt;

'''Angelica Fraser''' (25 January, 1823 – 27 November, 1910) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] social reformer. She was active in arranging bible based education for tailors and "Tailor's Hall" was opened in London. In Edinburgh she founded a [[temperance society]] for tailors and another for working women.

==Life==
Fraser was born in [[Aberdeen]] in 1823. Her mother, Agnes, died when she was eleven and she took a strong interest in religion.  Her father, Alexander, was the [[Lord Provost]] of Aberdeen. Fraser became interested in the education and well-being of tailors.&lt;ref name=ody/&gt; In 1856 she first entered a tailor's workshop to educate them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19080513.2.23.8|title=Papers Past {{!}} &amp;quot;THE TAILORS' FRIEND.&amp;quot; THE IMPRESSIONIST DRESSER. (Dominion, 1908-05-13)|last=Zealand|first=National Library of New|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She arranged for volunteers to read from the Bible as the tailors worked. The idea caught on and similar groups of lady readers were established in Belfast, London and Liverpool to read to tailors as they worked. Fraser thought that the tailors would improve their own working conditions if they were better informed and educated and in 1875 they formed the "Edinburgh Tailors' Abstinence Union".&lt;ref name=ody&gt;Kelly, S. (2004-09-23). Fraser, Angelica Patience (1823–1910), social reformer. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 23 Dec. 2017, see [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-59507 link]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 she formed the "Scottish Ladies' Temperance Society". The society intended to open public houses where alcohol would not be served. They identified laundresses, cooks and similar jobs which made women prone to the temptation of drink. The society planned to make them total abstainers.&lt;ref name="MurrayStark2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Janet Horowitz Murray|author2=Myra Stark|title=The Englishwoman's Review of Social and Industrial Questions: 1875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcwBDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT211|date=27 January 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-315-41091-3|pages=211–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser moved to London in 1879 and the following year organised a conference on matters important to tailors. By 1885 monies had been raised to open an institute with a lecture hall and reading room. It was known as "Tailors' Hall". She became known as the tailors' "Florence Nightingale"&lt;ref name="ody" /&gt; or the "Tailor's Friend". In 1906, on the 50th anniversary of her first work with tailors she established an endowment fund to raise £5000 to ensure the continued work at Tailors' Hall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fraser remained a regular visitor to Tailor's Hall until she died at her home in [[London]] in November 1910.&lt;ref name=ody/&gt;

{{Anti-nuclear movement sidebar}}

The '''anti-nuclear movement in Germany''' has a long history dating back to the early 1970s when large demonstrations prevented the construction of a [[nuclear plant]] at [[Wyhl]]. The Wyhl protests were an example of a local community challenging the nuclear industry through a strategy of direct action and civil disobedience. Police were accused of using unnecessarily violent means. [[Anti-nuclear]] success at Wyhl inspired nuclear opposition throughout [[Germany]], in other parts of [[Europe]], and in [[North America]]. A few years later protests raised against the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]] in Germany and were followed by the foundation of the [[Green party]].

In 1986, large parts of Germany were covered with [[radioactive contamination]] from the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and Germans went to great lengths to deal with the contamination. Germany's anti-nuclear stance was strengthened. From the mid-1990s onwards, anti-nuclear protests were primarily directed against transports of [[High-level radioactive waste management|radioactive waste]] in [[dry cask storage|"CASTOR" containers]].

In September 2010, German government policy shifted back toward nuclear energy, and this generated some new anti-nuclear sentiment in Berlin and beyond. On 18 September 2010, tens of thousands of Germans surrounded Chancellor Angela Merkel's office. In October 2010, tens of thousands of people protested in Munich. In November 2010, there were violent protests against a train carrying reprocessed nuclear waste.

Within days of the March 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], large anti-nuclear protests occurred in Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel promptly "imposed a three-month moratorium on previously announced extensions for Germany's existing nuclear power plants, while shutting seven of the 17 reactors that had been operating since 1981". Protests continued and, on 29 May 2011, Merkel's government announced that it would close all of its nuclear power plants by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/14.abstract |title=The implications of Fukushima: The European perspective |author=Caroline Jorant |date=July 2011 |volume=67 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dw31511/&gt; Galvanised by the Fukushima nuclear disaster, first anniversary anti-nuclear demonstrations were held in Germany in March 2012. Organisers say more than 50,000 people in six regions took part.&lt;ref name="euronews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.com/2012/03/11/anti-nuclear-demos-across-europe-on-fukushima-anniversary/ |title=Anti-nuclear demos across Europe on Fukushima anniversary |author= |date=11 March 2011 |work=Euronews }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
German publications of the 1950s and 1960s contained criticism of some features of nuclear power including its safety. Nuclear waste disposal was widely recognized as a major problem, with concern publicly expressed as early as 1954. In 1964, one author went so far as to state "that the dangers and costs of the necessary final disposal of nuclear waste could possibly make it necessary to forego the development of nuclear energy".&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s there was a proposal to build a nuclear power station in West Berlin, but the project was dropped in 1962. Another attempt to site a reactor in a major city was made in 1967, when BASF planned to build a nuclear power station on its ground at Ludwigshafen, to supply process steam. Eventually the project was withdrawn by BASF.&lt;ref name=wolf/&gt;

The tiny hamlet of Wyhl, located just outside the [[Kaiserstuhl (Baden-Württemberg)|Kaiserstuhl]] wine-growing area in the southwestern corner of Germany, was first mentioned in 1971 as a possible site for a [[nuclear power]] station. In the years that followed, local opposition steadily mounted, but this had little impact on politicians and planners. Official permission for the plant was granted and earthworks began on 17 February 1975.&lt;ref name=nuc&gt;Walter C Patterson (1986). [http://www.waltpatterson.org/nppenguin.pdf Nuclear Power] Penguin Books, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 February, local people spontaneously occupied the site and police removed them forcibly two days later.  Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives through the mud helped to turn nuclear power into a major national issue.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The rough treatment was widely condemned and made the wine-growers, clergy, and others all the more determined. Some local police refused to take part in the action.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Falk]] (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent support came from the nearby university town of Freiburg.  On 23 February about 30,000 people re-occupied the Wyhl site and plans to remove them were abandoned by the state government in view of the large number involved and potential for more adverse publicity.  On 21 March 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant.&lt;ref name=pub&gt;Mills, Stephen and Williams, Roger (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=SeMNAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22public+acceptance+of+new+technologies%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=vy8odbFQ2E&amp;sig=EGRHYr9Uq8pRXxOlfH1tJYaOzrc&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result#PPA376,M1 Public Acceptance of New Technologies] Routledge, pp. 375-376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=got&gt;Gottlieb, Robert (2005).

''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, pp. 130-135.&lt;/ref&gt;  The plant was never built and the land eventually became a nature reserve.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

The Wyhl occupation generated extensive national debate.  This initially centred on the state government's handling of the affair and associated police behaviour, but interest in nuclear issues was also stimulated.  The Wyhl experience encouraged the formation of citizen action groups near other planned nuclear sites.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt;&lt;ref name=wrudig/&gt; Many other anti-nuclear groups formed elsewhere, in support of these local struggles, and some existing citizens' action groups widened their aims to include the nuclear issue.  This is how the German anti-nuclear movement evolved.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt;&lt;ref name=wrudig/&gt;  Anti-nuclear success at Wyhl also inspired nuclear opposition in the rest of Europe and North America.&lt;ref name=nuc/&gt;&lt;ref name=got/&gt;&lt;ref name=wrudig/&gt;

==Other protests==
[[File:ANTIAKW.jpg|thumb|right|120,000 people attended an anti-nuclear protest in [[Bonn]], Germany, on 14 October 1979, following the [[Three Mile Island accident]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Kitschelt.

]]
In 1976 and 1977, mass demonstrations took place at [[Kalkar]], the site of Germany's first [[fast breeder reactor]], and at [[Brokdorf]], north of Hamburg.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt; Some of these demonstrations, which always started peacefully, were organized by the [[World Union for Protection of Life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-40941633.html Report in the German magazine DER SPIEGEL 14/1977]&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances at Brokdorf were similar to those at Wyhl, in that the behaviour of the police was again crucial:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The authorities had rushed through the licensing process, and police occupied the site hours before the first construction license was granted, in order to prevent a repetition of Wyhl.  Demonstrators trying to enter the site a few days later got harsh treatment, and all this helped consolidate the population in opposition.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 1977 the [[Minister-President of Lower Saxony]], [[Ernst Albrecht (politician)|Ernst Albrecht]] of the Christian Democratic Union, announced that the salt mines in [[Gorleben]] would be utilised to store [[radioactive waste]]. New protests by the local population and opponents of nuclear power broke out and approximately 20,000 people attended the first large demonstration in Gorleben on 12 March 1977. Protests about Gorleben continued for several years&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/jun2001/grns-j26.shtml The German Greens and the nuclear industry]&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1979, the prime minister declared that plans for a nuclear waste plant in Gorleben were “impossible to enforce for political reasons".&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;Lutz Mez, [[Mycle Schneider]] and [[Stephen Thomas (professor)|Steve Thomas]] (Eds.) (2009). ''International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power'', Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 an Enquete Commission of the Bundestag proposed "a paradigmatic
change in energy policy away from nuclear power". This contributed to a broad shift in German public opinion, the formation of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]], and its election to the [[German Bundestag]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=MST/&gt;

In the early 1980s plans to build a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in the Bavarian town of [[Nuclear reprocessing plant Wackersdorf|Wackersdorf]] lead to major protests. In 1986, West German police were confronted by demonstrators armed with slingshots, crowbars and [[Molotov cocktail]]s at the site of a nuclear reprocessing plant in [[Wackersdorf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961509-2,00.html Energy and Now, the Political Fallout], ''Time'', June 2, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/09/world/around-the-world-germans-arrest-300-in-antinuclear-protests.html Germans Arrest 300 In Antinuclear Protests]&lt;/ref&gt; The plans for the plant were abandoned in 1988. It still isn't clear whether protests or plant economics led to the decision.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear demonstration took place to protest against the construction of the [[Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant]] on the North Sea coast west of Hamburg. Some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. Twenty-one policemen were injured by demonstrators armed with gasoline bombs, sticks, stones and high-powered slingshots.&lt;ref name="chron"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F16FA3F5D0C728CDDAA0894D9484D81 West Germans Clash at Site of A-Plant] ''New York Times'', March 1, 1981 p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/01/world/violence-mars-west-german-nuclear-protest-demonstrators-brokdorf-near-hamburg.html Violence Mars West German Protest] ''New York Times'', March 1, 1981 p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The plant began operations in October 1986 and is scheduled to close in 2018.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

==Chernobyl disaster==
The [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986 was a pivotal event for Germany's anti-nuclear movement. After the radioactive fallout cloud covered large parts of the country, Germans went to great lengths to deal with the contamination.  Contaminated crops were destroyed, firemen dressed in protective gear cleaned cars as they crossed the border from other countries, and sand in playground sandboxes was replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Hanneke Brooymans. France, Germany: A tale of two nuclear nations, ''The Edmonton Journal'', May 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Chernobyl, the Green Party strived "for the immediate shut-down of all nuclear facilities". The SPD pushed for a nuclear phase-out within ten years. Länder governments, municipalities, parties and trade unions explored the question of "whether the use of nuclear power technology was reasonable and sensible for the future".&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;

In May 1986 clashes between anti-nuclear protesters and West German police became common. More than 400 people were injured in mid-May at the site of a nuclear-waste reprocessing plant being built near Wackersdorf. Police "used water cannons and dropped tear-gas grenades from helicopters to subdue protesters armed with slingshots, crowbars and Molotov cocktails".&lt;ref&gt;John Greenwald. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961509-2,00.html#ixzz0ceyKaRdI Energy and Now, the Political Fallout], ''TIME'', June 2, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==More recent developments==
[[File:Gorleben0001.JPG|thumb|Riots at anti-nuclear demonstrations near Gorleben, Lower Saxony, Germany, 8 May 1996.]]

Several advanced reactor designs in Germany were unsuccessful. Two [[fast breeder reactor]]s were built, but both were closed in 1991 without the
larger ever having achieved criticality. The High Temperature Reactor [[THTR-300]] at Hamm-Uentrop, under construction since 1970, was started in 1983, but was shut down in September 1989.&lt;ref name=MST&gt;Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). ''International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power'', Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-nuclear protests were also a driving force of the green movement in Germany, from which the party The Greens evolved. When they first came to power in the [[Gerhard Schröder|Schröder administration]] of 1998 they achieved their major political goal for which they had fought for 20 years: [[Nuclear power in Germany#Phase-out|abandoning nuclear energy in Germany]].

From the mid-1990s onwards, anti-nuclear protests were primarily directed against transports of [[High-level radioactive waste management|radioactive waste]] called "castor" containers. In 1996 there were sit-ins against the second castor consignment bringing nuclear waste from La Hague in France to Gorleben. In 1997 the third castor transport reached Gorleben despite the efforts of several thousand protesters.&lt;ref name=so/&gt;

In 2002, the "Act on the structured phase-out of the utilization of nuclear energy for the commercial generation of electricity" took effect, following a drawn-out political debate and lengthy negotiations with nuclear power plant operators. The act legislated for the shut-down of all German nuclear plants by 2021. The [[Stade Nuclear Power Plant]] was the first one to go offline in November 2003, followed by the [[Obrigheim Nuclear Power Plant]] in 2005. Block-A of the [[Biblis Nuclear Power Plant]] is still provisionally scheduled to be shut down in 2008.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UIC. [http://www.uic.com.au/nip46.htm Nuclear power in Germany].&lt;/ref&gt; Block-B is going back online after a year-long shutdown on 13 or 14 December 2007{{When|date=December 2017}}{{Update inline|date=December 2017}} and is scheduled to keep operating until 2009 or 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUSL3087639620071130 UPDATE 1-Germany's RWE says Biblis B reactor is restarting].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, amid concerns that Russian energy supplies to western Europe may not be reliable, conservative politicians, including Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and Economics Minister [[Michael Glos]], continued to question the decision to phase out nuclear power in Germany.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt; [[World Information Service on Energy|WISE]] along with other anti-nuclear movement groups contend that the climate problem can only be solved by the use of [[renewable energy commercialization|renewable forms of energy]] along with [[Efficient energy use|efficient and economical energy technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facts-on-nuclear-energy.info/6_climate_race.php?size=s&amp;l=en&amp;f= Nuclear Power Cannot Save the Climate]&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2008, a cover of the German magazine [[Der Spiegel]] read ''Atomkraft - Das unheimliche Comeback ''(Nuclear Power - Its eerie comeback). As a consequence the Germans anti-nuclear organisation ''[[:de:.ausgestrahlt|.ausgestrahlt]]'' decided to coordinate the various anti-nuclear movements on their website leading to a more powerful protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ausgestrahlt.de/ueber-uns.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316215557/http://www.ausgestrahlt.de/ueber-uns.html |archivedate=2011-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-nuclear Monday evening walks become popular in various German cities.

In November 2008, a shipment of radioactive waste from German nuclear plants arrived at a storage site near Gorleben after being delayed by large protests from nuclear activists. More than 15,000 people took part in the protests which involved blocking trucks with sit-down demonstrations and blocking the route with tractors. The demonstrations were partly a response to conservative calls for a rethink of the planned phaseout of nuclear power stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,589782,00.html Nuclear Waste Reaches German Storage Site Amid Fierce Protests]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.theage.com.au/world/police-break-up-german-nuclear-protest-20081111-5lw7.html Police break up German nuclear protest]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,589456,00.html The Renaissance of the Anti-Nuclear Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, activists blocked the entrance to controversial [[Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant]] with an 8-metre wall. Their protest coincided with the annual meeting of the company that runs the plant, [[EnBW Energie Baden-Württemberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.de/national/20090423-18823.html Protestors block nuclear power plant entrance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in April 2009 about 1,000 people demonstrated against nuclear power generation in the north-western city of Münster. Located southwest of Hamburg, Münster is surrounded by a nuclear waste dump at Ahaus, Germany's only uranium enrichment plant at Gronau and another such plant at Almelo in neighbouring Holland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydney.indymedia.org.au/story/1-000-demonstrated-against-nuclear-power-german-student-town 1,000 demonstrated against nuclear power in German student town] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429232230/http://sydney.indymedia.org.au/story/1-000-demonstrated-against-nuclear-power-german-student-town |date=April 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 2010, about 120,000 people built a human chain (''KETTENreAKTION!'') between the nuclear plants [[Krümmel Nuclear Power Plant|Krümmel]] and [[Brunsbüttel Nuclear Power Plant|Brunsbüttel]]. This way they were demonstrating against the plans of the German government to extend the period of producing nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE63N13Q20100424|title=German nuclear protesters form 75-mile human chain|work=Reuters|date=2010-04-25|accessdate=2010-04-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100427092449/http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE63N13Q20100424| archivedate= 27 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations were also held in other German cities "where public opinion is mainly opposed to nuclear energy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/germans-form-chain-in-nuclear-protest-20100425-tktv.html Germans form chain in nuclear protest] ''Sydney Morning Herald'', April 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, German government policy shifted back toward nuclear energy, and this generated some new anti-nuclear sentiment in Berlin and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;James Norman and Dave Sweeney. [http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/germanys-hot-autumn-of-nuclear-discontent-20100914-15aag.html  Germany's 'hot autumn' of nuclear discontent] ''Sydney Morning Herald'', September 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2010, tens of thousands of Germans surrounded Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]’s office in an anti-nuclear demonstration that organisers said was the biggest of its kind since the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Graham.

Protesters called for a move away from nuclear power towards [[renewable energy]]. The action was the biggest anti-nuclear event in [[Bavaria]] for more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,6097663,00.html Tens of thousands take part in Munich anti-nuclear protest] ''Deutsche Welle'', 9 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, police wielding batons clashed with protesters who disrupted the passage of a train carrying reprocessed nuclear waste from France to Germany. The train carrying the nuclear waste was heading for Dannenberg where the 123 tonnes of waste was loaded onto trucks and taken to the nearby storage facility of Gorleben, in central Germany. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Dannenberg to signal their opposition to the cargo. Organisers said 50,000 people had turned out but police said the figure was closer to 20,000. Around 16,000 police were mobilised to deal with the protests.&lt;ref&gt;Rachael Brown.

In March 2011, more than 200,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in four large German cities, on the eve of state elections. Organisers called it the biggest anti-nuclear demonstration the country has seen, with police estimating that 100,000 people turned out in Berlin alone. Hamburg, Munich and Cologne also saw big demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/03/26/germany-nuclear-idUKLDE72P0FG20110326 |title=Anti-nuclear Germans protest on eve of state vote |date=March 26, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' reported that "most Germans have a deep-seated aversion to nuclear power, and the damage at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan has galvanized opposition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/world/europe/28germany.html?_r=1  |title=Merkel Loses Key German State on Nuclear Fears |author=Judy Dempsey |date=March 27, 2011  |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Germans demanding an end to the use of nuclear power took part in nationwide demonstrations on 2 April 2011.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition announced on 30 May 2011, that Germany’s 17 nuclear power stations will be shut down by 2022, in a policy reversal following Japan's [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]]. Seven of the German power stations were closed temporarily in March, and they will remain off-line and be permanently decommissioned. An eighth was already off line, and will stay so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/30/us-germany-nuclear-idUKTRE74Q2P120110530 |title=German government wants nuclear exit by 2022 at latest |author=Annika Breidthardt |date=May 30, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2011 and 2014 Germany burned more coal, an additional 9.5 million tonnes of oil equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/Energy-economics/statistical-review-2015/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2015-coal-section.pdf pg5&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters delayed a train carrying radioactive waste from France to Germany. Many clashes and obstructions made the journey the slowest one since the annual shipments of radioactive waste began in 1995. The shipment, the first since Japan's Fukishima nuclear disaster, faced large protests in France where activists damaged the train tracks.&lt;ref name=spieg11/&gt; Thousands of people in Germany also interrupted the train's journey, forcing it to proceed at a snail's pace, covering 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) in 109 hours.

'''Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin''' (8 February 1796{{snd}}1 September 1864) was a [[France|French]] [[Reform movement|social reformer]], one of the founders of [[Saint-Simonianism]]. He was also a proponent of a [[Suez canal]].

== Early life ==
Enfantin was born in [[Paris]], the son of a banker of [[Dauphiné]]. After receiving his early education at a [[lyceum]], he was sent in 1813 to the [[École polytechnique]]. In March 1814 he was one of the band of students who, on the heights of [[Montmartre]] and [[Saint-Chaumont]], attempted resistance to the armies of the [[Sixth Coalition]] which had engaged in the invasion of Paris. In consequence of this outbreak of [[Patriotism|patriotic]] enthusiasm, the school was soon after closed by [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], and the young student was compelled to seek another career.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

Initially, he began working for a country wine merchant, travelling to [[German Confederation|Germany]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. In 1821 he entered a banking-house newly established at [[Saint Petersburg]], but returned two years later to Paris, where he was appointed [[cashier]] to the ''[[Caisse Hypothécaire]]''. At the same time, he became a member of the [[secret society]] of the ''[[Carbonari]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

In 1825 a new turn was given to his thoughts and his life by the friendship which he formed with [[Olinde Rodriguez]], who introduced him to the [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Comte de Saint-Simon]]. He affiliated to Saint-Simon's version of [[utopian socialism]], and, by 1829, he had become one of the acknowledged heads of the [[Sectarianism|sect]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

== Preaching and politics ==
After the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 Enfantin resigned his office of cashier, and devoted all his energy to the cause. Besides contributing to ''[[Le Globe]]'', he made appeals to the people by systematic [[Sermon|preaching]], and organized centres of action in some of the main cities of France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

The headquarters in Paris were moved from the modest rooms in the Rue Taranne to the large halls near the [[Boulevard des Italiens]]. Enfantin and [[Amand Bazard]] were proclaimed ''Pères Suprêmes'' ("Supreme Fathers") – a union which was, however, only nominal, as a divergence was already manifest. Bazard, who concentrated on organizing the group, had devoted himself to political reform, while Enfantin, who favoured teaching and preaching, dedicated his time to social and moral change. The antagonism was widened by Enfantin's announcement of his theory of the relation of man and woman, which would substitute a system of "[[free love]]" for the "tyranny of [[marriage]]".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

Bazard and his disciples broke with Enfantin's group. The latter became sole "father", leading a chiefly religiously-oriented movement, joined by new converts (according to Enfantin's estimate, the total number of followers would have reached 40,000). He wore on his breast a badge with his title of ''Père'', was referred to by his preachers as "the living law", declared himself to be the [[Messiah|chosen of God]], and sent out emissaries in a quest of a woman predestined to be the "female Messiah," and the mother of a new [[Salvation|Saviour]] (the latter quest was very costly and altogether fruitless).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

== Success and repression ==
Meanwhile, the new religion gathered believers in all parts of [[Europe]]. His extravagances and success at length brought him to the attention of authorities, who argued that he was endangering [[public morality]] - Enfantin had announced that the gulf between the sexes was too wide and this social inequality would impede rapid growth of society. Enfantin called for the abolition of prostitution and for the ability for women to divorce and obtain legal rights. This was considered radical for the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=29|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1832 the halls of the new sect were closed by the government, and the ''Père'', with some of his followers, appeared before the tribunals. He then retired to his estate at [[Menilmontant]], near Paris, where with forty disciples, all of them men, he continued to carry out his socialist views. In August of the same year he was again arrested, and on his appearance in court he desired his defence to be undertaken by two women who were with him, alleging that the matter was of special concern to women; the request was promptly refused. The trial occupied two days and resulted in a verdict of guilty, and a sentence of imprisonment for a year with a small fine.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}

This prosecution discredited the new society. Enfantin was released in a few months.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=402}} 

==Turkey and Egypt==
Then, accompanied by twenty of his followers, many of whom were also engineers from the [[Ecole Polytechnique]], including [[:fr:Charles Joseph Lambert|Charles Joseph Lambert]], also known as Lambert-Bey, and some women, he went first to [[Constantinople]]. Enfantin had declared 1933 the Year of the Mother, and upon arrival in Constantinople the group began to strongly preach their views about gender relations and New Christianity. The [[Ottoman Empire]] told them to leave to avoid prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=31|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enfantin and his group then arrived in [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali and his successors|Egypt]], where he planned to penetrate the feminine [[Orient]] with the masculine [[Occident]] in a consumation of progression - build a canal connecting the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the [[Red Sea]]. In Egypt at that time, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], the Egyptian Viceroy, was at odds with the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople, and also practiced public-private contracts known as concessions with mostly European companies to build cheap infrastructure. Ali did not agree to a project linking the two seas because he did not want to cut out the duties he collected from overland trade in Egypt, but did allow Enfantin's group to work on the [[Delta Barrage]] - a type of [[Barrage (dam)|dam]] - north of [[Cairo]] - with unpaid laborers - that would act to limit Nile flooding and create predictable crop yields. During his time in Egypt, Enfantine also established technical schools based on the Ecole Polytechnique model with Ali's blessing. Also in Egypt he encountered and influenced [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]. Enfantine returned to France in 1836, lacking the patience to finish the Nile barrage project that was encountering delays.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|pp=31-37|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to France ==
[[File:Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin.jpg|thumb|left]]
On his return to France, he occupied minor offices. He became first a [[postmaster]] near [[Lyon]], and in 1841 was appointed, through the influence of some of his friends who had risen to posts of power, member of a scientific commission on [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], which led him to engage in researches concerning [[North Africa]] and [[French colonial empires|colonization]] in general.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=402-403}}

In 1845 he was appointed a director of the Paris &amp; Lyons [[Rail transport|railway]]. Three years later he established, in conjunction with Duveyrier, a daily journal, entitled ''Le Credit'', which was discontinued in 1850. He was afterwards attached to the administration of the railway from Lyons to the Mediterranean. 

==Société d'Études du Canal de Suez==
Father Enfantin held fast by his ideal to the end, but he had renounced the hope of giving it a local habitation and a name in the degenerate obstinate world. His personal influence over those who associated with him was immense. "He was a man of a noble presence, with finely formed and expressive features. He was gentle and insinuating in manner, and possessed a calm, graceful and winning delivery" (''Gent. M .'' Jan. 1865). His evident sincerity, his genuine enthusiasm, gave him his marvellous ascendancy. The [[Société d'Études du Canal de Suez]] was established by Enfantin in 1846 to continue study of the Suez Canal. Its members included [[François Barthélemy Arlès-Dufour|Arlès-Dufour]], Jules, Lon and [[Paulin Talabot]], the British [[Robert Stephenson]] and Edward Starbuck, the Austrian [[Alois Negrelli]], inspector of the [[Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway]], and Feronce and Sellier of Leipzig as representatives of the German interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/suezcanal032262mbp Wilson, Arnold T. (1939). ''The Suez Canal''. 2nd ed., London: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Société sent surveying teams to Egypt, developed engineering plans, determined that the elevation difference between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea was negligible, but Muhammad Ali was still reticent to the idea of a canal. Upon his death in 1848, the activities of the Société were minimized until his successor was assassinated in 1854 and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] took up the initiative to build a canal. Lessups had corresponded at least once with the Société in the intervening years and had known the new Egyptian viceroy, [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id]], when he was a young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pp=58-61,65,70-71,76|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enfantin was listed by Lessups as a founder of the [[Suez Canal Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|date=2003|pp=81-82|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not a few of his disciples ranked afterwards amongst the most distinguished men of France. Enfantin died suddenly at Paris on September 1, 1864.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=403}}

== Literary works ==
Amongst his works are: ''Doctrine de Saint-Simon'' (written in conjunction with several of his followers), published in 1830, and several times republished; ''Economie politique et politique Saint-Simonienne'' (1831); ''{{lang|fr|Correspondance politique}}'' (1835–1840); ''Corresp. philos. et religieuse'' (1843–1845); and ''La Vie eternelle passee, presente, future'' (1861). A large number of articles by his hand appeared in ''Le Producteur'', ''L'Organisateur'', ''[[Le Globe]]'', and other periodicals. He also wrote in 1832 ''Le Livre nouveau'', intended as a substitute for the Christian Scriptures, but it was not published.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=403}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14542">'''Behavioral Communication''' is defined as a [[construct (philosophy)|psychological construct]] which influences individual differences in the expression of [[Emotion|feelings]], needs, and thoughts as a substitute for more direct and open [[communication]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ivanov, M. (n.d.). Behavioral Communication Debrief. Retrieved July 1, 2015, from http://psyresearch.org/behavioralcommunication/&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it refers to people's tendency to express feelings, needs, and thoughts by means of indirect messages and behavioral impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886910001017 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.02.033 | volume=49 | title=Behavioral communication: Individual differences in communication style | journal=Personality and Individual Differences | pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be argued that much of our communication is, in fact, non-verbal.

Any behavior (or its absence when one is expected) may be judged as communicative if it has the intent to convey a message. For example, an expressive hairstyle, a show of a certain emotion, or simply doing (or not doing) the dishes all can be means by which people may convey messages to each other.

The construct of behavioral communication is conceived as a variable of [[Individual differences]]. This means that some people more than others tend to engage in indirect or behavioral communication, whether consciously doing so, unconsciously doing so, in spite of the different alternatives of using [[Linguistics|verbal communication]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; An individual's behavioral style greatly effects their verbal and nonverbal communication. It is rare that someone utilizes all one behavioral communication style, all of the time.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Sherman, R. (n.d.). Understanding Your Communication Style. Retrieved July 1, 2015, from http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/sba/comm_style.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to identify one's own behavioral style requires a high level of self-awareness.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Different types of communication behavior ==
There are four different types of communication behavior: [[Aggression|aggressive]], [[Assertiveness|assertive]], [[Passivity (behavior)|passive]], and [[passive-aggressive]].

===Aggressive===

Aggression is defined as an unplanned act of anger in which the aggressor intends to hurt someone or something.&lt;ref&gt;Whitson, S. (2014, June 1). Passive Aggressive vs. Assertive Behavior in Relationships. Retrieved from https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/passive-aggressive-diaries/201406/passive-aggressive-vs-assertive-behavior-in-relationships&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressive communicators typically create avoidable conflict by engaging in [[personal attacks]] and put-downs.&lt;ref&gt;Adubato, S. (2014). Assertive versus aggressive communication. Retrieved from http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2014/01/assertive_versus_aggressive_communication.html&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressive communicators create a win-lose situation and use intimidation to get their own needs met, often at the expense of others.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Hennessy, K. (n.d.). Assertive Communication. Retrieved July 1, 2015, from http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/pub/feap/work-life/newsletters/assertive-communication.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressive communicators typically feel a strong sense of [[Inferiority complex|inadequacy]], have a lack of [[empathy]], and believe the only way to get their needs met is through power and control.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Aggressive communicators are usually [[ignorant|close-minded]], are poor listeners, and tend to monopolize others.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Behaviors often seen during aggressive communication include: putting others down, overpowering others, not showing appreciation, rushing others unnecessarily, ignoring others, not considering other’s feelings, intimidating others, and speaking in a condescending manner.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;SkillsYouNeed.com. (2015). Assertiveness - An Introduction. Retrieved from http://www.skillsyouneed.com/ps/assertiveness.html&lt;/ref&gt; Nonverbal behaviors exhibited during aggressive communication include: frowning, critical glares, rigid posture, trying to stand over others, using a loud voice and fast speech.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

While engaging in this type of communications, individuals typically feel [[anger]], [[superiority complex|superiority]], [[frustration]], and impatience.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Aggressive communication often results in counter aggression, alienation, and the creation of resistance or defiance.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Additionally, individuals on the receiving end of aggressive communication typically feel: resentful, defensive, humiliated, hurt, and or afraid.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Newton, C. (n.d.). The Five Communication Styles. Retrieved July 1, 2015, from http://www.clairenewton.co.za/my-articles/the-five-communication-styles.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There are times when aggressive communication is pertinent, however. The aggressive communication style is essential during emergencies or when decisions have to be quickly made.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Assertive===

[[Assertiveness]] is described as the ability to appropriately expresses one’s own wants and feelings.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Assertive communication is thought to be the halfway point between passive communication and aggressive communication.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Assertive communication is based on the belief that each individual is responsible for his or her own problems; therefore they are responsible for directly communicating these problems to the other party involved.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Assertive communication is a direct form of communication that respects both the communicator’s and the receiver’s rights and opinions.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Assertive communication is direct without being argumentative.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Engaging in assertive communication helps individuals avoid conflict, maintain relationships, and usually ends in a win-win situation.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;ReachOut.Com. (2013, October 8). Communication styles. Retrieved from http://ie.reachout.com/help-a-friend/communication/communication-styles/&lt;/ref&gt; Assertive communication is the communication style that is least utilized, however.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Individuals who engage in assertive communication are open to hearing the opinions of others, without criticizing their opinions, and feel comfortable enough to express their own opinions as well.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Assertive communicators generally have high self-esteem, as they have the confidence to effectively communicate with others without getting offended or being manipulative.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; 
While engaging in conversation, assertive communicators will state limits and expectations, state observations without judgment, be an active listener, and check on others feelings.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Essential problem solving skills that assertive communicators acquire include negotiations, confronting problems as soon as they arise, and not letting negative feelings build up.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Behaviors that may be present when an individual is engaging in assertive communication include: being open when expressing their thoughts and feelings, encouraging others to openly express their own opinions and feelings, listening to other’s opinions and appropriately responding to them, accepting responsibilities, being action-orientated, being able to admit mistakes, setting realistic goal, maintaining self-control, and acting as an equal to those whom are on the receiving end of the communication,.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

There are many nonverbal behaviors that represent assertive communication as well. Individuals engaging in assertive communication convey an open and receptive body language, with upright posture and movements that are relaxed.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Assertive communicators have a clear tone of voice and make appropriate eye contact.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
Assertive communicators typically feel more confident and self-respecting while engaging in this type of communication.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; People on the receiving end of assertive communication typically feel as though they can believe the communicator, know where they stand with the communicator, and possess a sense of respect for the communicator.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Assertive communication has positive effects on both the communicator and the receiver. Some positive effects include: the communicator feels connected to others, the communicator feels in control of their lives, the communicator is able to mature because they address and solve issues as they come up, and creating a respectful environment for others.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Benedict, C. (n.d.). Assertiveness and the Four Styles of Communication. Retrieved July 1, 2015, from http://serenityonlinetherapy.com/assertiveness.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Passive ===

Passive communication involves not expressing one’s own thoughts or feelings and putting their needs last in an attempt to keep others happy.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Passive communicators will internalize their discomfort in order to avoid conflict and to be liked by others.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This communication style is typically exhibited when individuals feel as if their needs do not matter and that if they voice their concerns they will be rejected.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Individuals who exhibit a predominately passive communication style usually have low self-esteem and may not be able to effectively recognize their own needs.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; They tend to trust others but they do not trust themselves.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

There are many behavioral characteristics identified with this communication style. These behavioral characteristics include, but are not limited to: actively avoiding confrontation, difficulty taking responsibilities or making decisions, agreeing with someone else’s preferences, refusing compliments, sighing a lot, asking permission unnecessarily, and blaming others.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; There are also many non-verbal behaviors that reflect passive communication. Typically, individuals engaging in a passive communication style have a soft voice, speak hesitantly, and make themselves very small.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; They also tend to fidget and avoid eye contact.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Passive communicators elicit numerous feelings in themselves as well as in others. They typically possess feelings of anxiety, depression, resentfulness, feelings of powerlessness, and confusion.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; They feel anxious because their life seems to be out of their control and they acquire depressive feelings from a perceived sense of hopelessness.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; Passive communicators may become resentful because they feel as if their own needs are not being met and may become confused because they cannot identify their own feelings.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; People on the receiving end of passive communication typically feel frustrated, guilty, and may discount the passive communicator for not knowing what they want.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; While engaging in this type of communication, passive individuals typically feel anxious during the conversation and hurt or angry later.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Passive communicators tend to build dependency relationships, often do not know where they stand in situations, and will over-promote others, all resulting in depletion of their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Passive communicators do not regularly respond to hurtful situations, but instead let their discomfort build until they have an explosive outburst.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; This outburst causes shame and confusion, leading the individual back into a passive communication style.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

There are, however, numerous instances in which passive communication is necessary. A few situations may include: when an issue is minor, when the problems caused by the conflict are worse than the actual conflict, and when emotions are running high.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Passive-Aggressive===

[[Passive-aggressive behavior|The Passive-Aggressive]] style incorporates aspects of both passive and aggressive communication styles. Individuals utilizing this style appear passive, but act out their anger in indirect ways.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; People who develop this style of communication usually feel powerless, resentful, and or stuck.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; A passive-aggressive individual exposes their anger through means of procrastination, being exaggeratedly forgetful, and or being intentionally inefficient, among other things.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

There are many behavioral characteristics that are identified with this communication style. These behavioral characteristics include, but are not limited to: sarcasm, being unreliable, frequent complaining, sulking, patronizing, and gossiping.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Non-verbal behaviors, such as posture or facial expression, can also reflect passive-aggressive communication.

Typically, individuals engaging in passive-aggressive communication have asymmetrical posture and display jerky or quick gestures.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; They may also have an innocent facial expression and act excessively friendly to conceal their anger or frustration.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; 
People on the receiving end of passive-aggressive communication are usually left confused, angry, and hurt.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; They tend to be alienated from others because they elicit these unpleasant feelings.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; A passive-aggressive communication style does not address and properly deal with the pertinent issues or problems. This maladaptive problem-solving style keeps passive-aggressive communicators in a state of powerlessness, resulting in continued passive-aggression.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

Examples of Passive-Aggressive Language/Behavior include: wistful statements, backhanded compliments, purposefully ignoring or saying nothing, leaving someone out, sabotaging someone, and muttering to oneself instead of confronting the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, N. (2015, April 14). Don’t fool yourself: Seven signs that you’re being passive-aggressive&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breast binding''' is the act of flattening [[breast]]s by the use of constrictive materials. The term also refers to the material used in this act. Common binding materials include cloth strips, elastic or non-elastic [[bandage]]s, purpose-built [[undergarment]]s (often using [[Spandex]] or other [[synthetic fibre]]) and shirts layered from tight to loose. The act of breast binding is common for [[trans men]], but is also done by [[androgynous]], [[Genderqueer|genderqueer and gender fluid]] people, as well as [[crossdressers]], [[cosplay]]ers, and performers. In a general sense; women may also use binders as alternatives to bras or as a practice of propriety.&lt;ref&gt;Countryman, Betty Ann. "Breast care in the early puerperium." Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, &amp; Neonatal Nursing 2.5 (1973): 36-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast binding by use of cloth strip or tape may result in bodily damage such as permanent deformation of the breast.

==Motivation==
There are many reasons people would bind their breasts:

* For accelerated recovery by reducing movement after an injury or surgery.
* For [[cosplay]], [[crossplay]], and other forms of [[costume|costuming]].
* For concealment of [[breast]]s or [[Breast#Development|breast development]].
* For [[beauty]] and [[aesthetics]].
* For less-feminine appearance.
* For suppression of [[gender dysphoria]] (among many gender identities, especially trans men).
* For athletics.
* [[Lactation suppression]].&lt;ref name="Swift2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swift|first=Kathy|author2=Janke, Jill|date=May 2003|title=Breast Binding . . . Is It All That It's Wrapped Up To Be?|journal=[[Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, &amp; Neonatal Nursing|J. Obstet. Gynecol. Neonatal Nurs.]]|volume=32|issue=3|pages=332–339|issn=0884-2175|doi=10.1177/0884217503253531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[adolescence|adolescent]] girls bind their breasts as they [[thelarche|enter]] [[puberty]]. This is done usually for reasons of modesty (they do not want others to see them), embarrassment (they do not want others to know they have started developing), or desire to be as they previously were (they do not want to have breasts yet).  This has potential risks, as the developing tissue may conform to the restricted shape, resulting in permanent deformity.  Breast binding in adolescent girls may be a symptom of [[body dysmorphic disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horowitz K, Gorfinkle K, Lewis O, Phillips KA |title=Body dysmorphic disorder in an adolescent girl |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry]] |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=1503–9 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12447038 |pmc=1613829 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0890-8567&amp;volume=41&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=1503 |doi=10.1097/00004583-200212000-00023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cis men may also find cause to bind if afflicted with [[gynecomastia]] as a means to control appearance in place of surgery or during the wait before surgery. [[Transgender men]], or people with non-binary gender identities, as well as women who have developed larger breasts from hormone replacement therapy or breast augmentation surgery, may have motivation to bind their breasts. Transgender men and people with other gender identities (typically male presenting) may bind their breasts as an alternative to or while waiting for a "top surgery" ([[mastectomy]]) in order to be recognized as masculine presenting.

Another way of binding is using a specially fitted binding bra, however these can be more expensive and are not widely stocked. There are places to buy binders, and they are a much better alternative to other, more dangerous methods.

Some people try to bind using an ace bandage or duct tape, however these methods are dangerous and may cause cracked ribs, trouble breathing, and even suffocation if worn to sleep. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

However, excessive use of all binding methods can lead to back pain and breathing trouble. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} A binding device/method should always be as loose as is practical and should not be worn for longer than 8 hours.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Complications==
Binding for extended periods of time can lead to [[rash]]es or [[yeast infections]] under the breasts.&lt;ref name="Feldman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/trans?page=protocol-exam|title=Transgender primary medical care: Suggested guidelines for clinicians in British Columbia|last=Feldman|first=JL|author2=Goldberg, J |year=2006|publisher=Vancouver Coastal Health|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Erickson-Schroth2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Erickson-Schroth|first=Laura|title=Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuB_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199325351|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsafe binding may lead to permanent deformation of the breasts,&lt;ref name="umich binding faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/transgender/Binding%20FAQ.pdf|title=Binding FAQ|publisher=University of Michigan Health System|archivedate=6 September 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906033102/http://www.med.umich.edu/transgender/Binding%20FAQ.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; scarring, and lung constriction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutton|first=Lauren|last2=Koenig|first2=Karel|last3=Fennie|first3=Kristopher|date=2008-08-01|title=Gynecologic care of the female-to-male transgender man|journal=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health|volume=53|issue=4|pages=331–337|doi=10.1016/j.jmwh.2008.02.003|issn=1542-2011|pmid=18586186|pmc=4902153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and long-term binding may adversely affect the outcome of a future [[mastectomy]].&lt;ref name="MakadonMayer2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makadon|first1=Harvey J.|last2=Mayer|first2=Kenneth H.|last3=Potter|first3=Jennifer|last4=Goldhammer|first4=Hilary|title=The Fenway Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFUkQG_hfMYC&amp;pg=PT409|year=2015|publisher=ACP Press|isbn=9781934465783|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Breastbinding has been used in many historical contexts. Wearing a [[corset]] was one way that the size of breasts could be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural encyclopedia of the breast|last=Smith|first=Merril|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2014|isbn=9780759123311|location=Lanham|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different time periods of history have had differing viewpoints on the [[female form]], including widespread use of [[corset]]s throughout western [[European history]] up to the [[Victorian era]].  The [[Japan]]ese [[kimono]] can be considered a very elaborate form of binding, although the ''[[obi (sash)|obi]]'' (belt) goes around the lower torso, the chest is bound by the [[sarashi]]. In the 1920s, [[flapper]]s bound their chests to achieve a less traditional look.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uplift: The bra in America.|last=Farrell-Beck &amp; Gau|first=J. &amp; C.|publisher=Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many Catholic nuns up until the 1930s were required to wear a linen breast binding under their garments in addition to their everyday vestments. This measure was designed to eliminate any potential distraction that the nuns' breasts might cause. In many ecclesiastical specialty shops, it is still possible to purchase antique linen breast bindings that have been hand-embroidered with crosses.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Wearing a minimizer bra is common to help with large breasts.

'''Charles Eliot Norton''' (November 16, 1827 – October 21, 1908) was an [[United States|American]] author, social critic, and professor of art. He was a progressive social reformer and a liberal activist whom many of his contemporaries considered the most cultivated man in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{see also|Eliot family}}
Norton was born at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  His father, [[Andrews Norton]] (1786–1853), was a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theologian, and Dexter professor of sacred literature at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]; his mother was Catherine Eliot, a daughter of the merchant [[Samuel Eliot (banker)|Samuel Eliot]]. [[Charles William Eliot]], president of Harvard, was his cousin. Norton graduated from Harvard in 1846, where he was a member of the [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals|Hasty Pudding]], and started in business with an East Indian trading firm in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], travelling to [[India]] in 1849. After a tour in [[Europe]], where he was influenced by John Ruskin and pre-Raphaelite painters, he returned to Boston in 1851, and devoted himself to literature and art. He translated [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''Vita Nuova'' (1860 and 1867) and the ''[[Divina Commedia]]'' (1891-91-92, 3 vols, 1902 being the publication year of Norton's thorough final edit). He worked tirelessly as secretary to the [[Loyal Publication Society]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], communicating with newspaper editors across the country, including the journalist [[Jonathan Baxter Harrison]] who became a lifelong friend.&lt;ref&gt;Turner (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; From 1864 to 1868, he edited the highly influential magazine ''[[North American Review]]'', in association with [[James Russell Lowell]]. In 1861 he and Lowell helped [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] in his translation of Dante and in the starting of the informal Dante Club.

==Marriage and family life==
In 1862 Norton married Susan Ridley Sedgwick (21 February 1838 – 17 February 1872), daughter of [[Theodore Sedgwick (writer)|Theodore Sedgwick III]] and Sara Morgan Ashburner.  They were the parents of six children: Eliot (1863), Sarah (1864), Elizabeth (1866), Rupert (1867), Margaret (1870) and Richard (1872).  Susan died at age thirty-three in Dresden, Germany, following the birth of their sixth child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sedgwick.org/na/library/books/sed1961/sed1961-214.html A Sedgwick Genealogy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Turner (historian)|Turner, James]] 1999. "The Liberal Education of Charles Eliot Norton"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept of Western Civilization ==

"Probably only someone with Norton’s experiences and scholarly range – who had written about the Mound Builders, roamed India, organized classical archaeology, scoured medieval archives, published nineteenth-century painting – could have concocted Western Civilization. And only then if he had filtered these materials through the sieve of college teaching during years of curricular anarchy. For Western civilization had a scholarly and pedagogical specificity about it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Travel and friendships ==
From 1855 to 1874 Norton spent much time in travel and residence on the continent of Europe and in England, and it was during this period that his friendships began with [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[John Ruskin]], [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] and [[Leslie Stephen]], an intimacy which did much to bring American and English men of letters into close personal relation. Another friend was [[John Lockwood Kipling]], father of Rudyard Kipling. Father and son visited Norton in Boston and the younger Kipling recalled the visit years later in his autobiography:
{{quote|We visited at Boston [my father's] old friend, Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard, whose daughters I had known at The Grange in my boyhood and since. They were Brahmins of the Boston Brahmins, living delightfully, but Norton himself, full of forebodings as to the future of his land’s soul, felt the established earth sliding under him, as horses feel coming earth-tremors. ... Norton spoke of Emerson and Wendell Holmes and Longfellow and the Alcotts and other influences of the past as we returned to his library, and he browsed aloud among his books; for he was a scholar among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Rudyard Kipling, ''Something of Myself: for my friends known and unknown'', London: MacMillan and Co., 1951 (first published 1937). pp. 127–28&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Norton was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1860.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter N|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterN.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began teaching at Harvard in 1874.&lt;ref name=elfland1990&gt;{{cite book|author= Arthur Efland |title=History of Art Education: Intellectual and Social Currents in Teaching the Visual Arts |year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3tyXoFOpPUC&amp;pg=PA64 |publisher= [[Teachers College Press]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8077-7003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, he was appointed professor of the history of art at Harvard, a chair which was created for him and which he held until retirement in 1898. He "centered his teaching upon the golden ages of art history -- classical Athens, the Italian Gothic style of Venetian architecture, and the Florence of the early Renaissance."&lt;ref name=elfland1990 /&gt;

The [[Archaeological Institute of America]] chose him as its first president (1879–1890).

Norton had a peculiar genius for friendship, and it is on his personal influence rather than on his literary productions that his claim to fame rests. In 1881 he inaugurated the Dante Society, whose first presidents were Longfellow, Lowell and Norton himself.  From 1882 onward he confined himself to the study of Dante, his professorial duties, and the editing and publication of the literary memorials of many of his friends.

In 1883 came the ''Letters of Carlyle and Emerson''; in 1886, 1887 and 1888, ''Carlyle's Letters and Reminiscences''; in 1894, the ''Orations and Addresses of [[George William Curtis]]'' and the ''Letters of Lowell''. Norton was also made Ruskin's [[literary executor]], and he wrote various introductions for the American "Brantwood" edition of Ruskin's works. His other publications include ''Notes of Travel and Study in Italy'' (1859), and an ''Historical Study of Church-building in the Middle Ages: Venice, Siena, Florence'' (1880). He organized exhibitions of the drawings of [[J.M.W. Turner|Turner]] (1874) and of Ruskin (1879), for which he compiled the catalogues. In 1886, he opposed the opening of a 'drinking saloon' on the main street near his home, in a letter which reveals little empathy for, or understanding of the significance of, Irish immigration to Cambridge in that era.&lt;ref&gt;For a copy of his letter, see [http://cambridgecivic.com/?p=2805 Cambridge Civic Journal Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; Like his friend Ruskin, Norton believed one of the best things one could do for working-class people was to give them opportunities to gain satisfaction by engaging in [[workmanship]], as opposed to monotonous routine labor where they have to work like machines. [[T. J. Jackson Lears]] has described Norton as the foremost American proponent of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. Norton was a founding member of [[The Society of Arts and Crafts of Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
During the first years of the twentieth century, Norton spoke out in favor of legalized [[euthanasia]]. He lent his name to a movement led by Ohio socialite Anna S. Hall to pass [[physician-assisted suicide]] legislation in [[Ohio]] and [[Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Jacob M. 2004. "A Duty to Kill? A Duty to Die? Rethinking the Euthanasia Controversy of 1906" in Bulletin of the History of Medicine, Volume 78, Number 3&lt;/ref&gt;
Norton died at "Shady Hill," the house where he had been born, on October 21, 1908, and was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].

==Legacy==
Norton was widely admired for the breadth of his intellectual interests, remarkable scholarship and interest in the common good.  He was awarded the honorary degrees of Litt.D. (Cambridge) and D.C.L. (Oxford), as well as the L.H.D. from Columbia and the LL.D. from both Harvard and Yale. One of his many students at Harvard was [[James Loeb]], who in 1907 created the "Charles Eliot Norton Memorial Lectureship" in archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeological.org/giving/endowments/244 The Charles Eliot Norton Memorial Lectureship, Archaeological Institute of America]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] are given annually by distinguished professors at Harvard. Norton bequeathed the more valuable portion of his library to Harvard.

Projects that crisis camps often work on include setting up [[social network]]s for people to locate missing friends and relatives, creating maps of affected areas, and creating inventories of needed items such as food and clothing.

Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], many crisis camps were set up around the world, often under the name "Crisis Camp Haiti", to help with the relief effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-crisiscamp17-2010jan17,0,6468659.story |title=Crisis Camp Haiti: Techno-types volunteer their computer skills to aid quake victims |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |accessdate=January 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120063956/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-crisiscamp17-2010jan17%2C0%2C6468659.story |archivedate=January 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7534">'''Dataism''' is a term that has been used to describe the mindset or philosophy created by the emerging significance of [[Big data|Big Data]]. It was first used by [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More recently, the term has been expanded to describe what social scientist [[Yuval Noah Harari]] has called an emerging ideology or even a new form of religion, in which 'information flow' is the 'supreme value'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
"If you asked me to describe the rising philosophy of the day, I'd say it is Data-ism", wrote [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in the New York Times in February 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/brooks-the-philosophy-of-data.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Philosophy of Data|last=Brooks|first=David|date=2013-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks argued that in a world of increasing complexity, relying on data can reduce cognitive biases and "illuminate patterns of behavior we haven't yet noticed".

In 2015, Steve Lohr's book 'Data-ism' looked at how Big Data is transforming society, using the term to describe the Big Data revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-can-run-from-big-data-but-can-you-hide/2015/03/20/082ea46c-c805-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html|title=You can run from Big Data, but can you hide?|last=Igo|first=Sarah E.|date=2015-03-20|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861210012|title=Data-ism : The Revolution Transforming Decision Making, Consumer Behavior, and Almost Everything Else|last=Lohr|first=Steve|publisher=HarperBusiness|year=May 2015|isbn=0062226819|edition=First|location=New York, NY|pages=|oclc=861210012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development by Harari ===
In his 2016 book, [[Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|Homo Deus]], [[Yuval Noah Harari]] takes the idea of Dataism further, putting it into a historical context. He argues that all competing political or social structures can be seen as data processing systems: "Dataism declares that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Hilbert_InfoGrowth.png|thumb|Harari expands on the term: A Dataist is someone that trusts Big Data (above) and computer algorithms, in preference to human knowledge and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953597984|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2017|publisher=Vintage|year=|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=429|oclc=953597984}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Harari posits that "we may interpret the entire human species as a single data processing system, with individual humans serving as its chips."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage, Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then argues that the whole of human history can be read as a process of improving the efficiency of this system by increasing the number and variety of processors/chips (humans) in the system, increasing the number of connections between the processors and increasing the freedom of movement along existing connections. A condensed form of this argument can be read in Harari's Wired article from 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/yuval-noah-harari-dataism|title='Homo sapiens is an obsolete algorithm': Yuval Noah Harari on how data could eat the world|last=Harari|first=Yuval|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari goes on to argue that Dataism, like any other religion, has practical commandments. A Dataist should want to "maximise dataflow by connecting to more and more media"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and believes that freedom of information is "the greatest good of all". Harari also argues that [[Aaron Swartz]], who took his life in 2013 after being prosecuted for releasing hundreds of thousands of scientific papers from the [[JSTOR]] archive online for free, could be called the "first martyr" of Dataism.

Writing in the Financial Times, Harari argued that Dataism presents an existential challenge to the dominant moral ideology of Humanism, which sees human feelings as the ultimate authority in the world: "humanism is now facing an existential challenge and the idea of “free will” is under threat... Once Big Data systems know me better than I know myself, authority will shift from humans to algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/50bb4830-6a4c-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c|title=Yuval Noah Harari on big data, Google and the end of free will|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2016-08-26|website=Financial Times|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harari predicts that the logical conclusion of this process is that eventually humans will give algorithms the authority to make the most important decisions in their lives, such as who to marry and which career to pursue.

== Criticism ==
Commenting on Harari's characterisation of Dataism, security analyst Daniel Miessler believes that Dataism does not present the challenge to the ideology of liberal humanism that Harari claims, because humans will simultaneously be able to believe in their own importance and that of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://danielmiessler.com/blog/some-thoughts-on-dataism/|title=Some Thoughts on Dataism|date=2017-04-07|work=Daniel Miessler|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari himself raises some criticisms, such as the problem of consciousness, which Dataism is unlikely to illuminate. Humans may also find out that organisms are not algorithms, he suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dataethics.eu/en/humanism-dataism-future-scenario/|title=From Humanism to Dataism. A future scenario. - Dataethical Thinkdotank|date=2017-04-25|work=Dataethical Thinkdotank|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other analysts such as Terry Ortleib have looked at the extent to which Dataism poses a dystopian threat to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Terry Ortlieb|title=is Harari Dataism Dystopian|date=2017-03-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev0Q4tCwgdI|accessdate=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dowry''' is a transfer of parental property, gifts or money at the marriage of a daughter.&lt;ref name=jgoody1976/&gt; Dowry contrasts with the related concepts of [[bride price]] and [[dower]]. While bride price or [[bride service]] is a payment by the [[Bridegroom|groom]] or his family to the bride's parents, dowry is the wealth transferred from the bride's family to the groom or his family, ostensibly for the bride. Similarly, [[dower]] is the property settled on the bride herself, by the groom at the time of marriage, and which remains under her ownership and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goody |first=Jack |title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain |year=1976 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dowry is an ancient custom, and its existence may well predate records of it. Dowries continue to be expected and demanded as a condition to accept a marriage proposal in some parts of the world, mainly in parts of [[Asia]], [[Northern Africa]] and the [[Balkans]]. In some parts of the world, disputes related to dowry sometimes result in acts of [[violence against women]], including killings and [[acid attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/3071963.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Programmes – Crossing Continents – India's dowry deaths|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407213904/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/3071963.stm|archivedate=7 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A dowry is the transfer of parental property to a daughter at her marriage (i.e. 'inter vivos') rather than at the owner's death (''mortis causa'').&lt;ref name=jgoody1976/&gt; A dowry establishes a type of conjugal fund, the nature of which may vary widely. This fund may provide an element of financial security in widowhood or against a negligent husband, and may eventually go to provide for her children.&lt;ref name=jgoody1976&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowries may also go toward establishing a marital household, and therefore might include furnishings such as linens and furniture.

Locally, dowry is called ''dahej'' in Hindi, ''varadhachanai'' in Tamil, ''jehaz'' in Urdu and Arabic, ''joutuk '' in Bengali, ''jiazhuang'' in Mandarin, ''çeyiz'' in Turkish, ''dot'' in French,"daijo" in Nepali,&lt;ref&gt;Stevan Harrell and Sara A.

==Origins==
[[File:Aussteuerschrank fcm.jpg|thumb|''Aussteuerschrank'' – a dowry cabinet, currently in a German museum.]]

Anthropologist [[Jack Goody]]'s comparative study of dowry systems around the world utilizing the [[Human Relations Area Files|Ethnographic Atlas]] demonstrated that dowry is a form of inheritance found in the broad swath of [[Eurasia]]n societies from [[Japan]] to [[Ireland]] that practice "diverging devolution", i.e., that transmit property to children of both sexes. This practice differs from the majority of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n societies that practice "homogenous inheritance" in which property is transmitted only to children of the same sex as the property holder. These latter African societies are characterized by the transmission of the "[[bride price]]," the money, goods or property given by the groom or his family to the parents of the bride (not the bride herself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goody has demonstrated a historical correlation between the practices of "diverging devolution" (dowry) and the development of intensive plough agriculture on the one hand, and homogeneous inheritance (brideprice) and extensive hoe agriculture on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the work of [[Ester Boserup]], Goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies in intensive plough agriculture and extensive shifting horticulture. In sparsely populated regions where shifting cultivation takes place, most of the work is done by women. These are the societies that give brideprice. Boserup further associates shifting horticulture with the practice of [[polygamy]], and hence bridewealth is paid as a compensation to her family for the loss of her labour.  In plough agriculture farming is largely men's work; this is where dowry is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, plough agriculture is associated with private property and marriage tends to be monogamous, to keep the property within the nuclear family. Close family are the preferred marriage partners so as to keep property within the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a scholarly debate on Goody's theory. Sylvia Yanagisko argues, for example, that there are a number of societies including parts of Japan, Southern Italy, and China, that do not support Goody's claim that dowry is a form of female inheritance of male property. She notes that Goody's is an evolutionary model in which these historical variables may not be the decisive factors today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yanagisako|first=Sylvia|title=Family and Household: The analysis of domestic groups|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1979|volume=8|pages=171–72|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.08.100179.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Mann argues, in contrast, with examples where even in late Imperial China, dowry was a form of female inheritance.&lt;ref name=mann&gt;Mann, S. (2008). Dowry Wealth and Wifely Virtue in Mid-Qing Gentry Households. Late Imperial China, 29(1S), 64–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Tambiah|Stanley J. Tambiah]] (Goody's co-author on the earlier "Bridewealth and Dowry"&lt;ref&gt;(Cambridge University Press, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;) later argued that Goody's overall thesis remained pertinent in North India, although it required modification to meet local circumstances. He points out that dowry in North India is only partially used as a bride's conjugal fund, and that a large part goes directly to the groom's joint family. This would initially seem to discount Goody's model, except that in North India, the joint family is composed of the groom's parents, his married brothers and unmarried sisters, and their third generation children. This joint family controlled this part of the dowry, which they used to help fund their own daughter/sister's dowries. But when the parents die, and the joint family partitions, this jointly held wealth was then divided among the married sons, such that ultimately, the bride's dowry given to the joint family returned to her and her husband as their "conjugal fund."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley J.|title=Bridewealth and Dowry Revisited: The posit of women in Sub-Saharan Africa and North India|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1989|volume=30|issue=4|page=426|doi=10.1086/203761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlegel and Eloul expanded on Goody's model through further statistical analysis of the Ethnographic atlas. They argue that a major factor in determining the type of marriage transaction is the type of property controlled by the household. Bridewealth circulates property and women, and is typical of societies where property is limited. Dowry concentrates property and is found in property owning classes or commercial or landed pastoral peoples. When families give dowry, they not only ensure their daughter's economic security, they also "buy" the best possible husband for her, and son-in-law for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlegel|first=Alice|author2=Eloul, Rohn|title=Marriage Transactions: Labor, Property, Status|journal=American Anthropologist|year=1988|volume=90|issue=2|pages=291–309|doi=10.1525/aa.1988.90.2.02a00030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical practices==
===Babylon===
Even in the oldest available records, such as the [[Code of Hammurabi]] in ancient [[Babylon]], the dowry is described as an already-existing custom. Daughters did not normally inherit anything from their father's estate. Instead, with marriage, they got a dowry from her parents, which was intended to offer as much lifetime security to the bride as her family could afford.&lt;ref name=jct09&gt;Thompson, James C., [http://www.womenintheancientworld.com/hammurabilawcode.htm Women in Babylonia Under the Hammurabi Law Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125071026/http://www.womenintheancientworld.com/hammurabilawcode.htm |date=2016-11-25 }} Women in the Ancient World (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Code of Hammurabi (Harper translation)|The Code of Hammurabi]] Robert Harper Translation (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Babylonia, both bride price and dowry were practiced. However, bride price almost always became part of the dowry.&lt;ref name=jct09/&gt; In case of divorce without reason, a man was required to give his wife the dowry she brought as well as the bride price the husband gave.  The return of dowry could be disputed, if the divorce was for a reason allowed under Babylonian law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp The Code of Hammurabi] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20101020002415/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp |date=2010-10-20 }}, Translated by L. W. King (1915), See Laws 137 through 164, and Laws 178 through 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iws.collin.edu/mbailey/hammurabi's%20code%20overview.htm Hammurabi's Code and Babylonian Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515232810/http://iws.collin.edu/mbailey/hammurabi's%20code%20overview.htm |date=2013-05-15 }} Mindi Bailey (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

A wife's dowry was administered by her husband as part of the family assets.  He had no say, however, in its ultimate disposal; and legally, the dowry had to be kept separate for it was expected to support the wife and her children. The wife was entitled to her dowry at her husband's death. If she died childless, her dowry reverted to her family, that is her father if he was alive, otherwise her brothers.  If she had sons, they would share it equally. Her dowry being inheritable only by her own children, not by her husband's children by other women.&lt;ref name=jct09/&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
In archaic [[classical Greece|Greece]], the usual practice was to give a [[bride price]] (''hédnon'' (''ἕδνον'')). Dowries (''pherné'' (''φερνή'')) were exchanged by the later classical period (5th century {{smallcaps|b.c.}}). A husband had certain property rights in his wife's dowry. In addition, the wife might bring to the marriage property of her own, which was not included in the dowry and which was, as a result, hers alone.  This property was "beyond the dowry" (Greek ''parapherna'', the root of [[paraphernalia]]) and is referred to as paraphernal property or [[extra-dotal property]].

A dowry may also have served as a form of protection for the wife against the possibility of ill treatment by her husband and his family,&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Guy Wilson. "Dowry". Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; providing an incentive for the husband not to harm his wife. This would apply in cultures where a dowry was expected to be returned to the bride's family if she died soon after marrying.

In contemporary Greece, dowry was removed from [[family law]] through legal reforms in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#|title=AROUND THE WORLD; Greece Approves Family Law Changes|last=|first=|date=1983-01-26|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616093929/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html|archive-date=16 June 2012|access-date=2016-10-03|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demos, Vasilikie.

===Roman Empire===
The Romans practiced dowry (''dos'').&lt;ref name=smith1875&gt;William Smith (1875), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Dos.html Dos], A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray, London; pp. 436–438&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fm/&gt; The dowry was property transferred by the bride, or on her behalf by anyone else, to the groom or groom's father, at their marriage. Dowry was a very common institution in Roman times,&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Bagnall et al.

All the property of the wife which was not dowry, or was not a donatio propter nuptias, continued to be her own property, and was called ''Parapherna''.&lt;ref name=smith1875/&gt; The dowry could include any form of property, given or promised at the time of marriage, but only what remained after deducting the debts. Not only the bride's family, any person could donate his property as dowry for the woman.

Two types of dowry were known—''dos profectitia'' and ''dos adventitia''.&lt;ref name=fm&gt;Ferdinand Mackeldey (1883), [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GeY2AAAAIAAJ Handbook of the Roman law: Volumes 1–2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005011622/https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GeY2AAAAIAAJ |date=2013-10-05 }}, Book III; pp. 419–430&lt;/ref&gt; That dos is profectitia which was given by the father or father's father of the bride. All other dos is adventitia. Roman law also allowed for a species of dowry, called ''dos receptitia'', which was given by some other person than the father or father's father of the bride, in consideration of marriage, but on the condition that it should be restored back to the dowry giver, on the death of the wife. The bride's family were expected to give a dowry when a girl married, and in proportion to their means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/caecina.shtml#73 M. TVLLI CICERONIS PRO A.

===India===
The practice of dowry in South Asia is a controversial subject. Some scholars believe dowry was practiced in antiquity, but some do not. Historical eyewitness reports (discussed below) suggest dowry in ancient India was insignificant, and daughters had inheritance rights, which by custom were exercised at the time of her marriage. Documentary evidence suggests that at the beginning of 20th century, [[bride price]], rather than dowry was the common custom, which often resulted in poor boys remaining unmarried.&lt;ref&gt;Muni Buddhmal, Terapanth ke Drudhdharmi Shravak Arjunlalji Porwal, Kesrimal ji Surana Abhinanda Granth, 1982, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parwar Directory, Pub.  Singhai Pannalal Raes ed. Pandit Tulsiram, 1924, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley J. Tambiah claims the ancient [[Code of Manu]] sanctioned dowry and bridewealth in ancient India (typically in Rohtak) and especially in [[Kadia (term)|Kadia]] families, but dowry was the more prestigious form and associated with the Brahmanic (priestly) caste. Bridewealth was restricted to the lower castes, who were not allowed to give dowry. He cites two studies from the early 20th century with data to suggest that this pattern of dowry in upper castes and bridewealth in lower castes persisted through the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley|title=Bridewealth and Dowry|year=1973|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge UK|pages=68–69|author2=Goody, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is more likely that marriages involved both reciprocal gifts between the two families, claims Tambiah, so that insofar as the groom's family gave the bridewealth, it tended to be given back as dowry to the bride as part of her conjugal estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley|title=Bridewealth and Dowry|year=1973|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge UK|page=71|author2=Goody, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Witzel]], in contrast, claims the ancient Indian literature suggests dowry practices were not significant during the Vedic period.&lt;ref&gt;Witzel, Michael. "Little Dowry, No Sati: The Lot of Women in the Vedic Period." Journal of South Asia Women Studies 2, no. 4 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Witzel also notes that women in ancient India had property inheritance rights either by appointment or when they had no brothers.

The findings of MacDonell and Keith are similar to Witzel, and differ from Tambiah; they cite ancient Indian literature suggesting bridewealth was paid even in brahma- and daiva-types of marriage associated with the Brahmanic (priestly) upper caste. Dowry was not infrequent, when the girl suffered from some bodily defect. Property rights for women increased in ancient India, suggest MacDonell and Keith, over the Epics era (200 BC – 700 AD).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonell, Arthur and Keith, Arthur. ''Vedic Index: Names and Subjects'', Indian Text Series (John Murray, London, 1912), Volume 1:482–485 ページ出版&lt;/ref&gt; Kane claims ancient literature suggests bridewealth was paid only in the asura-type of marriage that was considered reprehensible and forbidden by Manu and other ancient Indian scribes. Lochtefeld suggests that religious duties listed by Manu and others, such as 'the bride be richly adorned to celebrate marriage' were ceremonial dress and jewelry along with gifts that were her property, not property demanded by or meant for the groom; Lochtefeld further notes that bridal adornment is not currently considered as dowry in most people's mind.&lt;ref&gt;James G. Lochtefeld, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|9780823931798}}; 203 ページ出版&lt;/ref&gt;

The above analysis by various scholars is based on interpreting verses of ancient Sanskrit fiction and inconsistent ''[[smriti]]s'' from India, not eyewitness accounts. Available eyewitness observations from ancient India give a different picture. One of these are the eyewitness records from [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest (''ca''. 300 BC), as recorded by Arrian and Megasthenes. Arrian's first book mentions a lack of dowry,

{{Quote box

Arrian's second book similarly notes,

{{Quote box
 |quote = They (Indians) marry without either giving or taking dowries, but the women as soon as they are marriageable are brought forward by their fathers in public, to be selected by the victor in wrestling or boxing or running or someone who excels in any other manly exercise.

The two sources suggest dowry was absent, or infrequent enough to be noticed by Arrian.&lt;ref&gt;CV Vaidya, Epic India, Or, India as Described in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, {{ISBN|978-8120615649}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1200 years after Arrian's visit, another eyewitness scholar visited India named [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī]], also known as Al-Biruni, or Alberonius in Latin. Al-Biruni was an Islamic era Persian scholar who went and lived in India for 16 years from 1017 CE. He translated many Indian texts into Arabic, as well as wrote a memoir on Indian culture and life he observed. Al-Biruni claimed,

{{Quote box
 |quote = The implements of the wedding rejoicings are brought forward. No gift (dower or dowry) is settled between them. The man gives only a present to the wife, as he thinks fit, and a marriage gift in advance, which he has no right to claim back, but the (proposed) wife may give it back to him of her own will (if she does not want to marry).
 |source = [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al-Biruni]], ''Chapter on Matrimony in India'', about 1035 AD&lt;ref&gt;Edward Sachau (Translator), Bīrūnī, Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad, Alberuni's India (Vol. 2), Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co. (London, 1910.) Chapter LXIX: 154 ページ出版; see Al-Hind too.&lt;/ref&gt; |width  = 90% |align = center |fontsize=95%}}

Al-Biruni further claims that a daughter, in 11th century India, had legal right to inherit from her father, but only a fourth part of her brother. The daughter took this inheritance amount with her when she married, claimed Al-Biruni, and she had no rights to income from her parents after her marriage or to any additional inheritance after her father's death. If her father died before her marriage, her guardian would first pay off her father's debt, then allocate a fourth of the remaining wealth to her upkeep till she is ready to marry, and then give the rest to her to take with her into her married life.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Sachau (Translator), Bīrūnī, Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad, Alberuni's India (Vol. 2), Trübner &amp; Co. (London, 1910.) Chapter LXXII: 164 ページ出版&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear what happened to these daughter's inheritance laws in India after Al-Biruni's visit to India in the 11th century. It is also unclear when, why and how quickly the practice of dowry demand by grooms began, and whether this happened after the arrival of colonialism in the 16th century.

===China===
[[File:Jade cabbage closeup.jpg|thumb|[[Jadeite Cabbage]] – Jin received it as part of her dowry for her wedding to Guangxu, in 1889; originally displayed in Forbidden City (Beijing), it is now in National Palace Museum (Taipei City).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/travel/taipei-s-trove-of-chinese-art.html|title=Taipei's trove of Chinese art|date=12 January 1986|work=The New York Times|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505225335/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/travel/taipei-s-trove-of-chinese-art.html|archivedate=5 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Dowry was common in different historic periods of China and continued through the modern history. Locally called ''Jiàzhuāng'' (嫁妝), the dowry ranged from land, jewelry, money to a collection of clothing, sewing equipment and collection of household items. Mann&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;Lü, B. (2010). Bridal dowry land and the economic status of women from wealthy families in the Song Dynasty.

Journal of Human Resources, 44(1), 25–46&lt;/ref&gt; find that dowry was a form of inheritance to daughters. In traditional China, the property owned by a family, if any, was earmarked for equal division or inheritance by sons only. Dowry was the only way assets were transferred to a daughter. It included immovable property such as land, and movable property like jewelry and fine clothing. The dowry she brought with her was typically sequestered from the property of her husband and other male members in a joint family. She would often sell this property for cash to overcome hard economic times or needs of her children and husband. In a few cases, she may transfer the property she brought as dowry to her daughter or daughter-in-law. Dowry assets once transferred in turn constituted separate wealth of the woman who received it (''sifang qian'', etc.). Often a woman who brought a large dowry was considered more virtuous in Chinese culture than one who didn't.&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; In parts of China, both dowry and brideprice (''pinjin'') were practiced from ancient eras to the 20th century. Though throughout the history of China, the practice of using a brideprice has largely been used instead of dowries, but has slowly diminished in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian, B. (2004). The Camera's Positioning: brides, grooms, and their photographers in Taipei's bridal industry. Ethos, 32(2), 140–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Dowry was widely practiced in Europe until the early modern era. Folklorists often interpret the folk tale ''[[Cinderella]]'' as the competition between the stepmother and the stepdaughter for resources, which may include the need to provide a dowry. [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s opera ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' makes this economic basis explicit: Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters' dowries larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], ''From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers'', pp. 213–14 {{ISBN|0-374-15901-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common penalty for the [[bride kidnapping|kidnapping]] and [[raptio|rape]] of an unmarried woman was that the abductor or rapist had to provide the woman's dowry. Until the late 20th century this was sometimes called [[wreath money]], or the [[breach of promise]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

[[File:Gentile da Fabriano 063.jpg|thumb|The dowry for the three virgins (Gentile da Fabriano, c. 1425, [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]], Rome), the St. Nicholas legend.]]
Providing dowries for poor women was regarded as a form of charity by wealthier parishioners. The custom of Christmas stockings springs from a legend of [[Nicholas of Myra#Deeds and miracles attributed to Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]], in which he threw gold in the stockings of three poor sisters, thus providing for their dowries. St. [[Elizabeth of Portugal]] and St. [[Martin de Porres]] were particularly noted for providing such dowries, and the Archconfraternity of the Annunciation, a Roman charity dedicated to providing dowries, received the entire estate of [[Pope Urban VII]]. In 1425, the Republic of Florence created a public fund, called the ''[[Monte delle doti]]'', to provide dowries to Florentine brides.

Vast inheritances were standard as dowries for aristocratic and royal brides in Europe during the Middle Ages. The Portuguese crown gave two cities in India and Morocco as dowry to the British Crown in 1661 when King [[Charles II of England]] married [[Catherine of Braganza]], a princess of Portugal.

In some cases, [[nun]]s were required to bring a dowry when joining a [[convent]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04340c.htm Convent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102013510/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04340c.htm |date=2010-11-02 }}", ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; At some times, such as [[Ancien Régime]] France, convents were also used by some parents to put less attractive daughters, so that the more marriageable daughters could have larger dowries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Auchincloss]], ''False Dawn'', p. 42 {{ISBN|0-385-18021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancien Régime families that could not provide proper dowries also used the convents as places to put their daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Auchincloss, ''False Dawn'', p. 48 {{ISBN|0-385-18021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[County of Bentheim]], for instance, parents who had no sons might give a land dowry to their new son-in-law. It was commonly given with the condition that he take the surname of his bride, in order to continue the family name.
====England====
Dowry was used in England, however, the right of daughters to inherit and of women to hold property and other rights in their own name made it a different instrument than on the Continent.   The [[Salic law]], which required females to be disinherited and disenfranchised from land ownership, did not apply in England.  Single women held many rights men did.  The most famous example of this English female inheritance and agency right is perhaps [[Elizabeth I of England]], who held all rights a male monarch did.  

While single women held rights to hold property equivalent to those of men, marriage and married women were affected by the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] changes to the law in the 12th Century.   [[Coverture]] was introduced to the common law in some jurisdictions, requiring property of a wife to be held in the husband's name, custody and control.  The Normans also introduced the dowry in England replacing the earlier custom of the new husband giving a morning gift to his bride.  At first the husband publicly gave &lt;sup&gt;''[or received?]''&lt;/sup&gt; the dowry at the church door at the wedding.  

If the husband died, which was frequent, there was a Widows dowry of one third of the husband's lands at the time of his marriage; the income, and in some cases, the management, of the lands, was assigned to her for the rest of her life.  This concept is included in the [[Great Charter]], and along with the recognition of female inheritance and absence of the [[Salic law]], and women, particularly single women, holding many rights equivalent to those men held, manifests English law differing fundamentally from the law of the Continent, especially the law of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].    

Thirteenth-century court records are filled with disputes over dowries, and the law became increasingly complex.&lt;ref&gt; S. H. Steinberg et al. eds. ''A New Dictionary of British History'' (1963) pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English dowry system permitted most noble families to marry off their daughters and thereby gain extended kin and patronage ties. Marriageable daughters were a valuable commodity to ambitious fathers, and the English aristocracy sent few of their eligible daughters to convents.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara J. Harris, "A new look at the Reformation: Aristocratic women and nunneries, 1450–1540." ''Journal of British Studies'' 32.2 (1993): 89–113. &lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to provide a customary, or agreed-upon, dowry could cause a marriage to be called off. [[William Shakespeare]] made use of such an event in ''[[King Lear]]'': one of Cordelia's suitors gives up his suit upon hearing that King Lear will give her no dowry. In ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', Claudio and Juliet's premarital sex was brought about by their families' wrangling over dowry after the betrothal. Angelo's motive for forswearing his betrothal with Mariana was the loss of her dowry at sea.

In [[Victorian England]], dowries were viewed by some members of the upper class as an early payment of the daughter's [[inheritance]]. In some instances, daughters who had not received their dowries were the only female heirs entitled to part of the estate when their parents died. If a couple died without children, a woman's dowry was often returned to her family.&lt;ref&gt;Gail MacColl and Carol McD. Wallace, ''To Marry An English Lord'', pp. 166–67, {{ISBN|0-89480-939-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coverture]] never applied universally in Britain and was repealed in the 1800s.  This effectively ended the concept of dowry as the property of a single woman was either retained by her after marriage or its income became marital property under joint control with a husband (not under his sole control as in coverture).

====Russia====
[[File:Wassilij Wladimirowitsch Pukirew 001.jpg|thumb|''The Dowry'' by 19th century Russian painter, Vasili Pukirev. Dowry was a common practice in Russia through the 19th century.]]
In some parts of Europe, especially Eastern Europe, land dowries were common. 

The [[Domostroy]], a Russian advice book of the 16th century for upper classes, includes advice to set aside property for purposes of a dowry, and use it to accumulate linens, clothing, and other things for it, rather than have to suddenly buy it all for the wedding; if the daughter should happen to die, the dowry should be used to give alms and for prayers for her soul, although some might be set aside for other daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Johnston Pouncey, ''The Domostroi: Rules for Russian Households in the Time of Ivan the Terrible'', p. 95 {{ISBN|0-8014-9689-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsarist Russia]] the dowry originally consisted of clothing for the bride, linen, and bedding.&lt;ref name="Tian-Shanskaia1"&gt;Olga Semyonova Tian-Shanskaia, ''Village Life in Late Tsarist Russia'', pp. 3–4, 1993, Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis.&lt;/ref&gt; Linen became less common, a fact blamed on poor flax harvest and girls being poor spinners, but emphasis was added to the finest of the clothing, and a money dowry was sometimes added, particularly if the bride was regarded as having some fault.&lt;ref name="Tian-Shanskaia1"/&gt; Prospective in-laws, usually concerned mostly with her working ability, grew more concerned about a money dowry.&lt;ref name="Tian-Shanskaia2"&gt;Olga Semyonova Tian-Shanskaia, ''Village Life in Late Tsarist Russia'', p. 66, 1993, Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romania====
In Romania in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (1750–1830s) the exclusion of dowered girls from the family inheritance led to increased cohesion within the nuclear family.  The wife's male relatives controlled the dowry but she retained sole ownership of the dowry and wedding gifts. Her relatives could prosecute the husband for squandering a dowry; wives gained some ability to leave an abusive marriage. The long-term result was a greater legal empowerment of women, while providing economic security to divorced women, widows, and children.&lt;ref&gt; Angela Jianu,  "Women, Dowries, and Patrimonial Law in Old Regime Romania (c. 1750–1830)." ''Journal of family history'' 34.2 (2009): 189–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===

====Indigenous cultures====
According to one ethnographic study of indigenous cultures worldwide, around six percent of North American indigenous cultures practised reciprocal exchange, involving the giving of gifts between both the bride and groom's families.&lt;ref name="Ferraro, Gary P., and Susan Andreatta 2009 224"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ferraro, Gary P. |author2=Susan Andreatta|title=Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780495601920|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the tribes of the American Plains, a combination of [[dower]] and dowry was used. The groom would give a gift of horses to the bride's parents, while they in turn would give a gift to the groom. The exchange was somewhat reciprocal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deogaonkar|first=S.

====Mexico====
Spanish colonists brought the dowry custom to Mexico. Spain's laws gave brides the right to control their dowry after marriage, contrary to the usual European practice of transferring the dowry to the control of the groom and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangan|first=Jane E.|title=Trading Roles: Gender, Ethnicity, and the Urban Economy in Colonial Potosí|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822334705|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, in practice, often did maintain control over their dowry after marriage. The husband might be given funds from the dowry to invest for the mutual benefit of the couple and their children, but wives also often used funds from their dowries to operate their own businesses, as grocers, tavern keepers, and shop owners in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangan|first=Jane E.|title=Trading Roles: Gender, Ethnicity, and the Urban Economy in Colonial Potosí|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822334705|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowries were a common custom in the early colonial years, but were passing out of use by the mid-18th century. By that time, less wealthy daughters were often marrying without any dowry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Socolow|first=Susan Migden|title=The Women of Colonial Latin America|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521476423|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New France====
The French government made efforts to encourage marriage for the male soldiers and traders in New France by granting dowries to women willing to travel to the colony at Quebec. As the French crown provided dowries for many of the women persuaded to travel to [[New France]] for marriages and settlement there, they were known as ''[[filles du roi]]'' (daughters of the king).

Convents in Quebec, as in Europe, required a dowry from the parents of girls becoming nuns, much as the dowry was expected in the marriages of upper class brides. The Catholic Church intended for this requirement to be used to maintain some control over the new members of religious communities. Girls without a dowry were often supported by benefactors, however, and occasionally convents lowered the sum required to enter the convent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Freedom in Early America|year=1997|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814721988|page=116|editor=Larry D.

The 15th-century painting relates to the story of a poor man with three daughters. In those days a young woman's father had to offer prospective husbands a dowry.

The dowry was a custom brought to the United States by colonists from England and elsewhere in Europe. One legend tells how [[John Hull (merchant)|John Hull]], the Master of the Mint in [[Boston]] and a wealthy man, determined the dowry for his daughter Hannah's marriage to Samuel Sewall. Hull is said to have set his 18-year-old daughter onto one side of the large scales in his warehouse. He piled shillings into the other side of the scale until he reached her weight in silver, and that was her dowry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeologia Americana: transactions and collections of the American Antiquarian Society, Volume 3|year=1857|publisher=American Antiquarian Society, digitized by University of Wisconsin at Madison|pages=274–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dowry system existed in certain Native American tribes. An example is found in the marriage of Virginia settler [[John Rolfe]] to [[Pocahontas]], who brought a dowry to the marriage that included a large amount of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mirza|first=Rocky M.|title=The Rise and Fall of the American Empire: A Re-Interpretation of History, Economics and Philosophy: 1492–2006|year=2007|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=9781425113834|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughters of wealthy 19th century industrialists, who were able to inherit large amounts of money and property, were given "dowries" by their fathers to marry European aristocrats who held a title but had little wealth. The mutual exchange of title and wealth raised the status of both bride and groom.&lt;ref name="Ferraro, Gary P., and Susan Andreatta 2009 224"/&gt;

====Brazil====
The dowry was a custom brought to Brazil by Portuguese settlers. Colonial economics meant that families had a great stake in inheritances of land in particular. As in Europe, the eldest daughter was usually granted the largest dowry by her father. Variations were not unusual, however, as research has shown in São Paulo, 31% of fathers gave dowries of increasing size to the younger daughters, and 21% distributed dowries with no particular favour shown to birth order of the daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nazzari|first=Muriel|title=Disappearance of the Dowry: Women, Families, and Social Change in São Paulo, Brazil (1600–1900)|year=1991|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804719285|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to dowries, daughters could also be granted an inheritance from their father, a share of the ''legìtima''. Inheritance laws were complex in colonial Brazil. According to Portuguese law, an estate was to be divided among children who had not already received a dowry. In the early colonial period, married daughters receiving a large dowry would refuse to accept a further inheritance after the death of their father. In the 18th century, as inheritances and dowries gradually became smaller, this custom disappeared. Daughters accepted a dowry, plus a ''legìtima.'' In this way, they folded their dowry back into the estate with the ''legìtima'', called bringing the dowry ''à colação''. The remaining third of the estate, the ''terça'', was free for the father to divide as he wished among his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nazzari|first=Muriel|title=Disappearance of the Dowry: Women, Families, and Social Change in São Paulo, Brazil (1600–1900)|year=1991|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804719285|pages=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were instances where a daughter was left to marry without a dowry, whereas her sisters were given dowries, an indication of paternal control over marriage choices. During the 18th century, as inheritances decreased in size, litigation among siblings became more common. Dowries could include land, a house in the city, cash, gold dust, gold bars, tools and machinery, cattle, or horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nazzari|first=Muriel|title=Disappearance of the Dowry: Women, Families, and Social Change in São Paulo, Brazil (1600–1900)|year=1991|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804719285|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, economic changes meant that men, typically merchants, brought more to the marriage materially, and the economic dynamics of marriage changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nazzari|first=Muriel|title=Disappearance of the Dowry: Women, Families, and Social Change in São Paulo, Brazil (1600–1900)|year=1991|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804719285|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current practices==
Dowry is a common practice in many parts of the world, especially in [[South Asia]] and several [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] countries. Dowry is most common in nations with inadequate male-biased inheritance laws and [[patrilineal]] societies, which expect women to live with or near their husband's family.&lt;ref name="Van Willigen 1991 pp. 369–377"&gt;Van Willigen, J., &amp; Channa, V. C. (1991). Law, custom, and crimes against women: The problem of dowry death in India. Human organization, 50(4), pp. 369–377&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalmia, S. 2005 pp. 71–93"&gt;Dalmia, S., &amp; Lawrence, P. G. (2005). The institution of dowry in India: Why it continues to prevail. The Journal of Developing Areas, 38(2), pp. 71–93.&lt;/ref&gt; 
An unusual exception to the dowry custom in South Asia is found in [[Bhutan]]. The dowry system does not exist in Bhutan; inheritance is [[matrilineal]], and daughters do not take their father's name at birth, nor their husband's name upon marriage. Rural land may be registered in a woman's name. Women own businesses, and both [[polyandry]] and [[polygyny]] are socially accepted, with polygyny being more prevalent. Sometimes a prospective groom will work in the bride's family's household to earn the right to marry her.&lt;ref name="Stange, Mary Zeiss, and Carol K. Oyster, Jane E.

===India===
{{Main article|Dowry system in India}}
In India, dowry is called ''Dahej'' in Hindi, and ''Jahez'' in Arabic (derived from Islamic ''jahez-e-fatimi'').&lt;ref name=Waheed&gt;{{cite journal | last = Waheed | first = Abdul | title = Dowry among Indian muslims: ideals and practices | journal = [[Indian Journal of Gender Studies]] | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–75 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/097152150801600103 | date = February 2009 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In far eastern parts of India, dowry is called ''Aaunnpot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ali | first = Maqbul | title = Pangal women: social challenges and education | journal = International Organization of Scientific Research – Journal of Humanities and Social Science (IOSR-JHSS) | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 39–42 | publisher = International Organization of Scientific Research (IOSR) | doi = 10.1177/097152150801600103 | date = March 2013 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowry is a payment of cash or gifts from the bride's family to the bridegroom's family upon marriage. It may include cash, jewellery, electrical appliances, furniture, bedding, crockery, utensils, car and other household items that help the newly-weds set up their home.

In India, the dowry system puts great financial strain on the bride's family. Payment of dowry is now prohibited under the [[Dowry system in India#Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961|Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961]] in [[Law of India|Indian civil law]] and subsequently by Sections 304B and 498a of the [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC). Despite anti-dowry laws in India, it is still a common illegal practice. Other laws attempting to address the problem include the ''Dowry and Bridal Gifts Restrictions Rules, 1976'' and the ''Dowry Prohibition (Maintenance of Lists of Presents to the Bride and Bridegroom) Rules, 1985'', which are intended to document gifts and provide complainants with stronger evidence in the event that prosecution for crimes against the bride occurs later.

Dowry in India is not limited to Hindus or any specific religion. It is widespread. For example, Indian Muslims call dowry as ''jahez'', justify the practice in terms of jahez-e-fatimi. Islamists classify jahez into two categories: The first comprises some essential articles for the outfit of the bride as well as for conjugal life. The other is made up of valuable goods, clothes, jewelry, an amount of money for the groom's family, which is settled on after bargaining. The ''jahez'' often far exceeds the cost of the ''[[baraat]]'' and marriage parties. The ''jahez'' is separate from cash payment as ''[[Mahr]]'' or dower that Sharia religious law requires.&lt;ref name=Waheed /&gt;

Although Indian laws against dowries have been in effect for decades, they have been largely criticised as being ineffective.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Practical Steps towards Eliminating Dowry and Bride-Burning in India|last = Manchandia|first = Purna|journal = Tul.

Dowry-murder persists. It is the killing of a wife for not bringing sufficient dowry to the marriage. It is the culmination of a series of prior domestic abuses by the husband's family.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Rudd, "Dowry-murder: An example of violence against women."

===Bangladesh===
The original custom in Bangladesh was the [[bride price]], called ''pawn'', where the groom's family makes a payment to the bride's parents. This has gradually been replaced by the dowry, called ''joutuk''. This transition in customs began in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Gavin W.|title=The Continuing Demographic Transition|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198292579|pages=290–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 21st century, the bride price has been supplanted by the dowry. ''Joutuk'', sometimes spelled ''Joutukh'', like elsewhere in South Asia, is a serious and growing problem in Bangladesh. Between 0.6 and 2.8 brides per year per 100,000 women are reported to die because of dowry-related violence.&lt;ref&gt;Shahnaz Huda (2006), [http://sar.sagepub.com/content/26/3/249.short Dowry in Bangladesh: Compromizing {{sic|hide=yes}} Women's Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426235719/http://sar.sagepub.com/content/26/3/249.short |date=2015-04-26 }}, ''South Asia Research'', November vol. 26 no. 3, pp. 249–268. {{doi|10.1177/0262728006071707}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=4592 Women’s Safety: Ghosts on the Prowl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109202405/http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=4592 |date=November 9, 2014 }} Mahfuzur Rahman, Dhaka Courier, January 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh has seen a rise in the expected size of dowries in recent decades, as its middle class has grown. Sociologist Sarah White has argued that the dowry is not compensation for weakness in women's economic contribution. Instead its main function is now to support family advancement by mobilizing additional resources. It also demonstrates an ongoing commitment to the norms of masculine provision and protection. Dowries make women more valuable, which pushes against the background of widespread corruption and political and gender violence.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah C. White,  "Patriarchal Investments: Marriage, Dowry and the Political Economy of Development in Bangladesh." ''Journal of Contemporary Asia'' 47.2 (2017): 247–272. {{doi|10.1080/00472336.2016.1239271}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A negative factor is the rise in the rate of "dowry deaths". In Bangladesh, dowry killings are more frequently done by stabbing or poison rather than burning. Dowry extortion is also a problem in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Menski 1998 109"&gt;{{cite book|last=Menski|first=Werner|title=South Asians and the Dowry Problem|year=1998|publisher=Trentham Books|isbn=9781858561417|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; From January to October 2009, more than 3,413 complaints were made to the police in Bangladesh concerning beatings and other abuses related to dowries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report: Bangladesh 2010|year=2010|publisher=Amnesty International|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-bangladesh-2010?page=2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604140126/http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-bangladesh-2010?page=2|archivedate=2012-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the methods used by families who are unhappy with dowry includes [[acid throwing]], in which concentrated acid is thrown on the bride's face to cause disfiguration and social isolation. From 1995 to 1998, 15 women reported dowry disputes as the motivation behind acid attacks, though that number may be low due to underreporting.&lt;ref&gt;International Women's Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific. ''Baseline Report: Violence Against Women in Bangladesh''. 1–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh is combating the problem with legislation largely copied from that of India. Laws prohibiting dowry in Bangladesh include ''Dowry Prohibition Act, 1980''; ''Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1982''; and ''Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1986''.

Dowry Prohibition Act Clause 4 states that any one demanding Dowry from a person has committed a crime. The law does not have any clause stating punishment to misuse it. Therefore, the law is frequently used by women to harass in-laws and husbands.&lt;ref name="News article on Dowry Law Abuse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.priyo.com/law-and-order/2011/feb/16/women-repression-dowry-law-nee-20016.html|title=Women repression, dowry: Law needs changes to check false cases|work=Priyo News|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305113129/http://news.priyo.com/law-and-order/2011/feb/16/women-repression-dowry-law-nee-20016.html|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, dowry is called ''Jahez'' in Arabic (derived from Islamic ''jahez-e-fatimi'').&lt;ref&gt;Hussain, R. (1999). Community perceptions of reasons for preference for consanguineous marriages in Pakistan. Journal of Biosocial Science, 31(4), 449–461&lt;/ref&gt; At over 2000 dowry-related deaths per year, and annual rates exceeding 2.45 deaths per 100,000 women from dowry-related violence, Pakistan has the highest reported number of dowry death rates per 100,000 women in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4e4213da2.pdf Operational Note: Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925131251/http://refworld.org/pdfid/4e4213da2.pdf |date=2013-09-25 }} Refworld, A United Nations initiative (August 2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;16–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/21365/|title=To estimate an equation explaining the determinants of Dowry|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604225424/https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/21365/|archivedate=4 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ansari,&lt;ref&gt;Ansari, A. S. Bazmee (1978) "Is Dowry Obligatory?", Hamdard Islamicus, 1(2):78–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Masrat Musavi, Fatima – The Ideal Model for Women of All Times, Imam Reza (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's Muslim community considers dowry as an obligatory Islamic practice. They cite [[sunnah]] of the Prophet to justify the practice of giving dowry as well as receiving dower (Mahr); the Prophet gave items as dowry to his daughter Fatima at her marriage to Ali; and as second sunnah, the marriage of Zainab—another daughter of the Prophet—is mentioned, who received expensive jewelry from her family at the time of her marriage. Over 95 percent of all marriages in Pakistan involves transfer of a dowry from the bride's family to groom's family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/ayp0102.pdf Adolescents and Youth in Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312003405/http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/ayp0102.pdf |date=2014-03-12 }} Zeba Sathar, Cynthia Lloyd, et al., Population Council, with support from UNICEF; pp. 92–116&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 [[Gallup International Association|Gallup]] survey in Pakistan found that 84% of Pakistanis believe that dowry plays either very important or somewhat important role in marriage, while 69% believed it is not possible for a girl to get married without a dowry.&lt;ref&gt;"Tradition of dowry in Pakistan: 56% Pakistanis believe it is impossible for girls to get married without dowry" [http://gallup.com.pk/tradition-of-dowry-in-pakistan-56-pakistanis-believe-it-is-impossible-for-girls-to-get-married-without-dowry/ ''Gilani Research Foundation Polls,'' 17 Jan. 2017] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325050410/http://gallup.com.pk/tradition-of-dowry-in-pakistan-56-pakistanis-believe-it-is-impossible-for-girls-to-get-married-without-dowry/ |date=2018-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan has seen a rise in the values of dowries in recent decades, as in other South Asian countries.&lt;ref name="Menski 1998 109"/&gt; However, in Pakistan it is still expected that a bride will bring some kind of dowry with her to a marriage, whether she is Muslim, Hindu, or Christian.&lt;ref name="Walbridge 2003 134"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walbridge|first=Linda S.|title=The Christians of Pakistan: The Passion of Bishop John Joseph|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780700716562|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dower]] ([[bride price]]), called ''[[mahr]]'', and dowry, called ''jahaiz'', are both customs with long histories in Pakistan.

Control of the dowry belongs to the bride in theory, although in practice control often transfers to the husband and in-laws, and grooms sometimes extort large dowries. In rural Pakistan, dowry values are still relatively low, around 12 percent of a household's annual (non-durable goods) expenses. Also, in rural Pakistan it is standard for the bride to maintain control over her dowry after marriage, rather than control of the dowry being given to the in-laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bride Exchange and Women's Welfare in Rural Pakistan|publisher=World Bank Publications|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent survey in January 2017 by Gallup Pakistan showed that 56 percent of the population expects the girl to bring dowry to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalvillagespace.com/improving-female-conditions-depends-outlawing-dowry/|title=Why Improving female conditions depends on outlawing dowry|date=2017-01-18|work=Global Village Space|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210003122/https://www.globalvillagespace.com/improving-female-conditions-depends-outlawing-dowry/|archivedate=2018-02-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The pressure among some Pakistanis to provide a large dowry results in some brides' families going into debt, including debt servitude; some brides build up their dowry with their own earnings if they work outside the home.&lt;ref name="Walbridge 2003 134"/&gt; The debt trap created by providing large dowries puts pressure on parents aspiring to arrange a marriage for their daughter(s) into a better social class. It is also cited as a reason for the current trend toward delayed marriages. Arranged marriages among first cousins are common, since they provide a way of keeping dowries within an extended family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Singh, Sarina |author2= Lindsay Brown |author3= Paul Clammer |author4=Rodney Cocks |author5= John Mock |title=Pakistan and the Karakoram Highway|year=2008|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=9781741045420|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan has passed several laws to address the problem of excessive dowry demands: ''West Pakistan Dowry (Prohibition of Display) Act, 1967''; ''Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976''. Women's rights to inheritance separate from the dowry are offered some protection in the ''Muslim Personal Law of Shariat of 1948'' and the ''Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961''.&lt;ref name="Esposito, John L. and Natana J.

The practice of dowry is common in Nepal, and dowry-related violence is increasingly becoming a problem.

Even highly educated people living in the [[Terai]] of Nepal accept dowry without any second thoughts. Parents have thus started dreading the birth of daughters in the family, going as far as [[sex selection|determining the sex of fetuses]] in order to [[sex-selective abortion|abort daughters]].  Many deaths have also been caused by not giving dowry to the groom's side. Dowry system, however, is not practiced by Non-Hindu people or indigenous people.

In Nepal, the practice of dowry is closely related to social prestige; and dowry violence is especially prevalent in the Terai belt. In 2009, Nepal enacted the Social Customs and Practices Act outlawing dowry; however, there have been no known cases of enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Co-publications/Femicide_A%20Gobal%20Issue%20that%20demands%20Action.pdf|title=Femicide: A Global Issue that Demands Action|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Academic Council on the United Nations System (ACUNS) Vienna Liaison Office|isbn=978-3-200-03012-1|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630215522/http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Co-publications/Femicide_A%20Gobal%20Issue%20that%20demands%20Action.pdf|archivedate=2014-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large dowry is sometimes expected, and given, in Afghanistan; some houses are almost emptied so that the daughter may make a grand show at the wedding. Items included in a dowry depend on the resources of the bride's family and the demands made by the groom's family. Embroidery is traditionally included in a dowry, as is land, money, jewelry such as necklaces and ''pazab'', shoes, shawls, carpets, bedding, furniture, crockery, mirrors, clocks and such items. The dowry is transferred from bride's family house to the groom's family house one day before the wedding day in a ritual ceremony with band and a procession, which typically adopts the longest route in the residential area for the Afghan community to see the dowry being given by the bride's family.&lt;ref&gt;SHAH, Ikbal Ali.

Afghanistan has both dowry and bride price, although the practice differs between different tribal and ethnic groups. In Afghanistan, a marriage typically requires two kinds of payments: a [[mahr]], which typically consists of livestock, property and money, and in practice often takes the form of a bride price paid to the woman's family; and a dowry brought by the bride to her husband's home which may include various goods such as clothing, bedding and household utensils.&lt;ref name="undp.org.af"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Family"&gt;Peter Blood (2004), [http://countrystudies.us/afghanistan/57.htm Family] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120703101254/http://countrystudies.us/afghanistan/57.htm |date=2012-07-03 }}, Afghanistan A Country Study, Library of Congress, {{ISBN|978-1419104985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of dowry the bride brings often influences how she is treated when she arrives at her husband's home.&lt;ref name="Family"/&gt; Parents frequently arrange marriages for daughters at a young age, in order to end their economic responsibility for their daughter.&lt;ref name="Stange, Mary Zeiss, and Carol K.

Dowry has existed in Persia for over 1000 years, and called ''jahīzīeh'' (sometimes spelled ''jahaz'' or ''jaheez'', جهیزیه).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.2.steingass.125920 Steingass Persian-English], University of Chicago, See explanation for Jahiz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aryanpour.com/ Persian English Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102084608/http://www.aryanpour.com/ |date=2014-11-02 }} see Dowry&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jahiz'' is vestments, furniture, jewelry, cash and other paraphernalia a bride's family gives to the bride to take with her to the groom's family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arusi-the-secular-wedding-celebration-which-follows-the-wedding-contract-ceremony-aqd-q Encyclopedia Iranica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517002226/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arusi-the-secular-wedding-celebration-which-follows-the-wedding-contract-ceremony-aqd-q |date=2013-05-17 }}, New York (2011), Vol. II, Fasc. 6, pp. 666–670; See discussion of dowry, under ʿARŪSĪ&lt;/ref&gt; Jahiz is separate from [[Mahr]] required by [[Sharia]] religious laws, as well as the traditional payment of ''Shir Baha'' (literally: price of milk), in rural [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghorayshi, P.

===Turkey===
Dowry is known as ''çeyiz'' in [[Turkey]]. ''Ceyiz'' is the property and money bride's family in Turkey give during marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Sherife Ayla Samli (2011), Containing the Future: Modern Identities as Material Negotiation in the Urban Turkish Ceyiz, PhD thesis, Rice University, Houston (US)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suad Joseph, Afsāna Naǧmābādī, Encyclopedia of Women &amp; Islamic Cultures, Volume 3, {{ISBN|9004128190}}, Brill (The Netherlands), p. 263, Quote: "Ceyiz, a combination of dowry/trouseau [sic?], takes the form of goods, property, gold or cash given to the bride"&lt;/ref&gt; Ceyiz is different and separate from the ''[[Mahr]]'', which is paid by the groom to the bride, or traditional ''baslik'' in some parts of Turkey.

Ceyiz often includes furnishings, appliances, clothing, gold jewelry, cash and other items depending on the resources of the Turkish family.&lt;ref&gt;Suad Joseph, Afsāna Naǧmābādī, Encyclopedia of Women &amp; Islamic Cultures, Volume 3, {{ISBN|9004128190}}, Brill (The Netherlands), pp. 262–263&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Turkish dowry remains with the couple after marriage, other is specifically meant for the groom's family and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Sandikci and Ilhan (2011), ''Dowry: A Cherished Possession or an Old-Fashioned Tradition in a Modernizing Society?'', in Cele Otnes, Tina M. Lowre (Editors): Contemporary Consumption Rituals: A Research Anthology, {{ISBN|0-8058-4204-7}}, Taylor &amp; Francis; p. 164, Quote – "Gift dowry is the third type of dowry and fulfills a different role than the other two types. Whereas chest and appliance dowries are for the use of the bride and groom, gift dowry are given to relatives. It is required for the bride's family to give gift dowry to the groom's family and relatives. Typically, the parents and siblings receive more valuable items, whereas the relatives are given smaller gifts. By offering valuable gifts to the closest relatives, the bride's family symbolically reaffirms the relatively higher status for the groom's family."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ceyiz'' is typically agreed upon between the groom's and bride's families before the wedding date is finalized. According to tradition, even in current times, the dowry is displayed for showing-off, before the marriage in rural Turkey, at the bride's family, or groom's family—the display is typically attended and examined by females, particularly from the groom's family. In some cases, if the groom's family is not satisfied with the displayed dowry, the wedding is cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Sandikci and Ilhan (2011), in Cele Otnes, Tina M. Lowre (Editors), Contemporary Consumption Rituals: A Research Anthology, {{ISBN|0-8058-4204-7}}, Taylor &amp; Francis; p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The dowry is transferred, from the bride's family to the groom's family just before the wedding in a ceremonial ritual. Thereafter, the wedding is completed.&lt;ref name=sai2011&gt;Sandikci and Ilhan (2011), in Cele Otnes, Tina M.

Violence and property claims related disputes are more frequent if there is a divorce.

===Azerbaijan===
Dowry is known as ''cehiz'' in [[Azerbaijan]]. ''Cehiz'' is the property and money the bride's family must give to the groom's family prior to marriage. ''Cehiz'' is separate from the money under ''[[Mahr]]'' required under [[Sharia]] religious requirements in Islamic Azerbaijan. ''Cehiz'' often includes furnishings, appliances, crystal, mirrors, bed, jewelry and cash depending on the negotiations between the groom's and bride's families before the wedding day. While the groom's family receives ''Cehiz'', the bride receives ''Mahr''. Relatives of the bride often contribute to the ''Cehiz'' demands, through the ritual of ''koncas''. Dowry is transferred a few days before the wedding, and examined by groom's family, and a ''Sihaye'' (receipt) for the dowry is issued by the groom's family; this helps avoid disputes. If some items of the dowry are not satisfactory, the wedding may be delayed or cancelled. Similar traditions continue in many regions of Caucasus, including non-Muslim ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Lale Yalçın-Heckman (2005), The Return of Private Property: Rural Life After Agrarian Reform in the Republic of Azerbaijan, {{ISBN|978-3-643-10629-2}}, pp. 143–149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ghaffarzadeh, S.

===Tajikistan===
Dowries are sometimes expected in [[Tajikistan]], and they often consist of a collection of traditional dresses which are on display on the wedding day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13065495|title=Tajik weddings hit by austerity law|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103021621/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13065495|archivedate=3 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
In [[Egypt]], dowry is known as ''Gehaz''.&lt;ref name=amin2004&gt;Amin, Sajeda, and Nagah H. Al‐Bassusi. "Education, wage work, and marriage: Perspectives of Egyptian working women." ''Journal of Marriage and Family'' 66, no. 5 (2004): pp. 1287–1299. {{doi|10.1111/j.0022-2445.2004.00093.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://prezi.com/ltqoux45z6nv/marriage-in-subsaharan-west-african-countries/ Marriage in Subsaharan &amp; West African Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226211727/http://prezi.com/ltqoux45z6nv/marriage-in-subsaharan-west-african-countries/ |date=2013-12-26 }} Prezi (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; This is the property a bride is expected to bring with her at marriage, and it is different from the dower (Mahr) paid by the groom to the bride per requirements of Sharia. ''Gehaz'' is observed in rural and urban Egypt, and is typically negotiated between the groom's family and bride's. ''Gehaz'' includes furniture, appliances, jewelry, china, bedding and various household items. Families begin collecting dowry years before a girl is betrothed. Many Egyptian girls take up jobs so as to save money necessary to meet the expected dowry demands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/BuildingAssets_Oct05.pdf Building assets for safe, productive lives – Girls] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017093203/http://popcouncil.org/pdfs/BuildingAssets_Oct05.pdf |date=2012-10-17 }} Population Council, New York (2005); pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Egyptian+working+women's+perceptions+of+marriage.-a0110734686 Egyptian working women's perceptions of marriage], Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, Egypt (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the dowry is given during the marriage, in rural Egypt, it is ritually displayed to the village prior to the marriage. Every piece of the ''gehaz'' is placed on open cars that go around the village several times, with music, in order to show off the dowry being given by the bride's family to the groom.&lt;ref name=amin2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/48/24/92/PDF/10035.pdf A Collective Model of Female Labor Supply : Do Distribution Factors Matter in the Egyptian Case?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730202653/http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/48/24/92/PDF/10035.pdf |date=2012-07-30 }} Rana HENDY, Catherine SOFER, Universite Paris (May, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''gehaz'' show off ritual is also a means to enhance the bride's status within her new marital family.

===Morocco===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van groep vrouwen TMnr 60047825.jpg|thumb|Muslim [[Ouled Nail]] girls waiting in the streets of an Algerian village to earn dowry as dancers. Algerian patrons invited them at cafés and festivals or to shrines of Muslim [[Wali|awliya]]. When their dowries were adequate they returned to their mountain villages and married within the tribe. This centuries-old tradition has continued into modern [[Algeria]]. (Photo from the late 19th century, courtesy of Tropenmuseum, The Netherlands)&lt;ref&gt;Çelik, Zeynep, and Leila Kinney. "Ethnography and exhibitionism at the Expositions Universelles." Assemblage 13 (1990): 35–59.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Dowry is a traditional and current practice in [[Morocco]], and is called ''shura'', ''shawar'', ''ssdaq'' or ''amerwas'' depending on the speaker's region and ethnicity (e.g. Arabic, Berber, etc.). Dowry in Morocco is separate from the ''Mahr'' or ''Sadaq'' that is religiously required by [[Sharia]].&lt;ref name=Ziba2000/&gt;

Centuries ago, ''Mahr'' and ''Sadaq'' meant something different in Morocco. ''Mahr'' was the purchase price paid for the bride by the groom's family to the bride's father or guardian, while ''Sadaq'' was the betrothal gift offered by groom to the bride.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Westermarck (1914), Marriage ceremonies in Morocco, ISBN MacMillan (London), pp. 65–74&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the difference vanished and they are now one and the same, but different from the practice of dowry.&lt;ref&gt;Maher, V. (1974). Divorce and Property in the Middle Atlas of Morocco. Man, 9(1), pp. 103–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the Moroccan practice is to split the so-called ''Sadaq'', which meets the Islamic requirement of ''Mahr'', into two parts: ''naqd'' (cash) and ''kali'' (remainder Mahr). The ''Naqd Sadaq'' is paid by the groom's family to bride's family before the wedding. The bride's family supplements the ''Naqd'' amount with an equal or greater amount of cash, and gives dowry (called ''shura'', ''shawar'' or ''amerwas''). This dowry typically includes furniture, clothing, appliances, beds, household items, divans, jewelry, and other property. The dowry amounts are negotiated before the wedding. Higher dowry and lower [[Mahr]] are expected for widows and divorcées than for virgins. If elders of the two families do not agree on the dowry amount, the marriage is typically delayed or cancelled. The value and composition of the dowry varies according to social class, family wealth and regional customs. The ''kali al-sadaq'' (sometimes called ''mwahhar'' in Northern Morocco) is paid later, to technically meet the requirements of ''Mahr'' under Islamic Sharia. The ''shura'' (dowry) far exceeds the ''kali al-sadaq'', and there is a large transfer of wealth from bride's family to the couple and the groom's family.&lt;ref name=Ziba2000&gt;Ziba Mir-Hosseini (2000), Marriage on Trial: A Study of Islamic Family Law, Tauris (London), {{ISBN|1860646085}}, pp. 97–102, 70–75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camillia Fawzi El-Solh and Judy Mabro (1995), ''Muslim Women's Choices: Religious Belief and Social Reality'', {{ISBN|0-85496-8369}}, pp. 56–72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnia===
Dowry is known as ''oprema'' in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].&lt;ref name=bringa95&gt;Tone Bringa (1995), ''Being Muslim the Bosnian Way'', {{ISBN|978-0691001753}}, Princeton University Press; pp. 137–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Rheubottom(1980) in John Comaroff (Editor), Dowry and Wedding Celebrations in Yugoslav, Academic Press (London); pp. 221–251&lt;/ref&gt; In neighboring regions, it is sometimes called ''prikija'' or ''ženinstvo''. Another term ''miraz'' is used sometimes, but ''miraz'' is also used to mean inheritance, something different from dowry.&lt;ref&gt;Nusret Mulasmajic, Bosnian-English Dictionary – Turcisms Collorquialisms Islamic Words, {{ISBN|978-1-4634-0179-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanimirovic, V. (2010). Re-Emergence of the Dowry amongst Serbs. Annals Fac. L. Belgrade Belgrade L. Rev., 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oprema'' is separate from the Mahr dower Muslim Bosnians are required to give under Islamic laws. ''Oprema'' refers to the property the bride's parents give her as part of the marriage. It often includes furniture, kitchenware, decorative items, gold jewelry and other items. Oprema is also different from ''pohod'' (gift giving, ''dar'') ritual of Bosnia, as well as the ''ruho'' (embroidered clothing) ritual. Oprema is discussed between the groom's and bride's family before the marriage; the groom's family sets the quality and quantity expectations. The ''oprema'' is typically not displayed to those who attend the wedding. Oprema and ''dar'' are a major economic burden to bride's family in Bosnia. Poorer families spend years saving money and buying ''oprema'' in order to get their daughter(s) married.&lt;ref name=bringa95/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, O. (1935).

===Serbia===
In [[Serbia]], in some rural areas, the custom of dowry continues to be observed.
Dowry has been brought to medieval Serbia mainly through Byzantine influences; it was not originally a Slavic custom. The Turkish conquest of Serbia has caused the temporary disappearance of dowry, but the custom re-emerged in the 19th century. The communist regime sought to abolish dowry, but the custom has survived in some rural areas to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anali.ius.bg.ac.rs/Annals%202010/Annals%202010%20p%20185-202.pdf|title=RE-EMERGENCE OF THE DOWRY AMONGST SERBS|last=Stanimirović|first=Vojislav|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728232057/http://anali.ius.bg.ac.rs/Annals%202010/Annals%202010%20p%20185-202.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence against women and international perspectives==
{{Main article|Violence against women}}
Disputes related to dowry sometimes result in violence against women, including killings and [[acid attacks]]. [[Amnesty International]] has stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|title=Violence Against Women Information|work=Amnesty International USA|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225053/http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|archivedate=4 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[T]he ongoing reality of dowry-related violence is an example of what can happen when women are treated as property. Brides unable to pay the high "price" to marry are punished by violence and often death at the hands of their in-laws or their own husbands.}}

The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] classifies violence against women into three categories: that occurring in the family (DV), that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State. Family violence is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104.

{{quote|Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, '''dowry-related violence''', [[marital rape]], [[female genital mutilation]] and other traditional practices harmful to women, non- spousal violence and violence related to exploitation.}}

Kirti Singh states, "Dowry is widely considered to be both a cause and a consequence of son preference. The practice of dowry inevitably leads to discrimination in different areas against daughters and makes them vulnerable to various forms of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://india.unfpa.org/drive/LawsandSonPreferenceinIndia.pdf|title=Laws and son preference in India: a reality check|last=|first=|date=August 2013|website=|publisher=United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) – India|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313094849/http://india.unfpa.org/drive/LawsandSonPreferenceinIndia.pdf|archive-date=13 March 2014|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh suggests this may lead to girls being unwanted, [[sex selective abortion]], or her parents may abandon or mistreat her after she is born.

'''E-society''' is a society that consists of one or more [[E-community|e-Communities]] involved in the areas ''from [[e-Government]], [[E-democracy|e-Democracy]], and  [[Electronic business|e-Business]] to [[E-learning|e-Learning]] and [[eHealth|e-Health]]'',&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;    that use information and communication technologies ([[Information and communications technology|ICT]]) in order to achieve a common interests and goals. The first areas of e-society that emerged were [[E-learning|e-Learning]] and [[Electronic business|e-Business]].

The development of e-Society is relying and depending on the development of [[virtual reality|virtual reality (VR)]] technologies that insure interaction between participants of an e-Society in a more acceptable and tangible way. The development of [[virtual reality|(VR)]] and consequently the e-Society is based on improvement and balancing of participants’ interaction methods, hardware necessary for such interaction, content presentation and effort required for development and maintenance.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Magoulas, G., Lepouras, G., Vassilakis, C., “Virtual reality in the e-Society”, Springer London, 2007, {{ISSN|1359-4338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Faith Community Nursing''', also known as '''Parish Nursing''', '''Parrish Nursing''', '''Congregational Nursing''' or '''Church Nursing''', is a movement of over 15,000 [[registered nurse]]s, primarily in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nursingworld.org |title=American Nurses Association |publisher=Nursingworld.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also Parish nurses in [[Australia]], the Bahamas, Canada, England, Ghana, India, Kenya, [[Korea]], Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, [[New Zealand]], Nigeria, Palestine, Pakistan, Scotland, Singapore, [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], Ukraine, Wales, Zambia and [[Zimbabwe]].  Faith community nursing is a practice specialty that focuses on the intentional care of the spirit, promotion of an integrative model of health and prevention and minimization of illness within the context of a [[community of faith]]. The intentional integration of the practice of faith with the practice of [[nursing]] so that people can achieve wholeness in, with, and through the population which faith community nurses serve.

Parish nursing began in the mid-1980s in Chicago through the efforts of Rev. Dr. [[Granger E. Westberg|Granger Westberg]] as a reincarnation of the faith community nursing outreach done by religious orders, such as the "Parish Deaconesses" in Europe and America in the 1800s.  Parish nursing is rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition, and the historic practice of professional nursing, and is consistent with the basic assumptions of many faiths that we care for self and others as an expression of God's love. However, it is not only available to Christian congregations.  There are Jewish Congregational Nurses, Muslim Crescent Nurses, and RNs serving in similar capacities within other faith traditions.

Faith Community Nursing (FCN) is recognized as a [[Nursing specialties|specialty nursing practice]]. ''Faith Community Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice'' was approved by the [[American Nurses Association]] in 2005 (and updated in 2012) and define the specialty as "...the specialized practice of professional nursing that focuses on the intentional care of the spirit as part of the process of promoting holistic health and preventing or minimizing illness in a faith community." (American Nurses Association, 2012, Faith Community Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, Silver Springs, MD: Author, p1). The 16 standards of Faith Community Nursing Practice reflect the specialty's professional values and priorities and provide practice directions and the framework for practice evaluation.  Each standard is measurable by a set of specific competencies that serve as evidence of minimal compliance with that standard.

To become a faith community nurse, the registered nurse must have a minimum of 2 years experience, must have a current license in the state where the faith community is located, and have completed a parish nurse foundations course for the specialty practice as recognized by the American Nurses Association.  There are several different curriculum offerings for the faith community nurse which have been developed by a panel of nursing faculty.  These are offered though a partnership with the International Parish Nurse Resource Center (IPNRC) at more than 130 nursing schools and health systems around the US and abroad.

Faith community nurses serve in several roles, including:
•	Health advisor
•	Educator on health issues
•	Visitor of church members at home or in the hospital
•	Provider of referrals to community resources and provide assistance in obtaining needed health services
•	Developer of support groups within the church
•	Trainer and coordinator of volunteers
•	Provider of health screenings

It is important to note that faith community nurses are not expected to provide patient care in the church or at a patient's home but rather to be a source of referrals for services in the community.  They coordinate existing services and supplement them with a holistic dimension of health and caring.
A parish nurse program or faith community nurse program can operate in several different ways.  Models include: 1) one church supporting its own full or part-time nurse, 2) several churches supporting one nurse, 3) a group of volunteer nurses supporting one or several churches or 4) a nurse related to a hospital or clinic who supports a church or churches as part of his or her job.  Of the several thousand faith community nurses, only about 35% in the US are compensated financially for their ministry. In the United States, faith community nurses typically belong to the Health Ministries Association which is the national professional membership organization for faith community nurses.  They also have available the International Parish Nurse Resource Center and the American Nurses Association, among others.

The Caribbean has joined the community of Parish Nursing and Health Care Ministry with the launching of Health Care Ministry in The Bahamas.  It began with an initial course spanning a three-week period and brought together nurses from various denominations who were commissioned on 27 February 2005. Initially, the Canadian and Australian models of Parish Nursing were introduced to The Bahamas as an extension of the Pastoral Care Ministries of Diocese 2000 &amp; Beyond, a programme of the Anglican Diocese of The Bahamas and Turks &amp; Caicos Islands. To date, more than 60 people have been trained and actively engaged in the ministry as either Parish Nurses or Health &amp; Wellness Carers.

Since the ministry began in 2005 it has grown steadily and was known as the Anglican Diocesan Health Care Ministry [Parish Nursing] Council.  However, effective 7 March 2008 the name changed to the Ecumenical Health Care Ministry Council. It is intended that there will be continued training and that the programme will spread throughout the Commonwealth of The Bahamas and the Caribbean.  To this end, the ministry will be recognised by the Bahamas Christian Council and by extension the Caribbean Council of Churches (Ecumenical Health Care Ministry, Bahamas).

A '''Fersommling''' (plural, '''Fersommlinge''') (also spelled '''[https://www.padutchdictionary.com/#d=Versammling Versammling]''' or '''Fersammling''') is a [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] social event in which food is served, speeches are made, and one or more ''g'spiel'' (plays or skits) are performed for entertainment. "A high degree of theatricality and ceremony is involved, especially in the groundhog lodges: pledging loyalty to the lodge and the groundhog, listening to a weather report, singing patriotic songs in [[Pennsylvania German language|Deitsch]], and ending every meeting by asking God to allow them to keep their way of life and their merriment."  as described by William W. Donner.&lt;ref name="Donner William W."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donner|first1=William W.|title=Serious Nonsense|date=2016|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, PA|isbn=978-0-271-07118-3|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these traditions is the singing of the German folk song "[[Schnitzelbank]]"&lt;ref name="Donner William W." /&gt;  and the patriotic "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", in [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]], as translated by [[John Birmelin]]. &lt;ref name="rosenberger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenberger |first=Homer Tope |title=The Pennsylvania Germans: 1891-1965 |location=[[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster, PA]] |publisher=[[Pennsylvania German Society]] |year=1966 |pages=194–199 |oclc=1745108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  " there is continual creativity, as current events are incorporated into the versammling performances, speeches, and skits." &lt;ref name="Donner William W." /&gt; 

Fersommlinge are typically attended by the [[Fancy Dutch]], as opposed to the "Plain sects" of the [[Amish]], [[Church of the Brethren|Brethren]] and [[Mennonites]]. The term literally means "a congregation," not in the sense of a group of church-goers, but as a "social gathering of people." Fersommlinge are not religious functions, though many churches and church groups hosted the events and used them to raise money. The Pennsylvania German [[dialect]] is the only language spoken at the event, and those who speak [[English language|English]] pay a penalty, usually in the form of a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]], [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] or [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]], per word spoken, put into a bowl in the center of the table.&lt;ref name="rosenberger"/&gt;  

The first Fersommling was held by Dr. John I. Woodruff of [[Susquehanna University]] in 1933.&lt;ref name="rosenberger"/&gt;  Shortly afterward, on March 13, 1933, a second was held in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Pennsylvania]] at the home of [[William S. Troxell]], who wrote a daily [[Column (newspaper)|column]] on Pennsylvania German [[culture]] for the Allentown ''[[The Morning Call|Morning Call]]'' under the [[pseudonym]] "Pumpernickle Bill."  The purpose of the gathering was to plan the formation of the first [[Grundsow Lodge|Grundsow (Groundhog) Lodge]]. On the next [[Groundhog day|Groundhog Day]], February 2, 1934, the first Fersommling of Grundsow Lodge Nummer Ains an Da Lechaw (Number One on the Lehigh) took place in [[Northampton, Pennsylvania|Northampton]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kutztown.edu/community/pgchc/grundsau%20lodge%202007%20june.pdf |last=Miller |first=Richard K. |title=Pennsylvania German Groundhog Lodges |date=June 2007 |publisher=Pennsylvania German Cultural Heritage Center, [[Kutztown University of Pennsylvania|Kutztown University]] ([[Kutztown, Pennsylvania|Kutztown, PA]]) |pages=1 |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2008-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010101745/http://www.kutztown.edu/community/pgchc/grundsau%20lodge%202007%20june.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kutztown.edu/community/pgchc/News/Pdf/news005fall1994.pdf |last=Shupp |first=Col.

Fersommlinge continue to be held throughout eastern Pennsylvania as a means of preserving the Pennsylvania German dialect and culture. For example, the [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] Fersommling, which started in 1937, annually attracts more than 700 participants, most of whom are of Pennsylvania German [[ancestor|ancestry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drum.umd.edu/dspace/bitstream/1903/8029/1/umi-umd-5164.pdf |title=Current Trends of Dialect Preservation through Musical Performance in the Pennsylvania German Community of Southeastern Pennsylvania |last=Yadush |first=Chantel Lynn |year=2008 |publisher=[[University of Maryland, College Park]] ([[College Park, Maryland|College Park, MD]]) |pages=55 |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2008-07-09 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Devlin |first=Ron |url=http://readingeagle.com/Article.aspx?id=30412 |title=Dialect spoken, and that's no tripe |publisher=''[[Reading Eagle]]'' ([[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading PA]]) |date=April 16, 2007 |accessdate=2008-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427203627/http://www.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=30412 |archivedate=April 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, some of the texts presented at Fersommlinge are also published in the Pennsylvania German newspaper [[Hiwwe wie Driwwe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5481">'''Figure and ground''' is a concept drawn from [[Gestalt psychology]] by [[media studies|media theorist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] in the early 1970s. This concept underpins the meaning of his famous phrase, "[[The medium is the message]]". The concept was an approach to what was called "perceptual organization." He began to use the terms figure and ground as a way "to describe the parts of a situation&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cios.org/encyclopedia/mcluhan/probe/fg/probe_fg.html|title=CIOS/McLuhan Site: Probe: Figure &amp; Ground|website=www.cios.org|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;" and "to help explain his ideas about media and human communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" The concept was later employed to explain how a communications technology, the medium or ''figure'', necessarily operates through its context, or ''ground''.

To McLuhan, "‘figure’ refers to something that jumps out at us, something that grabs our attention, [whereas] ‘ground’ refers to something that supports or contextualizes a situation and is usually an area of unattention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" When we first experience a new image or sensation, there are certain aspects of the object that grab our attention and engage us and certain aspects that we unintentionally ignore. We should not focus on just the "figure" or the "ground" though, as McLuhan believed that both were equally as important to understanding the full meaning of the situation. "This distinction between that which is perceived and that which is blocked out in order to focus perception is central for McLuhan.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://felix.openflows.com/html/mcluhan_latour.html|title=Felix Stalder: McLuhan and Latour|website=felix.openflows.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

McLuhan used different words to describe the figure/ground relationship, sometimes using content for figure and environment or, more often, medium for ground.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

"McLuhan looked at media through a figure/ground relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" To him, people tended to focus on only specific parts of the media, and disregard other parts. "To examine the total effect of any medium, McLuhan pointed out that we need to look at both figure AND ground, and their relationship to one another.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" He believed that "only focusing on the ‘content’ of the media was like looking at figures without examining their ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" "The ground, or environment, is not a passive container, but active processes that influence the relationships between all of the elements in it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;"

McLuhan believed that to fully grasp the impact of a new technology in regard to figure (medium) and ground (context),&lt;ref name="LAC"&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/innis-mcluhan/ Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; one must understand that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Neither piece is definitive without the other. His ''[[Understanding Media]]'' explores different grounds as they are structured by different media including print, radio, and television.

[[Al Held]], a well-known artist, exemplifies this idea in one of his paintings. The work is called The Big N and it "provides us with an introduction to the concepts of figure and ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" Looking at a glance, you might draw your attention to the black triangles. "Once you were given the name of the painting, however, the frame became linked to the figures, and an 'N' suddenly appeared.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" In understanding the work, it is important to look at the bigger picture. Al Held’s painting is well-known for its display of framing, or context, and its importance to the meaning of the overall situation. If either the frame or the painting itself were to change, the interpretation of the work might shift. Pertaining to media, we must look at both the figure and the ground to "understand [its] effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" The ground which media creates gives a context for human communication, and thus "directs human action in unique and important ways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;"

McLuhan argued that we must study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to those technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in turn, further shapes societies and individuals.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

Furthermore, all technologies have embedded within them their own assumptions about [[Time- and space-bias|time and space]]. Again, the message conveyed by the medium can only be understood if the medium is concurrently analyzed with the environment in which it is used — and which, simultaneously, it effectively creates. McLuhan believed that an examination of the figure-ground relationship can offer a critical commentary on culture and society.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

Alternately, the idea of "figure" can also refer to content of a particular medium, while "ground" refers to the medium itself. McLuhan's aphorism "[[The medium is the message]]" can thus be read as an attempt to draw attention away from a preoccupation with the figure/message to a consideration of the importance of the ground/medium.

'''Force-field analysis''' is a development in social science. It provides a framework for looking at the factors (''forces'') that influence a situation, originally social situations. It looks at forces that are either driving movement toward a goal (helping forces) or blocking movement toward a goal (hindering forces). The principle, developed by [[Kurt Lewin]], is a significant contribution to the fields of [[social science]], [[psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[community psychology]], [[Communication studies|communication]], [[organizational development]], [[process management]], and [[change management]].

Lewin, a social psychologist, believed the "field" to be a [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] psychological environment existing in an individual's (or in the collective group) mind at a certain point in time that can be mathematically described in a [[topological]] constellation of constructs. The "field" is very dynamic, changing with time and experience. When fully constructed, an individual's "field" (Lewin used the term "life space") describes that person's motives, values, needs, moods, goals, anxieties, and ideals. 

Lewin believed that changes of an individual's "life space" depend upon that individual's internalization of external stimuli (from the physical and social world) into the "life space". Although Lewin did not use the word "experiential" (see [[experiential learning]]), he nonetheless believed that interaction (experience) of the "life space" with "external stimuli" (at what he calls the "boundary zone") were important for development (or regression). For Lewin, development (or regression) of an individual occurs when their "life space" has a "boundary zone" experience with external stimuli. Note, it is not merely the experience that causes change in the "life space", but the acceptance (internalization) of external stimuli.

Lewin took these same principles and applied them to the analysis of [[group conflict]], [[learning]], [[adolescence]], [[hatred]], [[morale]], German society, etc. This approach allowed him to break down common misconceptions of these social phenomena, and to determine their basic elemental constructs. He used theory, mathematics, and common sense to define a force field, and hence to determine the causes of human and group behavior.

'''''Future Shock''''' is a 1970 book by the [[futurist|futurists]] [[Alvin Toffler|Alvin and Heidi Toffler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alvin Toffler: still shocking after all these years - Interview|journal=New Scientist|date=19 March 1994|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14119173-500-alvin-toffler-still-shocking-after-all-these-years/}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the authors define the term "''future shock''" as a certain psychological state of individuals and entire societies. Their shortest definition for the term is a personal [[perception]] of "too much change in too short a period of time". The book, which became an international bestseller, grew out of an article "The Future as a Way of Life" in [[Horizon (U.S. magazine)|''Horizon'' magazine]], Summer 1965 issue.&lt;ref&gt;Toffler, Alvin, "The Future as a Way of Life", Horizon magazine, Summer 1965, Vol VII, Num 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://notearama.blogspot.com.au/2013/09/horizon-magazine-hardcover-issues-1959.html "Horizon Magazine hardcover issues 1959 – 1977 table of contents"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhart, Mary, [http://www.yoyow.com/marye/tofflers94.html "Alvin And Heidi Toffler: Surfing The Third Wave: On Life And Work In The Information Age"], MicroTimes #118, January 3, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/toffler.php "Alvin Toffler: still shocking after all these years: New Scientist meets the controversial futurologist"], [[New Scientist]], 19 March 1994, pp. 22–25. "What led you to write Future Shock? – While covering Congress, it occurred to us that big technological and social changes were occurring in the United States, but that the political system seemed totally blind to their existence. Between 1955 and 1960, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] was introduced, television became universalized, commercial jet travel came into being and a whole raft of other technological events occurred. Having spent several years watching the political process, we came away feeling that 99 per cent of what politicians do is keep systems running that were laid in place by previous generations of politicians. Our ideas came together in 1965 in an article called 'The future as a way of life', which argued that change was going to accelerate and that the speed of change could induce disorientation in lots of people. We coined the phrase 'future shock' as an analogy to the concept of culture shock. With future shock you stay in one place but your own culture changes so rapidly that it has the same disorienting effect as going to another culture"&lt;/ref&gt; The book has sold over 6 million copies and has been widely translated.

A [[Future Shock (film)|documentary film]] based on the book was released in 1972 with [[Orson Welles]] as on-screen narrator.

==Term==
The Tofflers argued that society is undergoing an enormous structural change, a revolution from an [[industrial society]] to a "[[super-industrial society]]". This change overwhelms people. He believed the accelerated rate of technological and social change left people disconnected and suffering from "shattering stress and disorientation"—future shocked. The Tofflers stated that the majority of social problems are symptoms of future shock. In their discussion of the components of such shock, they popularized the term "''[[information overload]]''."

This analysis of the phenomenon of information overload is continued in later publications, especially ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'' and ''[[Powershift: Knowledge, Wealth and Violence at the Edge of the 21st Century|Powershift]]''.

In the introduction to an essay entitled "Future Shock" in his book, ''Conscientious Objections'', [[Neil Postman]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Sometime about the middle of 1963, my colleague Charles Weingartner and I delivered in tandem an address to the [[National Council of Teachers of English]]. In that address we used the phrase "future shock" as a way of describing the social paralysis induced by rapid technological change. To my knowledge, Weingartner and I were the first people ever to use it in a public forum. Of course, neither Weingartner nor I had the brains to write a book called ''Future Shock'', and all due credit goes to [[Alvin Toffler]] for having recognized a good phrase when one came along" (p.&amp;nbsp;162).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Development of society and production==
[[Alvin Toffler|Alvin and Heidi]] distinguished three stages in development of society and production: agrarian, industrial and post-industrial.

All these waves develops own "super-ideology” with which explain the reality. This ideology affects all the spheres which make up a civilization phase: technology, social patterns, information patterns and "power" patterns.

The first stage began in the period of the [[Neolithic]] Era when people invented [[agriculture]], thereby passing from [[Barbarian|barbarity]] to a [[civilization]]. A large number of people acted as [[prosumers]] (eating their grown food, hunting animals, building their own houses, making clothes,....). People traded by exchanging their own goods for commodities of others. The second stage began in England with the Industrial Revolution during which people invented the [[machine tool]] and the [[steam engine]]. People worked in factories to make money they could spend on goods they needed (it means they produced for exchange, not for use). Countries also created new social systems. The third stage began in the second half of the 20th century in the West when people invented automatic production, robotics and the [[computer]]. The [[services sector]] attained great value. 

The Tofflers proposed one criterion for distinguishing between [[industrial society]] and [[post-industrial society]]: the share of the [[population]]  occupied in agriculture versus the share of city labor occupied in the services sector.  In a post-industrial society, the share of the people occupied in agriculture does not exceed 15%, and the share of city laborers occupied in the services sector exceeds 50%. Thus, the share of the people occupied with brainwork greatly exceeds the share of the people occupied with physical work in post-industrial society.

[[Third Wave Democracy|The third wave]] led to the [[Information Era]] (now). Homes are the dominant institutions. Most people carry on their own production and consumption in their homes or electronic cottages, they produce more of their own products and services and markets become less important for them. People consider each other to be equally free as vendors of prosumer-generated commodities.

==Fear of the future==
[[File:ChryslerBuildingMidtownManhattanNewYorkCity.jpg|thumb|[[Midtown Manhattan]] in New York City, the largest central business district in the United States]]
Alvin and Heidi Toffler's main thought consists of the fact that modern man feels shock from rapid changes. For example, Toffler's daughter went to shop in [[New York City]] and she couldn't find a shop in its previous location. Thus New York has become a city without a [[history]]. The urban population doubles every 11 years. The overall production of goods and services doubles each 50 years in developed countries. Society experiences an increasing number of changes with an increasing rapidity, while people are losing the familiarity that old institutions ([[religion]], [[family]], [[national identity]], [[profession]]) once provided. The so-called "[[brain drain]]" – the [[emigration]] of European scientists to the United States – is both an indicator of the changes in society and also one of their causes.

==Features of post-industrial society==
[[File:100 Yen lighter.JPG|thumb|A generic, disposable lighter.]]
*Many goods have become [[disposable]] as the cost of manual repair or cleaning has become greater than the cost of making new goods due to [[mass production]]. Examples of disposable goods include [[ballpoint pen]]s, [[lighter]]s, [[plastic bottle]]s, and [[paper towels]].
*The design of goods becomes outdated quickly. (And so, for example, a second generation of computers appears before the end of the [[service life|expected period of usability]] of the first generation). It is possible to rent almost everything (from a ladder to a wedding dress), thus eliminating the need for ownership.
*Whole branches of [[industry]] die off and new branches of industry arise. This affects unskilled workers who are compelled to change their residence to find new jobs. The constant change in the [[Market (economics)|market]] also poses a problem for advertisers who must deal with moving targets.
*People of post-industrial society change their profession and their workplace often. People have to change professions because professions quickly become outdated.  People of post-industrial society thus have many [[career]]s in a lifetime. The knowledge of an [[engineer]] becomes outdated in ten years. People look more and more for temporary jobs.
*To follow transient jobs, people have become [[nomad]]s. For example, immigrants from [[Algeria]], [[Turkey]] and other countries go to Europe to find work. Transient people are forced to change residence, phone number, [[school]], friends, car license, and contact with [[family]] often. As a result, relationships tend to be superficial with a large number of people, instead of being intimate or close relationships that are more stable. Evidence for this is tourist travel and holiday romances.
*The [[driver's license]], received at age 16, has become the [[teenager]]'s admission to the world of adults, because it symbolizes the ability to move independently.
*Death of Permanence. The post industrial society will be marked by a transient culture where everything ranging from goods to human relationships will be temporary.

==In popular culture==
[[Curtis Mayfield]]'s song "[[Future Shock (Curtis Mayfield song)|Future Shock]]" on the album "[[Back to the World (Curtis Mayfield album)|Back to the World]]" took its name from this book, and was in turn covered by [[Herbie Hancock]] as the title track for his 1983 recording ''[[Future Shock (Herbie Hancock album)|Future Shock]]''. That album was considered groundbreaking for fusing [[jazz]] and [[funk]] with [[electronic music]]. [[Stanley Clarke]] performed a song with the same title on his 1984 album [[Time Exposure (Stanley Clarke album)|Time Exposure]]. The rock band, BANG released "Future Shock" on their self titled Capitol Records release in 1972

In the 1974 movie ''[[The Parallax View]]'' the character Joe relates a story to Lee about a wife having an affair with her psychiatrist and then a bulldozer knocking down his house by calling it ''future shock''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.subzin.com/quotes/M6928efb3/The+Parallax+View/That%27s+future+shock%2C+Lee |title=Movie Quotes. The Parallax View |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=subzin.com |publisher= |access-date=August 30, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works taking their title from the book include: the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Future Stock]]"; [[Bailter Space|The Gordons]] 1981 EP on [[Flying Nun Records]]; a segment on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' starring [[Samantha Bee]]; Kevin Goldstein's recurring column on the ''[[Baseball Prospectus]]'' website; a ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' pre-constructed deck; and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]'s [[Starrcade (1989)|1989 Starrcade]] event.

Since 1977, UK Comic [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]] has run a series of short stories called [[Future Shocks]] based on this concept, some of which were written by [[Alan Moore]]. The abbreviated derogatory term ''Futsies'' was applied to citizens in 2000 AD stories (mainly in the [[Judge Dredd]] universe) who had been driven insane by Future Shock.

Works deriving themes and elements from Future Shock include the science fiction novels ''[[The Forever War]]'' (1974) by [[Joe Haldeman]], ''[[The Shockwave Rider]]'' (1975) by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], the [[role-playing game|RPG]] ''[[Transhuman Space]]'' (2002) by [[Steve Jackson Games]], and the [[indie RPG]] ''[[Shock: Social Science Fiction]]'' (2006) by designer [[Joshua A.C. Newman]]. [[Experimental music|Experimental]] music group [[Death Grips]] use the lyric "Culture shock, future shock, fuck yourself, choke yourself" in their song "[[Exmilitary|Culture Shock]]".

The line ''You knocked a '''future shock''' crowbar upside my head'' occurs in the track "The Outsiders" on the alternative rock band [[R.E.M.]]'s 2004 album ''[[Around the Sun]]''.

In 2011, a song titled "Future Shock" by Darwin, Obie, and Mr-E appeared on the album ''Nu Nrg 100'', the final installment of the world-renowned label Nu Energy, while Brooklyn-based band [[TV on the Radio]] included a song titled "No Future Shock" on their album ''[[Nine Types of Light]]''. The same year, the [[Unsound Festival|Unsound Music Festival]] in [[Krakow, Poland]] took the concept of 'future shock' as its theme.

[[William Brittelle]], the Brooklyn-based composer of pop-influenced electro-acoustic art music, has an album called "Future Shock".

The sense of future shock is an integral aspect of [[cyberpunk]].

Futureshock were also an electronic music duo recording for Junior Boys Own and Parlophone / EMI. The members were Phil Dockerty and Alex Tepper.

The Future Shock Book was lying on the deceased Wendell Armbruster Sr.'s desk in the 1972 movie [[Avanti!]] starring [[Jack Lemmon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5208">'''Global civics''' suggests to understand [[civics]] in a global sense as a [[social contract]] among all [[world citizen]]s in an age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=2010-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advocates of the notion attempt to demonstrate that it is possible to imagine global civics. According to this notion, in an increasingly interdependent world, the [[world citizen]]s need a compass that would frame mindsets on a global scale, and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility related to specific world issues such as environmental problems and nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary? Feasible?| journal = Global Policy| date = June 2010| url = http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/articles/international-law-and-human-rights/global-civics-necessary-feasible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==

The term '''global civics''' was first coined by Hakan Altinay, a nonresident senior fellow with the Global Economy and Development program at the [[Brookings Institution]], in a working paper published in March 2010. The concept builds upon the basic tenets behind [[global ethics]], [[global justice]] and [[world citizenship]], inviting everyone to question their increasingly important role in a highly interdependent world. In early 2011, Altinay published ''Global Civics: Responsibilities and Rights in an Interdependent World,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title =Global Civics: Rights and Responsibilities in an Interdependent World| last=Altinay| first=Hakan| year = 2011 | publisher= Brookings Institution Press | location= Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book of articles on global civics put forth by academics and intellectuals all around the world.

==Objections to the concept==
Opponents of the global civics concept argue that even a modest level of exercising responsibility towards all the people living in the world is so overwhelming and nearly impossible to achieve. These arguments also posit that [[civics]] assumes an effective state and enforcement. The claim goes that since there is no such thing as a [[world government]], global civics implementation is not feasible. Also, it has been suggested that superpowers of the world are selfish and dangerous nations, and that they do not feel constrained by international legitimacy and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dangerous Nations|last= Kagan|first= Robert|year= 2006 | publisher= Alfred A. Knopf | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the critics claim that any experience of pan-global solidarity among human beings cannot form the basis of constellation of rights and responsibilities as it is nascent at best and the experience of being a global citizen is a privilege restricted to international elites and a few activists.&lt;ref name = feasible/&gt;

==The role of universities==

The proponents of global civics also suggest that university campuses play a vital role in spreading a thorough understanding of how today's global world functions and contributes toward preparation of future generations for life in an interdependent world. This view calls for visionary universities that could successfully "provide their students with the forums and the tools to discuss and figure out what their responsibilities are to their fellow human beings." &lt;ref name = case/&gt;

It develops and offers training for sexual assault and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The method teaches students to intervene by using the 3 D's: Direct, Delegating the responsibility to others, and creating a Distraction to defuse a potentially dangerous situation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As described by Green Dot an example of this is in a situation at a party, intervening could mean that instead of calling out an inebriated student, an individual can create a distraction by "accidentally" spilling their drink on a potential aggressor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Dr. Dorothy Edwards is the founder of the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program. Prior to creating the program Dorothy Edwards worked as the [[University of Kentucky student life|University of Kentucky's]] Violence Intervention and Prevention Director where she discovered that individuals were not sure how to respond when witnessing a potential [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In her first year of running the program she trained 10 individuals, but by the time she left the [[University of Kentucky]] she was training 3,500 students and volunteers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The initiative led by Dr. Edwards was supported by a new focus on [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault|bystanders in The White House]]. Green Dot, Bringing in the Bystander, and [[Futures Without Violence|Coaching Boys Into Men]] are preventative bystander programs that have begun to make cultural changes.

=== Title IX ===
[[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972|1972 Education Amendment]] is a tool meant to combat campus violence. The law requires colleges and universities to fight [[gender-based violence]], [[harassment]], and respond to the needs of survivors promoting equal educational access.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;"Title IX in Detail."

=== Sexual assault in education ===
[[Sexual violence]] in schools and on campuses is a pressing civil rights issue.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; According to the National Women's Law Center students who suffer from [[sexual assault]] and [[harassment]] are deprived the liberty of equal education.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; A majority of sexual assaults involving college students also involve drugs and alcohol.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  A female or male who is incapacitated due to drugs and alcohol is legally incapable of giving consent and someone who has sex with an incapacitated person can be prosecuted for [[rape]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Purpose ==
The goal of Green Dot is to implement a [[bystander intervention]] strategy that prevents and reduces power-based personal violence.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Cherkis, Jason, and Ryan Grim.

== Training  ==
Green Dot develops programs, strategies, curriculum, and training courses designed to address power-based personal violence across environments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Training strategies include: strategic planning, bystander mobilization, communication, and [[Coalition|coalition building]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;"Green Dot Faculty &amp; Staff Toolkit."

''Green Dot Etcetera''. Green Dot Etcetera Inc, 2010. Web. https://www.livethegreendot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Dot bystander program uses four training modules to educate bystanders on their impact. 
# The first module provides bystanders with an overview of the strategy, where key definitions and strategies are discussed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"An Overview of the Green Dot Strategy." ''California Coalition Against Sexual Assault (CALCASA)''. California Coalition Against Sexual Assault. Web. http://www.calcasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Curriculum-Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
# The second module  reviews the observable behaviors associated with the major forms of power-based violence and educates about how to recognize potential dangerous or harmful situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
# Module three educates bystanders on obstacles within themselves that stop them from intervening. 
#* There are three major categories of influence it uses:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
#** The categories are personal, relationship, and general issues, which impact the way in which individuals intervene.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Personal characteristics may include being shy, fearful, or uncertain and not wanting to risk embarrassment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Relationship characteristics involve not wanting to upset friends or a party policer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; General issues include the belief that someone else will intervene, the risk of embarrassment, or creating a scene.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Module four focuses on building skills and generating confidence in the performance of the program. 
#* There are two types of Green Dots: proactive and reactive. The goal of proactive Green Dots is to set the two norms that are communicated: violence will not be tolerated and everyone is expected to do his or her part to contribute to fostering a safe community. Reactive Green Dots are done in reaction to seeing concerning behavior or potential dangers, either to stop them from happening or decrease the likelihood they will get worse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The heart of the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program are the 3 D's: direct,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; distract,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and delegate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Direct interaction with the potential perpetrator or victim can be used to address concern.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Through Distraction a [[wikt:bystander|bystander]] can create a diversion to diffuse the potentially problematic  situation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Lastly, through delegation a bystander can ask for someone else to help intervene in the situation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The 3 D's work in situations of high risk to act as reactive Green Dots.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Examples of proactive Green Dots are creating social media campaigns, checking-in with friends, promoting awareness, and hosting green dot sports games.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Examples of reactive Green Dots include: ''directly'' confronting a situation, ''distracting'' by changing the conversation and the energy of the interaction or by distracting the individuals, or ''delegating'' by finding someone who will be more successful in fixing the problem (bar tender, other friends, police offer, etc.)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Case studies ===

Ann Coker at the [[University of Kentucky|University of Kentucky's Center for Research on Violence Against Women]] (CRVAW) led a study pertaining to the effectiveness at Green Dots' reduction of sexual violence. In the study, CRVAW found a greater than 50% reduction in the self-reported frequency of [[Sexual violence|sexual violence perpetration]] by students at schools that received Green Dot training.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hautala, Keith. "'Green Dot' Effective at Reducing Sexual Violence." ''University of Kentucky News: UKNOW''. College of Arts and Sciences, 10 Sept. 2014. Web. http://uknow.uky.edu/content/green-dot-effective-reducing-sexual-violence&lt;/ref&gt; The CRVAW study also found a 40% reduction in self-reported frequency of total violence perpetration including [[sexual violence]], [[sexual harassment]], [[stalking]], and [[dating violence]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Ann Coker, and the CRVAW team identify violence prevention as a public health priority.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A recent study of 2,504 college undergraduate students between 18 and 24 looked at the impact of bystander intervention on college campuses. The study found that 46% of the students surveyed had heard a Green Dot speech on their college campus. Out of the sample size surveyed, only 14% had received active bystander training in the past two years. Students trained in Green Dot bystander intervention reported engaging in significantly more bystander behaviors and observing more self-reported active bystander behaviors compared to non-trained students. Those receiving bystander intervention training appeared to report more active bystander behaviors than those simply hearing a Green Dot speech, and both intervention groups reported more observed and active bystander behaviors than non-exposed students.&lt;ref&gt;Coker, A. L., P. G. Cook-Craig, C. M. Williams, B. S. Fisher, E. R. Clear, L. S. Garcia, and L. M. Hegge.

== Ancient Near East ==
{{see also|Sacred prostitution}}
The [[Ancient Near East]] was home to many shrines, temples or "houses of heaven," which were dedicated to various deities. These shrines and temples were documented by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Aabo%3Atlg%2C0016%2C001&amp;query=book%3D1%3Achapter%3D199%3Asection%3D1 1.199], tr A.D. Godley (1920)&lt;/ref&gt; where [[sacred prostitution]] was a common practice.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,  [[James Frazer]] (1922), ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', 3e, [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sumeria]]n records dating back to ca. 2400 [[Common Era|BCE]] are the earliest recorded mention of prostitution as an occupation. These describe a [[temple]]-[[brothel]] operated by Sumerian priests in the city of [[Uruk]]. This ''kakum'' or temple was dedicated to the goddess [[Ishtar]] and was the home to three grades of women. The first grade of women were only permitted to perform sexual rituals in the temple, the second group had access to the grounds and catered to visitors, and the third and lowest class lived on the temple grounds. The third class was also free to find customers in the streets.

During the region of [[Canaan]], a significant portion of temple prostitutes were male. This was also widely practiced in [[Sardinia]] and in some of the [[Phoenicia]]n cultures, usually in honor of the goddess [[`Ashtart|Ashtart]]. Presumably under the influence of the Phoenicians,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} this practice was developed in other ports of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], such as [[Erice]] ([[Sicily]]), [[Locri|Locri Epizephiri]], [[Crotone|Croton]], Rossano Vaglio and Sicca Veneria. Other hypotheses include [[Asia Minor]], [[Lydia]], [[Syria]] and the Etruscans.

In later years sacred prostitution and similar classifications for females were known to have existed in Greece, Rome, India, China, and Japan.{{sfn|Murphy|1983|}} Such practices came to an end when the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in the fourth century AD destroyed the [[goddess]] temples and replaced the religious practices with [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Life of Constantine'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lv.html 3.55] and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lviii.html 3.58]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical references ==
Prostitution was commonplace in [[ancient Israel]]. There are a number of references to prostitution in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The Biblical story of [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|38:14-26|HE}}) provides a depiction of prostitution being practiced in that time period. In this story the prostitute waits at the side of a highway where she waits for travelers. She covers her face in order to identify herself as a prostitute. Instead of being paid in money she asks for a kid goat. This would have been the equivalent of a high price, showing that only the wealthy owner of numerous herds could have afforded to pay for a single sexual encounter. Under this system if the traveller does not have his cattle with him he must give valuables to the woman as a deposit until a kid goat is delivered to her. The woman in the story was not a legitimate prostitute but actually was Judah's widowed daughter-in-law, who sought to trick Judah into impregnating her. However, since she succeeded in impersonating a prostitute her conduct can be assumed to accurately represent the behaviour of a prostitute in society during that time period.

In a later Biblical story, found in the [[Book of Joshua]], a prostitute in [[Jericho]] named [[Rahab]] assisted Israelite spies by providing them with information regarding the current socio-cultural and military situation. [[Rahab]] was knowledgeable in these matters because of her popularity with the high-ranking nobles. The Israelite spies, in return for this information, promised to save her and her family during the planned military invasion, only if she kept the details of her contact with them a secret. She would leave a sign on her residence that indicated to the advancing soldiers not to attack the people within. When the people of Israel conquered Canaan, she converted to Judaism and married a prominent member of the people.

In the [[Book of Revelation]], the [[Whore of Babylon]] is named "Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and Abominations of the Earth". However the word "whore" could also be translated as "Idolatress". The first Babylonian prostitute was in a place called Hinchinopolises, which arose from the appraised Hinchin family. At the time Hinchinapolis was the center of attraction for all travelers who came to rest in the company of the family's women, who perfected the art of satisfaction. Some ancient scrolls could tell us that the meaning of Hinchin came from the Hebrew ''Hinam'', meaning free, because the males of the family would offer themselves for free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G4204 πόρνη]: From Greek.

==Aztecs and Incas==
Among the [[Aztecs]], the [[Cihuacalli]] was the name given to the controlled buildings where prostitution was permitted by political and religious authorities.  Cihuacalli is a Nahuatl word which means House of Women. The Cihuacalli was a closed compound with rooms, all looking over a central patio. At the center of the patio was a statue of [[Tlazolteotl]], the goddess of purification, steam baths, midwives, filth and a patroness of adulterers. Religious authorities believed women should work as prostitutes, if they wish, only at such premises guarded by Tlazolteotl. It was believed that Tlazolteotl had the power to incite sexual activity, while cleansing the spirit of such acts. Bernal Díaz described numerous male prostitutes among the Aztecs, as well as unmarried temple priests engaging in sodomy.{{sfn|Neill|2011|p=26}}

Inca prostitutes were segregated from other people and lived under the supervision of a government agent.{{sfn|Bruhns|Stothert|1999|p=156}}

==Greece==
{{see also|Prostitution in ancient Greece}}
[[File:Griechen31.png|thumb|Customer and a prostitute illustrated on an [[ancient Greek]] [[Kylix (drinking cup)|wine cup]]]]
In ancient Greece, both women and boys engaged in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/culture-of-love/a-brief-cultural-history-of-sex-938527.html |title=A brief cultural history of sex |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word for prostitute is ''porne'' (Gr: πόρνη), derived from the verb ''pernemi'' (to sell). The English word ''[[pornography]]'', and its corollaries in other languages, are directly derivative of the Greek word ''pornē'' (Gr: πόρνη).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=porn&amp;lang=greek List of Greek words starting with πορν- (''porn-'')], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; Female prostitutes could be independent and sometimes influential women. They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek ''[[hetaera]]'' and the Japanese ''[[oiran]]'', complex figures that are perhaps in an intermediate position between prostitution and [[courtisanerie]]. (See also the Indian [[tawaif]].) Some prostitutes in ancient Greece, such as [[Lais of Corinth|Lais]] were as famous for their company as their [[beauty]], and some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services.

[[Solon]] instituted the first of Athens' brothels (''oik'iskoi'') in the sixth century BC, and with the earnings of this business he built a temple dedicated to [[Aphrodite Pandemos]], goddess of sexual pleasure. Procuring, however, was severely forbidden. In [[Cyprus]] (Paphus) and in [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], a type of [[religious prostitution]] was practiced where the temple counted more than a thousand prostitutes (''hierodules'', Gr: ιερόδουλες), according to [[Strabo]].

Each specialized category had its proper name, so there were the ''chamaitypa'i'', working outdoor (lie-down), the ''perepatetikes'' who met their customers while walking (and then worked in their houses), and the ''gephyrides'', who worked near the bridges. In the fifth century, Ateneo informs us that the price was 1 ''obole'', a sixth of a drachma and the equivalent of an ordinary worker's day salary. The rare pictures describe that [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] was performed on beds with covers and pillows, while [[triclinia]] usually didn't have these accessories.

Male prostitution was also common in Greece. Adolescent boys usually practiced it, a reflection of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic]] custom of the time. Slave boys worked the male brothels in Athens, while free boys who sold their favours risked losing their political rights as adults.

==Ancient Rome==
[[File:Pompeii-wall painting.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] from the [[Pompeii]] brothel]]
&lt;span id="RomeTV"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{{see also|Prostitution in ancient Rome}}
Prostitution in ancient Rome was legal, public and widespread. Even [[Social class in ancient Rome|Roman men of the highest social status]] were free to engage prostitutes of either sex without incurring moral disapproval,{{sfn|Dillon|Garland|2005|p=382}} as long as they demonstrated self-control and moderation in the frequency and enjoyment of sex. [[Latin literature]] also often refers to prostitutes. Real-world practices are documented by provisions of [[Roman law]] that regulate prostitution. [[epigraphy|Inscriptions]], especially graffiti from [[Pompeii]], uncover the practice of prostitution in Ancient Rome. Some large brothels in the fourth century, when Rome was becoming Christianized, seem to have been counted as tourist attractions and were possibly state-owned.{{sfn|McGinn|2004|pp=167–168}} Prostitutes played a role in several [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious observances]], mainly in the month of April, over which the love and fertility goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] presided. While prostitution was so widely accepted, prostitutes were often considered shameful. Most were [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] or former slaves, or if free by birth relegated to the ''[[infamia|infames]]'', people lacking in social standing and deprived of the protections that most [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] under Roman law received.{{sfn|Edwards|1997|p=66 ''et passim''}} Prostitution thus reflects the ambivalent attitudes of Romans toward [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|pleasure]] and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|sexuality]].{{sfn|Edwards|1997|pp=67, 83}}

A registered prostitute was called a [[meretrix]] while the unregistered one fell under the broad category ''prostibulae''. There were some similarities between the Ancient Roman and Greek system, but as the Empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign [[slavery|slaves]], captured, purchased or raised for the purpose of prostitution. This was sometimes done by large-scale "prostitute farmers" where  [[child abandonment|abandoned children]] were raised, and almost always raised to become prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Justin Martyr |authorlink1=First Apology |title=CHURCH FATHERS: The First Apology (St. Justin Martyr) |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm |website=www.newadvent.org |accessdate=28 August 2018 |quote="But as for us, we have been taught that to expose newly-born children is the part of wicked men; and this we have been taught lest we should do any one an injury, and lest we should sin against God, first, because we see that almost all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the males) are brought up to prostitution."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a male aristocrat.

{{further|Prostitution in India}}
Scholars have studied the history of prostitution in India from ancient times to the present.{{sfn|Simha|Bose|2003| }}

A [[tawaif]] was a [[courtesan]] who catered to the nobility of [[South Asia]], particularly during the era of the [[Mughal Empire]]. These courtesans would dance, sing, recite poetry and entertain their suitors at [[mehfil]]s. Like the [[geisha]] tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests. While sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. The most popular or highest-class tawaifs could often pick and choose between the best of their suitors. They contributed to music, dance, theatre, film and the [[Urdu]] literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/08/11/stories/2004081101090100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Mapping cultures | date=August 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[devadasi]] originally described a [[Hindu]] religious practice in which girls were married and dedicated to a deity ([[deva (Hinduism)|deva]] or [[devi]]). They were in charge of taking care of the temple, performing rituals they learned and practicing [[Bharatanatyam]] and other classical Indian arts traditions. This status allowed them to enjoy a high social status. The popularity of devadasis seems to have reached its pinnacle around the 10th and 11th centuries. The rise and fall in the status of devadasis can be seen to be running parallel to the rise and fall of Hindu temples. Due to the destruction of temples by Islamic invaders, the status of the temples fell very quickly in [[North India]] and slowly in [[South India]].

During the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was initially fairly common for British soldiers to engage in inter-ethnic [[prostitution in India]], where they would frequently visit local Indian ''[[nautch]]'' dancers.&lt;ref name=Fisher-2007&gt;{{citation|title=Excluding and Including "Natives of India": Early-Nineteenth-Century British-Indian Race Relations in Britain|first=Michael H.|last=Fisher|journal=Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East|volume=27|issue=2|year=2007|pages=303–314 [304–05]|doi=10.1215/1089201x-2007-007|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As British females began arriving in British India in large numbers from the early to mid-19th century, it became increasingly uncommon for British soldiers to visit Indian prostitutes, and [[miscegenation]] was despised altogether after the events of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].{{sfn|Beckman|2003|pp=31–33}}

===Muslims===
In the seventh century, the prophet [[Muhammad]] declared that prostitution is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement|url=http://cmje.usc.edu/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/012-sat.php#012.2304|website=cmje.usc.edu|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], prostitution is considered a sin, and Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari is attributed with saying, "Allah's Apostle forbade taking the price of a dog, money earned by prostitution and the earnings of a soothsayer." ({{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|439}}) However, [[sexual slavery]] was not considered prostitution and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] during the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]]. Women and girls from the [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Europe]] were captured and served as [[concubine]]s in the [[harem]]s of the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Slavery in Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]] said several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122171200/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Slavery.html |date=2009-11-22 }}.

According to [[Shia]] Muslims, the prophet Muhammad sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah|fixed-term marriage]], called ''muta'a'' in [[Iraq]] and ''[[sigheh]]'' in [[Iran]], which according to some Western writers, has allegedly been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.{{sfn|İlkkaracan|2008|p=36}} [[Sunni]] Muslims, who make up the majority of Muslims worldwide, believe the practice of nikah mut‘ah was revoked and ultimately forbidden by second Sunni caliph, [[Umar]]. However, Sunnis have fixed-term marriages, such as [[nikah urfi]], [[nikah Misyar]], and [[nikah halala]]. Fundamentalist Sunnis called for [[jihad al nikah|sexual jihad]]. Shias deem all sexual relations outside of proper marriage (the only being nikah or nikah mutah) as illegal, forbidden and against the sunnah. Like the Shia, Sunnis regard prostitution as sinful and forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olaniyan|first1=Olayinka|title=Prostitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual relations in exchange for payment|url=https://www.academia.edu/33506440/Prostitution_is_the_business_or_practice_of_engaging_in_sexual_relations_in_exchange_for_payment|website=Academia|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Portuguese visitors and their South Asian (and sometimes African) crew members often engaged in [[slavery in Japan]], where they brought or captured young Japanese women and girls, who were either used as [[Sexual slavery|sexual slaves]] on their ships or taken to [[Macau]] and other Portuguese colonies in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|the Americas]]{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=49}} and [[India]].{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=52}} For example, in [[Goa]], a [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colony in India]], there was a community of Japanese slaves and traders during the late 16th and 17th centuries.{{sfn|Leupp|2003|pp=49, 52}} Later European [[Portuguese East India Company|East India companies]], including those of the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] and [[East India Company|British]], also engaged in [[prostitution in Japan]].{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=50}}

===China===

Prostitution in [[China]] was due to a weak familial economy among the [[Rural China|rural]] families of the country.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293–294}} Although China was a nation of wealth, the poverty stricken families were due to the over population of rural areas. These lives of borderline starvation drove many women out of the rural countryside to the port side cities of China. Many of the women who took part in the prostitution of China were either sold into the industry or willingly joined. Due to their lack of economic stability, parents were unable to feed all the mouths of the house and often sold their daughters into the industry. The popularity of this industry stemmed from the [[Human overpopulation|over population]] in rural villages, and an overall life of poverty for the majority of Chinese families.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293–294}} However, the increase of the [[Colonialism|colonial powers]]' presence in China added to the demand for these ladies of the night.

===Southeast Asia===
In Southeast Asia, prostitution was mostly prevalent in [[Singapore]], due to its active ports. Certain districts of Singapore were dedicated [[brothel]] districts sanctioned by the colonial governments.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293–294}} As colonial powers entered the Asian countries, there was an increase in number of sailors at ports. Merchant ships carried large crews of men, who lacked the company of women for days on end. As these ships docked in Asian ports, like Singapore, they were drawn to the market of prostitution. This higher demand for the company of a woman created the need for these brothel districts.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293–294}}

===Japan===
[[File:Suzuki Haronubu oiran ukiyo-e.jpg|thumb|250px|An oiran preparing herself for a client, [[ukiyo-e]] print by Suzuki Haronubu (1765)]]
From the 15th century, [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea]]n and other [[Far East]]ern visitors began frequenting [[brothel]]s in Japan.{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=48}} This practice continued among visitors from the [[Western Regions]], mainly [[Europe]]an traders, beginning with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in the 16th century who often came with their [[South Asia]]n ''[[lascar]]'' crew, along with [[Africa]]n crewmembers in some cases.{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=49}} In the 16th century, the local [[Japanese people]] initially assumed that the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] were from ''[[Names of India#Tianzhu|Tenjiku]]'' ("Heavenly Abode"), the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name for the [[Indian subcontinent]] due to its importance as the birthplace of [[Buddhism]], and that [[Christianity]] was a new [[Indian religions|Indian faith]]. These mistaken assumptions were due to the [[India]]n city of [[Goa]] being a central base for the [[Portuguese East India Company]] and also due to a significant portion of the crew on Portuguese ships being [[Christianity in India|Indian Christians]].{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=35}}

In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of [[Kyoto]], [[Edo]] and [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. [[Oiran]] were [[courtesans]] in Japan during the [[Edo period]]. The [[oiran]] were considered a type of {{Nihongo|''yūjo''|遊女}} also known as a "woman of pleasure" or prostitute. Among the oiran, the tayū (太夫) was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their clients, oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and education was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure districts. Their art and fashions often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded oiran was in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Teruoka Yasutaka,  "The pleasure quarters and Tokugawa culture." ''Eighteenth Century Japan: Culture and Society'' (1989): 3-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the problem of regulating prostitution according to modern European models was widely debated in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Garon, "The World's Oldest Debate? Prostitution cactus and the State in Imperial Japan, 1900-1945," ''American Historical Review'' 98#3 (1993), pp. 710–732 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2167547 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
During the [[Middle Ages]] prostitution was commonly found in urban contexts. Although all forms of sexual activity outside of marriage were regarded as sinful by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], prostitution was tolerated because it helped prevent the greater [[evil]]s of [[rape]], [[sodomy]] and [[masturbation]].{{sfn|McCall|1979| }} [[Augustine of Hippo]] is quoted saying, "if you expel prostitution from society, you will unsettle everything on account of lusts." The general tolerance of prostitution was for the most part reluctant, and many people from the church urged prostitutes to reform.

After the decline of organized prostitution of the Roman empire, many prostitutes were slaves. However, religious campaigns against slavery and the growing marketisation of the economy turned prostitution back into a business. By the [[High Middle Ages]] it was common to find town governments ruling that prostitutes were not to ply their trade within the [[town wall]]s, but they were tolerated outside, only because these areas were beyond the jurisdiction of the authorities. In many areas of France and Germany town governments came to set aside certain streets as areas where prostitution could be tolerated.&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baarda|first1=Benjamin I.|last2=Sikora|first2=Aleksandra E.|title=Proteomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: the treasure hunt for countermeasures against an old disease|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=6|year=2015|issn=1664-302X|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01190|postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London the brothels of [[Southwark]] were owned by the [[Bishop of Winchester]].{{sfn|McCall|1979| }} After this, it became common in the major towns and cities of [[Southern Europe]] to establish civic brothels. This allowed the government to outlaw any prostitution taking place outside these brothels. In much of [[Northern Europe]] a more tolerant attitude could be found towards prostitution.{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=413}} Prostitutes also found a fruitful market in the Crusades.

==16th–17th centuries==
[[File:Étienne Jeaurat 001.jpg|thumb|French prostitutes being taken to the police station; painting by [[Étienne Jeaurat]]]]

By the end of the 15th century attitudes began to harden against prostitution. An outbreak of [[syphilis]] in [[Naples]] during 1494, which later swept across Europe, may have originated from the [[Columbian Exchange|Colombian Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.livescience.com/history/080114-syphilis-columbus.html Columbus May Have Brought Syphilis to Europe]". [[LiveScience]]. January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of other [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]] during the earlier 16th century may have caused this change in attitude. By the early 16th century the association between prostitutes, plague and contagion emerged, causing brothels and prostitution to be outlawed by secular authority.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=41}} Furthermore, outlawing brothels and prostitution was used to  "strengthen the criminal law" system of the 16th-century secular rulers.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=44}} [[Canon law]] defined a prostitute as "a promiscuous woman, regardless of financial elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London Commissary Court Act Books|year=1470–1473|publisher=Department of Manuscripts|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostitute was considered a "whore … who [was] available for the lust of many men," and was most closely associated with promiscuity.{{sfn|Bennett|1989|p=81}}

The Church's stance on prostitution was three-fold. It included the "acceptance of prostitution as an inevitable social fact, condemnation of those profiting from this commerce, and encouragement for the prostitute to [[repent]].{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=13}} The Church was forced to recognize its inability to remove prostitution from the worldly society, and in the 14th century "began to tolerate prostitution as a lesser evil."{{sfnm|Rossiaud|1996|1p=160|Otis|1985|2p=12}} However, prostitutes were excluded from the Church as long as they continued with their lifestyle.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1982|p=36}} Around the 12th century, the idea of prostitute saints took hold, with [[Mary Magdalene]] being one of the most popular saints of the era. The Church used Mary Magdalene's biblical history of being a reformed harlot to encourage prostitutes to repent and mend their ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karras|first=Ruth|title=Holy Harlots: Prostitute Saints in Medieval Legend|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|date=July 1990|volume=1|issue=1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, religious houses were established with the purpose of providing asylum and encouraging the reformation of prostitution. Magdalene Homes were particularly popular and peaked in the early 14th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Bullough|1a2=Brundage|1y=1982|1p=41|2a1=Roberts|2y=1992|2pp=73–74}}  Over the course of the Middle Ages, [[popes]] and [[religious communities]] made various attempts to remove prostitution or reform prostitutes with varying success.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1982|pp=41–42}}

With the advent of the [[Protestant Reformation]], numbers of Southern German towns closed their brothels in an attempt to eradicate prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roper |first1=Lyndal |title=Luther: Sex, Marriage and Motherhood |url=https://www.historytoday.com/lyndal-roper/luther-sex-marriage-and-motherhood |website=History Today |accessdate=28 August 2018 |date=12 December 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some periods prostitutes had to distinguish themselves from other with particular signs. They sometimes wore very short hair or no hair at all, and sometimes they wore [[veil]]s in societies where other women did not wear them. Ancient codes regulated the crime of a prostitute that dissimulated her profession.

==18th century==
[[File:Christian Krohg-Albertine i politilægens venteværelse.jpg|200px|thumb|''Albertine at the Police Doctor's Waiting Room'', 1885–87 painting by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer and painter [[Christian Krohg]] illustrating his then very controversial novel ''Albertine'' about the life of a prostitute]]
According to [[Dervish]] Ismail Agha, in the ''Dellâkname-i Dilküşâ'', the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] archives,{{sfnm|Gazali|2001|1p=106|Sılay|1994|2p= }} in the [[Turkish bath]]s, the masseurs were traditionally [[Pederasty#The Middle East|young men]] who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. They also were as [[sex workers]].{{sfn|Toledano|2003|p=242  "[Flaubert, January 1850:] Be informed, furthermore, that all of the bath-boys are bardashes [male homosexuals]."}} The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] texts describe who they were, their prices, how many times they could bring their customers to [[orgasm]] and the details of their sexual practices.

In the 18th century, presumably in [[Venice]], prostitutes started using [[condom]]s made with catgut or cow bowel.

==19th century==
In America, prostitution was seen as a "necessary evil" that aided in marital fidelity, especially as a system that would allow men to obtain sex when their wives did not desire it.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} D'Emilio and Freedman document that prostitution was not a crime in the early part of the 19th century, and thus brothels (or bawdy houses) were tolerated in American cities and the laws against individual prostitutes were enforced only occasionally.

In the 1830s, prostitution was becoming more visible in American cities, and with the professionalization of police forces, visible prostitutes such as streetwalkers risked arrest.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} But D'Emilio and Freedman note that raids on brothels were comparatively rare, and prostitution was tolerated in mining towns, cattle towns, and urban centers in the American east. In 1870, prostitution was legalized and regulated in the city of St. Louis Missouri.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} Prostitutes were licensed by public health officials, and were required to maintain weekly inspections for sexually transmitted diseases. However, due to protests and demonstrations organized by women and members of the clergy, Missouri legislators repealed the legislation allowing regulated prostitution.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }}

The [[Page Act of 1875]] was passed by the US Congress and forbid any importation of women for the purpose of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 141.-An act supplementary to the acts in relation to immigration|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/sourcefiles/PageAct.pdf|date=3 March 1875|website=www.procon.org|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national move to criminalize prostitution was led by Protestant middle class men and women who participated in the revivalism movement of the 19th century.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} 

Many of the women who posed in 19th- and early-20th-century [[vintage erotica]] were prostitutes. The most famous were the [[New Orleans]] women who posed for [[E. J. Bellocq]]. In the 19th century legalized prostitution became a public controversy as [[France]] and then the [[United Kingdom]] passed the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]]. This legislation mandated pelvic examinations for suspected prostitutes. It applied not only to the United Kingdom and France, but also to their overseas colonies. Many early [[feminists]] fought to repeal these laws, either on the grounds that prostitution should be illegal and therefore not government regulated or because it forced degrading medical examinations upon women. A similar situation existed in the [[Russian Empire]]. This included prostitutes operating out of government-sanctioned brothels given yellow internal passports signifying their status and were subjected to weekly physical exams. [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' describes legal prostitution in 19th-century Russia.

During the 19th century the British in [[British Raj|India]] began to adopt the policy of social segregation, but they continued to keep their brothels full of Indian women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/book1.htm How carnal desire put England on top].

===Mining camps===
The houses of prostitution found in every mining camp worldwide were famous, especially in the 19th century when long distance imports of prostitutes became common.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Ann Laite, "Historical Perspectives on Industrial Development, Mining, and Prostitution," ''Historical Journal'', (2009) 53#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;739–761 {{DOI|10.1017/S0018246X09990100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurs set up shops and businesses to cater to the miners, and brothels were largely tolerated in mining towns.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} [[Prostitution in the United States|Prostitution in the American West]] was a growth industry that attracted sex workers from around the globe where they were pulled in by the money, despite the harsh and dangerous working conditions and low prestige. Chinese women were frequently sold by their families and taken to the camps as prostitutes, and were often forced to send their earnings back to the family in China.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucie Cheng|Lucie Cheng Hirata]], "Free, Indentured, Enslaved: Chinese Prostitutes in Nineteenth-Century America," ''Signs'' (1979) 5f1 pp.&amp;nbsp;3–29 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173531 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In Virginia City, Nevada, a prostitute, [[Julia Bulette]], was one of the few who achieved "respectable" status. She nursed victims of an influenza epidemic, earning her acceptance in the community and the support of the sheriff. The townspeople were shocked when she was murdered in 1867 and they honoured her with a lavish funeral and hanging of her assailant.{{sfn|Goldman|1981|pp=1–4, 118}}

Until the 1890s, madams predominately ran the businesses, after which male pimps took over. This led to the generally declined treatment of women. It was not uncommon for brothels in Western towns to operate openly, without the stigma that was beginning to emerge in East Coast cities as a result of anti-prostitution activism.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns, and only later, as the female population increased, reformers moved in and other civilizing influences arrived, did prostitution become less blatant and less common.{{sfn|Butler|1987| }} After a decade or so the mining towns attracted respectable women who ran boarding houses, organized church societies, and worked as laundresses and seamstresses, all while striving for independent status.{{sfn|Jeffrey|1998|p=164}}

Australia mining camps had a well-developed system of prostitution.{{sfn|McKewon|2005| }} City fathers sometimes tried to confine the practice to red light districts.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine McKewon, "The historical geography of prostitution in Perth, Western Australia." ''[[Australian Geographer]]'' 34.3 (2003): 297–310 .&lt;/ref&gt; The precise role prostitution played in various camps depended on the sex ratio in specific population groups of colonial society as well as racial attitudes toward non-whites. In the early 19th century British authorities decided it was best to have lower-class white, Asian, Middle Eastern and Aboriginal women service the prisoners and thereby keep peace while maintaining strong class lines that isolated British gentlemen and ladies from the lower elements. Prostitution was so profitable that it was easy to circumvent the legal boundaries. When Australians took control by 1900 they wanted a "white Australia" and tried to exclude or expel non-white women who might become prostitutes. However, feminist activists fought against Australia's discriminatory laws that led to varying levels of rights for women, races and classes. By 1939 new attitudes toward racial harmony began to surface. These were inspired by white Australians to rethink their racist policies and adopt more liberal residency laws that did not focus on sexual or racial issues.&lt;ref&gt;Raelene Frances, "Sex Workers or Citizens? Prostitution and the Shaping of" Settler" Society in Australia." ''International Review of Social History'' 44 (1999): 101–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin American mining camps also had well-developed systems of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Roseann Cohen, "Extractive Desires: The Moral Control of Female Sexuality at Colombia's Gold Mining Frontier." ''Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology'' 19.2 (2014): 260–279.&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico the government tried to protect and idealize middle class women, but made little effort to protect prostitutes in the mining camps.&lt;ref&gt;William E.

In 20th-century African mining camps prostitution followed the historical patterns developed in the 19th century. They added the theme of casual temporary marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Fahy Bryceson, Jesper Bosse Jønsson, and Hannelore Verbrugge. "Prostitution or partnership?

==20th century==
During World War I, in colonial Philippines, US armed forces developed a prostitute management program called the "American Plan" which enabled the military to arrest any woman within five miles of a military cantonment. If found infected, a woman could be sentenced to a hospital or a farm colony until cured.{{sfn|Rosen|1982|p=35}}

Beginning in the 1910s and continuing in some places into the 1950s, the American Plan operated in the United States. Women were told to report to a health officer where they were coerced to submit to an invasive examination. Immigrants, minorities and the poor were primarily targeted.{{sfn|Stern|2018| }}

In 1921, the [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children]] was signed. In this convention some nations declared reservations towards prostitution.

The leading theorists of [[communism]] opposed prostitution. [[Karl Marx]] thought of it as "only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the laborer," and considered its abolition to be necessary to overcome capitalism. [[Friedrich Engels]] considered even marriage a form of prostitution, and [[Vladimir Lenin]] found sex work distasteful. Communist governments often took wide-ranging steps to repress prostitution immediately after obtaining power, although the practice always persisted. In the countries that remained nominally communist after the end of the Cold War, especially China, prostitution remained illegal but was nonetheless common.

During [[World War II]], [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] soldiers engaged in [[forced prostitution]] during their invasions across [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The term "[[comfort women]]" became a [[euphemism]] for the estimated 200,000 mostly [[Korean people|Korean]] and [[China|Chinese]] women who were forced into prostitution in [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese military]] brothels during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html|title=Comfort Women Were 'Raped': U.S. Ambassador to Japan|date=19 March 2007|work=The Chosun Ilbo (English Edition)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627070105/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html|archive-date=27 June 2009|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex tourism]] emerged in the late 20th century as a controversial aspect of Western tourism and [[globalization]]. Sex tourism was typically undertaken internationally by tourists from wealthier countries. Author [[Nils Johan Ringdal|Nils Ringdal]] alleged that three out of four men between the ages of 20 and 50 who have visited [[Asia]] or [[Africa]] have paid for sex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/love-for-sale-a-global-history-of-prostitution-by-nils-ringdal-trans-richard-daly-751462.html Love for Sale: a global history of prostitution by Nils Ringdal, trans Richard Daly]. By Sarah Burton. ''The Independent.'' November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A new legal approach to prostitution emerged at the end of the 20th century, termed ''the Swedish model''. This included the prohibition of buying, but not selling, of sexual services. This means that only the client commits a crime in engaging in paid sex, not the prostitute. Such laws were enacted in Sweden (1999), Norway (2009), Iceland (2009), Canada (2014), Northern Ireland (2015), France (2016), and the Republic of Ireland (2017), and are also being considered in other jurisdictions. These laws are an attempt to protect the worker and embrace the fallout of the [[sexual revolution]], meaning sex will happen, and for it to happen safely and respectfully, there must be "free-form" regulation.

==21st century==
In the 21st century, [[Afghan]]s revived a method of prostituting young boys, which is referred to as ''[[bacha bazi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/dancingboys/view/ |title=The Dancing Boys Of Afghanistan &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the break up of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] thousands of eastern European women have become prostitutes in China, Western Europe, Israel and Turkey every year.&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, Margot (24 June 2001). "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101930621-161939,00.html The Skin Trade]". ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]''. Retrieved 19 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There are tens of thousands of women from eastern Europe and Asia working as prostitutes in [[Dubai]]. Men from [[Saudi Arabia]] and the United Arab Emirates form a large proportion of the customers.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/16/dubai-sex-tourism-prostitution Why Dubai's Islamic austerity is a sham&amp;nbsp;– sex is for sale in every bar]". ''The Guardian''. May 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

India's [[devadasi]] girls are forced by their poor families to dedicate themselves to the [[Hindu]] goddess [[Renuka]]. The BBC wrote in 2007 that devadasis are "sanctified prostitutes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6729927.stm Slaves to the goddess of fertility]. BBC News. June 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The United Kingdom introduced the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956|Sexual Offences Act of 1956]] which would partly be repealed and altered by the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. While this law did not criminalise the act of prostitution itself, it did prohibit such activities as running a brothel and soliciting for paid sex.

Concerns were voiced over [[white British]] adolescent girls being used as prostitutes by [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]] immigrants in the 1960s. These girls were wanted by several police departments in the early 1960s and were described as "good-looking and attractive, not of common appearance ... will almost certainly earn her living by prostitution and with Pakistanis."{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=154}}

==United States==
In the United States prostitution was originally widely legal. Prostitution was made illegal in almost all states between 1910 and 1915 largely due to the influence of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], which was influential in the banning of [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and was a major force in the [[prohibition]] of alcohol. In 1917 the prostitution district [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]] in New Orleans was closed down by the Federal government over local objections. In Deadwood, South Dakota prostitution, while technically illegal, was tolerated by local residents and officials for decades until the last madam was brought down by state and federal authorities for tax evasion in 1980. Prostitution remained legal in [[Alaska]] until 1953, and is still legal in some rural counties of [[Nevada]], including areas outside of Las Vegas. For more, see [[Prostitution in Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~soc/docs/Weitzer/Prostitution_Facts.pdf | title=prostitution:facts and fictions | publisher=www.gwu.edu | accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1980s many states increased the penalties for prostitution in cases where the prostitute is knowingly [[HIV]]-positive. These laws, often known as felony prostitution laws, require anyone arrested for prostitution to be tested for HIV. If the test comes back positive the suspect is informed that any future arrest for prostitution will be a [[felony]] instead of a [[misdemeanor]]. Penalties for felony prostitution vary in the states that have such laws, with maximum sentences of typically 10 to 15 years in prison. An episode of ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'' which aired in the early 1990s detailed the impact of [[HIV/AIDS]] among prostitutes; this episode contributed to HIV/AIDS awareness.

== History ==
The first online community to use the term "incel" was started in 1993 when a Canadian college student known only by her first name, Alana, created a website in order to discuss her sexual inactivity with others.&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/24/incel-sexual-frustration-rebellion-at-center-toronto-attack.html|title='Incel' sexual frustration 'rebellion' at center of Toronto attack|last=Schallhorn|first=Kaitlyn|date=April 24, 2018|work=[[Fox News]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/08/intel-involuntary-celibate-movement-218324|title=How 'Incel' Got Hijacked|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|date=May 8, 2018|work=[[Politico]]|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/news/a34512/woman-who-started-incel-movement/|title=The Woman Who Accidentally Started the Incel Movement|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=March 1, 2016|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website, titled "Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project",&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt; was used by people of all genders to share their thoughts and experiences.  In 1997, she started a mailing list on the topic that used the abbreviation INVCEL, which was later shortened to "incel", where it was defined as "anybody of any gender who was lonely, had never had sex or who hadn't had a relationship in a long time".&lt;ref name="bbcaug302018"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45284455|title=The woman who founded the 'incel' movement|last=Taylor|first=Jim|date=August 30, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=August 30, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her college career and after, she realized she was [[queer]], and became more comfortable with her identity. She later gave the site to a stranger.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; When speaking about the website in 2018, Alana said, "It definitely wasn't a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems. That's a pretty sad version of this phenomenon that's happening today. Things have changed in the last 20 years."&lt;ref name="bbcaug302018" /&gt;

The message board love-shy.com was founded in 2003 as a place for people who were perpetually rejected or extremely shy of potential partners to discuss their situations.&lt;ref name="Dewey2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[/r/incels]] [[subreddit]], a forum on the website [[Reddit]], became a particularly active incel community. The subreddit was known as a place where men blamed women for their involuntary celibacy, sometimes advocated for rape or other violence, and were misogynistic and often racist.&lt;ref name="Solon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/reddit-violence-policy.html|title=Reddit Bans Nazi Groups and Others in Crackdown on Violent Content|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=October 26, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; One post titled "general question about how rapists get caught" was asked by a member pretending to be a woman, saying they wanted to know how a woman who was drugged and raped would begin finding her rapist.&lt;ref name="Solon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-41926687|title=Reddit bans 'involuntarily celibate' community|last=Bell|first=Chris|date=November 9, 2017|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Alana read about the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]], and the way parts of the incel subculture glorified the perpetrator, Elliot Rodger,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; she wrote, "Like a scientist who invented something that ended up being a weapon of war, I can't uninvent this word, nor restrict it to the nicer people who need it."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Alana expressed regret at the change in usage from her original intent of creating an "inclusive community" for men and women who were sexually deprived due to social awkwardness, marginalization, or mental illness.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/woman-who-invented-incel-movement-interview-toronto-attack|title=Woman behind 'incel' says angry men hijacked her word 'as a weapon of war'|last1=Kassam|first1=Ashifa|date=April 26, 2018|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since started a new project, "Love Not Anger", which she describes as "a project to research how lonely people might find respectful love, instead of being stuck in anger".&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

On October 25, 2017, Reddit announced a new policy that would ban "content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  and banned the /r/incels subreddit on November 7, 2017, under its purview. At the time of the ban, the community had around 40,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/technology/incels-reddit-banned.html|title=Reddit Bans 'Incel' Group for Inciting Violence Against Women|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=November 9, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Incels came to wider public notice with the banning of the subreddit and when a series of mass murders were committed by men who either self-identified as involuntarily celibate or shared similar ideologies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/life-love/sex-relationships/a33782/involuntary-celibacy/|title=What Happens to Men Who Can't Have Sex|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=February 29, 2016|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However the incel community continued to inhabit Reddit.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; Increased interest in incel communities has been attributed to the feeling of "aggrieved entitlement" by some men, who feel they are being denied rights they deserve and blame women instead of society's expectation of [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

The incel subculture includes people who are in [[sexless marriage]]s (or other sexless relationships) but who wish to be sexually active. It is considered to be distinct from [[asexuality]] and from voluntary [[Abstinence|sexual abstinence]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnelly|first=Denise|last2=Burgess|first2=Elisabeth|last3=Anderson|first3=Sally|last4=Davis|first4=Regina|last5=Dillard|first5=Joy|date=2001|title=Involuntary Celibacy: A life course analysis|url=http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~meeklesr/celibacy.html|journal=[[The Journal of Sex Research]]|volume=38|issue=2|pages=159–169|doi=10.1080/00224490109552083|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
"Involuntary celibacy" is not a medical or psychological condition. Some people who identify as incel suffer from physical disabilities or psychological disorders such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], and [[body dysmorphic disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/05/we-must-try-understand-how-unwanted-virginity-leads-self-hating-incels-murder|title=We must try to understand how unwanted virginity leads self-hating incels to murder|last=Tait|first=Amelia|date=May 8, 2018|website=[[New Statesman]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some visitors of incel forums attribute their inability to find a partner to physical or mental ailments, some others attribute it to extreme introversion.

== Mass murders and violence ==
Some mass murders and other violent attacks in North America have been committed or are suspected to have been committed by men who have self-identified as involuntarily celibate, or whose statements align with incel ideologies.

On May 23, 2014, Elliot Rodger [[2014 Isla Vista killings|killed six people and injured fourteen others]] before killing himself in [[Isla Vista, California|Isla Vista]], [[California]], near the campus of [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. These killings drew media attention to the concept of involuntary celibacy, and particularly the misogyny and glorification of violence that are a mainstay of many incel communities. Rodger self-identified as an incel and left behind a 137-page manifesto and [[YouTube]] videos detailing his involuntary celibacy and discussing how he wanted revenge for being rejected by women.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/05/24/the-disturbing-internet-footprint-of-santa-barbara-shooter-elliot-rodger/ |title=The Disturbing Internet Footprint Of Santa Barbara Shooter Elliot Rodger|last=Hill|first=Kashmir|date=May 24, 2014|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/elliot-rodger-killings-in-california-followed-years-of-withdrawal.html|title=Elliot O.

Rodger is among several attackers who are regularly praised by members of incel communities. The perpetrator of the [[2009 Collier Township shooting]], George Sodini, has been embraced by some of these communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]] by [[Stephen Paddock]] (a man with unclear motive), some of the involuntarily celibate community celebrated the shooter, who they felt was a hero who was targeting "normies".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The trend has since continued—after the 2018 Toronto van attack, a poster on a website created to supersede /r/incels wrote about suspected perpetrator Alek Minassian, "I hope this guy wrote a manifesto because he could be our next new saint."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; After the 2018 [[Danforth shooting]], posters on an incel message board expressed excitement with the possibility that the perpetrator might be an incel, although no motive has been identified.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/incels-looksmaxing-obsession_us_5b50e56ee4b0de86f48b0a4f|title=Inside Incels' Looksmaxing Obsession: Penis Stretching, Skull Implants And Rage|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=July 24, 2018|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2015, Chris Harper-Mercer killed nine people and injured eight others before killing himself in a [[Umpqua Community College shooting|shooting at the Umpqua Community College]] campus in [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], [[Oregon]]. He left a manifesto at the scene, outlining his interest in other mass murders including the Isla Vista killings, anger at not having a girlfriend, and animus towards the world.

On December 7, 2017, William Atchison killed two people before killing himself in [[Aztec, New Mexico|Aztec]], [[New Mexico]], in a [[Aztec High School shooting|shooting at Aztec High School]], where he had previously been a student. He had used the pseudonym "Elliot Rodger" on several online forums, and praised "the supreme gentleman" (a term Rodger had used to describe himself, which has since been adopted as a moniker by incel communities).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20180205/alt-right-killing-people|title=The Alt-Right is Killing People|last=Hankes|first=Keegan|date=February 5, 2018|work=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|access-date=May 14, 2018|last2=Amend|first2=Alex|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Incel communities have been widely criticized in the media and by researchers as violent, misogynist, and extremist.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":WaPo-Houston-etc" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst working for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has cautioned that exposure to violent content on incel forums "play[s] a very large role" in the radicalization of incels, and describes violent posts on the forums as "more&amp;nbsp;... than I'm used to seeing on even white supremacist sites".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Journalist [[David Futrelle]] has described incel communities as "violently misogynistic", and is among critics who attribute worsening violent rhetoric on incel forums to the growth of the alt-right and white supremacy, and the overlap between incel communities and online hate groups.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/online-extremism-radical-misogyny_us_5b491358e4b0bc69a787458f|title=Internet Giants Are Banning Extremists (Just Not The Ones Targeting Women)|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=July 27, 2018|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4167152/toronto-van-attack-incel-alek-minassian-violence/|title=Expert traces link between violent online alt-right fantasies and real-world attacks|last=Cain|first=Patrick|date=April 27, 2018|work=[[Global News]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior research fellow at the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] (ISD), [[Amarnath Amarasingam]], has criticized some incel communities where calls for violence are commonplace, saying "under the right set of psychological and personal circumstances, these kinds of forums can be dangerous and push people into violence".&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt; Another researcher at the ISD, Jacob Davey, compared the radicalization of incels in incel forums to teenagers being urged to go to extreme measures on online [[Pro-ana|forums that promote anorexia and other eating disorders]] and to online campaigns convincing people to join [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]. Speaking about incels' feelings of entitlement to sex, Davey said the attitude "can go as far as the justification of rape". [[University of Portsmouth]] lecturer Lisa Sugiura has described incel forums as a "networked misogyny", and urged the posts in such forums be taken seriously not only in the context of [[hate speech]] but also as a form of grooming that could radicalize "impressionable and vulnerable disillusioned young men".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/rise-women-haters-inside-dark-world-british-incels/|title=Rise of the women haters: Inside the dark world of the British 'incels'|last=Tait|first=Amelia|date=August 18, 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=September 1, 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting on incels by media outlets following the incel-related attacks during the 2010s has been criticized for its "breathless" coverage, normalizing incel communities by describing them as "sexually frustrated", and directing readers to incel communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/toronto-attack-incel-alek-minassian|title=After the Toronto attack don't explain Incel ideology, ban it|last=Kobie|first=Nicole|date=April 26, 2018|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reporting has also been criticized for [[victim blaming]] by implying that women and peers who rejected the attackers held some responsibility for provoking the attacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/05/21/no-girls-and-women-dont-provoke-mass-murderers/|title=No, girls and women don't 'provoke' mass murderers|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|date=May 21, 2018|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for giving attackers notoriety by reporting on them at length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44321469|title=The problem with mass shootings and the media|last=Cooper|first=Kelly-Leigh|date=May 31, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Inside Deep Throat''''' is a 2005 American [[documentary film]] about the 1972 [[pornographic film]] ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', at the forefront of the [[Golden Age of Porn]], and its effects on American society. 

== Content ==
{{More plot|date=January 2015}}
The film discusses how ''Deep Throat'' was distributed to theaters. Prints would be hand-delivered and employees would count heads of moviegoers and then collect the cash profits from the theaters. This process was known as sending "checkers and sweepers".

It features scenes from the film, news of the time and interviews, both from archive and purpose-made, with director [[Gerard Damiano]], actor [[Harry Reems]], actress [[Linda Lovelace]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[Larry Flynt]], [[Hugh Hefner]], [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], [[Erica Jong]], a prosecutor, Reems' defense, Mafia money collectors, and other people involved or just commenting on the film. Much of the material was compiled from approximately 800 hours of interview and archive footage collected by the filmmakers.

''Inside Deep Throat'' was rated [[NC-17]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] for explicit sexual content; specifically, explicit excerpts from the original film. It was the first film rated NC-17 to be released by Universal since ''[[Henry &amp; June]]'' in 1990, which was the first film to receive the NC-17 rating. 

An edited version received an R rating for "strong [[Human sexual behavior|sexuality]] including graphic images, [[nudity]] and dialogue". In addition, [[Arrow Productions]] edited the original, pornographic version of ''Deep Throat'' to get an "R" rating, and also submitted the original for reclassification. Both reedited films were released theatrically in 2005 in a double-bill.

The '''Institutional Analysis and Development framework''' ('''IAD''') was developed by [[Elinor Ostrom]], an American [[political scientist]], also known as the first woman to receive the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom, Elinor]]. (1990) ''Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action''. New York: Cambridge University.&lt;/ref&gt; The IAD relates a set of concepts to help in the analysis of collective action problems that involve social structures, positions, and rules. Under the rational choice models, the IAD was devised in an attempt to ''explain and predict'' outcomes by formalising the structures, positions, and rules involved in collective choice problems. Thus, it can be seen as a [[Systematic sampling|systematic method]] to collect policy analysis functions similar to [[analytical technique|analytic technique]] commonly used in [[Physical science|physical]] and [[social science]]s and understand how institution operate and change over a period of time&lt;ref name=indiana&gt;{{cite web|author1=Michael D. McGinnis|title=An Introduction to IAD and the Language of the Ostrom Workshop: A Simple Guide to a Complex Framework for the Analysis of Institutions and Their Development|url=http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=751119001100098006090092064001065006034048031046008017077070065006068117100125067022058117006035008099001118111016111092122095106078039042042125118092118002001030086033030046005106074116117000084089121084&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;TYPE=1|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mason&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret M.

=== Components of the framework ===
[[File:IAD framework diagram.png|thumb|400px|IAD framework diagram]]
Ostrom thought of the IAD as a "multi-level conceptual map" with which one could zoom in and out of particular hierarchical parts of the regularised interactions in an established social system. The IAD framework helps to perceive complex collective action problems by dividing them into 'action arenas', that are smaller pieces of practically understandable function.&lt;ref name="indiana" /&gt; The analyst assumes that the structure of the action situation is fixed in the short-term. For an action situation to exist, there must be "actors in positions" (the number of possible roles that are available in this recurring interaction situation)&lt;ref name="Understanding Institutional Diversity"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8085.pdf|title=Understanding Institutional Diversity|author=Elinor Ostrom|date=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400831739|location=Princeton|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Actors have choices within the existing (rule) structure. In the study of outcomes from collective choice situations, actors are influenced by the institutional arrangements, the socio-economic conditions, and the physical environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Krister Andersson|title=Understanding decentralized forest governance: an application of the institutional analysis and development framework|url=http://sspp.proquest.com/archives/vol2iss1/0507-010.andersson.html|journal=Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7645">[[File:Pigeon-hole messagebox 3.jpg|thumb|Pigeon-hole messageboxes at Stanford University, California, USA]]
In a large organisation with many employees, there is frequently an '''internal mail''' system. The '''post room''' sorts the incoming mail and the 'mailboy' takes it around on a trolly to the various [[Pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeon-holes]] and direct to the desks of important people.

==Mailroom==
{{main|Mailroom}}

This is the name of the department or the room where mail is sorted internally within a large organisation. '''Mailroom''' is used primarily by US companies and '''Post room''' by UK companies and organisations (e.g. hospitals and universities.)

==Central distribution==
This is where goods as opposed to letters are delivered to and distributed from.  Small packets and letters in bulk (e.g. mailsacks) would be sent on to the mailroom.  Goods are often heavy and bulky and may require specialist handling (e.g. fragile), [[lifting equipment]] (forklifts for pallets) and transportation devices (sacktrucks, motorised trollies, vans and flatbeds) and are therefore rarely handled by the mailroom.&lt;ref name="surrey.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/portal/page?_pageid=1638,1480713&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Central Distribution|author=|work=surrey.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal mail==
This is the name for mail which is sent and received between employees and departments.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.pws.gov.nt.ca/regionalServices/mailSystems.htm Internal and External Mail]&lt;/ref&gt;  Internal mail will often use a special envelope which can be reused.  It is common for them to have many address boxes that are used in order.  The most recent box is the current delivery address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.office365.co.uk/P/A26310/New-Guardian-Internal-Mail-Envelopes-Pocket-Tuck-in-Flap-125gsm-Manilla-C4-Pack-250|title=New Guardian Internal Mail Envelopes Pocket Tuck-in Flap 125gsm Manilla C4 [Pack 250]|work=office365.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# An employee with a desk places mail in their out tray.
# An employee without a desk places mail in the pigeonhole for the recipient of the mail or the one marked internal mail.
# The mailboy collects mail from the out tray of every desk and also the internal mail pigeonhole of every department
# The mailboy sorts the mail by department using the wallets on his trolley
# The mailboy visits every department
# The mail is placed in the in tray of the intended employee or in their pigeonhole

==External mail==
This is the name used to describe mail which comes from or is going to another organisation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Outgoing mail===
# An employee with a desk places mail in their out tray or in the pigeonhole marked external mail.
# The mailboy collects the mail from the out tray and collects mail from the departmental pigeonholes marked external mail
# The mailboy places external mail in the external mail wallet on his trolly.
# The mailboy visits the mail room
# External mail is passed to the postmaster or another mail clerk
# The mail is weighed, stamped, franked etc. and is collected by the national mail service

===Incoming mail===

# The national mail service deliver the mail once or more per day.
# The postmaster or a mail clerk sorts the mail by department.
# The mailboy collects the mail from the mailroom and places it in the appropriate departmental wallet on his trolley.
# The mailboy visits every department.
# The mail is delivered to the employee's desk or their pigeonhole.

==Pigeon-hole==
{{main|Pigeon-hole messagebox}}

This is the departmental system of mail delivery for employees that don't have a desk.

==Letter trays==
This is where mail is delivered to or received from when an employee has a desk.  Each desk has a minimum of three letter trays labelled, in, out and pending. The in tray is where mail is received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/in-tray|title=in-tray definition - English dictionary for learners - Reverso|work=reverso.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The out tray is mail that is waiting to be collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/out-tray|title=out-tray definition - English dictionary for learners - Reverso|work=reverso.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pending tray is for documents that cannot be worked on at present because input from another person is required, or the requests are low priority. Sometimes additional trays are used for post, filing, dictation, etc. according to the needs of the individual or organisation.
==Postmaster==
{{main|Postmaster}}
This person usually works independently and is responsible for a company's incoming and outgoing mail. They are in charge of the mailroom and all of the employees that work there.

==Mailroom clerk==
A person who works in a mailroom is known as a '''mailroom clerk''', '''mailroom operator''' or '''post room operator'''. A mailroom clerk deals with the preparation of packaged goods, letters, and other mail for shipping by the local post office or by an independent shipping service. A mailroom clerk's job may be with a [[private firm]], [[government agency]], [[non-profit group]], or a [[military operation]].  In some small companies, the pigeonholes are in the reception area so the receptionist may take on this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totaljobs.com|title=UK jobs - Job search on totaljobs.com - Find jobs, build a career|work=totaljobs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mailboy==
'''Mailboy''' is the traditional name for the '''mailroom clerk''' who collects and delivers mail within a large organisation.  A 'mailboy', delivers mail for other employees in different departments using a mail cart or a trolley often sorting as he goes using the pouches or wallets that are part of the trolley.  It is typically the most junior of roles and many employees start here so they can get a feel for the entire organisation, get to know everyone rapidly, and then to decide where in an organisation they would like to train for and work within.  In the modern workplace it is a role suitable for people with learning difficulties and helps an organisation meet legislative quotas.  A trolly with many slots is frequently used so that sorting can take place while the trolly does its rounds thereby reducing the amount of mail that has to be sorted in the mailroom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internal-mail-tracking.com/Track%20mail%20trolley%20deliveries.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923014650/http://www.internal-mail-tracking.com/Track%20mail%20trolley%20deliveries.html |date=September 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bring Me the Head of Willy the Mailboy!]] is the title of a [[Dilbert]] book and contains a great deal of humour about modern office life through the eyes of a computer engineer.

==Automated systems==
Some companies use an automated system to assist with mail.  Tracks which loop around the building carry the mail between the mailroom and the departmental mailrooms or reception areas  The mail and small packets are placed on "trucks" or "trollies" which are programmed with the destination &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanswerbank.co.uk/Technology/Question416522.html|title=HSBC internal mail system|work=theanswerbank.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britsoft.com/solutions/internal-mail-tracking.html|title=Internal Mail Tracking with barcodes - Britsoft Limited|author=Clive Holt|work=britsoft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12044">'''Lateral communication''' is "the exchange, imparting or sharing of information, ideas or feelings between people within a community, peer groups, departments or units of an organization who are at or about the same hierarchical level as each other for the purpose of coordinating activities, efforts or fulfilling a common purpose or goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.speechmastery.com/lateral-communication.html|title=Lateral Communication: What is the Definition and How Can it be Mastered?|work=Speechmastery|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in organisms==
Lateral communication in organisms or animals can give rise to [[collective intelligence]], or the appearance of collective intelligence. Examples of lateral communication in organisms include:

* The participants in a flock of birds or a shoal of fish all maintain their relative positions or alter direction simultaneously due to lateral communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthsky.org/earth/how-do-flocking-birds-move-in-unison|title=How do flocking birds move in unison? {{!}} EarthSky.org|website=earthsky.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ants, termites and bees coordinate by lateral communication, mediated in the case of ants and termites, for example, by scent trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dkfindout.com/us/animals-and-nature/insects/how-do-ants-communicate/|title=DK Find Out! {{!}} Fun Facts for Kids on Animals, Earth, History and more!|website=DK Find Out!|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting physical structure is an emergent property of the individual entities.
* Bacterial colonies communicate with each other, coordinating, for example, an attack, or the production of slime using lateral communication based on chemical messengers so that as a group they can detect how many colleagues are near and whether they are likely to overwhelm a target.
* The [[pacemaker cells]] in the heart, [[cardiac pacemaker|a cardiac pacemaker]] form a small group; lateral communications sweep through the cells, much like a [[Mexican wave]] as a three-dimensional circulating wave, which relays contraction signals to the whole heart.
* With [[slime mold]], millions of individual amoeba-like creatures can spread out and graze the surface of a leaf. When conditions change, the amoeba concentrate and form a slug-like creature that can relocate before forming a spore body and releasing individual spores.
*The position and type of human cells are mediated by lateral communication.

==Organizations and communities==
Communities communicate and store collective knowledge through lateral communication and is an essential ingredient in making hierarchies work, by compensating for errors in vertical information flows.

In an organization, lateral communication is [[communication]] between different individuals/departments at the same organizational level.&lt;ref name="Management"&gt;{{cite book|last=Montana|first=Patrick J.|author2=Bruce H. Charnov |publisher=Barron's Educational Series|date=2000|isbn=978-0-7641-1276-8|title=Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Membrane"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0968-0004(93)90171-I|last=Teissié|first=J.|author2=B. Gabriel |author3=M. Prats |date=July 1993|title=Lateral Communication By Fast Proton Conduction: A Model Membrane Study. |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Biochemical Sciences]]|volume=18|issue=7|pages=243–246|pmid=8212130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term lateral communication can be used interchangeably with horizontal communication. In his text entitled ''Organizational Communication'', Michael J. Papa defines horizontal communication as "the flow of messages across functional areas at a given level of an organization". People at the same level "communicate directly without going through several levels of organization". Given this elasticity, members of an organization have an easier time with "problem-solving, information sharing across different work groups, and task coordination between departments or project teams". The use of lateral or horizontal communication in the workplace "can also enhance morale and afford a means of resolving conflicts.&lt;ref name="papa"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Papa, Michael J., Tom D. Daniels, and Barry K. Spiker |title=Organizational Communication Perspectives and Trends |edition=4th |location=Thousand Oaks |publisher=Sage Publications Inc. |year=1997 |isbn=1-4129-1684-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research asserted, "lateral communication involves not only the movement of information from the upper levels to the lower levels of the organizational hierarchy but also is defined primarily as the quality of information sharing among peers at similar levels. Specifically, lateral communication occurs among coworkers, during staff meetings and informational presentations, throughout shift changes, and among employees regardless of peer types. In short, lateral communication's purpose is to keep organizational personnel informed of all current practices, policies, and procedures".&lt;ref name="Spillane"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Spillan, John E., Mary Mino, and Susan M. Rowles |title=Sharing Organizational Messages Through Effective Lateral Communication |publisher=[[Qualitative Research Reports in Communication]] 3 |year=2002 |pages=96–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Communicating effectively laterally involves the exchange of information between and among all organizational members. While we may perceive that organizational information flows vertically or from top to bottom, in reality, information moves laterally. In other words, as information directives are communicated from an upper to a lower position on the hierarchy, peers at each hierarchical level should quickly interpret and communicate these directives between and among peers at similar hierarchical levels. Thus, it is critical for an organization to understand its structure and culture, which are the two major determinants of the quality of lateral communication.".&lt;ref name="Spillane"/&gt;

==Quality: structure and culture==

===Structure===

* Mechanistic structure '''–''' "A mechanistic or hierarchical organizational structure emphasizes specialization in position. Examples include healthcare and governmental organizations where information is communicated based on a chain of command. This organizational structure type is not conducive to lateral communication and, in fact, discourages it. Since direction and coordination are achieved through upper hierarchical levels, peer information sharing is limited. Overall, a mechanistic structure promotes vertical communication or top-down communication with strict alignment and unity of command within the organization".&lt;ref name="Spillane" /&gt;

* Organic structure '''–''' "An organic organizational structure is built upon an entrepreneurial concept. Here, the decisions made are decentralized and coordinated by mutual adjustment rather than command and control. Examples include a small business or a manufacturing facility where communication is promoted at all levels of the organization. This organizational structure allows for greater autonomy, promotes individual initiative, and allows employees to be involved in the decision-making process thus enabling employee decision-making to contribute to or detract from organizational goals. In short, an organic organizational structure can encourage and facilitate lateral communication".&lt;ref name="Spillane" /&gt;

===Culture/climate===
"Organizational culture refers to the organization's shared visions, values, beliefs, goals, and practices (Gilsdorf, 1998). Deals and Kennedy (1982) have connected culture with effective communication. Strong cultures and effective communication result in employees who are more productive because they know exactly what is expected of them in organizational settings. Gilsdorf (1998) has implied that the more employees perceive a positive or strong organizational culture, the more productive they will be. Poole (1985) has contended that an organization's quality of communication is summed-up in its culture. In many cases, a strong positive organizational culture or climate can encourage employees to communicate effectively laterally when sharing achievements and disappointments. Thus, as Comer (1991) has asserted, managers should actively encourage employees to communicate effectively laterally with their peers. In sum, lateral communication allows for a spirit of collaboration and teamwork by empowering employees at every level of the organizational hierarchy to work effectively together (see, for example, Thamara, 2000)".&lt;ref name="Spillane"/&gt;

==Challenges==
Although laterl communication can be effective, according to Papa, "horizontal communication problems occur because of territoriality, rivalry, specialization, and simple lack of motivation." In addition to these problems and in general, "organizations that traditionally have functioned under rigid authority structures with fixed lines of communication may find that the values and expectations that members have acquired under such systems inhibit attempts at horizontal communication."&lt;ref name="papa" /&gt;{{rp|56}} 

Other problems with this form of communication can happen between [[Multinational corporation|multinational corporations]]. "Horizontal communication between subsidiaries of the same multinational corporation (MNC) is a problem faced by staff as the demands for communicating across borders are pushed downwards in the organizational hierarchy.".&lt;ref name="mir"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mirjaliisa, Charles, and [[Rebecca Piekkari]] |title=Language Training for Enhanced |publisher=Business Communication Quarterly 65 |year=2002 |pages=9–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territoriality===
Territoriality often occurs when members of an organization "control task-related activity within a defined and fixed jurisdictional area" and as a result "regard others' involvement in that area as territorial encroachment." "Departments value their turf and strive to protect it. This problem may be compounded by interdepartmental rivalries that arise from win/lose the competition for rewards and resources"&lt;ref name="papa" /&gt;{{rp|56}}

===Rivalry===
Rivalry within organizations occurs for example when different groups at a given organization level fail to cooperate.&lt;ref name="papa" /&gt;{{rp|56}} For example, Papa gives an example of "corporate executives in a national department store chain" who "encountered territorial rivalry when they discovered that local stores within each of the company's major sales districts refused to cooperate with one another on sales promotions".&lt;ref name="papa" /&gt;{{rp|56}} "Stores within the same sales region literally were in competition with one another as well as with other department store chains"&lt;ref name="papa" /&gt;{{rp|57}} 

===Specialization===
Specialization can inhibit communication when organizations do not have uniformity within departments. Specialization can occur within procedures or jargon used by different departments. For example, when "different specialties use the same terms in different ways", this can create confusion and miscommunication. When this occurs organizations have trouble functioning properly and do not run smoothly.&lt;ref name="papa" /&gt;{{rp|57}}

===Motivation===
"Horizontal communication often fails simply because organization members are unwilling to expend the additional effort that it requires." "Horizontal communication may require contact with people in units that are well removed from our own. The channels and rules of interaction may be unclear. We do not really know these people. The need to communicate with them makes us uneasy or takes too much time, so we avoid or ignore it"&lt;ref name="papa" /&gt;{{rp|57}}&lt;ref name="Spillane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mir"/&gt;

'''Laura Smith Haviland''' (December 20, 1808- April 20, 1898) was an American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[suffragette]], and social reformer. She was an important figure in the history of the [[Underground Railroad]].

==Early years and family==
Laura Smith Haviland was born on December 20, 1808, in [[Kitley Township, Ontario|Kitley Township]], Ontario, Canada to American parents, Daniel Smith and Asenath "Sene" Blancher,&lt;ref&gt;Hinshaw, William Wade. ''Encyclopedia of American Quaker Genealogy. Vol. IV.'' Transcribed records from the Adrian Monthly Meeting, Michigan Territory. Note: Her first name is recorded as both "Asenath" and "Sene" in the Quaker Records. Sene was a short form of the name Asenath, not her full given name. She was born in Jamaica, VT.&lt;/ref&gt; who had immigrated shortly before her birth.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Haviland wrote that Daniel was "a man of ability and influence, of clear perceptions, and strong reasoning powers,"&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; while her mother Sene was "of a gentler turn, ... a quiet spirit, benevolent and kind to all, and much beloved by all who knew her."&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; The Smiths, farmers of modest means, were devout members of the [[Society of Friends]], better known as Quakers. Haviland's father was a minister in the Society and her mother was an [[Religious elder|Elder]].&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

Though the Quakers dressed plainly, and strictly forbade dancing, singing, and other pursuits they deemed frivolous, many of their views were progressive by the standards of the day.&lt;ref name=Eisenmann&gt;Eisenmann, Linda. ''Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States,'' pages 332-333. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quakers encouraged the equal education of men and women, an extraordinarily forward-thinking position in an age when most individuals were illiterate, and providing a woman with a thorough education was largely viewed as unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith ''Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics,'' Pages 1-3. Roxbury, MA: Roxbury Pub., 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith, R. Drew Page 111"&gt;Smith, R. Drew ''Freedom's Distant Shores: American Protestants and Post-colonial Alliances,'' Page 111. Waco: Baylor University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Quaker women as well as men acted as ministers.&lt;ref name="Smith, R. Drew Page 111"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cahn, Susan. ''Industry of Devotion: The Transformation of Women's Work in England,'' Page 115. New York: Columbia University Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; While most Quakers did not agitate vocally for abolition, the majority condemned slavery as brutal and unjust.&lt;ref name=Eisenmann/&gt; It was in this atmosphere that Haviland was raised.

In 1815, her family left Canada and returned to the United States, settling in the remote and sparsely populated town of [[Cambria, New York|Cambria]], in western New York.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; At the time there was no school near their home, and for the next six years Haviland's education consisted of little more than "a spelling lesson" given to her daily by her mother.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Haviland described herself as an inquisitive child, deeply interested in the workings of the world around her, who at a young age began questioning her parents about everything from scripture to Newton's [[Law of Universal Gravitation]]. Once she had mastered spelling, Haviland supplemented her meager education by devouring every book she could borrow from friends, relatives, and neighbors, reading everything from religious material to serious historical studies.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

At sixteen, Laura met Charles Haviland, Jr., a devout young Quaker, whose parents were both respected ministers. They were married on November 11, 1825, at Lockport, New York. According to Laura, Charles was a devoted husband and theirs was a happy marriage.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; They were the parents of eight children.

The Havilands spent the first four years of their marriage in Royalton Township, near Lockport, New York, before moving in September, 1829, to [[Raisin Township, Michigan|Raisin]], [[Lenawee County, Michigan|Lenawee County]] in the [[Michigan Territory]]. They settled three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from the homestead her parents acquired four years earlier.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Michigan was then a largely unsettled wilderness, but land was cheap, and there were a number of other Quakers in the vicinity.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

==Anti-slavery work and the Raisin Institute==
Haviland vividly recalled seeing African Americans verbally abused, and even physically assaulted, in Lockport, New York, when she was a child. These experiences, combined with the horrific descriptions in [[John Woolman]]'s history of the slave-trade, made an indelible impression.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The pictures of these crowded slave-ships, with the cruelties of the slave system after they were brought to our country, often affected me to tears ... My sympathies became too deeply enlisted for the poor negroes who were thus enslaved for time to efface.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Haviland and other members of the Raisin community helped [[Elizabeth Margaret Chandler]] organize the [[Logan Female Anti-Slavery Society]] in 1832. It was the first [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] organization in Michigan.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;&lt;ref name=Michigan&gt;''Laura Smith Haviland.'' Michigan Historical Center, Department of History, Arts and Libraries. The Official State of Michigan Website. http://www.michigan.gov/hal/0,1607,7-160-15481_19271_19357-163242--,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, in 1837, Haviland and her husband founded a "''manual labor school ... designed for indigent children,''" which was later known as the Raisin Institute. Haviland instructed the girls in household chores, while her husband and one of her brothers, Harvey Smith, taught the boys to perform farm work.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; At the Havilands' insistence, the school was open to all children, "regardless of race, creed, or sex." It was the first racially integrated school in [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name=Michigan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berson&gt;Berson, Robin Kadison. ''Marching to a Different Drummer: Unrecognized Heroes of American History,'' pages 114-120. Greenwood Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Haviland's white students, upon learning they were to study with African Americans, threatened to leave. Most were persuaded to remain, however, and Laura wrote that once the students were together in the classroom their prejudices "soon melted away."&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

In 1838, Harvey Smith sold his farm, and the proceeds were used to erect accommodations for fifty students. The Havilands expanded the school's curriculum, operating it more closely along the lines of traditional elementary and secondary schools.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; They then hired a graduate of [[Oberlin College]] to serve as the school's principal. Due to their diligence, the Raisin Institute was soon recognized as one of the best schools in the Territory.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

As the Havilands became more actively involved in anti-slavery work, tensions grew within the Quaker community.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; There was a split between the so-called "radical abolitionists," like the Havilands, who wanted immediate emancipation, and the majority of Orthodox Quakers. Although the Quakers condemned slavery, most did not approve of active participation in abolitionist societies.&lt;ref&gt;Grover, Kathryn. ''The Fugitive's Gibraltar: Escaping Slaves and Abolitionism in New Bedford, Massachusetts,'' page 32. Boston: Univ of Massachusetts Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; By 1839, in order to continue with their abolitionist work, the Havilands, her parents, and fourteen other like-minded Quakers, felt compelled to resign their membership.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinshaw, William Wade. ''Encyclopedia of American Quaker Genealogy. Vol. IV,'' Page 1366. Transcribed records from the Adrian Monthly Meeting, Michigan Territory.&lt;/ref&gt; They then joined a group of [[Methodist]]s known as the [[Wesleyans]], who were equally devoted to the abolitionist cause.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

In the spring of 1845, an epidemic of [[erysipelas]] killed six members of Haviland's family, including both of her parents, her husband, and her youngest child.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Haviland also fell ill, but survived. At thirty-six, Haviland found herself a widow with seven children to support, a farm to run, the Raisin Institute to manage, and substantial debts to repay.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Sadly, just two years later tragedy struck again, when her eldest son died.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Due to lack of funds, Haviland was forced to close the Raisin Institute in 1849.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

In spite of her personal losses, she continued with her abolitionist work, and in 1851, she helped organize the Refugee Home Society in [[Windsor, Ontario]], Canada. Fugitive slaves were settled there, a church and school were erected for them, and each family was given twenty-five acres to farm.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Philip S. ''History of Black Americans: From the Compromise of 1850 to the End of the Civil War,'' page 151. Greenwood Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Laura remained on for several months as the settlement's teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Philip S. ''History of Black Americans: From the Compromise of 1850 to the End of the Civil War,'' pages 151-152. Greenwood Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; She then traveled to Ohio, where, with her daughter Anna, she taught in a school founded for African American children in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] and [[Toledo, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

By 1856, she had raised enough funds to reopen the Raisin Institute, and returned to Michigan.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; The new curriculum included having former slaves give lectures about the realities of life on a slave plantation.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; The Institute closed once again in 1864, after most of the staff, and some of the students, enlisted to fight during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

==Work for the Underground Railroad==
During the 1830s, the Haviland family began hiding runaway slaves on their farm. Their home became the first [[Underground Railroad]] station established in Michigan.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; After her husband's death, Haviland continued to shelter fugitive slaves in her home, in some cases, personally escorting them to Canada.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; She played an important role in the Detroit branch of the group, where she was considered railroad "superintendent", with [[George DeBaptiste]] the "president"and William Lambert the "vice president" or "secretary".&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, Jacqueline L. From Midnight to Dawn: The Last Tracks of the Underground Railroad. Anchor, 2008. p200-209&lt;/ref&gt;

She also traveled to the South on multiple occasions to aid escaped slaves. Her first trip was made in 1846, in an effort to free the children of fugitive slaves, Willis and Elsie Hamilton. The children were still in the possession of their mother's former slave owner, John P. Chester, a tavern-keeper in [[Washington County, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1850 United States Census. The 4th Subdivision, Washington Co., TN, Page 113A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chester had learned of the Hamilton's whereabouts and sent slave-catchers after them. When that failed, Chester attempted to lure the Hamiltons to his plantation with the promise that they would be treated as freedmen and reunited with their children.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Suspecting a trap, Haviland went to [[Tennessee]] in their place, accompanied by her son Daniel and a student from the Raisin Institute, James Martin, who posed as Willis Hamilton.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Mr. Chester became irate once he realized Willis Hamilton was not with Mrs. Haviland. He held the trio at gunpoint, threatening to murder them, kidnap James Martin, and enslave him in Willis Hamilton's stead.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; They managed to escape, but Mr. Chester did not forget Laura Haviland. His family would continue to haunt her for fifteen years, pursuing her legally in court and privately with slave catchers, while barraging her with derogatory letters.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; The following letter was sent by Chester's son, Thomas K. Chester, in February 1847. It's provides a good example of the tone which permeated the Chester family's correspondence with Haviland:

{{quote|... By your cunning villainies you have deprived us of our just rights, of our own property. ... Thanks be to an all wise and provident God that, my father has more of that sable kind of busy fellows, greasy, slick, and fat; and they are not cheated to death out of their hard earnings by villainous and infernal abolitionists, whose philanthropy is interest, and whose only desire is to swindle the slave-holder out of his own property, and convert its labor to their own infernal aggrandizement ... Who do you think would parley with a thief, a robber of man's just rights, recognized by the glorious Constitution of our Union! Such a condescension would damn an honest man, would put modesty to the blush. What! To engage in a contest with you? A rogue, a damnable thief, a Negro thief, an out-breaker, a criminal in the sight of all honest men; ... I would rather be caught with another man's sheep on my back than to engage in such a subject, and with such an individual as old Laura Haviland, a damned nigger-stealer ...

You can tell Elsie that since our return my father bought her eldest daughter; that she is now his property and the mother of a likely boy, that I call Daniel Haviland after your pretty son. ... What do you think your portion will be at the great Day of Judgment? I think it will be the inner temple of hell.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;}}

Haviland responded, sarcastically thanking him for naming the child after her family and stating that she hoped ''"like Moses, may he become instrumental in leading his people away from a worse bondage than that of Egypt."''&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Enraged by what he deemed her insolence, Thomas Chester placed a bounty on Haviland's head. All throughout the South he circulated "hand-bills" ([[Flyer (pamphlet)|fliers]]) describing Mrs. Haviland, detailing her abolitionist work, naming her place of residence and offering $3000, a considerable sum at the time, to anyone willing to kidnap or murder her on his behalf.&lt;ref name=Michigan/&gt;

Three years later, after the passage of the [[Fugitive Slave Law]], the Chester family attempted to have Haviland tried under the new statute for "''stealing''" their slaves. Haviland not only ran the risk of being physically harmed by angry slave-owners, like the Chesters, or their slave-catchers, if found guilty of violating the Fugitive Slave Law she would also be subject to hefty fines and imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; Still, Haviland was determined to continue with her work, no matter what the personal cost:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... I would not for my right hand become instrumental in returning one escaped slave to bondage. I firmly, believe in our Declaration of Independence, that all men are created free and equal, and that no human being has a right to make merchandise of others born in humbler stations, and place them on a level with horses, cattle, and sheep, knocking them off the auction-block to the highest bidder, sundering family ties, and outraging the purest and tenderest feelings of human nature.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fortunately for Haviland, her case was brought before Judge Ross Wilkins, who sympathized with the abolitionists.&lt;ref name="Haviland"/&gt; The Chesters attempted to regain possession of the Hamiltons by force, but were prevented by Haviland and her neighbors. Judge Wilkins delayed her case, allowing Haviland to help the Hamiltons escape to Canada.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; In the end, Haviland evaded legal punishment.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

In addition to another failed rescue attempt, detailed in her autobiography, Haviland later made other, more successful journeys south that went unmentioned in her memoirs.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; In the guise of a white cook, and once even posing as a fair skinned [[Free people of color|free person of color]], she visited plantations and managed to help some slaves escape north.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, Julie Roy. ''The Great Silent Army of Abolitionism: Ordinary Women in the Antislavery Movement,'' page 221. University of North Carolina Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War and Reconstruction==
[[Image:Laura Haviland holding slave irons ca. 1864.jpg|thumb|right|Laura Haviland holding slave irons.]] During the Civil War, Laura toured many refugee camps and hospitals, even venturing onto the frontlines, to distribute supplies to displaced citizens, freed slaves, and soldiers.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

In the spring of 1865, the commissioner of the newly created [[Freedmen's Bureau]], General [[Oliver O. Howard]], named Haviland Inspector of Hospitals.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blanding, Leonard Clark. ''Genealogy of the Blanding Family,'' Page 496. Published privately by the author, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Haviland's actual duties consisted of far more than inspecting hospitals. She spent the next two years traveling through [[Virginia]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kansas]] and Washington, D.C., distributing supplies, reporting on the living conditions of Freedmen and indigent whites, organizing refugee camps, establishing schools, working as a teacher, volunteering as a nurse at Freedmen's hospitals, and giving public lectures.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; In an effort to help whites understand what the Freedmen had endured under slavery, she toured abandoned plantations and collected chains, irons, restraints, and other implements which had been used on slaves. Haviland transported these items north and exhibited them during her lectures.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; She also met personally with President [[Andrew Johnson]] to petition for the release of former slaves still being held in Southern prisons for attempting years before to escape slavery.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

While working at the Freedmen's Hospital in Washington, D.C., Haviland met and befriended [[Sojourner Truth]], who later recalled an incident that took place one day when they had gone into town to get supplies. Haviland suggested they take a [[Streetcar|street car]] back to the hospital. Truth described what happened next as follows:

{{quote|As Mrs. Haviland signaled the car, I stepped to one side as if to continue my walk and when it stopped I ran and jumped aboard. The conductor pushed me back, saying, 'Get out of the way and let this lady come in.' I said 'I am a lady, too.' We went with no further opposition 'til we were obliged to change cars. A man coming out as we were going into the next car asked if 'niggers were allowed to ride.' The conductor grabbed me by the shoulder and jerking me around, ordered me to get out.  I told him I would not.

Mrs. Haviland took hold of my other arm and said, 'Don't put her out.'  The conductor asked if I belonged to her. 'No,' replied Mrs. Haviland, 'She belongs to humanity.'&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, Dorothy. ''We are Your Sisters: Black Women in the Nineteenth Century,'' page 254. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The Haviland Home orphanage==
After the Civil War, the Freedmen's Aid Commission acquired the former Raisin Institute, renamed it the Haviland Home, and converted it into an orphanage for African American children. Its first residents were seventy-five homeless children brought by Haviland from Kansas.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; As other  children joined their ranks, and their numbers increased, many whites in Michigan became unnerved. They claimed that Haviland was burdening white taxpayers and demanded that Haviland Home be closed.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; Matters came to a head in 1867, when the orphanage was purchased by the American Missionary Association, who closed the orphanage, and literally threw the orphans out into the street.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

Haviland abandoned her work in Washington, D.C., to return to Michigan and help the children.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; She managed to collect enough donations to purchase the orphanage and began to manage it herself.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; By 1870, funds were extremely scarce. The situation became so dire that, at Haviland's urging, the state took over the orphanage and it became the Michigan Orphan Asylum.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

==Later years==
When the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] ended in 1877, many African Americans fled the South, where they were subject to attacks by racist individuals and groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; Thousands of African American men, women and children, crowded into makeshift refugee camps in Kansas.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; Determined to help, Haviland set out with her daughter Anna for Washington, D.C., where she testified about the appalling conditions at the camps, before traveling to Kansas with supplies for the refugees. Using her personal savings, Haviland purchased {{convert|240|acre|km2}} in Kansas for the Freedmen at one of the refugee camps to live on and farm.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
During her life, Laura Haviland not only combated slavery and worked to improve the living conditions of Freedmen, she was also actively involved in other social causes, advocating for [[women's suffrage]], and helping to organize the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] in Michigan.&lt;ref name=Michigan/&gt;

Laura Haviland died on April 20, 1898 in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], at the home of her brother, Samuel Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com. Historical Newspapers, Birth, Marriage, &amp; Death Announcements, 1851-2003 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2006. Original data: "Obituary of Laura S. Haviland" ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', April 21, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried next to her husband in the Raisin Valley Cemetery in Adrian, Michigan.

Symbolically, at Haviland's funeral, hymns were sung by a choir of white and African American singers, and then her casket was carried to the grave by a group white and African American pall-bearers.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

In recognition of her efforts, the town of [[Haviland, Kansas]] was named in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=4704 | title=Profile for Haviland, Kansas | publisher=[[ePodunk]] | accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Laura Haviland stands in front of the Lenawee County Historical Museum in Adrian, Michigan.&lt;ref name=Michigan/&gt; The inscription on the statue reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Tribute to a Life Consecrated to the Betterment of Humanity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Laura Smith Haviland Elementary School in [[Waterford, Michigan]] is named in her honor.

Laura Smith Haviland will be inducted into the National Abolition Hall of Fame in Peterboro, NY in October, 2018 (www.nationalabolitionhalloffameandmuseum.org)  https://newyorkhistoryblog.org/2018/07/08/hall-of-fame-inducts-three-who-resisted-fugitive-slave-laws/

A person who works in a mailroom is known as a '''mailroom clerk''' or '''mailboy''' and the head person (sometimes the only person) is called the [[postmaster]]. The mailroom is responsible for a company's incoming and outgoing mail. A mailroom clerk prepares outgoing mail and packages prior to their being sent out via the post office or other carrier. 

In a large organization, the mailroom is the central hub of the [[internal mail]] system and the interface with external mail.  The postmaster manages the department, clerks assist them and mailboys deliver mail for other employees in different departments using a mail cart or a [[Flatbed trolley|trolley]] doing regular rounds throughout the day.  Sometimes the mailboys will trolley sort using the departmental slots on the trolley to reduce work at the central hub and to speed internal mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a-p-systems.com/acatalog/Online_Catalogue_MAILROOM__222.html |title=A P Systems MAILROOM |publisher=A-p-systems.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a small organization, or within a department or a large organization, a mailroom can be associated with the '''breakroom'''; these rooms can be combined into one. For instance, a mailroom can contain an area for employees to take a [[Break (work)|break]]. Besides [[pigeon-hole messagebox]]es, this area might have a [[kitchenette]] with a coffee maker, microwave, table and chairs, refrigerator, sink, pantry, or oven.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">'''Making Sense of Abstinence''' is a collection of 16 lessons for teaching about [[sexual abstinence]] in the context of comprehensive [[sexuality education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getthefactsny.org/educators/documents/NewMakingSenseFlyer.pdf|title=Empire State Acts|website=Getthefactsny.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Minnesota Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy, Prevention, and Parenting, it is "a [[curriculum]] that takes [[abstinence]] beyond a one-dimensional scope of 'just say no,'...[utilizing] positive and engaging activities to help young people think about [[abstinence]] in a way that values their ability to make decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moappp.org/Documents/MakingSenseAbstinence.pdf|format=PDF|title=Making Sense of Abstinence : Lessons for Comprehensive Sexuality Education|website=Moappp.org|date=February 8, 2006|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample lessons include such titles as "So What's An Abstinence Anyway?" "Hey, Mom?  Hey, Dad? Hey...Gram?  Can We Talk about Abstinence?" "Just Say Know," "Masturbation:  A Touchy Subject," "Handling Horny," and "Some Day:  Making the Transition from Sexual Abstinence".

The manual has received praise from sexuality educators for expanding the way [[sexuality education]] teaches about abstinence, and for teaching the subject in a positive way, unlike other fear-based approaches.  For example, the online journal "Sexual Intelligence" praised "Making Sense of Abstinence" for "not treating kids like robotic idiots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualintelligence.org/newsletters/issue71.html#four|title=Sexual Intelligence by Marty Klein, Ph.D.|website=Sexualintelligence.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abstinence-only]] advocates have criticized the manual for including such topics as [[outercourse]] and [[masturbation]], behaviors they believe should not be acknowledged.  Critics also claim that teenagers should not learn information to protect themselves when their abstinence decisions change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedom.us/pdf/abstinence_ed.pdf|format=PDF|title=Faith and Freedom|website=Faithandfreedom.us|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of "Making Sense of Abstinence" state that neither the "Just say no" approach, nor the "Always say yes," is appropriate for abstinence education.  Rather, they emphasize that teens need complete information to help them make the best decisions for themselves.

The '''mature minor doctrine''' is an American term for the [[statutory]], [[regulatory]], or [[common law]] policy accepting that an [[emancipated minor|unemancipated minor]] [[patient]] may possess the [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]] to choose or reject a particular [[health care]] [[Therapy|treatment]], sometimes without the knowledge or agreement of parents, and should be permitted to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''West's encyclopedia of American law'', Volume 8, West Publishing, 1998, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; It is now generally considered a form of patients [[rights]]; formerly, the '''mature minor rule''' was largely seen as protecting [[health care providers]] from [[criminal]] and civil [[cause of action|claims]] by parents of minors at least 15.&lt;ref&gt;''Legal issues in pediatrics and adolescent medicine'' by Angela Roddey Holder, Yale University Press, 1985, page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions may [[codification (law)|codify]] an age of medical consent, accept the judgment of [[licensure|licensed]] providers regarding an individual minor, or accept a formal [[court decision]] following a request that a patient be designated a mature minor, or may rely on some combination. For example, patients at least 16 may be assumed to be mature minors for this purpose,&lt;ref&gt;"Definitions", ''USLegal.com'', [http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/mature-minor-doctrine/ Retrieved 2011-05-16], "Mature minor doctrine is a legal principle which... has been consistently applied in cases where the minor is sixteen years or older"&lt;/ref&gt; patients aged 13 to 15 may be designated so by licensed providers, and pre-teen patients may be so-designated after evaluation by an [[Government agency|agency]] or [[court]]. The mature minor doctrine is sometimes connected with enforcing [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|confidentiality]] of minor patients from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mature Minor Rule: Teens and patient confidentiality'', Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County, [http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/personal/famplan/providers/matureminor.aspx Retrieved 2011-05-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute==
In the United States, a typical statute lists: ''"Who may consent [or withhold consent for] surgical or medical treatment or procedures."''
:"...Any unemancipated minor of sufficient intelligence to understand and appreciate the consequences of the proposed surgical or medical treatment or procedures, for himself."&lt;ref&gt;''Mississippi Code'', [http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/41/041/0003.htm Retrieved 2011-05-13] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720125628/http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/41/041/0003.htm |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''2010 Arkansas Code'', [http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-20/subtitle-2/chapter-9/subchapter-6/20-9-602/ Retrieved 2011-05-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical emancipation==
{{See also|Emancipation of minors}}
By definition, a "mature minor" has been found to have the [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] to make serious medical decisions alone. By contrast, "medical emancipation" formally releases children from some parental involvement requirements but does not necessarily grant that decision making to children themselves. Pursuant to statute, several jurisdictions grant medical emancipation to a minor who has become [[pregnant]] or requires [[reproductive health|sexual-health]] services, thereby permitting medical treatment without parental consent and, often, confidentiality from parents. A limited [[legal guardian|guardianship]] may be appointed to make medical decisions for the medically emancipated minor and the minor may not be permitted to refuse or even choose treatment.&lt;ref&gt;''Children and the Law'' by Douglas E. Abrams and Sarah H. Ramsey, West Group, 2003, page 769&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One early U.S. case of significance, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10967297783373086168&amp;q=431+P.2d+719.&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Smith v. Seibly''], 72 Wn.2d 16, 431 [[Pacific Reporter|P.2d]] 719 (1967), before the [[Washington Supreme Court]], establishes precedent on the mature minor doctrine. The plaintiff, Albert G. Smith, an 18-year-old married father, was suffering from [[myasthenia gravis]], a progressive disease. Because of this, Smith expressed concern that his wife might become burdened in caring for him for their existing child  and possibly for additional children. On March 9, 1961, while still 18, Smith requested a [[vasectomy]]. His doctor required [[Informed consent|written consent]], which Smith provided, and the [[surgery]] was performed. Later, after reaching Washington's statutory [[age of majority]], then 21, the doctor was sued by Smith, who now claimed that he had been a minor and thus unable to grant surgical or medical consent. The Court rejected Smith's argument: "Thus, age, intelligence, maturity, training, experience, economic independence or lack thereof, general conduct as an adult and freedom from the control of parents are all factors to be considered in such a case [involving consent to surgery]."

The court further quoted another recently decided case, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18043554202269328547&amp;q=422+P.2d+812&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Grannum v. Berard''], 70 Wn.2d 304, 307, 422 [[Pacific Reporter|P.2d]] 812 (1967): "The mental capacity necessary to consent to a surgical operation is a question of fact to be determined from the circumstances of each individual case." The court explicitly stated that a minor may grant surgical consent even without formal emancipation.

Especially since the 1970s, older pediatric patients sought to make autonomous decisions regarding their own treatment and sometimes sued successfully to do so.&lt;ref&gt;"Affirming the Decisions Adolescents Make about Life and Death" by Robert F. Weir and Charles Peters, ''Hastings Center Report'', Vol 27 No. 6, November–December 1997, Hastings Center, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; The decades of accumulated evidence tended to demonstrate that children are capable of participating in medical decision-making in a meaningful way;&lt;ref&gt;"Ethical problems in pediatric critical care: Consent" by Christine A. Zawistowski and Joel E. Frader, ''Critical Care Medicine'', Vol 31 Issue 5, May 2003, page S407-S410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mature Minors Should Have the Right to Refuse Life-Sustaining Medical Treatment" by Melinda T. Derish and Kathleen Vanden Heuvel, ''The Journal of Law Medicine and Ethics'', Vol 28 Issue 2, June 2000, pages 109-124&lt;/ref&gt; and legal and medical communities have demonstrated an increasing willingness of formally affirming decisions made by young people, even regarding life and death.&lt;ref&gt;"Children's Competence to Participate in Healthcare Decisions" by Susan M. Beidler and Susan B. Dickey, ''JONA's Healthcare Law Ethics and Regulation'', Vol 3 Issue 3, September 2001, page 80-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs have repeatedly influenced a patient's decision to choose treatment or not. In a case in 1989 in Illinois, [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/you-must-be-this-old-to-die/384303/ a 17 year old female Jehovah's Witness] was permitted to refuse necessary life saving treatments.

In 1990, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Patient Self-Determination Act]]; even though key provisions apply only to patients over age 18,&lt;ref&gt;''The Patient Self-Determination Act: An Early Look at Implementation'' by Mathy Mezey and Beth Latimer, ''Hastings Center Report'', January–February 1993, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; the legislation advanced patient involvement in decisionmaking. The [[West Virginia Supreme Court]], in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14842078072813819970&amp;q=422+SE2d+827&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Belcher v. Charleston Area Medical Center''], 422 [[South Eastern Reporter|S.E.2d]] 827, 188 W.Va. 105 (1992), defined a "mature minor" exception to [[parental consent]], according consideration to seven factors to be weighed regarding such a minor: age, ability, experience, education, exhibited judgment, conduct, and appreciation of relevant risks and consequences.&lt;ref&gt;"Mature Minors and Emancipated Minors", Health Sciences Center, West Virginia University, [http://www.wvendoflife.org/MediaLibraries/WVCEOLC/Media/laws/Minors.pdf Retrieved 2011-08-04] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226055543/http://www.wvendoflife.org/MediaLibraries/WVCEOLC/Media/laws/Minors.pdf |date=2011-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withholding of consent==
{{See also|Informed refusal}}

===United States===
In the United States, [[bodily integrity]] has long been considered a [[Natural and legal rights|common law right]]; the United States Supreme Court, in 1891's ''[[Union Pacific Railway Company v. Botsford]]'', found, "No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable [[Rational-legal authority|authority of law]]." The Supreme Court in 1990 (''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'') allowed that "constitutionally protected [[Claim rights and liberty rights|liberty interest]] in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred" in the ''[[Due process#The U.S. Constitution|Due Process]] Clause'' of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], but the Court refrained from explicitly establishing what would have been a newly enumerated right. Nevertheless, lower courts have increasingly held that competent patients have the right to refuse any treatment for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Towards the right to be killed?" by Trudo Lemmens, ''British Medical Bulletin'', Vol 52 No. 2, British Council, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] interpreted the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to have already adopted major aspects of mature minor doctrine, concluding,
:Although the United States Supreme Court has not broadened this constitutional right of minors beyond [[Abortion in the United States|abortion cases]], the [Illinois] [[appellate court]] found such an extension "inevitable." ...Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has not held that a [[Constitutional right|constitutionally based right]] to [[Informed refusal|refuse medical treatment]] exists, either for adults or minors. ...[U.S. Supreme Court] cases do show, however, that no "[[bright line]]" age restriction of 18 is tenable in restricting the rights of mature minors, [thus] mature minors may possess and exercise rights regarding medical care... If the evidence is clear and convincing that the minor is mature enough to appreciate the consequences of her actions, and that the minor is mature enough to exercise the judgment of an adult, then the mature minor doctrine affords her the common law right to consent to or refuse medical treatment [including life and death cases, with some considerations].&lt;ref&gt;''In re E.G.'', 549 [[North Eastern Reporter|N.E.2d]] 322, 133 Ill. 2d 98, Supreme Court of Illinois, November 13, 1989, [http://il.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19891113_0001777.IL.htm/qx Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

An ongoing case of Z.M is being heard in Maryland regarding the minor's right to refuse chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.state.md.us/cosappeals/pdfs/201610schedule.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In Connecticut, Cassandra C. a seventeen year old was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to receive treatment. The court decided that Cassandra was not mature enough to make medical decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://campbelllawobserver.com/the-choice-is-not-always-yours-a-minors-right-to-make-medical-decisions/|title=The Choice is Not Always Yours: A Minor’s Right to Make Medical Decisions|newspaper=Campbell Law Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In 2009, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruling in ''[[A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)|A.C. v. Manitoba]]''&lt;!-- This article will be added; please do not "fix" redlink.---&gt; [2009] SCC 30 (CanLII) found that children ''may'' make life and death decisions about their medical treatment. In the majority opinion, [[Puisne Justice|Justice]] [[Rosalie Abella]] wrote:
:"The result of this [decision] is that young people under 16 will have the right to demonstrate mature medical decisional capacity. ...If, after a careful analysis of the young person’s ability to exercise mature and independent judgment, the court is persuaded that the necessary level of maturity exists, the young person’s views ought to be respected."
A "dissenting"&lt;ref&gt;That is, dissenting to the disposition of this specific case rather than the larger point of law&lt;/ref&gt; opinion by Justice [[Ian Binnie]] would have gone further:
:"At common law, proof of capacity entitles the “mature minor” to exercise personal autonomy in making medical treatment decisions free of parental or judicial control. ...[A] young person with capacity is entitled to make the treatment decision, not just to have ‘input’ into a [[judge]]’s consideration of what the judge believes to be the young person’s best interests."&lt;ref&gt;"A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)", Supreme Court of Canada, June 26, 2009, Docket 31955, [http://www.lewisday.ca/ldlf_files/pdf/AC.pdf Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;
Analysts note that the Canadian decision merely requires that younger patients be permitted a ''[[Hearing (law)|hearing]]'', and still allows a judge to "decide whether or not to order a medical procedure on an unwilling minor".&lt;ref&gt;"Charter Offers No Protection from Forced Blood Transfusion for Young Jehovah’s Witness" by Jim Young, Center for Constitutional Studies, July 2, 2009, [http://www.law.ualberta.ca/centres/ccs/news/?id=313 Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "odalisque" is French in form and originates from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''odalık'', meaning "[[maid|chambermaid]]", from ''oda'', "chamber" or "room". It can also be [[transliterated]] ''odahlic'', ''odalisk'', and ''odaliq''.

Joan DelPlato has described the term's shift in meaning from Turkish to English and French:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The English and French term odalisque (rarely odalique) derives from the Turkish 'oda', meaning "chamber"; thus an odalisque originally meant a chamber girl or attendant. In western usage, the term has come to refer specifically to the harem [[concubine]]. By the eighteenth century the term odalisque referred to the eroticized artistic genre in which a nominally eastern woman lies on her side on display for the spectator.&lt;ref name="delplato1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Multiple Wives, Multiple Pleasures: Representing the Harem, 1800–1875 |first=Joan |last=DelPlato |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=2002 |page=9 |isbn=0838638805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin as the Turkish ''odalık''==
[[File:Odalisque with an orange.JPG|thumb|300px|''Odalisque with an orange'' by [[Angélique Bègue]] (2014)]]
An ''odalık'' was not a concubine of the harem, but a maid, although it was possible that she could become one. An ''odalık'' was ranked at the bottom of the [[social stratification]] of a harem, serving not the man of the household, but rather, his concubines and wives as personal chambermaids. ''Odalık'' were usually slaves given as gifts to the sultan by wealthy Turkish men. Generally, an ''odalık'' was never seen by the sultan but instead remained under the direct supervision of his mother, the [[Valide Sultan]].

If an ''odalık'' was of extraordinary beauty or had exceptional talents in dancing or singing, she would be trained as a possible concubine. If selected, an ''odalık'' trained as a court lady would serve the sultan sexually and only after such sexual contact would she change in status, becoming thenceforth one of the [[Queen consort|consort]]s of the sultan.

In contrast to European depictions of nude harem women, they more often wore androgynous robes resembling those worn by the male pages of the palace. The conditions of the Ottoman harem "resembled a monastery for young girls more than the bordello of European imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Necipoğlu |first=Gülru |title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapı Palace in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries |date=1991 |place=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-14050-0 |pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later western usage of the term==
[[File:Gustave Léonard de Jonghe - The Afternoon Siesta.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Reclining Odalisque'', painted by [[Gustave Léonard de Jonghe]], c. 1870]]
[[W. S. Gilbert]] refers to the "Grace of an odalisque on a divan" in Colonel Calverley's song [[Patience (opera)#Musical numbers|"If You Want A Receipt For That Popular Mystery"]] from the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]].''

In popular use, the word ''odalisque'' also may refer to a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], concubine or [[paramour]] of a wealthy man.

During the 19th century, ''odalisques'' became common fantasy figures in the artistic movement known as [[Orientalism]], being featured in many erotic paintings from that era. 

By the later 19th century, Turkish writers such as Melek Hanum used the word odalisque to refer to slave-concubines when writing in English:&lt;blockquote&gt;
If any lady possesses a pretty-looking slave, the fact soon gets known. The gentlemen who wish to buy an odalisque or a wife, make their offers. Many Turks, indeed, prefer to take a slave as a wife, as, in such case, there is no need to dread fathers, mothers, or brothers-in-law, and other undesirable relations.&lt;ref name="melekhanum"&gt;{{cite book |title=Thirty years in the harem|first=Melek|last=Hanum |publisher=Chapman and Hall|year=1872|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, the [[Law Society of British Columbia]] brought a discipline hearing against an unnamed lawyer for referring to another lawyer's client as living with an odalisque. The Law Society found the use of the word, though an extremely poor choice, did not rise to the level of professional misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/lsbc/apps/hearings/viewreport.cfm?hearing_id=575 The Law Society of British Columbia: "Decision of the Hearing Panel on Facts and Determination"]&lt;/ref&gt;

New open-source religions may develop their rituals, praxes, or systems of beliefs through a continuous process of refinement and dialogue among participating practitioners.

==Origin==

In 1994, with his essay, "The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS," the scholar and novelist [[Umberto Eco]] popularized the use of religious metaphors in comparing [[operating system]] design and user experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eco|first1=Umberto|title=The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS|journal=Espresso|date=September 30, 1994|url=http://cliffarnold.com/macvdos.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, the term "open-source religion" began appearing in technology magazines as a reference to the open-source [[Linux]] operating system's organizing principle and as an analogy for highlighting the philosophical differences between advocates of open-source vs. proprietary software .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liebmann|first1=Lenny|title=Say Hello to the 'Lintel' Reformation|journal=Computerworld|date=May 10, 1999|volume=33|issue=19|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90foRW8FHpkC&amp;pg=PT31&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Ed|title=Apple padlocks UI decor|journal=InfoWorld|date=June 6, 2001|volume=23|issue=24|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[Daniel Kriegman]] began describing a religion he invented called Ozacua (later Yoism) as "the world's first opensource religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozacua: the Living Religion (5 April 2001) |url=http://www.ozacua.com/ |website=ozacua.com |publisher=Daniel Kriegman |accessdate=11 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010419072235/http://www.ozacua.com/ |archivedate=April 19, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovink|first1=Geert|title=Dark Fiber: Tracking Critical Internet Culture|date=2002|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-12249-9|page=334|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_7YWf9WpwYC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=religion&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of an "open source religion" was further expanded upon by the media theorist, [[Douglas Rushkoff]] in his book, ''Nothing's Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003), where he offered the following description as an introduction to [[Open Source Judaism]]:
:An open source religion would work the same way as open source software development: it is not kept secret or mysterious at all. Everyone contributes to the codes we use to comprehend our place in the universe. We allow our religion to evolve based on the active participation of its people....An open source relationship to religion would likewise take advantage of the individual points of view of its many active participants to develop its more resolved picture of the world and our place within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|page=111|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discordianism, Copyleft, and open-source software===
[[File:Principia Discordia page "00075-Page 00088".jpg|thumb|Page of the Principia Discordia that includes the following Copyright disclaimer, "Ⓚ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED – Reprint what you like," the earliest example of what would become a declaration of [[copyleft]].]]
[[File:Circled latin capital letter k.svg|thumb|Discordian reference to the mythological Kallisti, or [[Apple of Discord]], by way of a kosher food symbol in place of a conventional Copyright symbol.]]
Before the coinage of the term [[open-source]] in 1998 or even the birth of the [[Free Software]] movement, the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', a [[Discordian]] religious text written by [[Malaclypse the Younger|Greg Hill]] with [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]], included the following Copyright disclaimer in its 4th edition (1970), "Ⓚ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED – Reprint what you like." By the summer of 1970, the implications of the disclaimer were being discussed in other [[Underground Press|underground publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clutterbuck|first1=Brenton|title=Chasing Eris: An Interlude on Copyleft|url=http://historiadiscordia.com/chasing-eris-an-interlude-on-copyleft/|website=Historia Discordia|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Commercial publishers are not likely to be interested in the ''Principia'' due, at least, to the counter copyright on it–for, if they had a good seller, then other publishers could print it out from under them. Consequently publication and distribution will have to occur spontaneously, thru the “underground”, as alternative cultures learn to meet their own needs and provide their own services. This non-commercial limitation of the ''Principia'' is to provide less limitations in other respects, and it is not an accident. The ''Principia'' is not simply a handbook, it is a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Greater Poop|date=July–August 1970|issue=30|page=1|url=http://historiadiscordia.com/greg-hills-discordian-newsletter-the-greater-poop/greg_hill-197007_08-the_greater_poop-poop30_page_00001/|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Via the counterculture, by the mid-1970s, the concept had influenced a generation of Discordians including the nascent hacker culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buxton|first1=Kristin|title=The Lifecycle of the Principia Discordia: The dissemination of the religion disguised as a joke and joke disguised as a religion|url=http://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/articles/principia-discordia|website=The Lazarus Corporation|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project to create [[Tiny BASIC]] was proposed in Bob Albrecht and [[Dennis Allison]]'s ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal|Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia]]'', a journal of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]], a small group of computer hobbyists who began meeting in 1975 around [[Silicon Valley]]. The first lines of the source code for Tiny Basic as released in 1976 by [[Li-Chen Wang]] stated ‘(ↄ) COPYLEFT ALL WRONGS RESERVED’. In 1984/5 programmer [[Don Hopkins]] sent [[Richard Stallman]] a letter labeled "[[Copyleft]]—[[all rights reversed]]". Stallman chose the phrase to identify his free software method of distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |last= Stallman |first= Richard  |year= 1999 |publisher= O'Reilly Media |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |pages= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Discordianism and "Kopyleft" remain part of the culture of Discordianism, as explained by the Discordian Rev. Dr. Jon Swabey in his ''Apocrypha Discordia.''
:Discordianism and the concept of KopyLeft go hand in hand. Although just a small part of the counter-culture gestalt, I believe that the ''Principia Discordia'' was probably one of the earliest expressions and strongest champions of this idea, which has since seen such concepts as the [[Open Source Software]] initiative, with endeavours such as the [[Linux]] Operating System.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swabey|first1=Jon|title=Apocrypha Discordia|date=2001|url=http://www.23ae.com/files/apocrypha2.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open-source in established religious traditions==
For established traditions whose canonical works, records of discourse, and inspired artworks reside in the [[public domain]], keeping these works open and available in the face of proprietary interests has inspired several open-source initiatives. Open access to resources and [[adaptive reuse]] of shared materials under [[open content]] licensing provide a structure by which communities can innovate new religious systems collaboratively under the aegis of copyright law. For some religious movements, however, [[public access]] and [[literacy]], and the potential of adaptive reuse also provide an opportunity for innovation and reform within established traditions. In an interview by [[Alan Jacobs (academic)|Alan Jacobs]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine on open-source religion, Aharon Varady (founding director of the [[Open Siddur Project]]) explained that "cultures breathe creativity like we breathe oxygen" arguing that open-source provides one possible strategy for keeping a tradition vibrant while also preserving historical works as non-proprietary during a period of transition from analog to digital media.&lt;ref  name="jacobs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=The Potential and Promise of Open-Source Judaism|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/the-potential-and-promise-of-open-source-judaism/258394/|work=The Atlantic Magazine Online|publisher=The Atlantic Magazine|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-source Judaism===
Although a work of radical 1960s Jewish counterculture rather than an explicitly religious work, the satirical songbook ''Listen to the mocking bird'' (Times Change Press, 1971) by [[the Fugs]]' [[Tuli Kupferberg|Naphtali "Tuli" Kupferberg]] contains the earliest explicit mention of "copyleft" in a copyright disclaimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kupferberg|first1=Naphtali|title=Listen to the Mocking Bird: Satiric Songs to Tunes You Know|date=1971|publisher=Times Change Press|location=Washington, New Jersey|url=https://archive.org/stream/2917619.0001.001.umich.edu#page/2/mode/2up|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Open Source Judaism|open-source efforts in Judaism]] begin to appear in 1988 with the [[free software]] code written for calculating the Hebrew calendar included in [[Emacs]]. After the popularization of the term "[[open-source]]" in 1998, essays and manifestos linking open-source and Judaism began appearing in 2002 among Jewish thinkers familiar with trends in new media and open-source software. In August 2002, Aharon Varady proposed the formation of an "[[Open Siddur Project|Open Siddur]]," an open-source licensed [[user-generated content]] project for digitizing liturgical materials and writing the code needed for the [[web-to-print]] publishing of [[Siddur]]im (Jewish prayer books).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varady |first1=Aharon |title=update 2002-08-08 |url=http://aharon.varady.net/omphalos/2002/08/update-2002-08-08 |website=Aharon's Omphalos |publisher=Aharon Varady |accessdate=16 June 2014 }} and {{cite web|last=Varady |first=Aharon |title=The Open Siddur Project |url=http://varady.net/open_siddur/ |work=Aharon Varady's Homepage |publisher=The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine |accessdate=5 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021013153654/http://varady.net/open_siddur/ |archivedate=October 13, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, media theorist [[Douglas Rushkoff]] began articulating his understanding of open-source in Judaism. "The object of the game, for me," Rushkoff explained, "was to recontextualize Judaism as an entirely Open Source proposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rushkoff |first1=Douglas |title=Open-Source Religion |url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html |website=G4 TV - The Screen Savers |publisher=G4 TV |accessdate=23 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312093353/http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Open-Source Judaism.svg|thumb|Open-Source Judaism logo]]
The term "Open Source Judaism" first appeared in [[Douglas Rushkoff]]'s book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003). Rushkoff employed the term "Open Source" to describe a democratic organizational model for collaborating in a commonly held source: the [[Hebrew Bible]] and other essential works of [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Rushkoff conceived of Judaism as essentially an open-source religion which he conceived as, "the contention that religion is not a pre-existing truth but an ongoing project. It may be divinely inspired, but it is a creation of human beings working together. A collaboration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Rushkoff, open-source offered the promise of enacting change through a new culture of collaboration and improved access to sources. "Anyone who wants to do Judaism should have access to Judaism. Judaism is not just something that you do, it's something you enact. You've got to learn the code in order to alter it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lehmann-Haupt|first=Rachel|title=Is Judaism Becoming Irrelevant?|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/16146/is_judaism_becoming_irrelevant|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=AlterNet|date=2003-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 publication of Rushkoff's book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothingsacred.html|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|author=Douglas Rushkoff|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an online forum dedicated to "Open Source Judaism" inspired several online projects in creating web applications for generating custom made [[haggadah|haggadot]] for [[Passover]], however neither content nor code for these were shared under [[free content|free-culture]] [[license compatibility|compatible]] [[open content]] terms.

Beginning with the [[Open Siddur Project]] in 2009, open-source projects in Judaism began to publicly share their software code with open-source licenses and their content with [[free content|free-culture]] [[license compatibility|compatible]] [[open content]] licenses. The explicit objectives of these projects also began to differ from Rushkoff's "Open Source Judaism." Rather than seek reforms in religious practices or doctrines, these projects used Open Content licenses to empower users to access and create their own resources from a common store of canonical texts and associated translations and metadata. By 2012, [[Open Source Judaism|open-source projects in Judaism]] were mainly active in facilitating collaboration in sharing resources for transcribing and translating existing works in the Public Domain, and for adaptation and dissemination of works being shared by copyright owners under Open Content licenses.&lt;ref name="jacobs"/&gt;

===Open-source Yoga===
Following proprietary claims on Yoga movements by some Yoga instructors, Open Source Yoga Unity was formed in 2003 to assert that Yoga movements reside in the [[public domain]]. The organization provides a common voice, and the pooling of resources, to legally resist the application of a proprietary [[Copyright]] to any Yoga style thereby "ensuring its continued natural unfettered practice for all to enjoy and develop." The organization explains, that "while we appreciate the teachings of yoga teachers, we do not believe that they have the legal right to impose control over another's Yoga teaching or practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Open Source Yoga Unity|url=https://www.facebook.com/yogaunity/info?tab=page_info|website=Open Source Yoga Unity Facebook Page|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (2005), the organization settled out of court, avoiding a federal court hearing to determine whether Bikram Choudhury’s copyrighted sequence of 26 poses and two breathing exercises could be legally protected.&lt;ref&gt;Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (N.D. Cal., 4/1/05, No. C 03–3182 PJH)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-source Wicca===
Concerned with the lack of a source text containing documentation on [[Wicca]] in the tradition of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], Dr. [[Leo Ruickbie]] self-published ''Open Source Wicca: The Gardnerian Tradition'' (2007) for "putting you back in control of spirituality." The work, a collection of "the original foundation documents of Wicca" authored between 1949 and 1961, was published [http://www.witchology.com/contents/opensourcewicca/gardnerianindex.php digitally] and in print under a [[Creative Commons]] [[Attribution (copyright)|Attribution]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruickbie|first1=Leo|title=Open Source Wicca|url=http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Wicca|publisher=Leo Ruickbie|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open-source in establishing new religions==
Several projects aiding individuals and communities in formulating their own belief systems cite inspiration from ideas common to the [[open-source movement]] and self-identify as open-source religions or religious initiatives. The establishment of new religions through open-source methods is closely related to [[chaos magic]], which emphasizes the pragmatic use of belief systems and the creation of new and unorthodox methods,&lt;ref name="New Encyclopedia of the Occult"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greer|first=John Michael|title=The New Encyclopedia of the Occult|year=2003|publisher=Llewellyn Publications|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=9781567183368|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; the difference being that any knowledge gained through such innovation is shared openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A.o.C.|first1=Fra.|title=Open Source Magic|url=http://osogd.org/library/the-aerodynamic-biscuits/142-2/|publisher=Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoism===
[[File:Yoism symbol.svg|thumb|Yoism]]
According to its founder, [[Daniel Kriegman]], Yoism (founded 1994) combines rational inquiry, empiricism, and science with [[Spinoza]]n or [[Einstein]]ian [[pantheism]].&lt;ref name=DemocratAndChronile&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/409|title=Civil commitment still evolving in N.Y.|author=Gary Craig|date=2011-04-11|publisher=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/395|title=Open to Revisions|first=Sam|last=Kean|date=May–June 2009|work=Search Magazine|accessdate=2010-09-19|quote=[Daniel Kriegman] based the [...] religion on a cocktail of rational inquiry, empiricism, and science.

===Human Worship===

Human Worship, or Open Religion, is an "eternal tradition of considering [[Human]] absolute, highest value", "considering God as Human continuation to infinity through Soul", described in its sacred book, shared in [[public domain]] by the formula "[[All rights reserved]] for [[God]]. Open Soul Holy [[Scripture]] of Human Worship is word of God, common heritage of Humankind, published anonymously, free for copying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Soul: Holy Scripture of Human Worship|url=https://www.academia.edu/34660139/Open_Soul_Holy_Scripture_of_Human_Worship|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blessing gesture and sacred sign of Open Religion is the [[circle]] or [[zero]],  with the human in the center of [[coordinates]]. Human Worshippers bow to every human [[soul]], laying the hand on [[heart]] and saying "Believe in yourself!". They organize "soul societies" for [[missionary]] work, [[friendship]], [[love]] and common [[joy]]. Also they believe in every human  having the capacity to be a [[prophet]], every human action to be [[prayer]] and all consequences as [[revelation]] from God, claiming that practical experience inspires true [[faith]] and [[skeptics]] are the same holy persons as prophets.

'''''Our Bodies, Ourselves''''' is a book about [[women's health]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] produced by the nonprofit organization [[Our Bodies Ourselves (organization)|Our Bodies Ourselves]] (originally called the Boston Women's Health Book Collective). First published in the late 1960s, it contains information related to many aspects of women's health and sexuality, including: sexual health, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[birth control]], [[abortion]], [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]], violence and abuse, and the [[menopause]]. The most recent edition of the book was published in 2011. The book was revolutionary in that it encouraged women to celebrate their sexuality, including chapters on reproductive rights, lesbian sexuality, and sexual independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://equalityarchive.com/history/taking-health-into-their-own-hands/|title=Boston Women's Health Collective {{!}} Equality Archive|date=2015-11-03|work=Equality Archive|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move towards women’s active engagement with their actual sexual desires was contradicting the popular gendered myth of &lt;ref&gt;Feminist Theory Reader&lt;/ref&gt; “women as docile, and passive,” and “men as active and aggressive” in a sexual relationship.

The book has been translated and adapted by women's groups around the world and is available in 29 languages. Sales for all the books exceed four million copies.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Norsigian, Vilunya Diskin, Paula Doress-Worters, Jane Pincus, Wendy Sanford, and Norma Swenson.

==History==
The health seminar that inspired the booklet was organized in 1969 by [[Nancy Miriam Hawley]] at Boston's [[Emmanuel College, Boston|Emmanuel College]]. "We weren't encouraged to ask questions, but to depend on the so-called experts," Hawley told ''[[Women's eNews]]''. "Not having a say in our own health care frustrated and angered us. We didn't have the information we needed, so we decided to find it on our own."&lt;ref name="womensenews"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ginty |first=Molly M. |url=http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1820/context/archive |title=Our Bodies, Ourselves Turns 35 Today |publisher=Women's eNews |date=May 4, 2004 |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903164405/http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1820/context/archive |archivedate=September 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this goal, the book contained information intended to guide women on "how to maneuver the American health care system, with subsections called 'The Power and Role of Male Doctors,' 'The Profit Motive in Health Care,'" 'Women as Health Care Workers,' and 'Hospitals.'&lt;ref name="Schneir, Miriam 1994"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism in Our Time: The Essential Writings, World War II to the Present|last=Boston Women's Health Book Collective|first=|publisher=Vintage|year=1994|isbn=9780679745082|editor-last=Schneir|editor-first=Miriam|location=New York|pages=352, 357|chapter=Our Bodies, Ourselves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original writers of the book stated four main reasons for creating it. First, that personal experiences provide a valuable way to understand one's own body beyond the mere facts that experts can provide, creating an empowering learning experience. Second, this kind of learning meant that they were "better prepared to evaluate that institutions that are supposed to meet our health needs . . .". Third, the historical lack of self-knowledge about the female body "had had one major consequence - pregnancy" and through greater information, women will have more ability to make proactive choices about when to get pregnant. Fourth, information about one's body is perhaps the most essential kind of education, because "bodies are the physical bases from which we move out into the world". Without this basic information, women are alienated from their own body and necessarily on unequal footing with men.&lt;ref name="Schneir, Miriam 1994" /&gt;

The women researched and wrote up the information themselves. Wendy Sanford wrote about [[abortion]], Jane Pincus and Ruth Bell about [[pregnancy]], and Paula Doress and Esther Rome about [[postpartum depression]]. The 12 feminists then published their research as a 35-cent, 136-page booklet called ''Women and Their Bodies'', published in 1970 by the New England Free Press. The booklet sold 250,000 copies in New England without any formal advertising.&lt;ref name="womensenews" /&gt;

As a result of their success, the women formed the non-profit Boston Women's Health Book Collective (which now goes by the name Our Bodies Ourselves) and published the first 276-page ''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' in 1973. The collective published it with the major publisher [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] only on the condition that they would have complete editorial control and that nonprofit health centers could purchase copies at a significant discount.&lt;ref name="Schneir, Miriam 1994" /&gt; It featured first-person stories from women, and tackled many topics then regarded as [[taboo]]. Since then, over four million copies have been sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/our-bodies-ourselves-revolutionary-feminist-health-book-will-no-longer-print-new-editions-180968729/|title=‘Our Bodies, Ourselves,’ the Revolutionary Feminist Health Book, Will No Longer Print New Editions|last=Katz|first=Brigit|date=|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the group announced that due to financial pressures, it would no longer publish new print editions nor have experts update its web site with new health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/04/05/chapter-closes-for-our-bodies-ourselves/3BbudyhAQgQquCGHHfuZvN/story.html |title='Our Bodies, Ourselves' will stop printing new editions |publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]'' |date=5 April 2018 |author=Stephanie Ebbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boston Women's Health Book Collective==
The Boston Women's Health Book Collective, also known as the Our Bodies, Ourselves Collective, is a feminist group that created ''Our Bodies, Ourselves''. The collective formed at the peak of the women's movement in Boston.

Twelve women all between the ages of 23 to 39 first attended a workshop entitled "Women and Their Bodies" which allowed the women to discuss together the issues they had surrounding their health. The discussion created a consciousness-raising environment, providing each woman with information that they all deal with when handling issues about their bodies. The strong discussion supplied the women with the necessary tools and ideas that lead to the creation of their book that addressed issues surrounding sexuality and abortion. They put their knowledge into an accessible format that served as a model for women who wanted to learn about themselves, communicate with doctors, and challenge the medical establishment to change and improve the health of women everywhere.

Reproductive justice was at the forefront during the women's liberation, causing much debate over the biological rights of women. The Equal Rights Amendment had a section specifically targeting the important issues about Reproductive justice that combines multiple reproductive rights and issues surrounding family. The strategy of the reproductive justice plank was to establish the necessary rights and access for women to gain control over their bodies. Through the passing of this legislation woman would be granted the ability to have abortions, obtain access to birth control and gain full control over their bodies. 

The Boston Collective focused on these ideas to allow women the ability to understand their bodies and themselves as women. During the National Women's Conference, women from all over the country deliberated to determine the exact laws that should be put into place for women's reproductive justice. The Boston Collective work together to teach courses and create books that provide knowledge from women not only in Boston, but women across the nation. These women use their skills and knowledge to provide many women with knowledge about their lives through rhetoric that avoids describing the female reproductive system as passive, unproductive, helpless, or powerless.

The organization has also created two single-topic books. ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: Menopause'' was published in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Our bodies, ourselves : menopause|author=The Boston Women's Health Book Collective|last2=Pinn|first2=Vivian|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2006|isbn=9780743274876|location=New York|authorlink2=Vivian Pinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: Pregnancy and Birth'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Our bodies, ourselves : pregnancy and birth|publisher=Touchstone Book/Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2008|isbn=9780743274869|editor=the Boston Women's Health Book Collective|edition=1st Touchstone trade pbk.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston Women's Health Book Collective earlier produced ''Changing Bodies, Changing Lives: A Book For Teens on Sex and Relationships''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Changing bodies, changing lives : a book for teens on sex and relationships|last=Bell|first=Ruth|publisher=Times Books|year=1998|isbn=9780812929904|edition=Expanded 3rd|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The New Ourselves, Growing Older: Women Aging with Knowledge and Power''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The new ourselves, growing older : women aging with knowledge and power|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|others=Roselaine (illustrator)|year=1994|isbn=9780671872977|location=New York|authors=Paula B.

[[Image:OurBodiesOurselves.jpg|thumb|230px|The cover of the 2005 edition, described as a "new edition for a new era."]]

==Style==
The first book was a product of the [[feminist movement]] and could still be said to reflect its values. The personal experiences of women are taken into account and are quoted throughout, while the social and political context of women's health informs the content of the book. The book emphasizes empowerment through information and learning, specifically, information gained through women sharing their personal narratives with each other because "by sharing our responses we can develop a base on which to be critical of what the experts tell us."&lt;ref name="Schneir, Miriam 1994" /&gt;

Topics such as [[male-to-female]] and [[female-to-male]] [[transsexualism]]/[[transgender]]ism are discussed in the most recent edition and considered in a nonjudgmental manner, despite the controversy to which they have been subject within the feminist movement. The writing style of the book tends toward a familiar, inclusive tone, with the authors referring to women and themselves as a collective group.

==Documentary==
The collective of women who initiated ''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' are part of the documentary ''[[She's Beautiful When She's Angry]]'', about the founders of the modern women's movement from 1966 to 1971.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2503">In the United States, '''public rights''', as compared to [[private rights]], belong to [[citizen]]s but are vested in and vindicated by political entities. Public rights cannot be vindicated by private citizens. A right must normally be a private right to be vindicated in court.

An exception to this general proposition is found in ''[[Flast v. Cohen]]'', 392 U.S. 83 (1968). In ''Flast'', the U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that a private citizen could challenge the [[constitutionality]] of a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[tax]] if the citizen established "a logical link between [their] status [as a taxpayer] and the type of legislative enactment attacked [and] . . . a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged."

'''Rebecca Ann Naylor Hazard''' (née '''Rebecca Ann Naylor'''; November 10, 1826 - March 1, 1912) was a 19th-century American philanthropist, [[suffragette]], reformer, and writer from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. With a few other women, she formed the Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri and an Industrial Home for Girls in [[St. Louis]]. She organized a society known as the [[Freedmen's Aid Society]], and served as president of the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]].

==Early life and education==
Rebecca Naylor was born in [[Woodsfield, Ohio]], November 10, 1826, the daughter of Robert F. Naylor (born in Pennsylvania, but lived mostly in Virgini) and Mary Bettis Archbold (of Virginia).{{sfn|Yale University. Class of 1867|1897|p=335}} Till the age of 14, she studied at Monroe Institute and the Marietta Seminary.{{sfn|Garraty|Carnes|1999|p=441}} The family then removed to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and later to [[Quincy, Illinois]]. In Quincy, in 1844, while still a teenager, she married William Tweedy Hazard, of [[Newport, Rhode Island]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=367-68}} 

==Career==
The husband was not a college man. His occupation during most of his life was that of a manufacturer (flour mills).{{sfn|Yale University. Class of 1867|1897|p=335}} Five children were born to the couple. In 1850, the family removed to [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. For many years, domestic affairs claimed the attention of Hazard.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=367-68}} 

===Philanthropist===
In 1854, she united with other women in establishing an Industrial Home for Girls in St. Louis. For five years she was on the board of managers of that institution, which has sheltered thousands of homeless children. At the breaking out of the [[American Civil War]], Hazard, who was an ardent [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]], engaged in hospital work, including the care of sick and wounded soldiers. She helped to organize the Union Aid Society and served as a member of the executive committee in the great Western Sanitary Fair. Finding that large numbers of African American women and children were by the exigencies of war helplessly stranded in the city, Hazard sought means for their relief. They were in a deplorable condition, and, as the supplies contributed to the soldiers could not be used for them, she organized a society known as the [[Freedmen's Aid Society]], for their special benefit. At the close of the war, that society was merged in an orphan asylum. Closely following that work came the establishment of a home for women, which was maintained under great difficulties for some years, before being abandoned. With [[Mary Foote Henderson]], Hazard co-founded the School of Design for women in the field of decorative art. It later became part of the Woman’s Exchange.{{sfn|Garraty|Carnes|1999|p=441}}

===Suffragist and writer===
Deeply impressed with the disabilities under which women labor in being deprived of political rights, Hazard, [[Virginia Minor]], [[Anna Clapp]], [[Lucretia Hall]], and [[Penelope Allen]],&lt;ref name="shsmo.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Virginia Minor|url=http://shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/m/minor/|publisher=The State Historical Society of Missouri|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; met in May 1867, and formed the Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri, the first society bearing the name, and having for its sole object the ballot for woman. Devoted to this cause, Hazard gave it her attention for many years, filling the various offices of the association, and also serving one term as president of the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]]. In 1870, the city of St. Louis, falling under evil counsels, framed into law the Social Evil Ordinance. Realizing the danger to good morals, Hazard at once engaged in the conflict for the overthrow of law. Three years later, she met with other women and organized an appeal to the legislature through a petition campaign to rescind it.{{sfn|Graves|2014|p=46-47}} The law was repealed by the [[Missouri Legislature]] in 1874. The call for the formation of the association for the advancement of women, known as the Woman's Congress, was signed by Hazard, and she continued to be a member of that body, contributing at various times to its sessions the following papers: "Home Studies for Women," "Business Opportunities for Women," and "Crime and its Punishment."{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=367-68}} 

==Later years==
After the death of her husband, in 1879, Hazard mostly retired from public work, but at her home in [[Kirkwood, Missouri]], a suburb of St. Louis, a class of women met each week for study and mutual improvement. As a result of these studies, Hazard published two papers on the "Divina Commedia." She also wrote a volume on the war period in St. Louis. Her contributions to local and other papers were numerous.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=367-68}} Hazard was a member of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] and of the [[American Akademe]], a philosophical society having headquarters in [[Jacksonville, Illinois]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=367-68}} She died in Kirkwood in 1912.{{sfn|Christensen|Foley|Kremer|1999|p=387}}

'''Robert Works Fuller''' (born 1936)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oberlin.edu/archive/holdings/finding/RG2/ "Presidents of Oberlin College"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021212656/http://www.oberlin.edu/archive/holdings/finding/RG2/ |date=2013-10-21 }}. Oberlin College Archives. Retrieved Dec. 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[American citizen|American]] physicist, author, social reformer, and former president of [[Oberlin College]].

==Biography==
Fuller graduated from [[Oberlin College]], and earned his [[Ph.D.]] in [[physics]] at [[Princeton University]] in 1961. He taught at [[Columbia University]], where he co-authored the book ''Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics''.

===Oberlin College president===
The mounting social unrest of the 1960s, and Fuller's commitment to educational reform—which he had already demonstrated as a [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] dean—led his alma mater, [[Oberlin College]], in 1970, to make him its tenth president, succeeding [[Robert K. Carr]]. At age 33, Fuller became one of the youngest college presidents in U.S. history. During his Oberlin presidency—a turbulent time at Oberlin and in higher education generally—Fuller reshaped the student body by tripling the enrollment of minorities at the college. He also recruited and hired Jack Scott as Chairman of the Physical Education Dept. and Athletic Director.  Scott, in turn, recruited and hired the first four African-American athletic coaches in a predominantly white American college or university, including [[Tommie Smith]], the Gold Medalist sprinter from the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]]. Scott and Fuller were interviewed on campus by [[Howard Cosell]] and appeared on primetime television to talk about these changes. In 1974, after four years of service as Oberlin's president, Fuller considered that he had fulfilled his mission and resigned the office.

===Ventures in social reform===
In 1971, on a visit to [[India]], Fuller had witnessed the famine caused by war with [[Pakistan]], a war that saw the emergence of [[Bangladesh]] as an independent nation. With the election of President [[Jimmy Carter]], Fuller began a campaign to persuade the new president to end world hunger. In 1977, Fuller co-founded [[The Hunger Project]], along with [[Werner Erhard]] and [[John Denver]]. His June 1977 meeting with Carter in the [[Oval Office]] helped lead to the establishment of the [http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/library/fed_records.phtml Presidential Commission on World Hunger]. 

During the 1970s and 1980s, Fuller traveled frequently to the [[Soviet Union]], working as a citizen-scientist to improve superpower relations during the [[Cold War]]. This led to the creation of the Mo Tzu Project, a group of [[Citizen diplomacy|citizen-diplomats]] traveling the world seeking citizen to citizen understanding to create sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.context.org/iclib/ic04/
| title = The Foundations of Peace
| website = Context Institute
| language = en-US
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also lead to the creation of the  nonprofit global corporation [http://www.internews.org/ Internews], which promotes democracy via free and independent media. For many years Fuller served as its chairman, working with [[Kim Spencer]], [[David M. Hoffman]] and [[Evelyn Messinger]] (founders of [[Internews]]), Alia Johnson, Robert Cabot, and John Steiner, among others. In 1982, Fuller appeared in the PBS documentary [https://vimeo.com/180973927 ''Thinking Twice About Nuclear War''].

With the [[collapse of the USSR]], Fuller's turn as a citizen-diplomat came to a close. Reflecting on the different roles he had played, he came to understand that he had, at various times, enjoyed the status of a "somebody" while at other times he had embraced the position of a "nobody." His experiences in "Nobodyland" led him to identify [[rankism]]—a term he coined, and defined as the abuse of the power inherent in rank.

In 2003, Fuller published his seminal work, ''Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank'' (New Society Publishers). The book inspired a group in Virginia to set up the Dignitarian Foundation. He published a sequel that focused on building a dignitarian society, titled ''All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity'' (Berrett-Koehler, 2006). In 2008, Fuller and co-author Pamela A. Gerloff released an 86-page "action-oriented guide" titled ''Dignity for All: How to Create a World Without Rankism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Samuel Mauger''' (pronounced ''Major'') (12 November 1857 – 26 June 1936)&lt;ref name=adb&gt;John Lack, '[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100442b.htm Mauger, Samuel (1857–1936)]', ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Volume 10, [[Melbourne University Press|MUP]], 1986, pp 451–453. Retrieved 5 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; was an Australian social reformer, hat manufacturing unionist and a [[Protectionist]] politician.

==Early life==
Mauger was born in [[Geelong]], Victoria, son of immigrants from [[Guernsey]], [[Channel Islands]], Samuel Mauger Senior and Caroline ''née'' Liz&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; who migrated to Australia in the 1850s. Mauger junior was educated at the Geelong National School, but left school early to become an errand boy for a hat maker when his father contracted rheumatic fever.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Mauger later owned the hat manufacturing business. Mauger was a Bible class teacher at St Mark's [[Church of England]] in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]]. He later became the Sunday-school superintendent at St Paul's Congregational Church in North Fitzroy. On 13 May 1880, Mauger married Hanna Rice who he had met at St Mark's; they eventually had four sons and four daughters.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==Career==
Mauger held various memberships to various organisations. He was a superintendent in the Fire Brigades' Association of Victoria and four times president of the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Mauger was one of the founders and secretary of the Anti-Sweating League from 1895. Mauger was on the Board enquiry for unemployment in 1899 and involved in the royal commission of Victorian factories and shops law in 1900.

Being a devout Christian of the [[Australian Church]], Mauger was president of the [[Young Men's Christian Association]] and president of the Melbourne Total Abstinence Society.

Mauger attempted to run for politics in various State electorates before becoming a Member of Parliament. He stood for the seat of [[Electoral district of Fitzroy (Victoria)|Fitzroy]] in 1892, [[Electoral district of South Melbourne|South Melbourne]] in 1896 and [[Electoral district of Portland|Portland]] in 1897. In 1899 he was a firefighter in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Birch|first=Adrian|title=Samuel Mauger firefighter.|url=http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/69174|publisher=State Library of Victoria|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1900, Mauger was elected to the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of Footscray|Footscray]]. He held the seat of Footscray until May 1901, where he resigned from State politics and ran for Federal politics. Mauger was the first member for [[Division of Melbourne Ports|Melbourne Ports]] in 1901 until his defeat to [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] candidate [[James Mathews (Australian politician)|James Mathews]] in [[Australian federal election, 1906|1906]]. Mauger then soon elected to the new Federal seat of [[Division of Maribyrnong|Maribyrnong]] and became the electorate's first Federal Member of Parliament. He was a Minister without a Portfolio from 1906 until 1907 and then [[Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Australia)|Postmaster-General]] until 1908. Mauger lost his seat of [[Division of Maribyrnong|Maribyrnong]] to [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] candidate [[James Fenton (Australian politician)|James Fenton]] in [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910]].

Mauger ran for the Victorian Senate in 1913 and 1914, but failed to get elected.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/candidates/m.txt Australian Federal Political Candidates (Surname beginning with letter "M")]
&lt;/ref&gt; He was an ardent protectionist and was for some time honorary secretary of the protectionists' association of Victoria; he was for a time president of the Melbourne Total Abstinence Society, and chairman of the Indeterminate Sentences Board; and he presumably found some time for his business as a hatter and mercer. For about 50 years in every movement in Melbourne intended to better the conditions of the mass of the people, Mauger was to be found working incessantly and showing much organizing ability.

==Legacy==
In 1934 Mauger wrote a brochure on ''The Rise and Progress of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, Victoria, Australia'',  on page 29 some verses relating to the success of the staff fund illustrate his philosophy of life. Basically it was that if anything is brought forward for the good of humanity, difficulties will vanish if the problem is tackled with sufficient courage.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;
Mauger died in [[Elsternwick, Victoria]] and is buried in the [[Melbourne General Cemetery]]. At his funeral, he was given a fire guard honour.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Mauger was survived by his wife, two sons and four daughters.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=Samuel|Last=Mauger|shortlink=0-dict-biogMa-Mo.html#mauger1|accessdate=5 October 2009}}

'''"Scientific Integrity in Policymaking: An Investigation into the Bush Administration's Misuse of Science"''' is the title of a report published by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] in February, 2004. The report was the culmination of an investigation of the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s objectivity in [[science]], and ultimately a [[critic]]ism thereof.&lt;ref name="UCS2004"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Integrity in Policy Making (2004)|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/promoting-scientific-integrity/reports-scientific-integrity.html|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (After it was published, the report's existence was fairly well-publicized by the [[United States]]' [[mass media]].)

== "Suppression and distortion of research findings" ==
[[File:Condoleezza_Rice_Colin_Powell_George_W._Bush_Donald_Rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|200px|Rice, Powell, Bush, and Rumsfeld]]
A central thesis of the report, according to the Executive Summary (on page 2 of the text), was that the Bush administration had behaved in ways considered to be consistent with the following three situations.

# Epidemic altering and concealing of scientific [[information]] by senior officials in various federal [[Government agency|agencies]]
# Active censorship of scientific information that the administration considered threatening to its own [[Philosophy|philosophies]]
# Restriction of the ability of government-supported scientists to freely communicate scientific [[idea]]s related to "sensitive" issues

== "An unprecedented pattern of behavior" ==

In "Part III", the text of the report posits that the aforementioned activities are unprecedented in the [[history of the United States]]. The report lists the following persons and organization who had supposedly acted or made statements to support this claim.

''This list is sorted first by category, then by the order in which the persons or organizations are mentioned in the report.''

* Organization
** [[REP America]]
* Persons
** [[William Ruckelshaus|Ruckelshaus, William]]
** [[Russell Train|Train, Russell]]
** [[Wolfgang Panofsky|Panofsky, Dr. Wolfgang H. K.]]
** [[Marvin Leonard Goldberger|Goldberger, Dr. Marvin]]
** [[Margaret Scarlett|Scarlett, Dr. Margaret]]
** [[Donald Kennedy|Kennedy, Donald]]
** [[D. Allan Bromley|Bromley, Dr. D. Allan]]
** [[Lewis M. Branscomb|Branscomb, Professor Lewis M.]]
** [[Lynn Goldman|Goldman, Dr. Lynn]]

== Recommendations by the Union ==

Page 29 of the report states: "This behavior by the administration violates the central premise of the [[scientific method]], and is therefore of particularly grave concern to the scientific community." It then goes on, in a short section titled "Conclusions and Recommendations: What's at Stake" at the end of the report, to provide recommendations for "restoring scientific integrity to federal policymaking" (page 30). These recommendations (on pages 30–31) include a suggestion for the [[President of the United States]] to issue [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]s, and other actions, that would prevent further "abuse"; for the [[United States Congress]] to hold appropriate [[Hearing (law)|hearing]]s, consider the consequences of [[statutory law]] under its influence, increase the amount of publicly available scientific information, and establish an organization to guide Congress in its deliberations in technical matters; for scientists to raise awareness of the aforementioned issues and provide public policy recommendations; for the public to exercise its political influence in a constructive manner.

== Response ==
On April 2, 2004, the [[White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]] issued a statement by [[John Marburger|Dr. John Marburger]], the director of OSTP, that claims the descriptions of the incidents in the UCS report are all "false," "wrong," or "a distortion." He said he was disappointed with the report and dismissed it as "biased."[https://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,62339,00.html].

'''Sexualization''' (or '''sexualisation''') is to make something [[Human sexuality|sexual]] in character or quality, or to become aware of sexuality,&lt;ref name="Sexualization"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Sexualization (definition) | publisher= ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''| accessdate = 30 September 2013 | url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sexualization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexualize"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Sexualize | publisher = ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' | accessdate = 30 September 2013 | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/sexualize}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in relation to men and women. Sexualization is linked to [[sexual objectification]]. According to the [[American Psychological Association]], sexualization occurs when "individuals are regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical characteristics and sexiness."&lt;ref name=Dewar&gt;{{cite web | last = Dewar | first = Gwen | title = The sexualization of girls: Is the popular culture harming our kids? | url = http://www.parentingscience.com/sexualization-of-girls.html | website = parentingscience.com | publisher = Parenting Science | date = October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "In study after study, findings have indicated that women more often than men are portrayed in a sexual manner (e.g., dressed in revealing clothing, with bodily postures or facial expressions that imply sexual readiness) and are objectified (e.g., used as a decorative object, or as body parts rather than a whole person). In addition, a narrow (and unrealistic) standard of physical beauty is heavily emphasized. These are the models of femininity presented for young girls to study and emulate."&lt;ref name=Exec&gt;{{citation | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | contribution = Executive Summary | editor-last = APA Task Force | editor-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who embrace their sexual desires are considered to be sexy and attractive to men who want nothing more than to have a woman as a sex toy. In the eyes of men, women that practice this behavior serve the pure purpose of providing satisfaction and showcasing their human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peter | first1 = Jochen | last2 = Valkenburg | first2 = Patti M. | title = Adolescents' exposure to a sexualized media environment and their notions of women as sex objects | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 383–384 | date = March 2007 | doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9176-y | ref = harv }} [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11199-006-9176-y.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Media Education Foundation's, ''[[Killing Us Softly|Killing Us Softly 4: Advertising's Image of Women]]'', the sexualization of girls in media and the ways women are portrayed in the dominant culture are detrimental to the development of young girls as they are developing their identities and understanding themselves as sexual beings.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne &gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Jean Kilbourne]] (writer/presenter), [[Sut Jhally]] (director) and David Rabinovitz | date= 2010 | accessdate= 30 December 2015 | title= Killing Us Softly 4: Advertising's Image of Women | medium= Video | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2507550/ | publisher= [[Media Education Foundation]] | location = Northampton, Massachusetts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports have found that sexualization of younger children is becoming increasingly more common in advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Donohue | first1 = William | last2 = Gold | first2 = Steven R. | last3 = McKay | first3 = J. Sean | author-link1 = William O'Donohue | title = Children as sexual objects: historical and gender trends in magazines | journal = [[Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment]] | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 291–301 | doi = 10.1177/107906329700900403 | date = October 1997 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has linked sexualization of young girls to negative consequences for girls and society as a whole, finding that the viewing of sexually objectifying material can contribute to body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, low self-esteem, depression and depressive affect. Medical and social science researchers generally deployed "sexualization" to refer to a liminal zone between sexual abuse and normal family life, in which the child's relationship with their parents was characterized by an "excessive", improper sexuality, though without recognizable forms of abuse having occurred.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite book | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 | oclc = 123130352 }} [http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; American Psychological Association also argues that the sexualization of young girls contributes to sexist attitudes within society, and a societal tolerance of sexual violence.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

From 2003 to 2005, "sexualization" began to ascend to the status of an issue in the public eye. The cause of this rise was that it became positioned by a number of discursive actors as a feminist issue. This is not to say that a single "feminist perspective on sexualization" emerged in this period; among discursive actors mobilizing feminist discourses, or identifying themselves explicitly with feminism, there were a host of different views. Yet a particular, relatively cohesive position emerged after 2003 among a number of media discourses: these discourses tended to emphasize that, in the context of a commercialized and sexist culture, young women are unable to exercise meaningful choice even when they experience themselves as doing so. These media actors, in their problematization of sexualization, positioned themselves as the true heirs to the feminist tradition and its critical insights, in contrast to contemporary youth.

[[Consumerism]] and [[globalization]] has led to sexualization of girls occurring across all [[advanced economies]], in media and advertisements, to clothing and toys marketed for young girls.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "sexualization" itself only emerged in Anglophone discourse in recent decades. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, the term was infrequently drawn upon by English writers to refer the assignation of a gendered frame to a particular object, such as the gendering of nouns (e.g., de Quincey [1839]1909, 195).&lt;ref name="de Quincey"&gt;{{citation | author-last = de Quincey | author-first = Thomas | author-link = Thomas De Quincey | contribution = Style and language | editor-last1 = de Quincey | editor-first1 = Thomas | editor-last2 = Darbishire | editor-first2 = Helen | editor-link1 = Thomas De Quincey | editor-link2 = Helen Darbishire | title = De Quincey's literary criticism | pages = 181&amp;ndash;196 | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Digital Library | location = New York, NY | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781411457836 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the term "asexualization" saw greater use, as a synonym for sterilization in eugenics discourse from around the turn of the twentieth century (e.g., Lydston 1904).&lt;ref name="Lydston"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lydston | first = G. Frank | title = The diseases of society (the vice and crime problem) | publisher = J.B. Lippincott Company | location = Philadelphia &amp; London | year = 1904 | oclc = 314683293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duschinsky"&gt;''Both de Quincey and Lydston are cited in:''

== Effects on children ==

In 2006, an Australian report called ''Corporate paedophilia: sexualisation of children in Australia''&lt;ref name=Australia /&gt; was published. The Australian report summarises its conclusion as follows:

:Images of sexualised children are becoming increasingly common in advertising and marketing material. Children who appear aged 12 years and under are dressed, posed and made up in the same way as sexy adult models. Children that appear on magazines are seen older than they really are because of the sexualised clothes they are given to pose in.  "Corporate paedophilia" is a metaphor used to describe advertising and marketing that sexualises children in these ways.

In 2007, the [[American Psychological Association]] published a report titled ''Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls'', discussed below.

In 2010, the [[American Psychological Association]] published an additional report titled " Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls", which performed a study where college students were asked to try on and evaluate either a swimsuit or a sweater. While they waited for 10 minutes wearing the garment, they completed a math test. The results revealed that young women in swimsuits performed significantly worse on the math problems than did those wearing sweaters.The hypothesis is that individuals about to try on the sweaters had less pressure to look beautiful because they were not wearing revealing clothing therefore they performed better.

In 2012, an American study found that self-sexualization was common among 6–9-year old girls. Girls overwhelmingly chose the sexualized doll over the non-sexualized doll for their ideal self and as popular. However other factors, such as how often mothers talked to their children about what is going on in TV shows and maternal religiosity, reduced those odds. Surprisingly, the mere quantity of girls' [[media consumption]] (TV and movies) was unrelated to their self-sexualization for the most part; rather, maternal self-objectification and maternal religiosity moderated its effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = Christine | last2 = Ferguson | first2 = Gail | title = Sexy dolls, sexy grade-schoolers?

However, in 2010 the [[Scottish Executive]] released a report titled ''External research on sexualised goods aimed at children''.&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; The report considers the drawbacks of the United States and Australian reviews, concluding:

{{Quote|[T]here is no indication [in the APA report] that the media might contain any positive images about human relationships, or that children might critically evaluate what they see.}}

The Scottish review also notes that:

{{Quote|[s]uch accounts often present the sexualisation of children as a relatively recent development, but it is by no means a new issue …  While the public visibility of the issue, and the terms in which it is defined, may have changed, sexualised representations of children cannot be seen merely as a consequence of contemporary consumerism.}}

It also notes that previous coverage "rests on moral assumptions … that are not adequately explained or justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mayo | first1 = Ed | last2 = Nairn | first2 = Agnes | author-link1 = Ed Mayo | title = Consumer kids: how big business is grooming our children for profit | publisher = Constable | location = London | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781845298807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letting Children be Children: Report of an Independent Review of the Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood (UK)'''
The report 'Letting Children Be Children',&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; also known as the Bailey Report, is a report commissioned by the UK government on the subject of the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood. The report was published in June 2011 and was commissioned as a result of concerns raised as to whether children's lives are negatively affected by the effects of commercialisation and sexualisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=NSPCC | author-link1 =NSPCC |title= Premature sexualisation: understanding the risks: outcomes of the NSPCC's expert seminar series |date= 2011 | publisher= NSPCC | location= London }} [https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/information-service/seminars-premature-sexualisation-understanding-risks.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailey Report is so-called as it was researched and compiled by Reg Bailey, the Chief Executive of the Mothers' Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.mothersunion.org/ | website = mothersunion.org | publisher = Mothers' Union | accessdate = 6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "charity supporting parents and children in 83 countries in the world".&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; The report asked for contributions from parents; children; organisations; businesses and the general public in order to consider their views and inform their recommendations and identified four themes that were of particular concern to parents and the wider public. These themes were:
*1) the "wallpaper" of children's lives
*2) clothing, products and services for children
*3) children as consumers
*4) making parents' voices heard

The report returned recommendations based on the research from interested parties, on each of the key themes, in the form of "what we would like to see". On the theme of "the wallpaper of children's lives" it said that it would like to see that sexualised images used in public places should be more in line with what parents find acceptable, to ensure that images in public spaces becomes more child friendly. On theme two "clothing, products and services for children" the Bailey report said that it would like to see retailers no longer selling or marketing inappropriate clothing, products or services for children. What they would like to see on theme three "children as consumers" is comprehensive regulation protecting children from excessive commercial pressures across all media in-line with parental expectations; that marketers are ethical and do not attempt to exploit gaps in the market to influence children into becoming consumers and to ensure that parents and children have an awareness of marketing techniques and regulations. Finally in terms of "making parents voices heard" it would like to see parents finding it easier to voice their concerns to, and be listened to by, businesses and regulators.&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt;

There is a motion for a [[European Parliament]] resolution going through which gives the following definition of sexualization: {{Quotation|[S]exualization consists of an instrumental approach to a person by perceiving that person as an object for sexual use disregarding the person's dignity and personality traits, with the person's worth being measured in terms of the level of sexual attractiveness; sexualization also involves the imposition of the sexuality of adult persons on girls, who are emotionally, psychologically and physically unprepared for this at their particular stage of development; sexualization&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As opposed to its meaning in relation to [[human sexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt;  not being the normal, healthy, biological development of the sexuality of a person, conditioned by the individual process of development and taking place at the appropriate time for each particular individual.&lt;ref name=draft&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skrzydlewska|first=Joanna|authorlink=Joanna Skrzydlewska|title=Draft report on the sexualization of girls (2012/2047 (INI)) | journal = European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.

== Effects on women of color ==
The sexualization of women of color is different than the sexualization of white women.  The media plays a significant role in this sexualization. "The media are likely to have powerful effects if the information is presented persistently, consistently, and corroborated among forms. As a media affect, stereotypes rely on the repetition to perpetuate and sustain them."&lt;ref name="Eva"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Merskin | first = Debra | title = Three faces of Eva: perpetuation of the hot-Latina stereotype in ''Desperate Housewives'' | journal = Howard Journal of Communications | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–151 | doi = 10.1080/10646170701309890 | date = 2007 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Celine Parrenas Shimizu]], "To see race is to see sex, and vice versa."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Park | first = Samuel | title = ''The hypersexuality of race: performing Asian/American women on screen and scene'' (review) | journal = [[Theatre Journal]] | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 346–347 | doi = 10.1353/tj.0.0193 | date = May 2009 | ref = harv }}

=== Black women ===
In an NPR interview with Professor Herbert Samuels at LaGuardia Community College in New York and Mireille Miller-Young a professor at UC Santa Barbara they talk about sexual stereotypes of black bodies in America and how even in sex work, already a dangerous job, black women are treated much worse than their counterparts due to the effects of their oversexualization and objectification in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= [[Farai Chideya]] (host/producer), Herbert Samuels (guest) and Mireille Miller-Young (guest) |date= 7 May 2007 |title= Sex stereotypes of African Americans have long history |medium= Radio program |series= [[NPR|NPR news]] |language= English |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 |access-date= 9 December 2015 |publisher= [[NPR]] }} [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 Transcript.]&lt;/ref&gt; Black women's bodies are either invisible or hypervisible. In the 1800s, a South African woman named [[Sarah Baartman]] was known as "Hottentot Venus" and her body was paraded around in London and Paris where they looked at her exotic features such as large breasts and behind. Her features were deemed lesser and oversexual. There is also the ''Jezebel'' stereotype that portrays black women as "hypersexual, manipulative, animalistic and promiscuous females who cannot be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mowatt | first1 = Rasul A. | title = Black/female/body hypervisibility and invisibility: a Black feminist augmentation of feminist leisure research | journal = Journal of Leisure Research, Special Issue: Feminist Leisure Research in the Contemporary Era | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 644–660 | doi = 10.18666/JLR-2013-V45-I5-4367 | date = 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominican Women ===
In the Dominican Republic, women are frequently stereotyped as sultry and sexual as the reputation of Dominican sex workers grows.&lt;ref name="Race_class"&gt;Brennan, Denise (2004), "[https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/brennan_selling-sex-for-visas.pdf Selling sex for visas: sex tourism as a stepping-stone to international migration]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Pauline | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 243&amp;ndash;248 | publisher = Wadsworth/Thomson Learning | location = Belmont, California | edition = 9th | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780534609030 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many poor women have resorted to sex work because the demand is high and the hours and pay are often dictated by the workers themselves.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; White European and American men "exoticize dark-skinned 'native' bodies" because "they can buy sex for cut-rate prices".&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; This overgeneralizing of the sexuality of Dominican women can also carries back to the women's homes.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; Even "women who...worked in Europe have become suspect..." even if they had a legal job.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; They have become "exports" instead of people because of their sexualization.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt;

=== Asian women ===
The image of Asian women in Hollywood cinema is directly linked to sexuality as essential to any imagining about the roles they play as well as her actual appearance in popular culture. Asian female fatale's hypersexualized subjection is derived from her sexual behaviour that is considered as natural to her particular race and culture. Two types of Asian stereotypes that are commonly found in media are the Lotus Flower and the Dragon Lady. The Lotus Flower archetype is the "self-sacrificing, servile, and suicidal Asian women." The dragon lady archetype is the opposite of the lotus flower, a "self-abnegating Asian woman…[who] uses her 'Oriental' femininity, associated with seduction and danger to trap white men on behalf of conniving Asian males." According to film-maker and film scholar, Celine Shimizu, "The figure of the Asian American femme fatale signifies a particular deathly seduction. She attracts with her soft, unthreatening, and servile femininity while concealing her hard, dangerous, and domineering nature."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Native American women ===
Starting from the time of white colonization of Native American land, some Native American women have been referred to as "squaw," an Algonquin word for vagina. "The 'squaw' [stereotype] is the dirty, subservient, and abused tribal female who is also haggard, violent, and eager to torture tribal captives."  Another stereotype is the beautiful Indian princess who leaves her tribe and culture behind to marry a white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mihesuah | first = Devon Abbott | contribution = Finding a modern American indigenous female identity | editor-last = Mihesuah | editor-first = Devon Abbott | title = Indigenous American women: decolonization, empowerment, activism | page = 102 | publisher = [[University of Nebraska Press]] | location = Lincoln, Nebraska and London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780803282865 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the hot Latina stereotype lies three categories of representation: the Cantina Girl, the Faithful, self-sacrificing señorita, and the vamp. The Cantina Girl markers are "'great sexual allure,' teasing, dancing, and 'behaving in an alluring fashion.'" The faithful, self-sacrificing Señorita starts out as a good girl and turns bad by the end. The Señorita, in an attempt to save her Anglo love interest, utilizes her body to protect him from violence. The Vamp representation "uses her intellectual and devious sexual wiles to get what she wants." The media represents Latinas "as either [a] hot-blooded spitfire" or "[a] dutiful mother".&lt;ref name="Vargas 1993"&gt;{{citation | last = Vargas | first = Deborah R. | contribution = Representations of Latina/o sexuality in popular culture | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Patricia | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 188&amp;ndash;192 | publisher = Cengage Learning | location = Boston, Massachusetts | edition = 9th | year = 2016 | origyear = 1993 | isbn = 9781305093614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual implications of the "hot-blooded" Latina has become an overgeneralized representation of Latin people. This has led many to see the Latin people as "what is morally wrong" with the United States. Some believe it to be wrong simply because the interpretation of this culture seems to go against white, Western culture.&lt;ref name="Vargas 1993" /&gt; Culturally, the Latina is expected to dress "as a proper señorita" in order to be respected as a woman which conflicts with the Western ideals that a girl is sexual if she dresses "too 'mature' for [her] age".&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993"&gt;{{citation | last = Cofer | first = Judith O. | contribution = The myth of the Latin woman: ''I Just Met a Girl Named Maria'' | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Patricia | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 188&amp;ndash;192 | publisher = Cengage Learning | location = Boston, Massachusetts | edition = 9th | year = 2016 | origyear = 1993 | isbn = 9781305093614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the business world this stereotype continues; "tight skirts and jingling bracelets [are misinterpreted] as a come-on". This sexualization can also be linked to certain stereotypical jobs. The image of the Latina woman often is not in the business world but in the domestic.&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993" /&gt; The sexualization of Latina women sexualizes the positions that they are expected to occupy. Domestic servants, maids, and waitresses are the typical "media-engendered" roles that make it difficult for Latinas to gain "upward mobility" despite the fact that many hold PhDs.&lt;ref name="Cofer 1993" /&gt;

== American Psychological Association view ==

=== Definition ===
The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in its 2007 Report looked at the cognitive and emotional consequences of sexualization and the consequences for mental and physical health, and impact on development of a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt; The report considers that a person is sexualized in the following situations:
*a person's value comes only from his or her [[Sexual attraction|sexual appeal]] or [[Human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], to the exclusion of other characteristics;
*a person is held to a standard that equates [[physical attractiveness]] (narrowly defined) with being sexy;
*a person is [[sexual objectification|sexually objectified]]—that is, made into a thing for others' sexual use, rather than seen as a person with the capacity for independent action and decision making; and/or
*sexuality is inappropriately imposed upon a person.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

=== Children ===
Some [[cultural critic]]s have postulated that over recent decades children have evidenced a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behaviour inappropriate for their age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaeser | first = Fred | title = Towards a better understanding of children's sexual behavior | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/74965/towardsabetterunderstandingofchildrenssexualbehavior.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = NYU Child Study Center | date = 30 October 2001 | quote = We know that exposure to sexualized messages, particularly those that are incomprehensible, can have several effects on children. }} ''Fred Kaeser Ed.D. is the Director of Health Services for Community School District Two, NYC.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of this premature sexualization that have been cited include portrayals in the media of sex and related issues, especially in media aimed at children; the marketing of products with sexual connotations to children, including clothing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chambers | first = Suzanna | title = Outrage as Argos sells G-strings for children | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=109621&amp;in_page_id=1770) | work = [[The Mail on Sunday|Mail on Sunday]] | publisher = [[DMG Media]] | date = 14 April 2002 | accessdate = 22 February 2007 | quote = High Street chain Argos has been branded irresponsible for promoting a range of sexually provocative lingerie designed for primary schoolgirls. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of parental oversight and [[discipline]]; access to adult culture via the internet; and the lack of comprehensive school [[sex education]] programs.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamb_Therapy&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Sharon | author-link1 = Sharon Lamb | title = Sex, therapy, and kids: addressing their concerns through talk and play | publisher = W.W.

For girls and young women in particular, the APA reports that studies have found that sexualization has a negative impact on their "[[self-image]] and healthy development".&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

The APA cites the following as advertising techniques that contribute to the sexualization of girls:&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;
*Including girls in ads with sexualized women wearing matching clothing or posed seductively.
*Dressing girls up to look like adult women.
*Dressing women down to look like young girls.
*The employment of youthful celebrity adolescents in highly sexual ways to promote or endorse products.
The APA additionally further references the teen magazine market by citing a study by [[Donald F. Roberts|Roberts]] ''et al'' that found that "47% of 8- to 18-year-old [girls] reported having read at least 5 minutes of a magazine the previous day."&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1= Roberts |first1= Donald F. |last2= Foehr |first2= Ulla G. |last3= Rideout |first3= Victoria | author-link1 = Donald F.

==== Cognitive and emotional consequences ====
Studies have found that thinking about the body and comparing it to sexualized cultural ideals may disrupt a girl's mental concentration, and a girl's sexualization or objectification may undermine her confidence in and comfort with her own body, leading to emotional and self-image problems, such as shame and anxiety.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research has linked sexualization with three of the most common mental health problems diagnosed in girls and women: eating disorders, low self-esteem, and depression or depressed mood.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research suggests that the sexualization of girls has negative consequences on girls' ability to develop a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

A result of the sexualization of girls in the media is that young girls are "learning how to view themselves as sex objects".&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; When girls fail to meet the [[thin ideal]] and dominant culture's standard of beauty they can develop anxieties.&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; Sexualization is problematic for young children who are developing their sexual identity as they may think that turning themselves into sex objects is empowering and related to having sexual agency.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

== Products for children ==

Some commercial products seen as promoting the sexualization of children have drawn considerable media attention:
* ''[[Bratz]] Baby'' Dolls marketed at 6-year-old girls that feature sexualized clothing, like fishnet stockings, feather boas, and miniskirts&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt;   
* Highly sexualized and gendered Halloween costumes marketed at young girls, such as the "sexy firefighter", a costume that consists of a tight fitted mini dress and high heeled boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Delisle | first = Riana | title = Halloween costumes are sexualizing our youngest trick-or-treaters | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/raina-delisle/halloween-costumes-sexy-inappropriate_b_6006922.html | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | publisher = [[AOL]] | location = Canada | date = 18 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Girls aged 10 and 11 wearing thongs in primary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Pupils warned not to wear thongs | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2943874.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = [[BBC]] | location = UK | date = 28 May 2003 | accessdate = 22 February 2007 | quote = Parents have been urged by a head teacher to stop their daughters wearing thongs to a primary school. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Clothing such T-shirts being marketed for young children in preschool and elementary school with printed slogans like "So Many Boys So Little Time"&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; 
* Padded bras on bikinis aimed at seven-year-old girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barr | first = Robert (in London) | title = Outrage at girls' padded bikinis | url = http://www.theage.com.au/world/outrage-at-girls-padded-bikinis-20100415-shjf.html | work = [[The Age]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | date = 16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people regard [[training bra]]s similarly. However, there is also evidence that with the mean age of puberty declining in Western cultures, functional brassieres are required by a higher percentage of preteen girls than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aksglaede | first1 = Lise | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = Kaspar | last3 = Petersen | first3 = Jørgen H. | last4 = Skakkebæk | first4 = Niels E. | last5 = Juul | first5 = Anders | title = Recent decline in age at breast development: the Copenhagen Puberty Study | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 123 | issue = 5 | pages = e932–e939 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2008-2491 | pmid = 19403485 | date = May 2009| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Executive]] report&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; surveyed 32 High street UK retailers and found that many of the larger chains, including [[Tesco]], Debenhams, JJ Sports, and [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] did not offer sexualized goods aimed at children. The report noted that overall prevalence was limited but this was based on a very narrow research brief. Whilst this shows that not all High street retailers were aiming products deemed sexualized by the researchers, the research cannot be taken out of context and used to say that there is not an issue of sexualization.{{original research inline|date=September 2015}}

== Culture and media ==
{{For2|more on the mainstreaming of sex in media and culture|[[pornographication]]}}
Sexualization has also been a subject of debate for academics who work in media and [[cultural studies]]. Here, the term has not been used to simply to label what is seen as a social problem, but to indicate the much broader and varied set of ways in which sex has become more visible in media and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Attenborough | first1 = Frederick T. | author-link1 = Frederick T.

the growth of sexual media of all kinds; for example, erotica, slash fiction, sexual self-help books and the many genres of pornography; 
the emergence of new forms of sexual experience, for example instant message or avatar sex made possible by developments in technology; 
a public concern with the breakdown of consensus about regulations for defining and dealing with obscenity; 
the prevalence of scandals, controversies and panics around sex in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Attwood | first = Feona | title = Sexed up: theorizing the sexualization of culture | journal = [[Sexualities (journal)|Sexualities]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 77–94 | doi = 10.1177/1363460706053336 | date = February 2006 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.452.7825 }} [http://shura.shu.ac.uk/50/1/fulltext.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Attwood | first = Feona | title = Mainstreaming sex the sexualization of Western culture | publisher = I.B.

The terms "[[pornographication|pornification]]" and "[[pornographication]]" have also been used to describe the way that aesthetics that were previously associated with pornography have become part of popular culture, and that mainstream media texts and other cultural practices "citing pornographic styles, gestures and aesthetics" have become more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Paasonen | first1 = Susanna | last2 = Nikunen | first2 = Kaarina |last3 = Saarenmaa | first3 = Laura | authorlink1 = Susanna Paasonen | title = Pornification: sex and sexuality in media culture | publisher = Berg | location = Oxford New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781845207045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, which Brian McNair has described as a "pornographication of the mainstream".&lt;ref name=McNair&gt;{{cite book | last = McNair | first = Brian | title = Striptease culture sex, media and the democratization of desire | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415237345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed alongside an expansion of the cultural realm of pornography or "pornosphere" which itself has become more accessible to a much wider variety of audiences. According to McNair, both developments can be set in the context of a wider shift towards a "striptease culture" which has disrupted the boundaries between public and private discourse in late modern Western culture, and which is evident more generally in cultural trends which privilege lifestyle, reality, interactivity, self-revelation and public intimacy.&lt;ref name=McNair /&gt;

Children and adolescents spend more time engaging with media than any other age group. This is a time in their life that they are more susceptible to information that they receive. Children are getting sex education from the media, little kids are exposed to sexualized images and more information than ever before in human history but are not able to process the information, they are not developmentally ready to process it, and this impacts their development and behavior.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

Sexualization of young girls in the media and infantilization of women creates an environment where it becomes more acceptable to view children as "seductive and sexy".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; It makes having healthy sexual relationships more difficult for people and creates sexist attitudes. Sexualization also contributes to sexual violence and childhood sexual abuse "where 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys are sexually abused during childhood".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

== Criticism ==

The Australian writers, [[Catharine Lumby]] and Kath Albury (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lumby | first1 = Catharine | last2 = Albury | first2 = Kath | title = Introduction: children, young people, sexuality and the media | journal = Media International Australia | volume = 135 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–60 | doi = 10.1177/1329878X1013500108 | date = May 2010 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that sexualization is "a debate that has been simmering for almost a decade" and concerns about sex and the media are far from new. Much of the recent writing on sexualization has been the subject of criticism that because of the way that it draws on "one-sided, selective, overly simplifying, generalizing, and negatively toned" evidence&lt;ref name="Vanwesenbeeck2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Vanwesenbeeck | first = Ine | title = The risks and rights of sexualization: an appreciative commentary on Lerum and Dworkin's "''Bad Girls Rule''" | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 268–270 | doi = 10.1080/00224490903082694 | pmid = 19657946 | date = July 2009 | ref = harv }}

The sexualization of women being influenced by society is a problem that should be avoided due to its impact on how women value and present themselves.

'''Social peer-to-peer processes''' are interactions with a [[peer-to-peer]] dynamic. These peers can be humans or computers. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a term that originated from the popular concept of the P2P distributed computer application architecture which partitions tasks or workloads between peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does Peer-to-Peer Architecture (P2P Architecture) mean?|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/454/peer-to-peer-architecture-p2p-architecture|publisher=Techopedia Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}} This application structure was popularized by [[file sharing]] systems like [[Napster]], the first of its kind in the late 1990s.

The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P human dynamic affords a critical look at current [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[centralization|centralized]] social structures. Peer-to-peer is also a political and social program for those who believe that in many cases, peer-to-peer modes are a preferable option.

== Definition ==
P2P is a specific form of relational dynamic, based on the assumed [[equipotent|equipotency]] of its participants, organized through the free cooperation of equals in view of the performance of a common task, for the creation of a common good, with forms of decision making and autonomy that are widely distributed throughout the network.

There are several fundamental aspects of social P2P processes:
* [[peer production]] - the collaborative production of use value is open to participation and use to the widest possible number (as defined by [[Yochai Benkler]], in his essay Coase's Penguin);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf | title = Coase's Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm | first = Yochai | last = Benkler | publisher = The Yale Law Journal | format = PDF | date =  | accessdate = 2010-04-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101010152105/http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf | archivedate = 2010-10-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* peer governance - production or project is governed by the community of producers themselves, not by market allocation or corporate hierarchy;
* peer property - the use-value of property is freely accessible on a universal basis; peer services and products are distributed through new modes of property, which are not exclusive, though recognize individual authorship (i.e. the [[GNU General Public License]] or the [[Creative Commons]] licenses).

Peer production does not produce commodities for exchange value, and does not use the [[price mechanism]] or [[corporate]] [[hierarchy]] to determine the allocation of resources. It must therefore be distinguished from both the [[capitalist]] [[Market (economics)|market]] (though it can be linked and embedded in the broader market) and from production through state and corporate planning; as a mode of [[governance]] it differs from traditional [[linear]] hierarchies; and as a mode of property it differs from both traditional private property and state-based collective [[public property]]; it is rather the common property of its producers and users and the whole of humankind. Unlike [[private property]], peer property is inclusive rather than exclusive — its nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible.

== Characteristics ==
P2P processes are not structureless, but are characterized by dynamic and changing structures which adapt themselves to phase changes. Its rules are not derived from an external authority, as in hierarchical systems, but are generated from within. It does not deny ‘authority’, but only fixed forced hierarchy, and therefore accepts authority based on expertise, initiation of the project, etc. P2P may be the first true [[meritocracy]]{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. P2P eliminates most, if not all, barriers to entry. The threshold for participation is kept as low as possible. Equipotency means that there is no prior formal filtering for participation, but rather that it is the immediate practice of cooperation which determines the expertise and level of participation. Communication is not top-down and based on strictly defined reporting rules, but feedback is systemic, integrated in the protocol of the cooperative system. Techniques of 'participation capture' and other social accounting make automatic cooperation the default scheme of the project. Personal identity becomes partly generated by the contribution to the common project. P2P characterists have been studied by [[Howard Rheingold]] ''et al.'''s Cooperation Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rheingold.com/cooperation/CooperationProject_3_30_05.pdf |title=The Cooperation Project: Objectives, Accomplishments, Proposals |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P2P is a network, not a linear or 'pyramidal' hierarchy (though it may have elements of it); it is 'distributed', though it may have elements of [[centralization]] and 'decentralisation'; intelligence is not located at any center, but everywhere within the system. Assumed equipotency means that P2P systems start from the premise that ‘it doesn’t know where the needed resource will be located’, it assumes that ‘everybody’ can cooperate, and does not use formal rules in advance to determine its participating members. Participants are expected to self-select the module that corresponds best to their expertise. Equipotency, i.e. the capacity to cooperate, is verified in the process of cooperation itself. [[Data validation|Validation]] of knowledge, acceptance of processes, are determined by the collective through the use of digital rules which are embedded in the project's basic protocol. Cooperation must be free, not forced, and not based on neutrality (i.e. the buying of cooperation in a monetary system). It exists to produce something. It enables the widest possible participation. These are a number of characteristics that we can use to describe P2P systems ‘in general’, and in particular as it emerges in the human lifeworld. Whereas participants in hierarchical systems are subject to the panoptism of the select few who control the vast majority, in P2P systems, participants have access to holoptism, the ability for any participant to see the whole.

== Infrastructure ==
The first requirement to facilitate the emergence of peer-to-peer processes is the existence of a technological infrastructure that enables distributed access to fixed capital. Individual computers that enable a universal machine capable of executing any logical task are a form of distributed fixed capital, available at low cost to many producers. The internet, as a point to point network, was specifically designed for participation by the edges (computer users) without the use of obligatory hubs. Although it is not fully in the hands of its participants, the internet is controlled through distributed governance, and outside the complete hegemony of particular private or state actors. The Internet's hierarchical elements, such as the stacked [[IP protocol]]s and [[Domain Name System]], do not deter participation. Viral communicators, or meshworks, are a logical extension of the internet. With this methodology, devices create their own networks through the use of excess capacity, bypassing the need for a pre-existing infrastructure. [[Wireless community network]]s, Open Spectrum advocacy, file-serving television, and alternative meshwork-based telecommunication infrastructures are exemplary of this trend.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=499
  |title=The Political Economy of Peer Production
  |date=2005-01-12
  |author=
  |publisher=CTheory
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second requirement is alternative information and communication systems which allow for [[autonomous]] communication between cooperating agents. The web (in particular the Writeable Web and the [[Web 2.0]] that is in the process of being established) allows for the universal autonomous production, dissemination, and 'consumption' of written material while the associated [[podcasting]] and [[webcasting]] developments create an 'alternative information and communication infrastructure' for audio and audiovisual creation. The existence of such an infrastructure enables autonomous content production that may be distributed without the intermediary of the classic publishing and broadcasting media (though new forms of mediation may arise).&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The third requirement is the existence of a 'software' infrastructure for autonomous global cooperation. A growing number of collaborative tools, such as blogs and wikis, embedded in [[social networking]] software facilitate the creation of trust and [[social capital]], making it possible to create global groups that can create [[use-value]] without the intermediary of manufacturing or distribution by for-profit [[Business|enterprises]].&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The fourth requirement is a legal infrastructure that enables the creation of use-value and protects it from private [[appropriation (economics)|appropriation]]. The [[General Public License]] (which prohibits the appropriation of software code), the related [[Open Source Initiative]], and certain versions of the [[Creative Commons]] license fulfill this role. They enable the protection of common use-value and use viral characteristics to spread. [[GPL]] and related material can only be used in projects that in turn put their adapted source code in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The fifth requirement is cultural. The diffusion of mass intellectuality, (i.e. the distribution of human intelligence) and associated changes in ways of feeling and being ([[ontology]]), ways of knowing ([[epistemology]]) and value constellations ([[axiology]]) have been instrumental in creating the type of cooperative individualism needed to sustain an [[ethos]] which can enable P2P projects.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

== In the economy ==

=== Capitalism ===
There are two important aspects to the emergence of P2P in the economic sphere. On the one hand, as format for peer production processes, it is emerging as a 'third mode of production' based on the cooperation of autonomous agents. Indeed, if the first mode of production was [[laissez-faire]] based [[capitalism]], and the second mode was the model of a [[Central planning|centrally-planned]] economy, then the third mode is defined neither by the motor of profit, nor by central planning: to allocate resources and make decisions, it does not use market and pricing mechanisms, or managerial commands, but instead uses [[social relations]]. Peer production is a significant part of the [[mainstream]] economy, even if it is not much advertised as such in mainstream economic literature.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

Despite significant differences, P2P and the capitalist market are highly interconnected. P2P is dependent on the market and the market is dependent on P2P. Peer production produces [[use-value]] through mostly [[Intellectual capital|immaterial]] production, without directly providing an income for its producers. Participants cannot live from peer production, though they derive meaning and value from it.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The market and capitalism are also dependent on P2P. Capitalism has become a system relying on distributed networks, in particular on the P2P infrastructure in computing and communication. Productivity is highly reliant on cooperative [[teamwork]], most often organized in ways that are derivative of peer production's governance. The support given by major IT companies to [[open-source software development|open-source development]] is a testimony to the use derived from even the new common property regimes. The general [[business model]] seems to be that businesses use the P2P [[infrastructure]], and create a surplus value through services, which can be packaged for [[exchange value]]. For-profit enterprises mostly use partial implementations of P2P. [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] built itself around user reviews,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} [[eBay]] lives on a platform of worldwide distributed auctions, and [[Google]] is constituted by [[user-generated]] content. Value creation today is no longer confined to the enterprise, but beholden to the mass intellectuality of [[knowledge worker]]s, who through their lifelong learning/experiencing and systemic connectivity, constantly innovate within and without the enterprise.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; Yet more recently, in the last decade, peer-to-peer exchanges have become even more prevalent in the so-called "[[sharing economy]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The rise of the sharing economy|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21573104-internet-everything-hire-rise-sharing-economy|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also termed an "access economy" or a "peer exchange economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Popularity of Peer-to-Peer Exchanges in the Last Decade|url=http://www.gearpeers.com/blog/the-popularity-of-peer-to-peer-exchanges-in-the-last-decade/|publisher=Gear Peers|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, businesses such as [[Uber]], [[Lyft]], and [[Airbnb]] are all based on peer-to-peer physical exchanges. This sharing economy is projected by some analysts to encompass $335 billion by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Car Sharing Economy|url=http://www.drivemycar.com.au/Long-term-rental-in-the-car-sharing-economy|publisher=DriveMyCar|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhuo|first1=TX|title=Airbnb and Uber Are Just the Beginning. What's Next for the Sharing Economy.|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244192|publisher=Entrepreneur|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer-to-peer systems contribute to more specific forms of distributed capitalism. The massive use of [[open source software]] in business, enthusiastically supported by [[venture capital]] and large IT companies such as [[IBM]], is creating a distributed software platform that will drastically undercut the [[monopolistic]] rents enjoyed by companies such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], while [[Skype]] and [[VoIP]] will drastically redistribute the [[Telecommunications service provider|telecom]] infrastructure. In addition, it also points to a new business model that is 'beyond' products, focusing instead on services associated with the nominally free FS/OS software model. Industries are gradually transforming themselves to incorporate user-generated innovation, and a new intermediation may occur around user-generated media. Many knowledge workers are choosing non-corporate paths and becoming mini-entrepreneurs, relying on an increasingly sophisticated participatory infrastructure, a kind of digital corporate commons.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

=== Market economy ===
Social P2P systems are different from [[market economy]]:&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; neither market pricing nor managerial command are required for P2P processes to make decisions regarding the allocation of [[resources]]. There are further differences:

* Market economy is similar to insect-like [[swarm intelligence]]. There are autonomous agents in a distributed environment, but each individual only sees his own immediate benefit.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;
* Markets are based on 'neutral' cooperation, and not on [[synergistic]] cooperation: no [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] is created.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;
* Markets operate on the production and exchange of value to generate [[Profit (economics)|profit]], not [[production for use]].
* Whereas P2P aims at full participation, markets only fulfill the needs of those with [[purchasing power]].

Markets do not function well for common needs that do not involve direct payment&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; ([[national security|national defense]], general policing, [[education]] and [[public health]]). In addition, they fail to take into account [[negative externalities]]&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; (the environment, social costs, future generations).

=== P2P economic system ===
In ''The Political Economy of Peer Production'' Bauwens regards P2P phenomena as an emerging alternative to capitalist society. P2P economy may be seen as extending or already existing outside the sphere of free/open source software production and other non-rival immaterial goods. Peer production effectively enables the free cooperation of producers, who have access to their own means of [[Production (economics)|production]], and the resulting use-value of the projects supersedes for-profit alternatives.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

Historically, though forces of higher [[productivity]] may be temporarily embedded in the old productive system, they ultimately lead to deep upheavals and reconstitutions of the [[political economy]]. The emergence of capitalist modes within the [[feudal system]] is a case in point. This is particularly significant because leading sectors of the for-profit economy are deliberately slowing down productive growth (through patents and [[Monopoly|monopolization]]) and trying to outlaw P2P production and sharing practices.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

== In politics ==

=== Governance ===
[[Government]]s of countries are composed of a specialized and privileged body of individuals, who [[monopolize]] political decision-making. Their function is to enforce existing laws, [[legislate]] new ones, and arbitrate conflicts via their monopoly on violence. Legislation can be open to the general [[citizenry]] through [[open source governance]], allowing policy development to benefit from the collected wisdom of the people as a whole.

[[Michel Bauwens]] has stated, that society is not a peer group with an [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] [[consensus]], but rather a [[decentralized]] structure of competing groups and [[representative democracy]] cannot be replaced entirely by peer governance.&lt;ref name="Re-public"&gt;{{cite news

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer projects which evolve beyond a certain scale and start facing issues of decisions about scarce [[resources]], will probably adapt some representational mechanisms. Representative and [[bureaucratic]] [[decision-making]] can and will in some places be replaced by global governance networks which may be self-governed to a large extent, but in any case, it will and should incorporate more and more [[Multistakeholder Model]]s (i.e. [[collaborative e-democracy]]), which strives to include all groups that could be affected. This group-based partnership model is different, but related in spirit, to the individual-based peer governance, because they share an [[ethos]] of participation.&lt;ref name="Re-public"/&gt;

=== Open source movements ===
Many new movements are taking on P2P organizational formats, such as the [[alter-globalization]] movement and the [["Occupy" protests|"Occupy"]] movement (i.e. [[Occupy Wall Street]]). The movements see itself as a network of networks that combines players from a wide variety of fields and opinion, who, despite the fact that they do not see eye to eye in all things, manage to unite around a common [[Computing platform|platform]] of action around certain key events.

They are able to mobilize vast numbers of people from every [[continent]], without having at their disposal any of the traditional [[news media]], such as television, radio or newspapers. Rather, they rely almost exclusively on the P2P technologies described above. Thus, Internet media are used for communication and learning on a continuous basis, prior to the mobilizations, and also during the mobilizations.

Independent Internet media platforms such as [[Indymedia]], as well as the skillful use of mobile phones, are used for real-time response management, undertaken by small groups that use buddy-list technologies, and sometimes open source programs that have been explicitly designed for political activism such as TextMob.

Many reports have appeared, including those described in Howard Rheingold's [[Smart Mob]]s, about the political significance of [[SMS]] in organizing successful protests and ‘democratic revolutions’. The network model allows for a more fluid organization that does not fix any group in a permanent adversarial position. Various temporary coalitions are created on an [[ad hoc]] basis depending on the issues.

'''Social viewing''' describes a recently developed practice revolving around the ability for multiple users to aggregate from multiple sources and view [[online]] [[video]]s together in a synchronized viewing experience.

Typically the experience also involves some form of [[Instant messaging &amp; messengers|instant messaging]] or [[communication]] to facilitate discussion pertaining to the common viewing experience.

The term in this context originated with the [[Toronto]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]-based company View2Gether&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.view2gether.com/ View2gether – Welcome to Social Viewing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213230139/http://www.view2gether.com/ |date=2007-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has created proprietary technology for aggregating content from sources not controlled by the user for synchronized play and inclusion in common [[playlist]]s by multiple participants with a commensurate instant messaging chat function. Other sites which provide similar functionality include Oortle (Photophlow),&lt;ref&gt;[http://oortle.com/ Oortle home page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429201312/http://www.oortle.com/ |date=2008-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SeeToo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seetoo.com/ SeeToo home page]&lt;/ref&gt; and development of social viewing for existing portals such as Yahoo have recently been announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timetags.research.yahoo.com/zync/ Zync from Yahoo!

The term has been used in some cases to describe online viewing within the framework of a social network,&lt;ref&gt;http://paidcontent.org/article/419-bebo-launches-open-media-platform-for-social-viewing-22-tv-partners/&lt;/ref&gt; however View2gether and similar sites have reconfigured the term to mean a common viewing experience as a social activity.

Social viewing has also been used in the past to describe activities such as gathering for the viewing of particular [[television program]]s, such as [[soap opera]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.sabinet.co.za/images/ejour/comcare/comcare_v23_n2_a2.pdf Soap opera viewing in a communal context : an ethnographic examination of the viewing experiences of black Zulu-speaking students living in university residences&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of modern social viewing sites include [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]], [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]].

{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology of gender''' is a prominent subfield of [[sociology]]. Social interaction directly correlated with sociology regarding social structure. One of the most important social structures is [[Social status|status]]. This is determined based on position that an individual possesses which effects how he/she will be treated by society. One of the most important statuses an individual claims is gender.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qjjbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=gender+roles+in+marriage#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20roles%20in%20marriage&amp;f=false|title=Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective|last=Lindsey|first=Linda L.|date=2015-10-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317348085|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discourse and the academic literature generally use the term ''[[gender]]'' for the perceived or projected ([[Gender identity|self-identified]]) [[masculinity]] or [[femininity]] of a person.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Introduction==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
The term ''gender role'' was coined by [[John Money]] in a seminal 1955 paper where he defined it as "all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman."&lt;ref name="Basic-Concepts"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Money |first=John |authorlink1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |url= |journal=Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=301–19 |doi= |pmid=13260820 |quote=By the term, gender role, we mean all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively. It includes, but is not restricted to sexuality in the sense of eroticism. Gender role is appraised in relation to the following: general mannerisms, deportment and demeanor, play preferences and recreational interests; spontaneous topics of talk in unprompted conversation and casual comment; content of dreams, daydreams, and fantasies; replies to oblique inquiries and projective tests; evidence of erotic practices and, finally, the person's own replies to direct inquiry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person's gender is complex, encompassing countless characteristics of appearance, speech, movement and other factors not solely limited to [[biological sex]]. Societies tend to have [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] [[gender systems]] in which everyone is categorized as [[male]] or [[female]]. Some societies include a [[third gender]] role; for instance, the Native American [[Two-Spirit]] people and the [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]]s of India. There is debate over the extent to which gender is a [[social construct]] or a [[Sex differences in humans|biological construct .]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0465077144|location=New York|pages=|via=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In feminist theory==
{{Main|Feminist theory|Feminist sociology}}

During the 1970s, there was no consensus about how the terms were to be applied. In the 1974 edition of ''Masculine/Feminine or Human'', the author uses "innate gender" and  "learned sex roles", but in the 1978 edition, the use of ''sex'' and ''gender'' is reversed. By 1980, most feminist writings had agreed on using ''gender'' only for socioculturally adapted traits.

Liberal feminism is the belief that individuals should be free to develop their own talents and pursue their interests. Individuals seek to expand equality by removing the barriers in society. Socialist feminism thinks that capitalism strengthens patriarchy by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a few. The traditional family structure should be replaced by a collective revolution. In Radical feminism, they believe that patriarchy is so deeply rooted in society that even a sociological revolution would not end it; Society must eliminate gender itself.

==Other languages==
In English, both ''sex'' and ''gender'' are used in contexts where they could not be substituted (sexual intercourse; anal sex; safe sex; sex worker; sex slave). Other languages, like [[German language|German]], use the same word ''Geschlecht'' to refer both to grammatical gender and to biological sex, making the distinction between ''sex'' and ''gender'' advocated by some anthropologists difficult. In some contexts, German has adopted the English loan-word ''gender'' to achieve this distinction. Sometimes 'Geschlechtsidentität' is used as gender (although it literally means ''gender identity'') and 'Geschlecht' as sex (translation of [[Judith Butler]]'s ''[[Gender Trouble]]''). More common is the use of modifiers: ''biologisches Geschlecht'' for ''sex'', ''Geschlechtsidentität'' for ''gender identity'' and ''Geschlechterrolle'' for ''gender role'' etc.

==U.S. media==

Media criticism is a reflection of the gender inequality in society through print, advertisements, television and music.  Media influences and reinforces the idea of [[The Beauty Myth]] as discussed in [[Naomi Wolf]]'s book, The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, which refers to unrealistic standards of beauty for women.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Naomi. The Beauty Myth: how images of beauty are used against women. N.p.: Perennial, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the mainstream media perpetuates the idea of hetero-masculinity by portraying men as dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael. Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men . New York : HarperCollins, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some also argue that the media objectifies and oppresses women, and men who don't fall into the heteronormative category.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, S. (1999). "Never Just Pictures" in Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oppression ===

Through the media, men are taught to be ultra-masculine by being desensitized, violent, and physically strong.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. (2002) 8 Reasons Why Eminem's Popularity is a Disaster for Women.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other forms of media that often portray the ultra-masculine figure are advertisements, specifically beer commercials.  These forms encourage men to oppress other men if they do not fit the ideals of heteromasculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Strate, L. (2004) "Beer Commercials: A manual for masculinity" in Kimmel, M. S., &amp; Messner (Eds.), M. A. Men's Lives (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn and Bacon. pp. 533-543.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objectification of women ===
{{See also|Sexualisation}}

Objectification of women refers to instances in the media in which women may be viewed as, or directly compared to, insentient objects that can be acquired and/or possessed. This can be examined in the context of advertisements, where objects may be anthropomorphized and given feminine qualities or aspects of the female form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/objectify.|title=Definition of OBJECTIFY|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some studies indicate that widespread objectification of women in the media may have significant repercussions on society, such as low self-esteem and/or eating disorders among women.&lt;ref&gt;Greening, Kacey D. "The Objectification and Dismemberment of Women in the Media." Undergraduate Research Journal for the Human Sciences (2004): n. pag. URC. Web. 8 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.kon.org/urc/v5/greening.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and socialization==
{{See also|Socialization#Gender socialization}}
Socialization theory offers a straightforward account of the acquisition of gendered identities. Infants are seen as blank slates, waiting to be written down on by their environment. Through their interactions with people close to them and exposure to the values of their society, infants learn what sex is attributed to them and what roles they are expected to learn. Reinforcement (through rewarding gender-appropriate behavior and punishing what may seem as deviant behavior) socializes children into their genders.&lt;ref name="thorne"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Play: Girls and Boys in School|author=Thorne, Barrie|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8135-1923-3|location=New Brunswick, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents, for example, are far more likely to engage with their sons in rough physical play than they are with their daughters, and it has been argued that long-term consequences may follow (in this case, a head start for boys in the development of physical violence and aggressiveness.)&lt;ref&gt;Mcdonald, K. and R.D. Park (1986). Parent-child physical play, Sex Roles, Vol.15, pp.367-378&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents and family can influence the way that a child develops their view of gender. These types of influences can include parental attitudes and difference of treatment regarding male and female children. Researcher Susan Witt claims that parents also expose children to gender from the time they are born via specific toys, colors, and names associated with genders in the binary. Witt suggests that parental attitudes about gender can differ from male to female children and that these attitudes develop quickly after a child's birth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witt|first1=Susan|title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles|journal=Adolesncence|date=Summer 1997|volume=32|issue=126|pages=253–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Susan Grieshaber, in "Constructing the Gendered Infant", suggests that attitudes regarding pregnancy change after parents find out the sex of their child, subsequently changing parental attitudes towards the unborn child. According to Grieshaber's theory, once parents determine the sex of their unborn child, they assume a gender while planning for the child's arrival. Because of this, Grieshaber claims that infants are born into a gendered world where they never know anything other than the gender traits that are assumed due to their sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Early Childhood|last=Yelland|first=Nicola|last2=Grieshaber|first2=Susan|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=0-415-15409-X|location=New York, New York|pages=15–35|chapter=Constructing the Gendered Infant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Kara Smith utilizes similar theory throughout the analysis of her pregnancy journals kept throughout her second pregnancy. Smith concluded that her attitude towards her child changed after learning that her child’s sex was male. Smith's claim is reflected in changes in tone of voice when talking to the unborn child as well as differences in physical touch of her stomach throughout the rest of her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kara|date=2005|title=Prebirth Gender Talk: A Case Study in Prenatal Socialization|url=|journal=Women and Language|volume=28|pages=49–53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory of gender socialization, discussed by Susan McHale, is that the gender roles and attitudes of older siblings can impact the gender roles adopted by younger children. Throughout the findings of McHale's study, it is maintained that parents still have the most familial influence on childhood socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McHale|first=Susan|date=2001|title=Sibling Influences on Gender Development in Middle Childhood and Early Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/H_Helms_Sibling_2001.pdf|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=37|pages=115–125|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.1.115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time children reach the age of three, many will have acquired a firm sense of themselves as male or female, a gender identity that remains throughout life. In addition, many pre-schoolers develop a firm awareness of [[gender stereotypes]], insisting that certain activities or items of clothing are not for girls and others not for boys. Yet gender identity does not automatically follow from biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|date=2000|title=The Five Sexes, Revisited|url=|journal=The Sciences|volume=40|issue=4|pages=18–23|via=|doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.2000.tb03504.x|pmid=12569934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paradoxes of Gender|last=Lorber|first=Judith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-300-06497-1|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults respond differently to communicative efforts of boys and girls. A study of infants aged 13 months found that when boys demand attention - by behaving aggressively, or crying, whining or screaming - they tended to get it. By contrast, adults tended to respond to girls only when they used language, gestures, or gentle touches; girls who used attention-seeking techniques were likely ignored. There was little difference in the communicative patterns at the start of the study, but by the age of two, the girls have become more talkative and boys more assertive in their communicative techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fagot | first1 = B.I | year = 1985 | title = Differential reactions to assertive and communicative acts by toddler boys and girls | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 56 | issue = 6| pages = 1499–505 | doi=10.2307/1130468| pmid = 4075871 | jstor = 1130468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The norms that are taught throughout childhood are influential in an individual's life because the ideas about gender that are typically taught by parents in early years are reinforced outside of the home.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A study done by Dr. Mick Cunningham states that the normative behaviors and attitudes that children observe can influence the way that these children grow up to structure their own households in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=Mick|date=April 2001|title=Parental Influences on the Gendered Division of Housework|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=66|issue=2|pages=184|doi=10.2307/2657414|via=|jstor=2657414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normative gender roles can be reinforced outside of the household, adding power to these hegemonic ideas about gender. An analysis of children’s books in the twenty-first century, by Janice McCabe, suggests that this particular avenue of children’s media symbolically annihilates females, representing them about half as often as that of males. Underrepresentation such as this can affect children and their views of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=Janice|date=2011|title=Gender in Twentieth- Century Children's Books|url=|journal=Gender and Sociology|volume=25|issue=2|pages=197–226|via=PsychINFO|doi=10.1177/0891243211398358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children’s TV networks, such as Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network have demonstrated a disproportional representation of males and females on their respective shows in a study done by Beth Hentges and Kim Case. According to Hentges and Case, there are less female characters across all three children’s networks; however, there is more propagation of stereotypical gendered behavior on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon than that of Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hentges|first=Beth|last2=Case|first2=Kim|date=2013|title=Gender Representation on Disney Channel, Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon Broadcasts in the United States|url=|journal=Journal of Children and Media|volume=7|issue=3|pages=319–333|doi=10.1080/17482798.2012.729150|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atypical Household Influence on Gender Socialization ===

Some children are raised in atypical households that challenge normative gender roles. In Jada Tidwell's study, she observes the play of children who come from households with lesbian feminist mothers (both single mothers and couples). Tidwell's observations consisted of both individual play as well as play integrated with the mothers. As a result of these observations, Tidwell asserts that atypical environments can affect children’s lives and ideas. According to Tidwell, households that challenge hegemonic cultural ideas ultimately give children a different perspective of gender than those of children raised in heterosexual, two parent households. In the families studied by Jada Tidwell, children reported ideas that both endorsed and challenged stereotypical gender roles at times.&lt;ref&gt;Tidwell, Jada Annette. “Gender Development in Children with Atypical Parental Socialization: An Example of Lesbian Feminist Mothers.” ''Georgia State University,'' US: ProQuest Information &amp; Learning, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In a different study, Abbie Goldberg observed toddlers from various types of households and how these children engaged in play. Goldberg's findings suggest that children whose parents are of the same gender tend to play in ways that are less adherent to stereotypical gender roles than children from heterosexual households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Abbie|date=November 2012|title=Gender- Typed Play Behavior in Early Childhood: Adopted Children with Lesbian, Gay, and Heterosexual Parents|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=67|issue=9–10|pages=503–515|via=PsychINFO|doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0198-3|pmid=23420542|pmc=3572788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Witt, in her article “Parental Influence on Children’s Socialization to Gender Roles’, advocates for androgynous gender roles in parenting, arguing that environments are more open minded about gender and encouraging to both their sons and daughters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Gender and psychoanalysis==
One of the most influential of the psychoanalytic theories of gender identity is the perspective developed in the book The Reproduction of Mothering. Its author, Nancy Chodorow, traces the implications for emotional development by linking them with the way mothers usually care for their infants in their formative years, while fathers are more emotionally distant. The development of an identity takes place as the infant gets more and more separated from his/her mother, with whom the infant is initially psychically merged. This process however operates differently for boys and girls. Girls can separate gradually, maintain a continuous sense of relationship with the mother, who is after all experienced as alike. For boys, on the other hand, separating from the mother, who is experienced as different, involves repressing the feminine aspects of themselves and rejecting their tenderness that was central to that early relationship. Boys' sense of maleness, according to Chodorow, is achieved at a great emotional cost.&lt;ref&gt;Chodorow, N. (1978). ''The Reproduction of Mothering'', Berkeley, CA, and London, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, men grow up to have a more autonomous sense of self, and to be more independent, more instrumental and competitive in their dealings with others. They are also more likely to have difficulty expressing their emotions and to be anxious about intimacy. Women, on the other hand, have more ability and more need to sustain relationship with others.; they have greater empathy with others. They have difficulty however in maintaining the boundaries of an independent and autonomous self.

Chodorow however believes that these patterns aren't inevitable. Changes in the social arrangements for care of children such as dual parenting, which would involve fathers in emotional intimacy with their children, can break the cycle.

==Gender and the division of labor==
Before industrialization, economic activity, which centered around agricultural work, crafts and so on, was organized by households. Household members, whether male or female, young or old, contributed to the family's livelihood. Although women might do some types of work and men others, depending on region and class, the distinction between men as breadwinners and women as housewives didn't characterize pre-industrial divisions of labor.

Industrialization shifted much productive activity to factories, shops and offices. This separation of work from home signaled a profound change in gender relations and gender discourse. The home came to be understood not as the site of a family enterprise, but as a refuge from the world of work. Women were defined as the keepers of the home, as it was seen as their nature to create harmony and virtue rather than services and goods. Preindustrial society relied on gendered roles in the workforce to create equilibrium between men and women. Men were assigned the hunter role while women were assigned the domestic roles. Men were expected to supply food and shelter for the family while women were the caretakers for the children and their household. As centuries passed, this continued and created a divide in gendered roles in labor. Women remained dependent on men to provide, this dependence led to male roles being more valued in society which still remains in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Gender in conversation==
Some research has found that, in classroom settings, male students tend to talk more, and longer, than female students. This was determined to be particularly noticeable when the instructor is male.&lt;ref name=krupnick-1985&gt;{{cite web |last=Krupnick |first=Catherine G. |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/html/icb.topic58474/krupnick.html |title=Women and Men in the Classroom: Inequality and Its Remedies |work=On Teaching and Learning, Volume 1 |year=1985 |accessdate=3013-06-23 |publisher=Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar results were found previously in hospitals by Erving Goffman in 1961, university discussion groups by Elizabeth Aries in 1972, and in corporate settings by Rosabeth Kanter in 1977.&lt;ref name=krupnick-1985/&gt;

=== Gender in the workplace ===
Women and men experience different types of mobility within the workplace. Women tend to experience a [[glass ceiling]], an invisible barrier that prevents them from moving up the corporate ladder. Men in jobs traditionally held by women, such as nursing, elementary school teaching, and social work, experience a "glass escalator" effect in which they are able to quickly ascend the job hierarchy to become managers and principals.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Christine L., "The Glass Escalator: The Hidden Advantages for Men in the "Female" Professions", Social Problems, 39(3), pp. 253-267&lt;/ref&gt; There also tends to be a [[gender pay gap]] between men and women, with women earning 77% as much as men.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}
 
One cause of the gender pay gap may be due to [[occupational segregation]], which pushes men and women towards gender-specific forms of employment, rather than pay discrimination. Another cause is the [[double burden]], a phenomenon in which women perform most of the unpaid childcare and household work despite being otherwise employed for pay. A third cause is [[occupational sexism]], one part of which favors men for promotions due to their traditional breadwinner status.&lt;ref&gt;Coltrane, Scott. 1997. Family Man: Fatherhood, Housework, and Gender Equity. Oxford University Press, USA&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 class action lawsuit, [[Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.]], charged Wal-Mart with sexist hiring and promotion practices.

In addition, the emergence of [[transgender]] individuals in the workplace has begun to disrupt the gender binary of male and female.  By creating a hybrid gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;Connel, C. "Doing, Undoing, or Redoing Gender?: Learning from the Workplace Experiences of Transpeople."  Gender &amp; Society, 24(1), 31-55&lt;/ref&gt; the transgender community suggests notions of movement toward [[postgenderism]].{{peacock term|date=June 2013}}

== Intersectionality ==
[[Intersectionality]] is a [[Neo-Marxist]] concept stemming from a [[critical theory]] social analysis of [[class (social)|class]], [[race (human classification)|race]], and [[gender]]. The theory of intersectionality argues that forms of "inequality, oppression, and privilege" are shaped by interconnected axes of identity, and are mutually reinforced by social interactions and by social, political, and economic structures, such as capitalism, patriarchy, and institutionalized heteronormativity.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"&gt;Candace West and Sarah Fenstermaker, "Doing Difference," Gender and Society 9, no. 1 (Feb 1995): 8-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory of Intersectionality argues that race, class, gender, and other markers of identity are social constructions.&lt;ref&gt;West, C. Z. (1987). Doing Gender. Gender and Society, 1 (2), 125-151.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory argues against the assumption that systems of power relations are normative and can hold individuals accountable for their own character and efforts.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"/&gt;

West &amp; Fenstermaker in their 1995 article ''[[Doing Difference]]'' offer that models that conceive gender, race and class as distinct axes are highly limiting in their understanding of the whole experience or identity of an individual. For example, they critique the additive model, in which the whole will never be greater (or lesser) than the sum of it parts. By analyzing each identity marker as an individual characteristic, we ignore the effect of the interconnection of these markers.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"/&gt;

Additional sociologists have written about the intersectionality of class, race, and gender. Joan Acker outlines four gendered processes of intersectionality. The first includes procedures that create hierarchies based on gender and race. Another is the process in which social images and ideas condone gendered institutions. The third is a process of interaction between individuals and groups that, through communication, creates gender. The fourth is the internal labeling of the self and others to gendered personas.&lt;ref&gt;Acker, J. (1992). From Sex Roles to Gendered Institutions. Contemporary Sociology, 21 (5), 565-569.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evelyn Nakano Glenn]] critiques both the patriarchy model of gender, which ignores racial differences among oppressed women, and the internal colonialism model, which focuses on minority populations in general, ignoring gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, E. N. (1985). Racial Ethnic Women's Labor: The Intersection of Race, Gender and Class Oppression. Review of Radical Political Economics, 17 (85), 86-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embodiment==

Embodiment may be defined as the ways in which cultural ideals of gender in a given society create expectations for and influence the form of our bodies. There is a bidirectional relationship between biology and culture; by embodying societally determined [[gender roles]] we reinforce cultural ideals and simultaneously shape, both temporarily and permanently, our bodies, which then perpetuates the cultural ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Connel, R.W. 2002. ''Gender: Short Introductions.'' Malden: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; While there is actually more variation in body type within the male and female sexes than there is between the two sexes, embodiment exaggerates the perceived bodily differences between gender categories.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. 2011. ''The Gendered Society.'' New York: Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social embodiment, for both men and women, is variable across cultures and over time. Examples of women embodying [[gender norms]] across cultures include [[foot binding]] practices in Chinese culture, [[neck rings]] in African and Asian cultures, and [[corsets]] in Western cultures. Another interesting phenomenon has been the practice of wearing [[high heels]], which shifted from a masculine fashion to a feminine fashion over time. In the United States, the ideal body image and dimensions have changed for both women and men, with the body ideal [[female body shape]] becoming progressively slimmer and the body ideal for men becoming progressively larger.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Susan. 1999. "Never Just Pictures" in ''Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J.'' University of California Press, pp. 107-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

These differences are epitomized in the example of children's toys; [[G.I. Joe]] dolls depict the physical ideals for boys and [[Barbie]] dolls embody the ideals for girls. [[The Beauty Myth]], as discussed in [[Naomi Wolf]]'s book The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, refers to the unattainable standard of beauty for women, which sustains [[consumer culture]]. In contrast, men's bodies are also "dictated" by cultural ideals of gender, as is evident in consumer culture—especially beer commercials—in which men are portrayed as outdoorsy, tough, strong, and "manly."&lt;ref&gt;Buysse, J.A.M. and Embser-Herbert, M.S. "Construction of Gender in Sport: An Analysis of Intercollegiate Media Guide Cover Photographs." ''Gender and Society'', 18 (1), 2004, pp. 66-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality==

Sexuality encompasses both sexual behavior and sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Pepper, and Virginia Rutter. 1998. The Gender of Sexuality. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Heteronormativity]] structures social life so that [[Heterosexuality]] is always assumed, expected, ordinary and privileged. Its pervasiveness makes it difficult for people to imagine other ways of life.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Stevi. 2006. Gender, sexuality and heterosexuality: The complexity (and limits) of heteronormativity. Feminist Theory 7:105-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media works to glorify heterosexuality, which in turn lends to its pervasiveness and to its power.&lt;ref name="Martin, K.A. 2009"&gt;Martin, K.A., &amp; Kayzak, E. (2009). Hetero-Romantic Love and Heterosexiness in Children's G-Rated Films. Gender and Society, 23(3), 315-336.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ordinary and exceptional constructions of heterosexuality work to normalize heterosexuality; thus, it becomes difficult to imagine anything other than this form of social relationship or anyone outside of these bonds.&lt;ref name="Martin, K.A. 2009"/&gt;

There is a common perception of heterosexuality as the "natural" emotional and sensual inclination for [[Human sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Rich, A. (1980). Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence. Signs, 5(4), 631-660.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, marital heterosexuality occupies the largely invisible core of normative and desirable sexuality, while all other sexualities are marginalized and considered perverse and unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, M. (2008). State of our Unions: Marriage Promotion and the Contested Power of Heterosexuality. Gender &amp; Society, 23(1), 27-48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] created a Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale called the [[Kinsey Scale]], which challenges the common perception of [[Human sexuality]] as strictly binary and directly linked to [[Gender]]. [[Drag queens]] are an example of "troubling" gender, complicating the understanding of sexuality in our society by causing people to think outside the binary of male/female.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, J. and Jasper, J.M. (eds). The Contexts Reader. New York: W.W. Norton, 2008. Pp. 247-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Engels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|title=Origin  of the Family, Private Property, and the State|date=1884|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/origin_family.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that in hunter-gatherer societies the activities of men and women, although different, had the same importance. As technological advances let to productive surplus, social equality and communal sharing gave way to private property and ultimately class hierarchy. With the rise of agriculture, men gained significant power over women. With surplus wealth to pass on to their heirs, upper class men wanted to ensure their sons were indeed theirs, which led them to control the sexuality of women. The desire to control property brought about monogamous marriage and family. Women were taught to remain virgins until marriage and remain faithful to their husbands thereafter, and to build their lives around bearing and raising one man's children.

==Masculinity==

[[Masculinity]] is a performed gender identity. Contrary to popular perception{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}, it is not the same as [[sex]] or [[sexual orientation]]. The contents and practices of masculinity are socially constructed and reproduced through daily interaction, especially on a more micro scale.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists West &amp; Zimmerman emphasized that gender is maintained through accountability. Men are expected to perform masculinity to the point that it is naturalized. Thus, a man's status depends on his performance. It is important to note, however, that masculinity can be performed by any sex.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masculinity and Crime"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krienert | first = Jessie L. | title = Masculinity and crime: a quantitative exploration of Messerschmidt's hypothesis | journal = [[Electronic Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | publisher = [[International Consortium for the Advancement of Academic Publication|ICAAP]] | date = July 2003 | url = http://www.sociology.org/content/vol7.2/01_krienert.html | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guyland&gt;{{cite book |last=Kimmel|first=Michael | author-link = Michael Kimmel |title= Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men |year=2008 |publisher= [[Harper (publisher)|Harper]] |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-06-083135-6  |url= https://archive.org/details/guylandperilousw00kimm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doing Difference"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Fenstermaker | first2 = Sarah | title = Doing difference | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 8&amp;ndash;37 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/089124395009001002 | date = February 1995 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/089124395009001002 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant form of masculinity in a society is known as [[hegemonic masculinity]]. Men are constantly performing this to prove their status as men.&lt;ref name="hegemonic"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.W. | last2 = Messerschmidt | first2 = James W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Hegemonic masculinity: rethinking the concept | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 829&amp;ndash;859 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243205278639 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639 | ref = harv| postscript = .}} [http://xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Connell,%20Hegemonic%20masculinity_0.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not really possible to reach it, especially as peers are in constant surveillance of each other, looking for flaws in their performance.&lt;ref name="hegemonic" /&gt; Hegemonic masculinity is constructed in opposition to [[femininity]] and is dominant to all other gender identities (including alternative masculinities). Men are [[socialization|socialized]] from birth to perform it, especially through behavior and symbolism. One of the prominent behaviors is aggression in order to protect one's reputation. An example of symbols used would be clothing.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Undoing Gender"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Connell | first = Catherine | title = Doing, undoing, or redoing gender?

Sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] describes three cultures that support masculinity (especially in young men) in his 2008 book, ''Guyland'':
* The Culture of Entitlement: Men are raised to feel they deserve something. They feel entitled to power, sex and women.
* The Culture of Silence: Men are not to talk to outsiders (those not embedded in the cultures of masculinity) about drinking, bullying, rape, or any performance of masculinity by their peers that they may get in trouble for. If they do talk, they will be seen as unmanly traitors.
* The Culture of Protection: Communities do not hold men responsible for questionable and illegal actions. Many turn a blind eye, assuming their boys would never do that. Others write off dangerous acts as "boys will be boys".&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

Some of the prominent attitudes and behaviors of western hegemonic masculinity are: power, sexual dominance and activity, wealth, aggression, independence, and lack of emotion. Less extreme sexual harassment is often seen as normal behavior.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt; Exemplifying [[control theory]], the norms of masculinity are so rigidly ingrained that men find little room to escape and end up constantly reproducing them.

Hegemonic masculinity is often reproduced and reinforced through media and culture. "Media representations of men…often glorify men's use of physical force, a daring demeanor, virility, and emotional distance." Contemporary [[rap music]] is a striking example of masculinity on display. Rappers boast about their sexual conquests of women (emphasizing [[heterosexuality]] as well), wealth, power and violence.&lt;ref name="Rap Music"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Weitzer | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Kubrin | first2 = Charis E. | author-link1 = Ronald Weitzer | author-link2 = Charis E.

==Gender and violence==

Gender-based [[violence]] is the physical, [[Human sexuality|sexual]] or emotional harm or suffering enacted upon an individual as contextualized by societal [[gender]] norms. Violence affects the lives of millions worldwide, in all socio-economic and educational classes. It cuts across cultural and religious barriers, impeding the right of many to participate fully in society. Violence is about power, control, and domination. Systems of inequality and [[oppression]] interact positioning certain groups as particularly vulnerable to violence. Gendered violence takes place within a socially constructed power dynamic in which one ideology ([[masculinity]]) dominates another ([[femininity]]). What it means to be a woman in society is influenced and ascribed by the media, which acts a "powerful educational force". The media glamorizes [[violence against women]] cultivating a "toxic cultural environment" in which women are institutionally positioned as inferior and worthy objects of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Killing Us Softly 3: Advertising's Image of Women. Dir. Jean Kilbourne. Perf., 2000. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

Men are disproportionally the offenders, and women disproportionally the victims. Those that commit violent crimes are overwhelmingly male—[[rape]] (98%), armed [[robbery]] (92%), drunk driving (90%), [[murder]] (88%), aggravated assault (87%), arson (86%), and family violence (83%).&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. 2011. The Gendered Society. New York: Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael Kimmel]], [[hegemonic masculinity]] creates a culture of entitlement, silence, and protection, which effectively normalizes violence against women and silences victims of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. Guyland: the Perilous World Where Boys Become Men. New York: Harpercollins, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence]] defines three social arenas in which violence commonly takes place (1) in the family—including [[domestic violence]], [[infanticide]], and traditional practices such as  [[female genital mutilation]], [[foot binding]], and [[bride burning]]; (2) in the community—including rape, sexual assault, [[sexual harassment]], and commercialized violence such as [[sexual slavery]], labor exploitation, female migrant workers; and (3) by the State—including violence against women in detention, and in situations of armed conflict such as [[systematic war rape]].&lt;ref&gt;"Women and Violence." Welcome to the United Nations: It's Your World. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.un.org/rights/dpi1772e.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address and end gendered violence, solutions must address both the root causes and interpersonal manifestations of gender roles and power relations in order to ensure a balance of power at all levels of society.

==Globalization and gender==

[[Globalization]] refers to the increasingly global relationships of culture, people and economic activity. Globalization impacts female equality on a large and international scale, both negatively and positively.  With continuous changes in international relations, the perception of [[feminism]] in Western and Nonwestern societies is frequently revised.  It is important to be wary of Western bias in sociological accounts of global feminism, as Modern [[Western society]] is not always due credit for feminist reform in other cultures and countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ferree, Myra Marx. 2006. "Globalization and Feminism: Opportunities and Obstacles for Activism in the Global Arena" in Ferree, M.M. &amp; Tripp, A.M. (Eds.) Global Feminism: Transnational women's activism, organizing, and human rights. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist sentiments – or a push for gender equality – emerge as a result of the nation-specific circumstances, not according to the exported beliefs of Western society.  Advances in female equality and status are often not the result of national groups or corporations, but of individuals and small groups.

One of the results of globalization is the increased use of female factory workers in nonwestern countries.  In Mexico, the female worker is ideal because she is seen as docile and inexpensive labor.  Stereotypical feminine traits such as beauty, domesticity, and docility are exaggerated and exploited for the production of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Salzinger, L. 2003. Genders in Production: Making Workers in Mexico's Global Factories. Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;  These gender traits then frame the behavior of the women beyond the occupational realm.  Despite increasing feminism, the lack of economic and [[social mobility]] prevents women in many nations from having equal status in society.

One of the solutions to erasing gender inequalities globally, is to provide resources and funds to impoverished women who will in turn use them for [[education]] as well as business ventures.  The [[global economy]] could benefit drastically from incorporating educated women into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23Women-t.html|title=The Women’s Crusade|first1=Nicholas|last1=Kristof|first2=Sheryl|last2=WuDunn|date=17 August 2009|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third gender ==
Throughout history, and around the world, the idea of a [[third gender]] has existed. In Native American culture, the [[Two-spirit|two spiririt]] had gender roles different from men and women. The [[muxe]] of southern Mexico are males who identify as neither male or female. In Samoa the [[Fa'afafine]] are biological males who identify as females. The [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] are biological males who identify as women. They are considered outsiders in their communities and have formed their own language. In the United States, the concept of a third gender is beginning to gain traction. California now allows for drivers licenses to have the gender "non-binary", see [[genderqueer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18626">'''Strategic communication''' can mean either [[communication|communicating]] a [[concept]], a [[business process|process]], or [[Data management|data]] that satisfies a long term [[strategy|strategic]] goal of an organization by allowing facilitation of [[project management|advanced planning]], or communicating over long distances usually using [[Telecommunication|international telecommunications]] or dedicated [[global network]] assets to coordinate actions and activities of operationally significant [[commerce|commercial]], [[government|non-commercial]] and [[military]] [[business unit|business]] or [[Military unit|combat]] and [[logistics|logistic]] subunits. It can also mean the related function within an organization, which handles internal and external communication processes.  Strategic communication can also be used for [[political warfare]].

==Definition of strategic communication==
Strategic communication refers to policy-making and guidance for consistent information activity within an organization and between organizations. Equivalent business management terms are: integrated (marketing) communication, organizational communication, corporate communication, institutional communication, etc. (see paragraph on 'Commercial Application' below).

In the U.S. government context, strategic communication has been defined as "Focused United States Government efforts to understand and engage key audiences to create, strengthen, or preserve conditions favorable for the advancement of United States Government interests, policies, and objectives through the use of coordinated programs, plans, themes, messages, and products synchronized with the actions of all instruments of national power."&lt;ref&gt;Joint Publication 1-02: "Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms", Washington D.C., 12 April 2001 (as amended through 17 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic communication management could be defined as the systematic planning and realization of information flow, communication, media development and image care in a long-term horizon. It conveys deliberate message(s) through the most suitable media to the designated audience(s) at the appropriate time to contribute to and achieve the desired long-term effect. Communication management is process creation. It has to bring three factors into balance: the message(s), the media channel(s) and the audience(s).&lt;ref name='Bockstette'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf |title=Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques|last=Bockstette|first=Carsten |date=December 2008 |publisher=George C. Marshall Center for European Security Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view of strategic communication is offered by Steve Tatham of the UK Defence Academy. He argues that whilst it is desirable to bound and coordinate communications together - particularly from governments or the military - it should be regarded in a much more fundamental manner than simply process. The 'informational effect' should be placed at the very epi-centre of command and that all action must be calibrated against that effect - including the evaluation of 2nd and 3rd order effects.  This is, he argues, proper Strategic Communication (communication singular — an abstract noun) whilst the actual process of communicating (which include Target Audience Analysis, evaluation of conduits, measurements of effect etc.) — is Strategic Communications (plural).&lt;ref&gt;https://independent.academia.edu/SteveTatham&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 2008 paper, "DoD Principles of Strategic Communication," [[Robert T. Hastings, Jr.]], acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, described strategic communication as "the synchronization of images, actions and words to achieve a desired effect."

Communication is strategic when it is completely consistent with the organisation mission, vision, values and when it is able to enhance the strategic positioning and competitiveness between their competitors. It is important to understand the concept of communication strategy, it should be seen from the organization’s perspective and no one else beside them. As a result of this communication, strategic communication should follow ‘The nature of organisational communication in general, and strategic communication in particular, is defined as the purposeful use of communication by an organisation to fulfill its mission’ stated by (Hallahan et al., 2007). Therefore, the Strategic Communications Framework should be lay out to aim the objectives of communicating to the audience/organisation. The deliberate application of the specific content will help achieve the business goal clearly. While communication is something that does happen in the organisation, businesses that take steps to implement sound strategies impacting the effectiveness of their business communications can achieve measurable results. According to Mulhern(2009), Technological advancement have been a huge factor in business meaning that information can be communicated through many diverse channels and media like the internet and through ads. Technology have been rapidly growing throughout the year pretty fast, accelerating communication that allow customers to connect and communicate with others. This will make it easier for them to reach to each other in a traditional communication way that suit the demand of their needs. ‘These changes mean that marketers are in a far more challenging competitive environment in attempting to fulfil customers wants and needs, while simultaneously seeking to develop long-term relationships’( Mulhern, 2009). Having changes in communication will help communication goals, organisation, and communication channels. This will have an effect of measuring the effectiveness of the communication tactics used in a business for their audience. To start a business no matter how small it is, communication strategy should be a goal to start with and it will indicate the future of the business. A business that communicate with their employees about benefit options will have increased the level of trust between them.

==Application objectives==
Strategic communication provides a conceptual umbrella that enables organizations to integrate their disparate messaging efforts. It allows them to create and distribute communications that, while different in style and purpose, have an inner coherence. This consistency can, in some instances, foster an echo chamber that reinforces the organizational message and brand. At minimum, it prevents contradictory, confusing messaging to different groups across all media platforms.

=== Strategic planning ===
To have an object, the first thing to do is have a plan for the business to communicate how the business is formed and to see how strong its core is. Ensure that alignment with the organization’s understanding of where it is currently at.  An approach that could be used to determine the current state of the objective, is to do a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis. When using a SWOT analysis, the strengths and weaknesses must be realistic.  This is to help make improvements or adjustments that were not so good. The analysis will help get a better understanding of the business and will help plan and make the objectives more solid because it shows the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats the business is facing.  This helps decide where the business is today, and where it will be in the future.
Planning is a continuous process of research and analysis, task analysis, execution, and assessment. Success in this process requires diligent and continual analysis, and assessment being fed back into planning and actions.&lt;ref&gt;Commander’s Handbook for Strategic Communication and Communication Strategy, US Joint Forces Command, Suffolk, VA. 2010, p 109&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Talk to key stakeholders. ===
Have interviews with the customers to learn their priorities and what goals they want to achieve with the organization. Having a good understanding of the business issues, this will allow the organisation to offer effective solutions that will help the objective. Ask questions to see what the customer’s aim is, with the main goal to focus on what needs to be achieved and done and not what he/ or she wants. ‘Sustainability calls for a value chain approach, whereby firms need to take wider responsibility and collaborate with a range of stakeholders to ensure that unsustainable practices are addressed’ (Scandelius, &amp; Cohen,2015).

=== Develop actionable objectives ===
Objectives should have a specific end points to provide an indicator of success. Kotler et al., (2013) stated by understanding the consumer and the marketplace, he or she can design a marketing strategy. To have an understanding to what is happening around the organisation will ensure that planning the marketing strategy will be easy because the vision is there and making sure the objectives are SMART. Objectives are the intended goals of a business campaigns, to show what is achievable. The objectives are effective when using SMART goals: they need to be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive. Have assignments for individuals or groups so the responsibilities for each of these objectives are already set and no adjustments are needed because they have been assigned to a specific person or group.  The responsibility is in their hands. This is to indicate the specific individual or group have a direct preliminary objective they are assigned to. They will need to develop a range of possible strategies and tactics to achieve the objectives given to them.

=== Develop and prioritise potential strategies and tactics ===
Brainstorm a list of potential strategies achievable for each of the objectives given out by the business and its customers, and have tactics that will support these strategies and objectives. Gather as a team to discuss the merits of each proposed strategy to the organisation.  The discussion must be about the strategies that will most likely be able to be used and those that are unlikely to be used. Some strategies will not be achievable, will be difficult or no solution will be available for it so these will be crossed of the list. This shortens the list and helps to round up the best strategies left to be used. Collectively decide which strategies and tactics are going to be pursued to provide a clear objective for the business. The main focus is to achieve the objectives that were given out by the organisation.

=== Metrics, timelines and responsibilities ===
Have the detail behind those strategies and tactics name out so that there is a clear objective and what is needed to be focus on'''.''' Explain how it will be successful, how it is measured, the time frame and who will be responsible. To ensure that everything is successfully plan out and the success of these strategies and tactics. To do this planning wisely is a key part, planning does not only help a business achieve the objective but also help with communication within the group. Everyone will be assigned to a responsibility so that these strategies and tactics are meet.

==Defense application==
{{main article|Propaganda}}
The recently approved NATO Policy on Strategic Communication defines Strategic Communication as "the coordinated and appropriate use of NATO communications activities and capabilities – Public Diplomacy, Military Public Affairs, Information Operations and Psychological Operations, as appropriate – in support of Alliance policies, operations and activities, and in order to advance NATO's aims" (SG(2009)0794). "It is important to underline that Strategic Communication is first and foremost a process that supports and underpins all efforts to achieve the Alliance's objectives; an enabler that guides and informs our decisions, and not an organization
in itself. It is for this reason that Strategic Communication considerations should be integrated into the earliest planning phases - communication activities being a consequence of that planning" (MCM-0164-2009).

==Commercial application==
Strategic Communication is communication aligned with the company's overall strategy, to enhance its strategic positioning.&lt;ref&gt;Argenti, Paul A. / Howell, Robert A. / Beck, Karen A.: "The Strategic Communication Imperative", Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) / Alfred P. Sloan School of Management, MIT Sloan Management Review (SMR) Vol. 46, No. 3, Spring 2005, pp.83-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept development and experimentation (CD&amp;E)==
Strategic communication is currently subject to multinational CD&amp;E,&lt;ref&gt;Peter E. Westenkirchner (Bundeswehr Transformation Centre): Framework Concept "Integrated Communication in Multinational Coalition Operations within a Comprehensive Approach" (request copy at: peterwestenkirchner@bundeswehr.org)&lt;/ref&gt; led by the military, because communication is always an indispensable part of crisis management and compliance strategies. Across the spectrum of missions and broadly covering all levels of involvement in a civil-military, comprehensive approach context, the function of Strategic Communication and its military tool for implementation – Information Operations – have evolved and are still under development, in particular concerning their exact delineation of responsibilities and the integration of non-military and non-coalition actors.

Three major lines of development are acknowledged as state of the art, with practical impact on current crisis management operations and/or multinational interoperability: (1) U.S. national developments, which one can argue have resulted in the most mature concepts for both Strategic Communication and Information Operations so far; (2) NATO concept development, which in the case of Strategic Communication is very much driven by current mission requirements (such as ISAF in Afghanistan), but also has benefitted much from multinational CD&amp;E in the case of Information Operations; and (3) multinational CD&amp;E projects such as the U.S.-led Multinational Experiment (MNE) series and the Multinational Information Operations Experiment (MNIOE), led by Germany.

Intensive discussions involving civil and military practitioners of Strategic Communication and Information Operations - with a view on existing national and NATO approaches to Strategic Communication, and current best practice - have questioned whether a new approach and definition of Strategic Communication really is required. Consequently, a reorientation of CD&amp;E efforts was suggested, focussing now on the theme of "Integrated Communication", which better reflects the shared baseline assessment with a broader scope, including but not limited to Strategic Communication:

* the ineffective top-down approach to communication (mission-specific, strategic-political guidance for information activities; information strategy; corporate vision; shared narrative) and
* the insufficient horizontal and vertical integration of communication (cohesion of a coalition; corporate identity; cultural awareness; communication by words and deeds - the "say-do-gap"; involvement of non-coalition actors - participatory communication).

This change also should prevent false expectations of potential customers of resulting concepts who currently are reluctant to engage in CD&amp;E on the widely implemented subject of Strategic Communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16337">'''Tangible symbols''' are a type of [[augmentative and alternative communication]] (AAC) that uses objects or pictures that share a perceptual relationship with the items they represent as [[symbols]].  A tangible symbol's relation to the item it represents is perceptually obvious and concrete - the visual or tactile properties of the symbol resemble the intended item. Tangible Symbols can easily be manipulated and are most strongly associated with the sense of touch.These symbols can be used by individuals who are not able to communicate using speech or other abstract symbol systems, such as [[sign language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trief|first=Ellen|author2=Bruce, Cascella |title=The selection of tangible symbols by educators of students with visual impairments and additional disabilities|journal=Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness|date=August 2010|volume=104|issue=8|pages=499–504|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;id=2E7D9C0E-CF91-609B-9F5A-F774F1C81BA8&amp;resultID=8&amp;page=1&amp;dbTab=pi}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for those who have the ability to communicate using speech, learning to use tangible symbols  does not hinder further developing acquisition of natural [[speech]] and/or [[language development]], and may even facilitate it.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;

==Definition==
The term tangible symbols was first developed by Charity Rowland and Philip Schweigert,&lt;ref name=rowsch00&gt;Rowland, C. &amp; Schweigert, P. (2000). Tangible symbols, tangible outcomes. Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 16 (2), 61-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89&gt;Rowland, C., &amp; Schweigert, P. (1989). Tangible symbols: Symbolic communication for individuals with multisensory impairments. Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 5(4), 226-234.&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to two-dimensional pictures or three-dimensional objects used as symbols to convey meaning. The items are termed "tangible" because they are concrete items that can be manipulated by the user and communication partner. Symbols can be used individually or combined with other symbols in order to create new messages. Tangible symbols are used as a means of communication for individuals who are unable to understand or communicate using abstract systems, such as speech or [[sign language]].&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=beu51&gt;Beukelman &amp; Mirenda (2005), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Properties of tangible symbols include permanency, capacity to be manipulated by both the user and the communication partner, and an obvious relationship between the symbol and the referent. They can represent items, people, activities and/or events, and look or feel similar to what they refer to.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;&lt;ref name=park95/&gt;&lt;ref name=park97/&gt; For example, a cup can be used as three-dimensional tangible symbol to represent the action: "drink".&lt;ref name=park97/&gt; A photograph of a cup can be used as a two-dimensional tangible symbol to also represent the action : "drink". Two- and three-dimensional symbols are used to fit the cognitive and sensory abilities of the individual, as well as the individual's unique experiences.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 5(4), 226-234.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Rowland and Schweigert use the term tangible symbols to refer to conceptually tangible items like two-dimensional pictures or three-dimensional objects.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;  However, other authors, such as Beukelman and Mirenda, use the term to exclusively describe three-dimensional physical objects that display concrete properties such as shape or texture.&lt;ref name=beu51/&gt;

According to Rowland and Schweigert, "for some individuals, the use of tangible symbols may be used to bridge the gap between gestural communication and the use of formal language systems. For others, tangible symbols may represent an ultimate level of communicative competence."&lt;ref name=rowsch00 /&gt;

&lt;ref name=rowsch00 /&gt;

==History==
Historically, objects and pictures have frequently been used as communication devices.&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;&lt;ref name=park95&gt;Park, K. (1995)  Using objects of reference: a review of the literature. European Journal of Special Needs Education, 10(1), 40-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=park97&gt;Park, K. (1997). How do objects become objects of reference? A review of the literature on objects of reference and a proposed model for the use of objects in communication. British Journal of Special Education, 24(3), 108-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors have also used picture symbols, such as line drawings and photographs to develop language in individuals with little or no speech and/or [[cognitive disabilities]].&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt; Tangible symbols emerged from Van Dijk’s work in the 1960s using objects as symbols to develop language in [[deaf-blind]] children.&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, J. (1966).  The first steps of the deaf-blind child toward language.  International Journal for the Education of the Blind, 15(4), 112-114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, J. (1967).  The non-verbal deaf-blind child and his world:  His outgrowth towards the world of symbols.  Jaarverslag, Institut voor Doven.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Van Dijk’s work was based on the concept "symbol formation" developed by Werner and Kaplan (1963), who theorized that "symbol formation" referred to the process of developing language by creating symbols in our minds.&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, H. &amp; Kaplan, B. (1963).  Symbol formation.  New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of tangible symbols==
Rowland and Schweigert propose that tangible symbols can be divided into hierarchical categories, ranging from most [[concrete]] to most abstract symbols:&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt; 
*Identical objects are real items that are equal to their referent and are the most concrete type of tangible symbol. An example includes using a toothbrush to represent "brush your teeth".&lt;ref name=beu51/&gt; Beukelman and Mirenda includes in this category miniature objects: items that are smaller than what they symbolize, such as having a small toy toilet indicate "toilet".&lt;ref name=beu52&gt;Beukelman &amp; Mirenda (2005), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;
*Partial/associated objects refers to a portion of the object they represent, and therefore are less concrete than identical objects.&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt; For example, a shoelace would symbolize "shoes". 
*Symbols with one or two shared features have a resemblance to their referent, like using a mould of a loaf of bread for "bread". This category is sometimes included in the partial/associated objects category.&lt;ref name=beu52/&gt;
*Artificial symbols are abstract symbols that do not have a direct resemblance to their referent, such as having a 3D shape (i.e. an apple) that is attached to a cafe door be used as the symbol for "cafe".&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;  Beukelman and Mirenda include textured symbols in this category.&lt;ref name=beu52/&gt; An example of a textured symbol is using a piece of spandex material to denote "bathing suit".&lt;ref name=beu52/&gt;
*Three-dimensional symbols may be identical objects, parts of objects, or associated objects. A three-dimensional symbol will share similar features of the focused object, creating a meaningful symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowland|first=Charity|title=Tangible Symbol Systems|url=http://www.osepideasthatwork.org/toolkit/pdf/TangibleSymbol%20Systems.pdf|accessdate=16 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204002735/http://www.osepideasthatwork.org/toolkit/pdf/TangibleSymbol%20Systems.pdf|archivedate=4 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Two-dimensional pictures, such as photographs and line drawings, are the most abstract type of tangible symbols.&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt; They are commonly used for both expressive and receptive communication, whereas the three-dimensional symbols are often used for receptive only communication (i.e. to cue the individual for upcoming events). [http://www.pac6.org/images/upload/Tangible_Symbols_Tangible_Outcomes.pdf]

The type of tangible symbol used is chosen based on the [[cognitive]] and [[Sensory perception|sensory]] abilities of the learner/user.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt; The meaning behind each symbol is not universal, but by using a symbol the individual is familiar with, a meaningful symbol is created.  Tangible symbols should be constructed by meaningful and motivating symbols that will provide the individual with the most opportunities to practice using the new system.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;

==Users of tangible symbols==

Individuals who can benefit from using tangible symbols include those who may lack the skills to communicate using verbal speech or other various communication systems such as sign language. Users of tangible symbols may include individuals with [[cognitive disabilities]] (including developmental delay and intellectual disability), sensory and/or [[visual impairments]] (blindness and/or deafblindness), [[developmental disabilities]] (such as autism spectrum disorder), and orthopedic impairments.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch00 /&gt;&lt;ref name=beu51/&gt;  Rowland and Schweigert claim that tangible symbols do not require the use of high demands on the learner’s [[cognitive abilities]], [[memory]], [[visual perception]], and motor abilities because they are:
*[[Iconic]] and concrete: they have a clear connection what they refer to.
*Permanent: the user does not need to recall the object, but simply be able to recognize them. 
*Manipulable: can be picked up and used by the learner and who s/he is communicating with.
*Tactually discriminable: can be identified by touch. 
*May be indicated through a simple motor response: such as eye gazing, touching, or pointing.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt; 
Furthermore, simple behavioral responses can be used with tangible items. For example, learners that are unable to speak can simply point, touch, pick up, or look (in cases of severe motoric impairment) at the object to answer a question or make a request.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;  Finally, three-dimensional objects can be distinguished from one another using touch, and therefore they are suitable for people with visual impairments or blindness.&lt;ref name=rowsch00/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowsch89/&gt;
A study by Rowland and Schweigert found individuals who were already able to communicate using gestures or vocalizations more readily learned to use tangible symbols than those who did not have intentional pre-symbolic communication skills.

==Application of tangible symbols==
Presentation format depends on the users [[visual scanning]] and motoric ability. The tangible symbols can placed in front of the user within reach, placed on a board for visual scanning, or placed in a book for access.

Typically, tangible symbols are custom made and tailored to the individual child.  If pre-made sets are used, it is assumed that the symbols are familiar and motivating for the user.  It is important to utilize frequently occurring and highly motivating symbols in order to optimize opportunities for use.&lt;ref name=rowsch00 /&gt;

==Universal tangible symbol system==
In 2009, Ellen Trief, Susan M. Bruce, Paul W. Cascella, and Sarah Ivy created a Universal Tangible Symbol System. They began by developing a survey to determine which tangible symbols were already in use, new activities and concepts for which tangible systems are needed, and participant preferences for tangible symbols from a pilot study. Participants included teachers and [[speech-language pathologists]] from four New York City schools. Following the survey, an advisory board consisting of directors of the New York City schools, speech-language pathologists, the designer and manufacturer of the symbols, a representative from the Perkins School for the Blind, college professors, and a graduate research assistant reviewed and discussed the results. This resulted in the establishment of the 55 universal tangible symbols seen in the chart below. However, this universal tangible symbol system should not replace a system already established for an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Trief, E., Bruce, S.M., Cascella, P.W., &amp; Ivy S. (2009). The development of a universal tangible symbol system. Journal of visual impairment &amp; blindness. July 2009. 425-431.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man''''' is a 1962 book by [[Marshall McLuhan]], in which the author analyzes the effects of [[mass media]], especially the [[printing press]], on European [[culture]] and human consciousness. It popularized the term ''[[global village (term)|global village]]'',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.31: "But certainly the electro-magnetic discoveries have recreated the simultaneous "field" in all human affairs so that the human family now exists under conditions of a "global village.""&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the idea that [[mass communication]] allows a village-like mindset to apply to the entire world; and ''Gutenberg Galaxy'',&lt;ref&gt;Note that Marshall McLuhan himself states quite clearly that "although the main theme of this book is the Gutenberg Galaxy or a configuration of events, which lies far ahead of alphabet and of scribal culture, it needs to be known why, without alphabet, there would have been no Gutenberg. McLuhan 1962, p.40"&lt;/ref&gt; which we may regard today to refer to the accumulated body of recorded works of human art and knowledge, especially [[books]].

McLuhan studies the emergence of what he calls Gutenberg Man, the subject produced by the change of [[consciousness]] wrought by the advent of the printed book. Apropos of his axiom, "[[The medium is the message]]," McLuhan argues that [[technology|technologies]] are not simply inventions which people employ but are the means by which people are re-invented. The invention of [[movable type]] was the decisive moment in the change from a culture in which all the senses partook of a common interplay to a tyranny of the visual. He also argued that the development of the [[printing press]] led to the creation of [[nationalism]], [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], domination of [[rationalism]], automatisation of scientific research, uniformation and standardisation of culture and [[Social alienation|alienation]] of [[individual]]s.

Movable type, with its ability to reproduce texts accurately and swiftly, extended the drive toward homogeneity and repeatability already in evidence in the emergence of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspectival art]] and the exigencies of the single "point of view". He writes:

:''the world of visual perspective is one of unified and homogeneous space. Such a world is alien to the resonating diversity of spoken words. So language was the last art to accept the visual logic of Gutenberg technology, and the first to rebound in the electric age.''&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

==The format of the book—a ''mosaic''==
The book is unusual in its design. McLuhan described it as one which "develops a [[mosaic]] or field approach to its problems".&lt;ref&gt;(McLuhan 1962, first line of the unnamed preface on "page 0")&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic image to be constructed from data and quotations would then reveal "causal operations in history".&lt;ref&gt;(McLuhan 1962, p.0)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book consists of five parts:

* '''Prologue''',&lt;ref name="McLuhan-1962-1"&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Gutenberg Galaxy''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.11-263&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Galaxy Reconfigured''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.265-79. The full title of this "epilogue" is "THE GALAXY RECONFIGURED or the Plight of Mass Man in an Individualist Society.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bibliographic Index''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.281-89&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Index of Chapter Glosses'''.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.291-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body of the book, part 2, "The Gutenberg Galaxy", consists of 107 short "chapters",
many of which are just three, two, or even one page(s) in length.
Such a large collection of small chapters does fit the picture of a mosaic.

Apparently, McLuhan also had some ideas about how to browse a book. ''Marshall McLuhan, the guru of The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (1962), recommends that the browser turn to page 69 of any book and read it. If you like that page, buy the book."&lt;ref&gt;John Sutherland 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Such apparent arbitrariness fits with picking a particular piece (or part) of a mosaic and deciding if you like it. Certainly the McLuhan test can be applied to the Gutenberg Galaxy itself. Doing so will reveal a further insight into the purpose of his own book.&lt;ref&gt;"To show by exactly what historical process ["modern man has desacralized his world and assumed a profane existence"] was done is the theme of The Gutenberg Galaxy." McLuhan 1962, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prologue===
McLuhan declares his book to be "complementary to ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'' by Albert B. Lord."&lt;ref name="McLuhan-1962-1" /&gt; The latter work follows on from the Homeric studies of [[Milman Parry]] who turned to "the study of the Yugoslave epics"&lt;ref name="McLuhan-1962-1" /&gt; to prove that the poems of Homer were oral compositions.

==Four epochs of history==
The book may also be regarded as a way of describing four epochs of history:

&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oral tribe culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manuscript culture&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan himself proposes to demonstrate that "manuscript culture is intensely audile-tactile compared to print culture; and that means that detached habits of observation are quite uncongenial to manuscript cultures, whether ancient Egyptian, Greek, or Chinese or medieval." 1962, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gutenberg galaxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronic age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the break between the time periods in each case the occurrence of a new medium is responsible, the ''hand-writing'' terminates the oral phase, the printing and the electricity revolutionizes afterwards culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel morisse and Uwe lehmann, Marshall McLuhan Project, Philosophy, The Gutenberg Galaxy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given the clue of "hand-writing" that terminates the "oral phase" one expects "printing" to terminate the manuscript phase and the "electrifying" to bring an end to the Gutenberg era. The strangeness of the use of "electrifying" is entirely appropriate in the McLuhan context of 1962. The Internet did not exist then.

McLuhan himself suggests that the last section of his book might play the major role of being the first section:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The last section of the book, "The Galaxy Reconfigured," deals with the clash of electric and mechanical, or print, technologies, and the reader may find it the best prologue.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.0&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oral tribe culture===
The [[oral tradition]] is not dead. In schools or at home or in the street, where children are taught to learn by heart, to memorize, [[nursery rhyme]]s or poems or songs, then they can be said to participate in the oral tradition. The same is often true of the children belonging to religious groups who are taught to learn to say their prayers. In other words, childhood is one of [[All the world's a stage|the ages of man]] (in Shakespeare's sense) and is essentially an oral tribal culture. The transition from this oral culture takes place when the child is taught to read and write. Then the child enters the world of the manuscript culture.

McLuhan identifies [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as a key that unlocks something of the nature of the oral culture.&lt;ref name="Joyce-1964"&gt;"The fall of a once wallstrait oldparr is retaled early in bed and later on life down through all Christian minstrelsy." Joyce 1964, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;"

Of particular importance to the Oral Culture is the [[Art of memory]].

====The village====
In commenting on the then [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref&gt;We have gone from the Soviet Union of McLuhan's day to the Russian Federation today.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan puts "the advertising and PR community" on a par with them in so far that both "are concerned about access to the media and about results."&lt;ref name="gloss 18"&gt;'''gloss 18''': "The interiorization of the technology of the phonetic alphabet translates man from the magical world of the ear to the neutral visual world." McLuhan 1962, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; More remarkably he asserts that "Soviet concern with media ''results'' is natural to any oral society where interdependence is the result of instant interplay of cause and effect in the total structure. Such is the character of a village, or since electric media, such is also the character of global village."&lt;ref name="gloss 18" /&gt;

===Manuscript culture===
The culture of the manuscript (literally hand-writing) is often referred to by McLuhan as [[Print culture|scribal culture]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Medieval illumination, gloss, and sculpture alike were aspects of the art of memory, central to scribal culture.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Associated with this epoch is the [[Art of memory]] (in Latin Ars Memoriae).

===Gutenberg galaxy===
Finnegans Wake:
Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (like Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'') is one of the texts which McLuhan frequently uses throughout the book in order to weave together the various strands of his argument.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Throughout ''Finnegans Wake'' Joyce specifies the [[Tower of Babel]] as the tower of Sleep,
that is, the tower of the witless assumption, or what [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] calls the reign of the Idols.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Movable type====
His episodic and often rambling history takes the reader from pre-alphabetic tribal humankind to the [[Electronics|electronic age]]. According to McLuhan, the invention of [[movable type]] greatly accelerated, intensified, and ultimately enabled cultural and cognitive changes that had already been taking place since the invention and implementation of the alphabet, by which McLuhan means [[phonemic orthography]]. (McLuhan is careful to distinguish the phonetic [[alphabet]] from [[logographic]]/logogramic writing systems, like [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] or [[ideograms]].)

Print culture, ushered in by the [[Gutenberg press]] in the middle of the fifteenth century, brought about the cultural predominance of the visual over the aural/oral. Quoting with approval an observation on the nature of the printed word from ''Prints and Visual Communication'' by [[William Ivins]], McLuhan remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this passage [Ivins] not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits, but, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience of print culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to the background. [...] The technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from noting interplay and, as it were, "formal" causality, both in our inner and external lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' pp. 124-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main concept of McLuhan's argument (later elaborated upon in ''[[The Medium is the Massage]]'') &lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt;is that new technologies (like alphabets, printing presses, and even speech itself) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits ("visual homogenizing of experience"), which in turn affects social interactions ("fosters a mentality that gradually resists all but a... specialist outlook"). According to McLuhan, the advent of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the [[Modern age|Modern]] period in the [[Western world]]: [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[Protestantism]], [[capitalism]] and [[nationalism]]. For McLuhan, these trends all reverberate with print technology's principle of "segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification."&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic age===

====The global village====
In the early 1960s, McLuhan wrote that the visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called "electronic interdependence": when [[electronic media]] would replace [[visual culture]] with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind will move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a "tribal base." McLuhan's coinage for this new social organization is the ''[[Global Village (term)|global village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "global village"  specifically as such. According to McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a ''Wake'' scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term. &lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss2/1_2art2.htm | publisher=''McLuhan Studies'' (issue 2) | title=The source of the term 'global village' | author=Eric McLuhan | year=1996 | accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes described as having negative connotations in ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', but McLuhan himself was interested in exploring effects, not making value judgments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of tending towards a vast [[Alexandrian library]] the world has become a [[computer]], an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of [[science fiction]]. And as our senses have gone outside us, [[Authoritarianism|Big Brother]] goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence. [...] Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time. [...] In our long striving to recover for the [[Western world]] a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Key to McLuhan's argument is the idea that technology has no ''per se'' moral bent—it is a tool that profoundly shapes an individual's and, by extension, a society's self-conception and realization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not obvious that there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than [[manuscript]] culture could ever do. Print is the technology of [[individualism]]. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. "But", someone says, "we didn't know it would happen." Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The moral [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of technology's effects on cognition is, for McLuhan, a matter of perspective. For instance, McLuhan contrasts the considerable alarm and revulsion that the growing quantity of books aroused in the latter seventeenth century with the modern concern for the "end of the book." If there can be no universal moral sentence passed on technology, McLuhan believes that "there can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our technologies."

Though the [[World Wide Web]] was invented thirty years after ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' was published, McLuhan may have coined and certainly popularized the usage of the term "[[surfing]]" to refer to rapid, irregular and multidirectional movement through a heterogeneous body of documents or knowledge, e.g., statements like "[[Heidegger]] surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as [[Descartes]] rode the mechanical wave." [[Paul Levinson]]'s 1999 book ''Digital McLuhan'' explores the ways that McLuhan's work can be better understood through the lens of the digital revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.cyberchimp.co.uk/U75102/levinson.htm#ch3 | author=Paul Levinson | title=Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium | publisher=Routledge | year=1999 | ISBN=0-415-19251-X}} Book has been translated into Japanese, Chinese, Croatian, Romanian, and Korean.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Bill Stewart (internet historian)|Bill Stewart]]'s 2007 "Living Internet" website describes how McLuhan's "insights made the concept of a global village, interconnected by an electronic nervous system, part of our popular culture well before it actually happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Stewart | first = Bill | title = Marshall McLuhan Foresees The Global Village | work = Living Internet | date = 2000-01-07 | url=http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_mcluhan.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan frequently quoted [[Walter Ong]]'s ''Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue'' (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan to write ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''. Ong wrote a highly favorable review of this new book in ''America''.&lt;ref&gt;''America'' 107 (Sept. 15, 1962): 743, 747.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' as "a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 8 (1967): 838.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan himself said of the book, "I'm not concerned to get any kudos out of [''The Gutenberg Galaxy'']. It seems to me a book that somebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of ''Understanding Media'' [the 1960 NAEB report] that I'm doing now." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' won Canada's highest literary award, the [[Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction|Governor-General's Award for Non-Fiction]], in 1962.  The chairman of the selection committee was McLuhan's colleague at the University of Toronto and oftentime intellectual sparring partner, [[Northrop Frye]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tianxia'''''  ({{zh|c=[[wikt:天下|天下]]}}) or '''''All under Heaven''''' is a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term for an ancient [[Culture of China|Chinese cultural]] concept that denoted either the entire geographical world or the metaphysical realm of mortals, and later became associated with political sovereignty. In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], ''tianxia'' denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the Emperor by universal and well-defined principles of order.  The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Imperial court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Imperial court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common citizens, [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary states]], and finally ending with the fringe "[[barbarians]]".  

The center of this world view was not exclusionary in nature, and outer groups, such as ethnic minorities and foreign people, who accepted the mandate of the Chinese Emperor were themselves received and included into the Chinese ''tianxia''. However, as the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] in this context was a narrative device facilitating transitions between various ethnic Chinese political dynasties (with notable exceptions) this essentially made such people second-class citizens subservient to an ethno-Chinese polity. In classical Chinese political thought, the "Son of Heaven" ([[Emperor of China]]) ({{zh|c=天子|p=tiānzǐ|w = t'ien&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-tzu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}), having received the [[Mandate of Heaven]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|天|命}}|p=tiānmìng|l=heaven decree}}), would nominally be the ruler of the entire world.  Although in practice there would be areas of the known world which were not under the control of the Emperor, in Chinese political theory the rulers of those areas derived their power from the Emperor.

The larger concept of ''tianxia'' is closely associated with [[civilization]] and order in classical Chinese philosophy, and has formed the basis for the [[world view]] of the Chinese people and nations influenced by them since at least the first millennium BC. ''Tianxia'' has been independently applied by other countries in the [[East Asian cultural sphere]], including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.

==Historical and political development==
The ''tianxia'' [[world view]] was not fully developed during the [[Shang dynasty]].  Only during the [[Zhou dynasty]] when Heaven took on human deity traits (or at least when references to Heaven as such enter recorded history) did the concept of ''tianxia'' become common.  Terms like "Four Quarters" and "Ten Thousand States" appear in texts of the time; the term "Four Quarters" ({{zh|c=四方|p=sìfāng}}) means territory established by the royal court and governed by the Zhou kings from the capital, but with peripheral non-Han tribes on the outer borders and Han Chinese in the center.  The term "Ten Thousand States" ({{zh|t=萬邦|s=万邦|p=wànbāng}}) refers to both territory and the subjects who reside therein, both Han and "barbarian".  The Zhou kings received and empowered these "Ten Thousand States" by virtue of the [[Mandate of Heaven]].  This is some of the earliest evidence of the [[Hua-Yi distinction]].

During the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States period]]s in the latter half of the Zhou dynasty, the power of the feudal lords developed rapidly, and several non-Han regions became powerful [[State (Ancient China)|states]] themselves.  As many of these feudal states had shared cultural and economic interests, the concept of a great nation centered on the [[Yellow River Plain]] gradually expanded.  The term ''tianxia'' began to appear in classical texts such as the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' and ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]''.

The territory and governments of the Zhou dynasty and the [[Qin dynasty]] were unified after [[Qin's wars of unification|the conquests]] of [[Qin Shi Huang]], and the concept of ''tianxia'' was adapted to act as an actual geographic entity.  Qin Shi Huang's goal to "unify all under Heaven" was, in fact, representative of his desire to control and expand Chinese territory. At the founding of the [[Han dynasty]], the equivalence of ''tianxia'' with the Chinese nation evolved due to the feudal practice of conferring land and autonomy upon the aristocracy to avoid having to expend military expense in their subjugation.  Although many areas enjoyed great autonomy, the practice established and spread Chinese language and culture throughout an even wider territory.

Unification theme applied to ''tianxia'' can be seen in [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' where the supreme goal of offensive strategy was to conquer without destroying that which you sought to conquer:&lt;ref name="TheArtofWar" /&gt;

{{Quote|text=Your aim must be to take All-under-Heaven intact. Thus your troops are not worn out and your gains will be complete. This is the art of offensive strategy. |sign=[[Sun Tzu]]|source=''[[The Art of War]]'', Chapter III, Line 11}}

Unified China fractured into many different nations during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], and with it went the practical use of the term ''tianxia''.  When [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]] reunited China under the [[Tang dynasty]] in the 7th century, some northern tribes, after being made vassal, referred to him as the "Khan of Heaven".

By the time of the [[Song dynasty]], China's northern borders were met by the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-led [[Liao dynasty]], the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin dynasty]], and the [[Tangut people|Tangut]]-led [[Western Xia]] kingdom.  After being threatened by these northern states and realizing the possible effects of a war to the country and people, the Song rulers invented a false concept of kinship with the Jurchens in an attempt to improve relations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The Mongols divided Chinese citizens into two types during the [[Yuan dynasty]]: those of the south, and those of the north.  When the [[Ming dynasty]] expelled the Mongols and reunited China under Han rule, the concept of ''tianxia'' returned largely as it was during the Han dynasty.

At the end of the Ming dynasty, criticisms of [[Neo-Confucianism]] and its mantras of "cultivation of moral character, establishment of family, ordering the state, and harmonizing ''tianxia''" (a quote from the [[Great Learning]]) became widespread, producing large shifts in [[Confucianism]].  Contemporary philosopher [[Wang Fuzhi]] believed that tianxia was of a fixed, unchangeable dimension, notwithstanding the fact that the Great Learning's mentioning of "harmonizing ''tianxia''" was actually in reference to government. Using these arguments, Wang was highly critical of Neo-Confucianism.  On the other hand, the collapse of the Ming dynasty and the establishment of the [[Qing dynasty]] by the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], people previously considered "fringe barbarians", heavily influenced people's views of ''tianxia''.  [[Gu Yanwu]], a contemporary of Wang Fuzhi, wrote that the destruction of the State was not equivalent to the destruction of ''tianxia''.  He argued that the Manchus simply filled the role of Emperor, and that the ''tianxia'' of traditional Chinese culture was thus carried on.

The idea of the absolute authority of the Chinese emperor and the extension of ''tianxia'' by the assimilation of vassal states began to fade for good with [[Earl Macartney]]'s embassy to China in 1793.  Earl Macartney hoped to deal with China as equal sovereign nations, as [[Great Britain]] would with other European nations of the time, and to persuade the Emperor to sign a trade agreement.  The [[Qianlong Emperor]] rejected his request, and stated that China was the foremost and most divine nation on Earth and had no interest in foreign goods, and rejected the idea that Great Britain could negotiate with China as an equal nation.  In the early 19th century, Britain's victory over Qing China in the [[First Opium War]] forced China to sign an [[unequal treaty]]. This marked the beginning of the end for the ''tianxia'' concept.

Following their defeat in the [[Second Opium War]], China was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Tianjin]], in which China was made to refer to Great Britain as a "sovereign nation", equal to itself.  This made it impossible for China to continue dealing with other nations under the traditional ''tianxia'' system, and forced it to establish a foreign affairs bureau.

Because Western nations' system of international affairs was based on the idea that the sovereign nations dealt with each other as equals, China's traditional ''tianxia'' [[world view]] slowly collapsed.  After China's defeat in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the Japanese terminated Korea's traditional status as a protectorate of China, and the system of feudal [[enfeoffment]] and vassalage that had been practiced since the Han dynasty came to an end, a move that greatly changed attitudes toward the ''tianxia'' concept.  At the end of the 19th century, Chinese Ambassador to Great Britain [[Xue Fucheng]] took the traditional [[Hua-Yi distinction]] in the ''tianxia'' world view and replaced it with a Chinese-foreigner distinction.

==Non-Chinese uses of the term==

===Japan===
References to ''tianxia'' first appear in Japanese history during the [[Kofun period]], approximately 250 to 538 AD.  At the time, Japanese rulers were respectful and submissive to the Chinese court, and Chinese immigrants (then called ''toraijin'' 渡來人) were received happily and sought after for their knowledge of the [[Chinese language]] and [[Chinese culture|culture]].  The excavated Eda Funayama grave mound in [[Kumamoto]] contained an iron sword with engraved [[Chinese characters|characters]] that dates to the late 5th century.  The characters on the sword refer to the king of the time as the "Grand King who rules all under ''Tianxia''" ({{zh|c=治天下大王}}).  This discovery demonstrates that the Kofun-era Japanese (at least of that area) had begun viewing their realm to be a complete and divinely-appointed ''tianxia'' in its own right, separate from the ''tianxia'' of the older and larger Chinese empire.

According to the ''[[Book of Sui]]'', the [[Yamato period|Yamato]] king in 607 sent a hand-written epistle to [[Emperor Yang of Sui|Emperor Yang]] of the [[Sui dynasty]] in which he called himself the "[[Son of Heaven]] in the Land of the Rising Sun" ({{zh|c=日出處天子}}), showing that the Japanese notion of their independent ''tianxia'' had continued to that time.

With the development of ''[[Ritsuryō]]'' in 7th-century Japan, a Sino-centric concept of ''tianxia'' was introduced and replaced older concepts.  The hallmark of ''Ritsuryō'' – the concept of [[citizenship]] – necessarily accompanied its introduction into Japan, since Neo-Confucianism said that all were "Equal Citizens Under Heaven" ({{zh|c=天下公民}}).

In the journals of  [[Fujiwara no Kanezane]] (藤原兼実、九條兼実), an official of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] whose journals became the ''Gyokuyō'' (玉葉), he describes the founding of the Shogunate by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] as "beginning ''tianxia''".  His usage of ''tianxia'' is entirely ''Ritsuryō'' in nature, and his phrase "beginning ''tianxia''" refers to the establishment of a new nation, [[jurisprudence]], and system of order.  However, even if Yoritomo had the intention to become a monarch-level ruler, Japan's ''tianxia'' concept had not achieved the Chinese level of an Emperor who governed feudal kingdoms and was entrusted with the ordering of the world by Heaven.  In the journals of Gidō Shūshin (義堂周信), Gidō records a discussion he had with [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] where the Shōgun repeatedly referred to his dominion as "''tianxia''".  In the [[Muromachi period]], people gradually began regarding the Shōgun as the representative of Heaven.

As the Muromachi shogunate weakened, regional warlords began fighting with each other for control of the nation.  More powerful nobles, such as [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], controlled large areas and viewed their domains as ''tianxia''.  The term was used with increasing frequency as generals sought to reunify Japan, and came to be equivalent with the land of Japan itself.

By the [[Edo period]], the ''[[shōgun]]'' was referred to as "Man of ''Tianxia''" and the Shogunate as "Court of ''Tianxia''".  The widespread adoption of the ''tianxia'' concept helped influence Japan's long period of isolation before the [[Meiji Restoration]].

===Korea===
Based on epitaphs dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, [[Goguryeo]] had concepts of [[Son of Heaven]] (天帝之子) and independent ''tianxia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yeongkwang |first1=Jo |title=Status and Tasks for Study of the Foreign Relations and World View of Koguryo in the Gwanggaeto Stele |journal=Dongbuga Yeoksa Nonchong |date=2015 |issue=49 |pages=70–76 |url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE06520451 |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=ko |issn=1975-7840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=고구려의 천하관 |url=http://contents.history.go.kr/front/hm/view.do?treeId=010201&amp;tabId=01&amp;levelId=hm_013_0010 |website=우리역사넷 |publisher=National Institute of Korean History |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of [[Goryeo]] used the titles of [[emperor]] and Son of Heaven and positioned Goryeo at the center of the ''Haedong'' "East of the Sea" ''tianxia'', which encompassed the historical domain of the "''Samhan''", another name for the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Em |first1=Henry |title=The Great Enterprise: Sovereignty and Historiography in Modern Korea |date=2013 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822353725 |pages=24–26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxAd2Aw_jP0C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, with the fall of the Ming dynasty in China, a concept of Korea as the cultural center of Confucianism, or the "[[Sojunghwa|Little China]]" ({{Korean|소중화|小中華|labels=no}}), emerged among the Confucian literati of the Joseon dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Stefan |title=Writing the Nation: A Global Perspective |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9780230223059 |page=126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIODDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] concept of ''tianxia'' as well as [[cultural identity]] originate in the [[Yuan dynasty]]'s invasion in the 13th century.  The [[Trần dynasty]]'s defeat of the Mongol-Chinese armies gave them the confidence to adopt their own ''tianxia'' view and become the official sustainers of the Kingdom of Vietnam.  From that time forward, the area from the [[Lingnan]] region of China to northern [[Vietnam]] was considered an independent ''tianxia''.  However, near the end of the [[Lê dynasty]] in the late 18th century, the orthodox idea of Vietnam as the Vietnamese king's dynasty fell out of favor, and Vietnam was referred to as "Great South" until the European conquests of [[Southeast Asia]].

==Western calques==
The "all under the heaven" expression became the origin for the literary expressions denoting China in a number of Western languages, such as the Russian ''Podnebesnaya'' (Поднебесная, i.e. "Under the heaven"). The English term "Celestial Empire" is said to have been based on the title of Chinese emperors, ''tian zi'' (Son of Heaven).&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Weekley, ''An etymological dictionary of modern English'', 1967. Page 270. (The ''tian zi'' etymology for the "Celestial Empire")&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;
'''Violence''' is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "the intentional use of physical force or [[Power (social and political)|power]], threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation," although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of "the use of power" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;Krug et al., [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ "World report on violence and health"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }}, [[World Health Organization]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm ([[suicide]]), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence ([[war]]) and legal intervention.&lt;ref name=GDB2013 /&gt; In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death.&lt;ref&gt;awake Aug 8/05 pp. 4-7&lt;/ref&gt; Corlin, past president of the [[American Medical Association]] said: "The United States leads the world—in the rate at which its children die from firearms." He concluded: "Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country."&lt;ref&gt;Awake Jul 8/2003 pp. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/ "Global Burden of Disease"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009053208/http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/ |date=2015-10-09 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development.

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
In 2013, assault by [[firearm]] was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.&lt;ref name=GDB2013 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention --&gt;
Violence in many forms is preventable. There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors such as [[concentrated poverty]], income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents. Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be effective in preventing violence.&lt;ref&gt;WHO / Liverpool JMU Centre for Public Health, [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ "Violence Prevention: The evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830082343/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ |date=2012-08-30 }}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Types ==
[[File:Typology of violence.jpg|thumb|Typology of violence&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;]]
Violence can be divided into three broad categories:&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;
* self-directed violence
* interpersonal violence
* collective violence

Violent acts can be:
* physical
* sexual
* physiological
* emotional

This initial categorization differentiates between violence a person inflicts upon himself or herself, violence inflicted by another individual or by a small group of individuals, and violence inflicted by larger groups such as states, organized political groups, militia groups and terrorist organizations. These three broad categories are each divided further to reflect more specific types of violence.

Violence is primarily classified as either instrumental or reactive / hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Violence_Coding_Guide_for_Instrumental_and_Hostile-Reactive_Incidents_10-5-13.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915221238/http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Violence_Coding_Guide_for_Instrumental_and_Hostile-Reactive_Incidents_10-5-13.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-directed violence ===
Self-directed violence is subdivided into suicidal behaviour and [[Self-harm|self-abuse]]. The former includes [[suicidal thoughts]], [[attempted suicide]]s – also called ''[[para suicide]]'' or ''deliberate self-injury'' in some countries – and completed suicides. Self-abuse, in contrast, includes acts such as [[self-mutilation]].

=== Collective violence ===
{{Citation style|date=February 2017}}
[[File:The Bochnia massacre German-occupied Poland 1939.jpg|thumb|right|[[Massacre]] of [[Poles|Polish]] civilians during [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], 1939]]

Collective violence is subdivided into [[structural violence]] and [[economic violence]]. Unlike the other two broad categories, the subcategories of collective violence suggest possible motives for violence committed by larger groups of individuals or by states. Collective violence that is committed to advance a particular social agenda includes, for example, crimes of hate committed by organized groups, terrorist acts and mob violence. Political violence includes war and related violent conflicts, state violence and similar acts carried out by larger groups. Economic violence includes attacks by larger groups motivated by economic gain – such as attacks carried out with the purpose of disrupting economic activity, denying access to essential services, or creating economic division and fragmentation. Clearly, acts committed by larger groups can have multiple motives.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1300/J137v04n02_03|title=Poverty as a Form of Violence|journal=Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment|volume=4|issue=2–3|pages=45–59|year=2001|last1=Allen|first1=Josephine A. V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This typology, while imperfect and far from being universally accepted, does provide a useful framework for understanding the complex patterns of violence taking place around the world, as well as violence in the everyday lives of individuals, families and communities. It also overcomes many of the limitations of other typologies by capturing the nature of violent acts, the relevance of the setting, the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, and – in the case of collective violence – possible motivations for the violence. However, in both research and practice, the dividing lines between the different types of violence are not always so clear.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. State violence also involves upholding, forms of violence of a structural nature, such as poverty, through dismantling welfare, creating strict policies such as 'welfare to work', in order to cause further stimulation and disadvantage&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Poverty as a form of violence may involve oppressive policies that specifically target minority or low socio-economic groups. The 'war on drugs', for example, rather than increasing the health and well-being of at risk demographics, most often results in violence committed against these vulnerable demographics through incarceration, stigmatization and police brutality&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02249526|title=Political ideologies and drug policy|journal=European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research|volume=1|pages=94–105|year=1993|last1=Scheerer|first1=Sebastian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warfare ===

{{Main|War}}

[[File:UStankParis-edit1.jpg|thumb|A United States [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured car in Paris during World War II]]
War is a state of prolonged violent large-scale conflict involving two or more groups of people, usually under the auspices of government. It is the most extreme form of collective violence.&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 64, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
War is fought as a means of resolving territorial and other conflicts, as [[war of aggression]] to conquer territory or loot resources, in national [[self-defence]] or liberation, or to suppress attempts of part of the nation to [[secession|secede]] from it. We know also ideological, religious and revolutionary wars.&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 84, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], the lethality of modern warfare has grown. [[World War I casualties]] were over 40 million and [[World War II casualties]] were over 70 million.

=== Non-physical ===
Violence includes those acts that result from a power relationship, including threats and [[intimidation]], [[neglect]] or acts of omission. Such non-physical violence has a broad range of outcomes – including psychological harm, deprivation and maldevelopment. Violence may not necessarily result in injury or death, but nonetheless poses a substantial burden on individuals, families, communities and health care systems worldwide. Many forms of violence can result in physical, psychological and social problems that do not necessarily lead to injury, disability or death. These consequences can be immediate, as well as latent, and can last for years after the initial abuse. Defining outcomes solely in terms of injury or death thus limits the understanding of the full impact of violence.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

=== Interpersonal violence ===
[[File:Interpersonal violence world map-Deaths per million persons-WHO2012.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Deaths due to interpersonal violence per million persons in 2012 {{refbegin|3}}{{legend|#ffff20|0-8}}{{legend|#ffe820|9-16}}{{legend|#ffd820|17-24}}{{legend|#ffc020|25-32}}{{legend|#ffa020|33-54}}{{legend|#ff9a20|55-75}}{{legend|#f08015|76-96}}{{legend|#e06815|97-126}}{{legend|#d85010|127-226}}{{legend|#d02010|227-878}}{{refend}}]]
Interpersonal violence is divided into two subcategories: Family and [[intimate partner violence]] – that is, violence largely between family members and intimate partners, usually, though not exclusively, taking place in the home. Community violence – violence between individuals who are unrelated, and who may or may not know each other, generally taking place outside the home. The former group includes forms of violence such as [[child abuse]], intimate partner violence and [[elderly abuse|abuse of the elderly]]. The latter includes youth violence, random acts of violence, [[rape]] or [[sexual assault]] by strangers, and violence in institutional settings such as schools, workplaces, prisons and nursing homes.  When interpersonal violence occurs in families, its psychological consequences can affect parents, children, and their relationship in the short- and long-terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schechter DS, Willheim E, McCaw J, Turner JB, Myers MM, Zeanah CH | year = 2011 | title = The relationship of violent fathers, posttraumatically stressed mothers, and symptomatic children in a preschool-age inner-city pediatrics clinic sample | url = | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 26 | issue = 18| pages = 3699–3719 | doi=10.1177/0886260511403747 | pmid=22170456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Child maltreatment ====
{{Main|Child abuse}}
Child maltreatment is the abuse and neglect that occurs to children under 18 years of age. It includes all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], [[neglect]], [[negligence]] and commercial or other [[child exploitation]], which results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power. Exposure to intimate partner violence is also sometimes included as a form of child maltreatment.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2006).

Child maltreatment is a global problem with serious lifelong consequences, which is, however, complex and difficult to study.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  The Effects of Violent Experience and Maltreatment on Infants and Young Children.  In CH Zeanah (Ed.).  Handbook of Infant Mental Health—3rd Edition.  New York: Guilford Press, Inc.  pp. 197-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no reliable global estimates for the prevalence of child maltreatment. Data for many countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are lacking. Current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used. Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stoltenborgh M. |author2=Van IJzendoorn M.H. |author3=Euser E.M. |author4=Bakermans-Kranenburg M.J. | year = 2011 | title = A global perspective on child abuse: Meta-analysis of prevalence around the world | url = | journal = Child Maltreatment | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 79–101 | doi = 10.1177/1077559511403920 |pmid=21511741 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1029.9752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and social and occupational functioning (e.g. school, job, and relationship difficulties).

==== Youth violence ====
[[File:Kids off the Block Rocks in grass IMG 4815.JPG|thumb|The [[Kids off the Block]] memorial featuring hundreds of simple stone blocks, one for each child killed by violence in [[Roseland, Chicago]] ]]

Following the World Health Organization, youth are defined as people between the ages of 10 and 29 years. Youth violence refers to violence occurring between youths, and includes acts that range from [[bullying]] and physical fighting, through more severe sexual and physical assault to homicide.&lt;ref name="Mercy, J.A. 2002 pp 23"&gt;Mercy, J.A., Butchart, A., Farrington, D., Cerda, M. (2002). Youth violence. In Etienne Krug, L.L. Dahlberg, J.A. Mercy, A.B. Zwi &amp; R. Lozano (Eds.), [http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ World Report on Violence and Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }} pp 23–56. Geneva, Switzerland: [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide some 250,000 homicides occur among youth 10–29 years of age each year, which is 41% of the total number of homicides globally each year ("Global Burden of Disease", World Health Organization, 2008). For each young person killed, 20-40 more sustain injuries requiring hospital treatment.&lt;ref name="Mercy, J.A. 2002 pp 23" /&gt; Youth violence has a serious, often lifelong, impact on a person's psychological and social functioning. Youth violence greatly increases the costs of health, welfare and criminal justice services; reduces productivity; decreases the value of property; and generally undermines the fabric of society.

Prevention programmes shown to be effective or to have promise in reducing youth violence include life skills and social development programmes designed to help children and adolescents manage anger, resolve conflict, and develop the necessary social skills to solve problems; schools-based anti-bullying prevention programmes; and programmes to reduce access to alcohol, illegal drugs and guns.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization and Liverpool John Moores University.[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598507_eng.pdf "Violence prevention: the evidence: overview"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193235/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598507_eng.pdf |date=2013-01-22 }} Geneva, WHO, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, given significant neighbourhood effects on youth violence, interventions involving relocating families to less poor environments have shown promising results.&lt;ref name="Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.01216 | volume=12 | title=Children and youth in neighborhood contexts | journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science | pages=27–31 | year=2003 | author=Leventhal Tama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, urban renewal projects such as [[business improvement district]]s have shown a reduction in youth violence.&lt;ref name="Rand report"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2009/RAND_TR622.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020054800/http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2009/RAND_TR622.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of youth on youth violence include witnessing or being involved in physical, emotional and sexual abuse (e.g. physical attacks, bullying, rape) and violent acts like gang shootings and robberies.  According to researchers in 2018, "More than half of children and adolescents living in cities have experienced some form of community violence." The violence "can also all take place under one roof, or in a given community or neighborhood and can happen at the same time or at different stages of life." &lt;ref name="The Conversation US Darby Saxbe 2018"&gt;{{cite magazine | department=The Conversation US |author=Darby Saxbe | title=Living with Neighborhood Violence May Shape Teens' Brains | magazine=Scientific American | date=June 15, 2018 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/living-with-neighborhood-violence-may-shape-teens-rsquo-brains/ | access-date=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It seems that youth violence is on the rise due to the growing number of legal and illegal guns on the streets especially in low income neighborhoods. Youth violence has immediate and long term adverse impact whether the individual was the recipient of the violence or a witness to it. Our knowledge about the impact of trauma on the brain, mind and body is growing every day as more research studies have been conducted and results are published. "Youth violence is a leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults. Some forms of youth violence, such as bullying, slapping, or hitting, can cause severe emotional harm, nonfatal physical injuries, and long-lasting problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Consequences Youth Violence |url=https://vetoviolence.cdc.gov/consequences-youth-violence |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The cost to individuals, their families, and society in general is huge and rising. These people often have lifelong injuries which means ongoing doctor and hospital visits the cost of which quickly adds up. Since the victims of youth on youth violence may not be able to attend school or work because of their physical and/or mental injuries, it is often up to their family members to take care of them (including paying their daily living expenses and medical bills). Their caretakers may have to give up their jobs or work reduced hours to provide help to the victim of violence. This causes a further burden on society because the victim and maybe even their caretakers have to obtain government assistance to help pay their bills. Recent research has found that psychological trauma during childhood can change a child's brain. "Trauma is known to physically affect the brain and the body which causes anxiety, rage, and the ability to concentrate. They can also have problems remembering, trusting, and forming relationships." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Der Kolk, M.D. |first1=Bessel |title=The Body Keeps The Score |date=09/08/2015 |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9780143127741 |pages=464 |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/9780143127741 |accessdate=11/24/18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the brain becomes used to violence it may become alerted and stay continually in an alert state (similar to being stuck in the fight or flight mode). "Researchers claim that the youth who are exposed to violence may have emotional, social, and cognitive problems. They may have trouble controlling emotions, paying attention in school, withdraw from friends, or show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder". &lt;ref name="The Conversation US Darby Saxbe 2018" /&gt; Youth who do not get help and get it under control may have more issues down the line.

There are informal ways in which the youth who have suffered trauma caused by violence can improve their mental health. They can practice yoga and learn how to use meditation and mindfulness techniques which has been known to help people deal with stress. There are more formal organizations now which aim to help mentor and provide a safe environment for the youth especially those living in neighborhoods with higher rates of violence. This includes organizations such as Becoming a Man, CeaseFire Illinois, Chicago Area Project, Little Black Pearl, and Rainbow House". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WCL: Stop the Violence Resources for Illinois |url=https://abc7chicago.com/archive/9009544/ |website=ABC 7 Windy City Live |publisher=ABC 7 Windy City Live |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are designed to help give the youth a safe place to go, stop the violence from occurring, offering counseling and mentoring to help stop the cycle.

Growing up in a life of violence violence can have an impact that has long lasting negative repercussions. Some people get caught up in violence while others are able to turn their life around and make a positive contribution to the world. For example, Derek grew up amongst the violence in Chicago in the 1980's and was even a former gang leader. It took him thirty years in a gang and time in jail to realize he was on the wrong path. He created a boxing program called "Boxing Out Negativity" which provides youth in high crime areas a safe place to get out their anger and energy. It helps them in a positive way and keeps them off the street. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schmich |first1=Mary |title=In a tough Chicago neighborhood, comfort and safety in boxing |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/schmich/ct-chicago-violence-lawndale-boxing-mary-schmich-0918-20160916-column.html |accessdate=11/20/18 |publisher=Chicago Tribume |date=09/16/16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that anyone that grows up in violence can eventually use their "bad" experiences for future "good".

==== Intimate partner violence ====
{{Main|Domestic violence|Intimate partner violence}}
Intimate partner violence refers to behaviour in an intimate relationship that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviours.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

Population-level surveys based on reports from victims provide the most accurate estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner violence and sexual violence in non-conflict settings. A study conducted by WHO in 10 mainly developing countries&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C. et al. (2005). [http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/en/ "WHO multi-country study on women’s health and domestic violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224124426/http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/en/ |date=2011-02-24 }} Geneva: WHO&lt;/ref&gt; found that, among women aged 15 to 49 years, between 15% (Japan) and 70%  (Ethiopia and Peru) of women reported physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner.

Intimate partner and sexual violence have serious short- and long-term physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems for victims and for their children, and lead to high social and economic costs. These include both fatal and non-fatal injuries, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, [[unintended pregnancy|unintended pregnancies]], sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stith SM | year = 2004 | title = Intimate partner physical abuse perpetration and victimization risk factors: a meta-analytic review | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 65–98 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2003.09.001|display-authors=etal| hdl = 2097/14851 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors associated with the perpetration and experiencing of intimate partner violence are low levels of education, history of violence as a perpetrator, a victim or a witness of parental violence, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes that are accepting of violence as well as marital discord and dissatisfaction. Factors associated only with perpetration of intimate partner violence are having multiple partners, and [[antisocial personality disorder]].

A recent theory named "The [[Criminal Spin]]" suggests a mutual flywheel effect between partners that is manifested by an escalation in the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bensimon M. |author2=Ronel N. | year = 2012 | title = The flywheel effect of intimate partner violence: A victim-perpetrator interactive spin | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 423–429 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2012.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A violent spin may occur in any other forms of violence, but in Intimate partner violence the added value is the mutual spin, based on the unique situation and characteristics of intimate relationship.

The primary prevention strategy with the best evidence for effectiveness for intimate partner violence is school-based programming for adolescents to prevent violence within dating relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foshee V.A. | year = 2004 | title = Assessing the long-term effects of the Safe Dates program and a booster in preventing and reducing adolescent dating violence victimization and perpetration | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 94 | issue = 4| pages = 619–624 | doi=10.2105/ajph.94.4.619|display-authors=etal| pmc = 1448308 | pmid=15054015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence is emerging for the effectiveness of several other primary prevention strategies – those that: combine microfinance with gender equality training;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kim J | year = 2009 | title = Assessing the incremental effects of combining economic and health interventions: the IMAGE study in South Africa | url = | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 87 | issue = 11| pages = 824–832 | doi=10.2471/blt.08.056580|display-authors=etal| pmc = 2770274 | pmid=20072767}}&lt;/ref&gt; promote communication and relationship skills within communities; reduce access to, and the harmful use of alcohol; and change cultural gender norms.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;WHO(2010).[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/9789241564007_eng.pdf "Preventing intimate partner and sexual violence against women: Taking action and generating evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112035242/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/violence/9789241564007_eng.pdf |date=2011-11-12 }} World Health Organization: Geneva&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sexual violence ====
{{Main|Sexual violence}}
[[File:DRC raped women.jpg|thumb|Meeting of victims of [[sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].]]
Sexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting. It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object.&lt;ref&gt;Krug et al.,[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ "World report on violence and health"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822172354/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |date=2015-08-22 }}, World Health Organization, 2002, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population-level surveys based on reports from victims estimate that between 0.3–11.5% of women reported experiencing sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C. et al. (2005).[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/24159358X/en/ "WHO multi-country study on women’s health and domestic violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193441/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/24159358X/en/ |date=2013-01-22 }} Geneva: WHO&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence has serious short- and long-term consequences on physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health for victims and for their children as described in the section on intimate partner violence. If perpetrated during childhood, sexual violence can lead to increased smoking,&lt;ref&gt;Ford, S.E. et al. (2011). Adverse childhood experiences and smoking status in five states. Preventive Medicine: 43, 3, 188-193.&lt;/ref&gt; drug and alcohol misuse, and risky sexual behaviors in later life. It is also associated with perpetration of violence and being a victim of violence.

Many of the risk factors for sexual violence are the same as for [[domestic violence]]. Risk factors specific to sexual violence perpetration include beliefs in family honor and sexual purity, ideologies of male sexual entitlement and weak legal sanctions for sexual violence.

Few interventions to prevent sexual violence have been demonstrated to be effective. School-based programmes to prevent child sexual abuse by teaching children to recognize and avoid potentially sexually abusive situations are run in many parts of the world and appear promising, but require further research. To achieve lasting change, it is important to enact legislation and develop policies that protect women; address discrimination against women and promote gender equality; and help to move the culture away from violence.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

==== Elder maltreatment ====
{{Main|Elder abuse}}
Elder maltreatment is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person. This type of violence constitutes a violation of human rights and includes [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], emotional; [[financial abuse|financial]] and material abuse; abandonment; [[neglect]]; and serious loss of [[dignity]] and [[respect]].&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

While there is little information regarding the extent of maltreatment in elderly populations, especially in developing countries, it is estimated that 4–6% of elderly people in high-income countries have experienced some form of maltreatment at home&lt;ref&gt;Sethi et al. [http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/Life-stages/healthy-ageing/publications/2011/european-report-on-preventing-elder-maltreatment "WHO European report on preventing elder maltreatment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122231547/http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/Life-stages/healthy-ageing/publications/2011/european-report-on-preventing-elder-maltreatment |date=2013-01-22 }}, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper C, Selwood A, Livingston G | year = 2008 | title = The prevalence of elder abuse and neglect: a systematic review | url = | journal = Age Ageing | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 151–60 | doi=10.1093/ageing/afm194 | pmid=18349012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, older people are often afraid to report cases of maltreatment to family, friends, or to the authorities. Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce. Elder maltreatment can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences. Elder maltreatment is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations.

Many strategies have been implemented to prevent elder maltreatment and to take action against it and mitigate its consequences including public and professional awareness campaigns, screening (of potential victims and abusers), caregiver support interventions (e.g. stress management, respite care), adult protective services and self-help groups. Their effectiveness has, however, not so far been well-established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ploeg Jenny |author2=Fear Jana |author3=Hutchison Brian |author4=MacMillan Harriet |author5=Bolan Gale | year = 2009 | title = A Systematic Review of Interventions for Elder Abuse | url = | journal = Journal of Elder Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 187–210 | doi=10.1080/08946560902997181|pmid=19827325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pillemer K et al.

=== Targeted violence ===

Several rare but painful episodes of [[assassination]], attempted assassination and [[school shooting]]s at elementary, middle, high schools, as well as colleges and universities in the United States, led to a considerable body of research on ascertainable behaviors of persons who have planned or carried out such attacks. These studies (1995–2002) investigated what the authors called "targeted violence," described the "path to violence" of those who planned or carried out attacks and laid out suggestions for law enforcement and educators. A major point from these research studies is that targeted violence does not just "come out of the blue".&lt;ref&gt;Fein, R.A., Vossekuil, B. &amp; Holden, G.

=== Everyday violence ===
As an anthropological concept, "everyday violence" may refer to the incorporation of different forms of violence (mainly political violence) into daily practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gammeltoft|first=Tine M.|date=2016-12-01|title=Silence as a Response to Everyday Violence: Understanding Domination and Distress Through the Lens of Fantasy|journal=Ethos|language=en|volume=44|issue=4|pages=427–447|doi=10.1111/etho.12140|issn=1548-1352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com/tag/everyday-violence/|title=everyday violence {{!}} The Ethnography of Political Violence|website=ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213200042/https://ethnographyofpoliticalviolence.wordpress.com/tag/everyday-violence/|archivedate=2018-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://istmo.denison.edu/n08/articulos/power.html|title=Philippe Bourgois - The Power of Violence in War and Peace|website=istmo.denison.edu|access-date=2018-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423065302/http://istmo.denison.edu/n08/articulos/power.html|archivedate=2016-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors ==
Violence cannot be attributed to a single factor. Its causes are complex and occur at different levels. To represent this complexity, the ecological, or [[social ecological model]] is often used. The following four-level version of the ecological model is often used in the study of violence:

The first level identifies biological and personal factors that influence how individuals behave and increase their likelihood of becoming a victim or perpetrator of violence: demographic characteristics (age, education, income), [[Genetics of aggression|genetics]], [[brain lesion theory|brain lesions]], [[personality disorders]], [[substance abuse]], and a history of experiencing, witnessing, or engaging in violent behaviour.&lt;ref name=Patrick&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrick | first1 = C. J. | title = Psychophysiological correlates of aggression and violence: An integrative review | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 363 | issue = 1503 | pages = 2543–2555 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18434285 | pmc = 2606710 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCrory&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCrory | first1 = E. | last2 = De Brito | first2 = S. A. | last3 = Viding | first3 = E. | title = The link between child abuse and psychopathology: A review of neurobiological and genetic research | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 105 | issue = 4 | pages = 151–156 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22532655 | pmc =  3343716| doi = 10.1258/jrsm.2011.110222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second level focuses on close relationships, such as those with family and friends. In youth violence, for example, having friends who engage in or encourage violence can increase a young person’s risk of being a victim or perpetrator of violence. For intimate partner violence, a consistent marker at this level of the model is marital conflict or discord in the relationship. In [[elder abuse]], important factors are stress due to the nature of the past relationship between the abused person and the care giver.

The third level explores the community context—i.e., schools, workplaces, and neighbourhoods. Risk at this level may be affected by factors such as the existence of a local drug trade, the absence of social networks, and concentrated poverty. All these factors have been shown to be important in several types of violence.

Finally, the fourth level looks at the broad societal factors that help to create a climate in which violence is encouraged or inhibited: the responsiveness of the criminal justice system, social and cultural norms regarding gender roles or parent-child relationships, income inequality, the strength of the social welfare system, the social acceptability of violence, the availability of weapons, the exposure to violence in mass media, and political instability.

=== Child-rearing ===

Cross-cultural studies have shown that greater prevalence of [[corporal punishment]] of children tends to predict higher levels of violence in societies. For instance, a 2005 analysis of 186 [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]] found that corporal punishment was more prevalent in societies which also had higher rates of homicide, assault, and war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300461.html "Corporal Punishment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031091526/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300461.html |date=2010-10-31 }} (2008). ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[domestic corporal punishment]] has been linked to later violent acts against family members and spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |format=PDF |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |page= |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127213730/http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While studies showing associations between physical punishment of children and later aggression cannot prove that physical punishment causes an increase in aggression, a number of [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Durrant |first=Joan |last2=Ensom |first2=Ron |date=4 September 2012 |title=Physical punishment of children: lessons from 20 years of research |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=12 |pages=1373–1377 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.101314 |pmid=22311946 |pmc=3447048}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American family violence researcher [[Murray A. Straus]] believes that disciplinary [[spanking]] forms "the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families", whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later domestic violence and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Straus Murray A | year = 2000 | title = Corporal punishment by parents: The cradle of violence in the family and society" (PDF) | url = http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Virginia Journal of Social Policy &amp; the Law | volume =  | issue =  | page =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110040441/http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf | archivedate = 2011-11-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===

The causes of violent behaviour in humans are often a topic of research in [[psychology]]. [[Neuroscientist|Neurobiologist]] Jan Volavka emphasizes that, for those purposes, "violent behavior is defined as intentional physically aggressive behavior against another person."&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071127111237/http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/11/3/307.pdf The Neurobiology of Violence, An Update], Journal of Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci 11:3, Summer 1999. As Mexican Biologist and Scientologist Adri Rodriguez says, Violence is a recurring motif in today's society.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the idea of human nature, scientists do agree violence is inherent in humans. Among prehistoric humans, there is archaeological evidence for both contentions of violence and peacefulness as primary characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Whipps,[http://www.livescience.com/history/060316_peace_violence.html Peace or War? How early humans behaved] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715062002/http://www.livescience.com/history/060316_peace_violence.html |date=2007-07-15 }}, LiveScience.Com, March 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since violence is a matter of perception as well as a measurable phenomenon, psychologists have found variability in whether people perceive certain physical acts as "violent". For example, in a state where execution is a legalized punishment we do not typically perceive the executioner as "violent", though we may talk, in a more metaphorical way, of the state acting violently. Likewise, understandings of violence are linked to a perceived aggressor-victim relationship: hence psychologists have shown that people may not recognise defensive use of force as violent, even in cases where the amount of force used is significantly greater than in the original aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rowan | first = John | year = 1978 | title = The Structured Crowd | publisher = Davis-Poynter. | title-link = The Structured Crowd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "violent male ape" image is often brought up in discussions of human violence. Dale Peterson and [[Richard Wrangham]]in "Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence" write that violence is inherent in humans, though not inevitable.
However, William L. Ury, editor of a book called "Must We Fight? From the Battlefield to the Schoolyard—A New Perspective on Violent Conflict and Its Prevention" criticizes the "killer ape" myth in his book which brings together discussions from two Harvard Law School symposiums. The conclusion is that "we also have lots of natural mechanisms for cooperation, to keep conflict in check, to channel aggression, and to overcome conflict. These are just as natural to us as the aggressive tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;Cindy Fazzi, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3923/is_200205/ai_n9060833Debunking the "killer ape" myth]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},

The psychiatrist [[James Gilligan]] argues that most violent behavior represents an effort to eliminate feelings of [[shame]] and [[humiliation]], which he calls "the death of self".&lt;ref name="Gilligan 2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilligan |first=James |title=Preventing Violence |date=2001 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-50-077056-6 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/Preventing_Violence.html?id=7_06CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT15 |chapter=Shame and the Death of Self}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilligan 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilligan |first=James |title=Shame, Guilt, and Violence |journal=Social Research |date=2003 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=1149–1180 |jstor=40971965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of violence often is a source of [[pride]] and a defence of honor, especially among males who believe violence defines manhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/violence.htm Emotional Competency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323204810/http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/violence.htm |date=2007-03-23 }}; Michael Obsatz,[http://www.angeresources.com/shamebased.html From Shame-Based Masculinity to Holistic Manhood] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201053950/http://angeresources.com/shamebased.html |date=2007-12-01 }}, Robin Morgan, The Demon Lover On the Sexuality of Terrorism, W.W. Norton, 1989, Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article entitled "The History of Violence" in ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[Steven Pinker]] posits that, on average, the amount and cruelty of violence to humans and animals has decreased over the last few centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, [http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2007_03_19_New%20Republic.pdf The History of Violence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127111245/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2007_03_19_New%20Republic.pdf |date=2007-11-27 }}, The New Republic, March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker's observation of the decline in interpersonal violence echoes the work of [[Norbert Elias]], who attributes the decline to a "civilizing process", in which the state's monopolization of violence, the maintenance of socioeconomic interdependencies or "figurations", and the maintenance of behavioural codes in culture all contribute to the development of individual sensibilities, which increase the repugnance of individuals towards violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=CaWFQgAACAAJ | last = Elias | first = N. | year = 1994 | title = The Civilizing Process | location = Oxford | publisher = Blackwell | isbn = 978-0-631-19222-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars disagree with the argument that all violence is decreasing arguing that not all types of violent behaviour are lower now than in the past. They suggest that research typically focuses on lethal violence, often looks at [[homicide]] rates of death due to [[warfare]], but ignore the less obvious forms of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gorelik, G., Shackelford, T.K., Weekes-Shackelford, V.A., 2012.

(Eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Perspectives on Violence, Homicide, and War. Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp. 506–524&lt;/ref&gt;  However, non-lethal violence, such as assaults or bullying appear to be declining as well.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelhor, D., Turner, H., Ormrod, R., &amp; Hamby, S.  "Structural Trends in childhood violence and abuse exposure: Evidence from 2 national surveys." Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine 164.3 (2010): 238-242.&lt;/ref&gt;
In his article [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/02/the-coming-anarchy/304670/ "The Coming Anarchy"], Robert D. Kaplan introduces the notion of liberating violence. According to Kaplan, we will observe more violent [[civil war]]s in the future, which will be fought due to economic inequalities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/02/the-coming-anarchy/304670/ "The Coming Anarchy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407054749/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/02/the-coming-anarchy/304670/ |date=2017-04-07 }}, Robert D.

The concept of violence normalization, is known as socially sanctioned or [[structural violence]], and is a topic of increasing interest to researchers trying to understand violent behavior. It has been discussed at length by researchers in [[sociology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Galtung Johan | authorlink = Johan Galtung | year = 1969 | title = Violence, Peace and Peace Research | url = | journal = Journal of Peace Research | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 167–91 | doi=10.1177/002234336900600301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Galtung Johan |author2=Höivik Tord | year = 1971 | title = Structural and Direct Violence: A Note on Operationalization | url = | journal = Journal of Peace Research | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 73–76 | doi=10.1177/002234337100800108}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[medical anthropology]],&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, Paul, M.

[[Evolutionary psychology]] offers several explanations for human violence in various contexts, such as [[sexual jealousy in humans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Daly Martin |author2=Wilson Margo | year = 1982 | title = Male Sexual Jealousy | url = | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 11–27 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(82)90027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; child abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Daly Martin |author2=Wilson Margo I | year = 1981 | title = Child Maltreatment from a Sociobiological Perspective | url = | journal = New Directions for Child Development | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 93–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Margo, and Martin Daly. Homicide. Hawthorne: Aldine de Gruyter, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Goetz (2010) argues that humans are similar to most [[mammal]] species and use violence in specific situations. He writes that "Buss and Shackelford (1997a) proposed seven adaptive problems our ancestors recurrently faced that might have been solved by aggression: co-opting the resources of others, defending against attack, inflicting costs on same-sex rivals, negotiating status and hierarchies, deterring rivals from future aggression, deterring mate from infidelity, and reducing resources expended on genetically unrelated children."&lt;ref name=EP&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goetz | first1 = A. T. | title = The evolutionary psychology of violence | journal = Psicothema | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20100422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goetz writes that most [[homicide]]s seem to start from relatively trivial disputes between unrelated men who then escalate to violence and death. He argues that such conflicts occur when there is a status dispute between men of relatively similar status. If there is a great initial status difference, then the lower status individual usually offers no challenge and if challenged the higher status individual usually ignores the lower status individual. At the same an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status.&lt;ref name=EP /&gt;

=== Media ===
{{further|Media violence research}}
Research into the media and violence examines whether links between consuming media violence and subsequent aggressive and violent behaviour exists. Although some scholars had claimed media violence may increase aggression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anderson Craig A. |author2=Berkowitz Leonard |author3=Donnerstein Edward |author4=Huesmann L. Rowell |author5=Johnson James D. |author6=Linz Daniel |author7=Malamuth Neil M. |author8=Wartella Ellen | year = 2003 | title = The Influence of Media Violence on Youth | url = | journal = [[Psychological Science in the Public Interest]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3|pages=81–110 | doi = 10.1111/j.1529-1006.2003.pspi_1433.x | pmid=26151870}}&lt;/ref&gt; this view is coming increasingly in doubt both in the scholarly community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ferguson Christopher J | year = 2010| title = Blazing Angels or Resident Evil?

Entertainment Merchants Association|Brown v EMA]] case, as well as in a review of video game violence by the Australian Government (2010) which concluded evidence for harmful effects were inconclusive at best and the rhetoric of some scholars was not matched by good data.

== Prevention ==

The threat and enforcement of physical punishment has been a tried and tested method of preventing some violence since civilisation began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Code-of-Hammurabi|title=Code of Hammurabi {{!}} Summary &amp; History|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-30|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313150613/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Code-of-Hammurabi|archivedate=2017-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in various degrees in most countries.

=== Interpersonal violence ===
A review of scientific literature by the [[World Health Organization]] on the effectiveness of strategies to prevent interpersonal violence identified the seven strategies below as being supported by either strong or emerging evidence for effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ "Violence Prevention: the evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830082343/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ |date=2012-08-30 }}, World Health Organization/Liverpool John Moores University, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies target risk factors at all four levels of the ecological model.

==== Child–caregiver relationships ====
Among the most effective such programmes to prevent child maltreatment and reduce childhood aggression are the Nurse Family Partnership home-visiting programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olds DL, Sadler L, Kitzman H | year = 2007| title = Programs for parents of infants and toddlers: recent evidence from randomized trials | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 48| issue = 3–4| pages = 355–391 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01702.x | pmid=17355402}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Triple P (Parenting Program)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prinz | year = 2009 | title = Population-based prevention of child maltreatment: the US Triple P system population trial | journal = Prevention Science | volume =  10| issue = 1| pages =  1–12| doi = 10.1007/s11121-009-0123-3 | pmid = 19160053 |display-authors=etal| pmc =4258219}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also emerging evidence that these programmes reduce convictions and violent acts in adolescence and early adulthood, and probably help decrease intimate partner violence and self-directed violence in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Caldera D, etal | year = 2007 | title = Impact of a statewide home visiting program on parenting and on child health and development | url = | journal = Child Abuse and Neglect | volume = 31 | issue = 8| pages = 829–852 | doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2007.02.008| pmid = 17822765 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Caldera | year = 1997 | title = Long-term effects of home visitation on maternal life course and child abuse and neglect: 15 year follow-up of a randomized trial | doi = 10.1001/jama.1997.03550080047038 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 278 | issue = 8| pages = 637–643 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Life skills in youth ====
Evidence shows that the [[life skills]] acquired in social development programmes can reduce involvement in violence, improve social skills, boost educational achievement and improve job prospects. Life skills refer to social, emotional, and behavioural competencies which help children and adolescents effectively deal with the challenges of everyday life.

==== Gender equality ====
Evaluation studies are beginning to support community interventions that aim to prevent [[violence against women]] by promoting [[gender equality]]. For instance, evidence suggests that programmes that combine microfinance with gender equity training can reduce intimate partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Pronyk PM, etal | year = 2006| title = Effect of a structural intervention for the prevention of intimate-partner violence and HIV in rural South Africa: a cluster randomised trial | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 368| issue = 9551| pages = 1973–83 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69744-4 | pmid=17141704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kim JC, Watts CH, Hargreaves JR, etal | year = 2007| title = Understanding the impact of a microfinance-based intervention on women's empowerment and the reduction of intimate partner violence in South Africa | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 97| issue = 10| pages = 1794–1802 | doi=10.2105/ajph.2006.095521 | pmid=17761566 | pmc=1994170}}&lt;/ref&gt; School-based programmes such as Safe Dates programme in the United States of America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Foshee VA, etal | year = 1998| title = An evaluation of safe dates an adolescent dating violence prevention programme | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 1998 | issue = 88| pages = 45–50 | doi=10.2105/ajph.88.1.45| pmc = 1508378 | pmid=9584032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foshee| year = 2005 | title = Safe Dates" using random coefficient regression modelling | url = | journal = Prevention Science | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 245–257 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Youth Relationship Project in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wolfe D, etal | year = 2009 | title = Dating violence prevention with at risk youth: a controlled outcome evaluation | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 279–291 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.71.2.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been found to be effective for reducing dating violence.

==== Cultural norms ====
Rules or expectations of behaviour – norms – within a cultural or social group can encourage violence. Interventions that challenge cultural and [[social norms]] supportive of violence can prevent acts of violence and have been widely used, but the evidence base for their effectiveness is currently weak. The effectiveness of interventions addressing [[dating violence]] and [[sexual abuse]] among teenagers and young adults by challenging social and cultural norms related to gender is supported by some evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fabiano P | year = 2003 | title = Engaging men as social justice allies in ending violence against women: evidence for a social norms approach | url = | journal = Journal of American College Health | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 105–112 | doi=10.1080/07448480309595732| pmid = 14992295 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S.

Little Falls, NJ, PaperClip Communications, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Support programmes ====
Interventions to identify victims of interpersonal violence and provide effective care and support are critical for protecting health and breaking cycles of violence from one generation to the next. Examples for which evidence of effectiveness is emerging includes: screening tools to identify victims of intimate partner violence and refer them to appropriate services;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Olive P | year = 2007 | title = Care for emergency department patients who have experienced domestic violence: a review of the evidence base | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Nursing | volume = 16 | issue = 9| pages = 1736–1748 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.01746.x| pmid = 17727592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; psychosocial interventions – such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy – to reduce mental health problems associated with violence, including post-traumatic stress disorder;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roberts GL | year = 1997 | title = Impact of an education program about domestic violence on nurses and doctors in an Australian emergency department | url = | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 220–226 | doi=10.1016/s0099-1767(97)90011-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and protection orders, which prohibit a perpetrator from contacting the victim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Holt VL, etal | year = 2003| title = Do protection orders affect the likelihood of future partner violence and injury? | url = | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 2003 | issue = 24| pages = 16–21 | doi=10.1016/s0749-3797(02)00576-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=McFarlane J, etal | year = 2004| title = Protection orders and intimate partner violence: an 18-month study of 150 Black, Hispanic, and White women | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 2004 | issue = 94| pages = 613–618 | doi=10.2105/ajph.94.4.613| pmc = 1448307 | pmid=15054014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce repeat victimization among victims of intimate partner violence.

=== Collective violence ===
Not surprisingly, scientific evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to prevent collective violence is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Zwi, Garfield, &amp; Loretti (2002) Collective violence, In Krug et al (Eds) World report on violence and health, WHO&lt;/ref&gt;  However, policies that facilitate [[poverty reduction|reductions in poverty]], that make [[decision-making]] more accountable, that reduce inequalities between groups, as well as policies that reduce access to biological, chemical, nuclear and other weapons have been recommended. When planning responses to violent conflicts, recommended approaches include assessing at an early stage who is most vulnerable and what their needs are, co-ordination of activities between various players and working towards global, national and local capabilities so as to deliver effective health services during the various stages of an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Zwi, Garfield, &amp; Loretti (2002) Collective violence, In Krug et al (Eds) World report on violence and health&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main functions of [[law]] is to regulate violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = David Joseph E | year = 2006 | title = The One who is More Violent Prevails – Law and Violence from a Talmudic Legal Perspective | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence | volume = 19 | issue = 2| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Max Weber]] stated that the state claims the [[monopoly of the legitimate use of force]] practised within the confines of a specific territory. [[Law]] enforcement is the main means of regulating nonmilitary violence in society. Governments regulate the use of violence through [[legal system]]s governing individuals and political authorities, including the [[police]] and [[military]]. Civil societies authorize some amount of violence, exercised through the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]], to maintain the status quo and enforce laws.

However, German political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]] noted: "Violence can be justifiable, but it never will be legitimate ... Its justification loses in plausibility the farther its intended end recedes into the future. No one questions the use of violence in self-defence, because the danger is not only clear but also present, and the end justifying the means is immediate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Arendt | first = Hannah | title = On Violence | publisher = Harvest Book | page = 52 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt made a clear distinction between violence and power. Most political theorists regarded violence as an extreme manifestation of power whereas Arendt regarded the two concepts as opposites.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, H. (1972) On Violence in Crises in the Republic, Florida, Harcourt, Brace and Company, pp 134-155.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 20th century in acts of [[democide]] governments may have killed more than 260 million of their own people through [[police brutality]], [[execution]], [[massacre]], slave [[labour camps]], and sometimes through intentional [[List of famines#20th century|famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM|title=20th Century Democide|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301064559/http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM|archivedate=2006-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm|title=Atlas – Wars and Democide of the Twentieth Century|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110130810/http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/war-1900.htm|archivedate=2007-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violent acts that are not carried out by the military or police and that are not in [[self-defense]] are usually classified as [[crimes]], although not all crimes are [[violent crime]]s. [[Property damage|Damage to property]] is classified as violent crime in some jurisdictions but not in all.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) classifies violence resulting in [[homicide]] into [[murder|criminal homicide]] and [[justifiable homicide]] (e.g. self-defense).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf|title=Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook|year=2004|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503055659/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-03|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice approach sees its main task as enforcing laws that proscribe violence and ensuring that "justice is done". The notions of individual blame, responsibility, guilt, and culpability are central to criminal justice's approach to violence and one of the criminal justice system's main tasks is to "do justice", i.e. to ensure that offenders are properly identified, that the degree of their guilt is as accurately ascertained as possible, and that they are punished appropriately. To prevent and respond to violence, the criminal justice approach relies primarily on deterrence, incarceration and the punishment and rehabilitation of perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;M. Moore "Public Health and Criminal Justice Approaches to Prevention."1992. In Vol. 16 of Crime and Justice: A Review of Research, edited by M. Tonry. Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal justice approach, beyond justice and punishment, has traditionally emphasized indicated interventions, aimed at those who have already been involved in violence, either as victims or as perpetrators. One of the main reasons offenders are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted is to prevent further crimes – through deterrence (threatening potential offenders with criminal sanctions if they commit crimes), incapacitation (physically preventing offenders from committing further crimes by locking them up) and through rehabilitation (using time spent under state supervision to develop skills or change one's psychological make-up to reduce the likelihood of future offences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Medicine, and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 82–94 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades in many countries in the world, the criminal justice system has taken an increasing interest in preventing violence before it occurs. For instance, much of community and [[problem-oriented policing]] aims to reduce crime and violence by altering the conditions that foster it – and not to increase the number of arrests. Indeed, some police leaders have gone so far as to say the police should primarily be a crime prevention agency.&lt;ref&gt;Bratton W (with Knobler P). Turnaround: how America's top cop reversed the crime epidemic. New York: Random House, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile justice systems – an important component of criminal justice systems – are largely based on the belief in rehabilitation and prevention. In the US, the criminal justice system has, for instance, funded school- and community-based initiatives to reduce children's access to guns and teach conflict resolution. In 1974, the US Department of Justice assumed primary responsibility for delinquency prevention programmes and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which has supported the "Blueprints for violence prevention" programme at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence [http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints "Blueprints for violence prevention/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103080341/http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints/ |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public health ===
The public health approach is a science-driven, population-based, interdisciplinary, intersectoral approach based on the ecological model which emphasizes primary prevention.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt; Rather than focusing on individuals, the public health approach aims to provide the maximum benefit for the largest number of people, and to extend better care and safety to entire populations. The public health approach is interdisciplinary, drawing upon knowledge from many disciplines including medicine, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, criminology, education and economics. Because all forms of violence are multi-faceted problems, the public health approach emphasizes a multi-sectoral response. It has been proved time and again that cooperative efforts from such diverse sectors as health, education, social welfare, and criminal justice are often necessary to solve what are usually assumed to be purely "criminal" or "medical" problems. The public health approach considers that violence, rather than being the result of any single factor, is the outcome of multiple risk factors and causes, interacting at four levels of a nested hierarchy (individual, close relationship/family, community and wider society) of the [[Social ecological model]].

From a public health perspective, prevention strategies can be classified into three types:
* Primary prevention – approaches that aim to prevent violence before it occurs.
* Secondary prevention – approaches that focus on the more immediate responses to violence, such as pre-hospital care, emergency services or treatment for sexually transmitted infections following a rape.
* Tertiary prevention – approaches that focus on long-term care in the wake of violence, such as rehabilitation and reintegration, and attempt to lessen trauma or reduce long-term disability associated with violence.

A public health approach emphasizes the primary prevention of violence, i.e. stopping them from occurring in the first place. Until recently, this approach has been relatively neglected in the field, with the majority of resources directed towards secondary or tertiary prevention. Perhaps the most critical element of a public health approach to prevention is the ability to identify underlying causes rather than focusing upon more visible "symptoms". This allows for the development and testing of effective approaches to address the underlying causes and so improve health.

The public health approach is an evidence-based and systematic process involving the following four steps:
# Defining the problem conceptually and numerically, using statistics that accurately describe the nature and scale of violence, the characteristics of those most affected, the geographical distribution of incidents, and the consequences of exposure to such violence.
# Investigating why the problem occurs by determining its causes and correlates, the factors that increase or decrease the risk of its occurrence (risk and protective factors) and the factors that might be modifiable through intervention.
# Exploring ways to prevent the problem by using the above information and designing, monitoring and rigorously assessing the effectiveness of programmes through outcome evaluations.
# Disseminating information on the effectiveness of programmes and increasing the scale of proven effective programmes. Approaches to prevent violence, whether targeted at individuals or entire communities, must be properly evaluated for their effectiveness and the results shared. This step also includes adapting programmes to local contexts and subjecting them to rigorous re-evaluation to ensure their effectiveness in the new setting.

In many countries, violence prevention is still a new or emerging field in public health. The public health community has started only recently to realize the contributions it can make to reducing violence and mitigating its consequences. In 1949, Gordon called for injury prevention efforts to be based on the understanding of causes, in a similar way to prevention efforts for communicable and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon JE, "The epidemiology of accidents," ''American Journal of Public Health'', 1949; 504–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Gomez, referring to the WHO definition of health, stated that it is obvious that violence does not contribute to "extending life" or to a "complete state of well-being". He defined violence as an issue that public health experts needed to address and stated that it should not be the primary domain of lawyers, military personnel, or politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abad Gomez H | year = 1962 | title = Violence requires epidemiological studies | url = | journal = Tribuna Medica | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is only in the last 30 years that public health has begun to address violence, and only in the last fifteen has it done so at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dahlberg L. |author2=Mercy J. | year = 2009 | title = History of violence as a public health issue | url = | journal = AMA Virtual Mentor | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 167–172 | doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2009.11.2.mhst1-0902|pmid=23190546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a much shorter period of time than public health has been tackling other health problems of comparable magnitude and with similarly severe lifelong consequences.

The global public health response to interpersonal violence began in earnest in the mid-1990s. In 1996, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA49.25&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf "WHA49.25 Prevention of violence: a public health priority"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122193242/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf |date=2013-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which declared violence "a leading worldwide public health problem" and requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) initiate public health activities to (1) document and characterize the burden of violence, (2) assess the effectiveness of programmes, with particular attention to women and children and community-based initiatives, and (3) promote activities to tackle the problem at the international and national levels. The World Health Organization's initial response to this resolution was to create the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability and to publish the World report on violence and health (2002).&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

The case for the public health sector addressing interpersonal violence rests on four main arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Prothrow-Stith D | year = 2004 | title = Strengthening the collaboration between public health and criminal justice to prevent violence | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Medicine, and Ethics | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 82–88 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2004.tb00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the significant amount of time health care professionals dedicate to caring for victims and perpetrators of violence has made them familiar with the problem and has led many, particularly in emergency departments, to mobilize to address it. The information, resources, and infrastructures the health care sector has at its disposal are an important asset for research and prevention work. Second, the magnitude of the problem and its potentially severe lifelong consequences and high costs to individuals and wider society call for population-level interventions typical of the public health approach. Third, the criminal justice approach, the other main approach to addressing violence (link to entry above), has traditionally been more geared towards violence that occurs between male youths and adults in the street and other public places – which makes up the bulk of homicides in most countries – than towards violence occurring in private settings such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence and elder abuse – which makes up the largest share of non-fatal violence. Fourth, evidence is beginning to accumulate that a science-based public health approach is effective at preventing interpersonal violence.

=== Human rights ===
[[File:Abdulredha Buhmaid on floor.jpeg|thumb|[[Bahrain]]'s pro-democracy protesters killed by military, February 2011]]
The [[human rights]] approach is based on the obligations of states to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and therefore to prevent, eradicate and punish violence. It recognizes violence as a violation of many human rights: the rights to life, liberty, [[autonomy]] and security of the person; the rights to equality and non-discrimination; the rights to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; the right to [[privacy]]; and the [[right to health|right to the highest attainable standard of health]]. These human rights are enshrined in [[international human rights law|international and regional treaties]] and national constitutions and laws, which stipulate the obligations of states, and include mechanisms to hold states accountable. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], for example, requires that countries party to the Convention take all appropriate steps to end violence against women. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in its Article 19 states that States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.

=== Geographical context ===
Violence, as defined in the dictionary of human geography, "appears whenever power is in jeopardy" and "in and of itself stands emptied of strength and purpose: it is part of a larger matrix of socio-political power struggles".&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009"&gt;Hyndman, J. (2009) Violence in Gregory, D., Johnston, R., Pratt, G., Watts, M. and Whatmore, S. eds. Dictionary of Human Geography, Wiley-Blackwell, NJ: 798-799.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence can be broadly divided into three broad categories – direct violence, structural violence and cultural violence.&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; Thus defined and delineated, it is of note, as Hyndman says, that "geography came late to theorizing violence"&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; in comparison to other social sciences. Social and human geography, rooted in the [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Marxist]], and [[Feminist theory|feminist]] subfields that emerged following the early positivist approaches and subsequent behavioral turn, have long been concerned with social and spatial justice.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, S. (2001) Social Geography, in Smelser, N. and Baltes, P. eds. International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Oxford, Elsevier, 14293-14299.&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with critical geographers and political geographers, it is these groupings of geographers that most often interact with violence. Keeping this idea of social/spatial justice via geography in mind, it is worthwhile to look at geographical approaches to violence in the context of politics.

Derek Gregory and Alan Pred assembled the influential edited collection ''Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence'', which demonstrates how place, space, and landscape are foremost factors in the real and imagined practices of organized violence both historically and in the present.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek and Pred, Alan'', 2006 Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, political violence often gives a part for the state to play. When "modern states not only claim a monopoly of the legitimate means of violence; they also routinely use the threat of violence to enforce the rule of law",&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; the law not only becomes a form of violence but is violence.&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt; Philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s concepts of [[state of exception]] and ''[[homo sacer]]'' are useful to consider within a geography of violence. The state, in the grip of a perceived, potential crisis (whether legitimate or not) takes preventative legal measures, such as a suspension of rights (it is in this climate, as Agamben demonstrates, that the formation of the Social Democratic and Nazi government's lager or concentration camp can occur). However, when this "in limbo" reality is designed to be in place "until further notice…the state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself".&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998"&gt;Agamben, G. (1998) ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'', Stanford University Press, Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt; For Agamben, the physical space of the camp "is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical order, but it is nevertheless not simply an external space".&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998" /&gt; At the scale of the body, in the state of exception, a person is so removed from their rights by "juridical procedures and deployments of power"&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998" /&gt; that "no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime";&lt;ref name="Agamben, G. 1998" /&gt; in other words, people become only ''homo sacer''. [[Guantanamo Bay]] could also be said to represent the physicality of the state of exception in space, and can just as easily draw man as homo sacer.

In the 1970s, genocides in Cambodia under the [[Khmer Rouge]] and [[Pol Pot]] resulted in the deaths of over two million Cambodians (which was 25% of the Cambodian population), forming one of the many contemporary examples of state-sponsored violence.&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002"&gt;Ringer, G. (2002) "Killing Fields", in Christensen, K. and Levinson, D. eds. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Asia'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York: 368-370.&lt;/ref&gt; About fourteen thousand of these murders occurred at [[Choeung Ek]], which is the best-known of the extermination camps referred to as the [[Killing Fields]].&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; The killings were arbitrary; for example, a person could be killed for wearing glasses, since that was seen as associating them with intellectuals and therefore as making them part of the enemy. People were murdered with impunity because it was no crime; Cambodians were made ''homo sacer'' in a condition of bare life. The Killing Fields—manifestations of Agamben's concept of camps beyond the normal rule of law—featured the state of exception. As part of Pol Pot's "ideological intent…to create a purely agrarian society or cooperative",&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; he "dismantled the country's existing economic infrastructure and depopulated every urban area".&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; Forced movement, such as this forced movement applied by Pol Pot, is a clear display of structural violence. When "symbols of Cambodian society were equally disrupted, social institutions of every kind…were purged or torn down",&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; cultural violence (defined as when "any aspect of culture such as language, religion, ideology, art, or cosmology is used to legitimize direct or structural violence"&lt;ref name="Hyndman, J. 2009" /&gt;) is added to the structural violence of forced movement and to the direct violence, such as murder, at the Killing Fields. Vietnam eventually intervened and the genocide officially ended. However, ten million landmines left by opposing guerillas in the 1970s&lt;ref name="Ringer, G. 2002" /&gt; continue to create a violent landscape in Cambodia.

Human geography, though coming late to the theorizing table, has tackled violence through many lenses, including anarchist geography, feminist geography, Marxist geography, political geography, and critical geography. However, [[Adriana Cavarero]] notes that, "as violence spreads and assumes unheard-of forms, it becomes difficult to name in contemporary language".&lt;ref name="Cavarero, A. 2009"&gt;Cavarero, A. (2009) ''Horrorism: Naming Contemporary Violence'', Columbia University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavarero proposes that, in facing such a truth, it is prudent to reconsider violence as "horrorism"; that is, "as though ideally all the…victims, instead of their killers, ought to determine the name".&lt;ref name="Cavarero, A. 2009" /&gt; With geography often adding the forgotten spatial aspect to theories of social science, rather than creating them solely within the discipline, it seems that the self-reflexive contemporary geography of today may have an extremely important place in this current (re)imaging of violence, exemplified by Cavarero.{{clarify|date=November 2014}}

== Epidemiology ==
[[File:No Violence Sign.jpg|thumb|A sign that calls to stop violence ]]
As of 2010, all forms of violence resulted in about 1.34 million deaths up from about 1 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|first2=M|last3=Foreman|first3=K|last4=Lim|first4=S|last5=Shibuya|first5=K|last6=Aboyans|first6=V|last7=Abraham|first7=J|last8=Adair|first8=T|last9=Aggarwal|first9=R|last10=Ahn|first10=SY|last11=Alvarado|first11=M|last12=Anderson|first12=HR|last13=Anderson|first13=LM|last14=Andrews|first14=KG|last15=Atkinson|first15=C|last16=Baddour|first16=LM|last17=Barker-Collo|first17=S|last18=Bartels|first18=DH|last19=Bell|first19=ML|last20=Benjamin|first20=EJ|last21=Bennett|first21=D|last22=Bhalla|first22=K|last23=Bikbov|first23=B|last24=Bin Abdulhak|first24=A|last25=Birbeck|first25=G|last26=Blyth|first26=F|last27=Bolliger|first27=I|last28=Boufous|first28=S|last29=Bucello|first29=C|last30=Burch|first30=M|last2=Naghavi|display-authors=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suicide]] accounts for about 883,000, interpersonal violence for 456,000 and collective violence for 18,000.&lt;ref name=Loz2012 /&gt; Deaths due to collective violence have decreased from 64,000 in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012 /&gt;

By way of comparison, the 1.5 millions deaths a year due to violence is greater than the number of deaths due to tuberculosis (1.34 million), road traffic injuries (1.21 million), and malaria (830'000), but slightly less than the number of people who die from HIV/AIDS (1.77 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html "Global Burden of Disease, Disease and injury regional estimates"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For every death due to violence, there are numerous nonfatal injuries. In 2008, over 16 million cases of non-fatal violence-related injuries were severe enough to require medical attention. Beyond deaths and injuries, forms of violence such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder maltreatment have been found to be highly prevalent.

=== Self-directed violence ===
In the last 45 years, suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Suicide is among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15–44 years in some countries, and the second leading cause of death in the 10–24 years age group.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} These figures do not include suicide attempts which are up to 20 times more frequent than completed suicide.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Suicide was the 16th leading cause of death worldwide in 2004 and is projected to increase to the 12th in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/EN_WHS08_Full.pdf "World Health Statistics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030212923/http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/EN_WHS08_Full.pdf |date=2011-10-30 }} World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although suicide rates have traditionally been highest among the male elderly, rates among young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now the group at highest risk in a third of countries, in both developed and developing countries.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Interpersonal violence ===
Rates and patterns of violent death vary by country and region. In recent years, homicide rates have been highest in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean and lowest in East Asia, the western Pacific, and some countries in northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html "Global Burden of Disease"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show a strong, inverse relationship between homicide rates and both economic development and economic equality. Poorer countries, especially those with large gaps between the rich and the poor, tend to have higher rates of homicide than wealthier countries. Homicide rates differ markedly by age and sex. Gender differences are least marked for children. For the 15 to 29 age group, male rates were nearly six times those for female rates; for the remaining age groups, male rates were from two to four times those for females.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg ML, Butchart A, Mercy J, Narasimhan V, Waters H, Marshall MS. Interpersonal violence. In Jamison DT, Breman JG, Measham AR, Alleyne G, Claeson M, Evans DB, Prabhat J, Mills A, Musgrove P (eds.) Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 2nd Edition. Washington, D.C.: Oxford University Press and The World Bank, 2006: 755-770.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in a number of countries show that, for every homicide among young people age 10 to 24, 20 to 40 other young people receive hospital treatment for a violent injury.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

Forms of violence such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence are highly prevalent. Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs150/en/index.html "Child maltreatment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229124411/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs150/en/index.html |date=2011-12-29 }}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A WHO multi-country study found that between 15–71% of women reported experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html "Violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228151643/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html |date=2011-12-28 }}, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collective violence ===
Wars grab headlines, but the individual risk of dying violently in an armed conflict is today relatively low—much lower than the risk of violent death in many countries that are not suffering from an armed conflict. For example, between 1976 and 2008, [[African American]]s were victims of 329,825 homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homicide trends in the United States |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |url=http://www1.cj.msu.edu/~outreach/mvaa/Homicide/Homicide%20Trends%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010151657/http://www.cj.msu.edu/~outreach/mvaa/Homicide/Homicide%20Trends%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homicide Victims by Race and Sex |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/law_enforcement_courts_prisons/crimes_and_crime_rates.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323173400/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/law_enforcement_courts_prisons/crimes_and_crime_rates.html |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is a widespread perception that war is the most dangerous form of armed violence in the world, the average person living in a conflict-affected country had a risk of dying violently in the conflict of about 2.0 per 100,000 population between 2004 and 2007. This can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7.6 per 100,000 people. This illustration highlights the value of accounting for all forms of armed violence rather than an exclusive focus on conflict related violence. Certainly, there are huge variations in the risk of dying from armed conflict at the national and subnational level, and the risk of dying violently in a conflict in specific countries remains extremely high. In Iraq, for example, the direct conflict death rate for 2004–07 was 65 per 100,000 people per year and, in Somalia, 24 per 100,000 people. This rate even reached peaks of 91 per 100,000 in Iraq in 2006 and 74 per 100,000 in Somalia in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Krause, Robert Muggah, and Achim Wennmann, "Global Burden of Armed Violence," Geneva Declaration Secretariat, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fry]] writes that scholars are divided on the origins of this greater degree of violence—in other words, war-like behavior: {{quote|There are basically two schools of thought on this issue. One holds that warfare... goes back at least to the time of the first thoroughly modern humans and even before then to the primate ancestors of the hominid lineage. The second positions on the origins of warfare sees war as much less common in the cultural and biological evolution of humans. Here, warfare is a latecomer on the cultural horizon, only arising in very specific material circumstances and being quite rare in human history until the development of agriculture in the past 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fry, Douglas P.|title=War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views|page=168|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eJoAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22one+of+the+critical+issues%22|isbn=978-0-19-985900-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jared Diamond]] in his books ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]'' and ''[[The Third Chimpanzee]]'' posits that the rise of large-scale warfare is the result of advances in technology and city-states. For instance, the rise of agriculture provided a significant increase in the number of individuals that a region could sustain over hunter-gatherer societies, allowing for development of specialized classes such as soldiers, or weapons manufacturers.

In academia, the idea of the peaceful pre-history and non-violent tribal societies gained popularity with the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial perspective]]. The trend, starting in [[archaeology]] and spreading to [[anthropology]] reached its height in the late half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Keely1&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H. War before Civilization. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some newer research in archaeology and [[bioarchaeology]] may provide evidence that violence within and among groups is not a recent phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=[[Asia Times Online]]|date=4 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2014}} According to the book "The Bioarchaeology of Violence" violence is a behavior that is found throughout human history.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Debra L., Ryan P.

Lawrence H. Keeley at the University of Illinois writes in ''[[War Before Civilization]]'' that 87% of [[tribal societies]] were at war more than once per year, and that 65% of them were fighting continuously. He writes that the attrition rate of numerous close-quarter clashes, which characterize [[endemic warfare]], produces casualty rates of up to 60%, compared to 1% of the combatants as is typical in modern warfare. "Primitive Warfare" of these small groups or tribes was driven by the basic need for sustenance and violent competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.troynovant.com/Franson/Keeley/War-Before-Civilization.html Review of book "War Before Civilization" by Lawrence H.

Fry explores Keeley's argument in depth and counters that such sources erroneously focus on the ethnography of hunters and gatherers in the present, whose culture and values have been infiltrated externally by modern civilization, rather than the actual archaeological record spanning some two million years of human existence. Fry determines that all present ethnographically studied tribal societies, "by the very fact of having been described and published by anthropologists, have been irrevocably impacted by history and modern colonial nation states" and that "many have been affected by state societies for at least 5000 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fry, Douglas P.|title=War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views|pages=171–3|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' ===
[[Steven Pinker]]'s 2011 book, ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'', roused both acclaim and controversy by asserting that modern society is less violent than in periods of the past, whether on the short scale of decades or long scale of centuries or millennia.

Steven Pinker argues that by every possible measure, every type of violence has drastically decreased since ancient and medieval times. A few centuries ago, for example, [[genocide]] was a standard practice in all kinds of warfare and was so common that historians did not even bother to mention it. According to Pinker, rape, murder, warfare and animal cruelty have all seen drastic declines in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Steven Pinker]] |title=The Better Angels of Our Nature |isbn=978-0-670-02295-3|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pinker's analyses have met with much criticism;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bookreview-steven-pinker-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined |title=Book Review |author=R Epstein |publisher=Scientific American |date=October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914140139/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bookreview-steven-pinker-the-better-angels-of-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined |archivedate=2016-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laws"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=702 |title=Against Pinker's Violence |first=Ben |last=Laws |journal=[[Ctheory]] |date=21 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512052358/http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=702 |archivedate=12 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Herman Edward S. | author2 = Peterson David | year =  | title = Steven Pinker on the alleged decline of violence | url = http://isreview.org/issue/86/steven-pinker-alleged-decline-violence | journal = International Socialist Review | volume = 86 | issue =  | page =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150319022936/http://isreview.org/issue/86/steven-pinker-alleged-decline-violence | archivedate = 2015-03-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/03/the_big_kill?page=full |title=The Big Kill – By John Arquilla |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2013-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107171044/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/03/the_big_kill?page=full |archivedate=2013-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, Pinker himself, on his FAQ page, states that he does not include catastrophic ecological violence (including violence against wild or domesticated non-human animals or plants, or against ecosystems) or the violence of economic inequality and of coercive working conditions in his definition; he controversially regards these forms of violence as "metaphorical". Some critics have therefore argued that Pinker suffers from "a reductive vision of what it means to be violent."&lt;ref name="Laws" /&gt;

== Society and culture ==

[[File:PikiWiki Israel 20285 quot;Stop Violencequot; sculpture in Petah Tikva.JPG|thumb|right|A sculpture in [[Petah Tikva, Israel]] of a padlock on the warped barrel of a [[semi-automatic pistol]], with the inscription "stop violence!" in ({{lang-he|!די לאלימות}})]]

Beyond deaths and injuries, highly prevalent forms of violence (such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence) have serious lifelong non-injury health consequences. Victims may engage in high-risk behaviours such as alcohol and substance misuse and smoking, which in turn can contribute to cardiovascular disorders, cancers, depression, diabetes and HIV/AIDS, resulting in premature death&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170920185014/https://www.cdc.gov/ace/index.htm |date=2017-09-20 }}, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eye for an eye|Violence may beget violence]]. The balances of prevention, mitigation, mediation and exacerbation are complex, and vary with the underpinnings of violence.

=== Economic effects ===
In countries with high levels of violence, economic growth can be slowed down, personal and collective security eroded, and social development impeded. Families edging out of poverty and investing in schooling their sons and daughters can be ruined through the violent death or severe disability of the main breadwinner. Communities can be caught in poverty traps where pervasive violence and deprivation form a vicious circle that stifles economic growth. For societies, meeting the direct costs of health, criminal justice, and social welfare responses to violence diverts many billions of dollars from more constructive societal spending. The much larger indirect costs of violence due to lost productivity and lost investment in education work together to slow economic development, increase socioeconomic inequality, and erode human and social capital.

Additionally, communities with high level of violence do not provide the level of stability and predictability vital for a prospering business economy. Individuals will be less likely to invest money and effort towards growth in such unstable and violent conditions.

In 2016, the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], released the [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/The-Economic-Value-of-Peace-2016-WEB.pdf Economic Value of Peace] report, which estimates the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy, the total economic impact of violence on the world economy in 2015 was estimated to be $13.6 trillion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/how-much-does-violence-really-cost-our-global-economy/|title=How much does violence really cost our global economy?|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2017-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913201606/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/how-much-does-violence-really-cost-our-global-economy|archivedate=2017-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[purchasing power parity]] terms.

Throughout history, most religions and individuals like [[Mahatma Gandhi]] have preached that humans are capable of eliminating individual violence and organizing societies through purely [[nonviolent]] means.

Gandhi, Navajivan Publishing House, Ahmedabad, India, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern political ideologies which espouse similar views include pacifist varieties of [[Voluntaryism|voluntarism]], [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], [[anarchism]] and [[libertarianism]].

Terence Fretheim writing about the Old Testament:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

For many people, ... only physical violence truly qualifies as violence. But, certainly, violence is more than killing people, unless one includes all those words and actions that kill people slowly. The effect of limitation to a “killing fields” perspective is the widespread neglect of many other forms of violence. We must insist that violence also refers to that which is psychologically destructive, that which demeans, damages, or depersonalizes others.  In view of these considerations, violence may be defined as follows: any action, verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, physical or psychical, active or passive, public or private, individual or institutional/societal, human or divine, in whatever degree of intensity, that abuses, violates, injures, or kills. Some of the most pervasive and most dangerous forms of violence are those that are often hidden from view (against women and children, especially); just beneath the surface in many of our homes, churches, and communities is abuse enough to freeze the
blood. Moreover, many forms of systemic violence often slip past our attention because they are so much a part of the infrastructure of life (e.g., racism, sexism, ageism).&lt;ref name=Fretheim&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Word &amp; World |first=Terence |last=Freitheim |title=God and Violence in the Old Testament |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2004 |url=http://wordandworld.luthersem.edu/content/pdfs/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119093532/http://wordandworld.luthersem.edu/content/pdfs/24-1_Violence/24-1_Fretheim.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hard-sided waterbed consists of a water-containing mattress inside a rectangular frame of wood resting on a [[plywood]] deck that sits on a platform.

A soft-sided waterbed consists of a water-containing mattress inside of a rectangular frame of sturdy foam, zippered inside a fabric casing, which sits on a platform. It looks like a conventional bed and is designed to fit existing bedroom furniture. The platform usually looks like a conventional foundation or box spring, and sits atop a reinforced metal frame.

Early waterbed mattresses, and many inexpensive modern mattresses, have a single water chamber. When the water mass in these "free flow" mattresses is disturbed, significant wave action can be felt, and they need time to stabilize after a disturbance. Later types employed wave-reducing methods, including fiber batting and interconnected water chambers. More expensive "waveless" modern waterbeds have a mixture of air and water chambers, usually interconnected.

Water beds are normally heated. Temperature is controlled via a [[thermostat]] and set to personal preference, but is most commonly average skin temperature, 30&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] or about 86&amp;nbsp;[[Degrees Fahrenheit|°F]]. A typical [[heating pad]] consumes 150–400 [[watt]]s of power. Depending on insulation, [[bedding]], temperature, use, and other factors, electricity usage may vary, significantly.

Waterbeds are usually constructed from soft [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) or similar material. They can be repaired with practically any vinyl repair kit.

* '''Free flow mattress''': A free flow mattress or full wave mattress is a mattress that contains only water but no baffles or inserts.
* '''Semi-waveless mattress''': A semi-waveless mattress is a type of mattress that contains a few fiber inserts and/or baffles to control the water motion and increase support.
* '''Waveless mattress''': A waveless mattress is a type of mattress that contains many layers of fiber inserts and/or baffles to control the water motion and increase support.  Frequently the better mattresses contain additional layers in the center third of the mattress called special lumbar support.

==History in 1800s==
A form of waterbed was invented in 1833 by the Scottish physician [[Neil Arnott]]. ''Dr. Arnott's Hydrostatic Bed'' was devised to prevent bedsores in [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/invalid#Noun invalids], and comprised a bath of water with a covering of rubber-impregnated canvas, on which lighter bedding was placed. Arnott didn't patent it, permitting anyone to construct a bed to this design.&lt;ref&gt;''An Encyclopaedia of Domestic Economy'', Webster &amp; Parkes, Harper &amp; Brothers, NY, 1855 [https://books.google.com/books?id=f5oDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=%22water+bed%22+mattress#PPA309,M1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Arnott's Hydrostatic Bed, ''[[London Medical and Surgical Journal]]'', Volume II, 1833 [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA165 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a waterbed (for the ailing Mrs. Hale) is mentioned in [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s 1855 novel ''[[North and South (1855 novel)|North and South]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=North and South |url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/north-and-south/9780099511489#popup-back |publisher=Vintage Publishing |accessdate=3 June 2012 |author=Elizabeth Gaskell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protagonist Graham is placed on a waterbed in a glass case during his coma of 103 years in the 1898 H. G. Wells novel "The Sleeper Awakes".

In 1871, a waterbed was in use in [[Elmira, New York]], for "invalids". It was briefly mentioned by [[Mark Twain]] in his article "[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1871/07/23/78769193.pdf A New Beecher Church]", which was published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 23 July 1871. Twain wrote: "In the infirmary will be kept one or two water-beds (for invalids whose pains will not allow them to be on a less yielding substance) and half a dozen reclining invalid-chairs on wheels. The water-beds and invalid-chairs at present belonging to the church are always in demand, and never out of service".

==Heinlein descriptions==
Science fiction writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]] described therapeutic waterbeds in his novels ''[[Beyond This Horizon]]'' (1942), ''[[Double Star]]'' (1956), and ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' (1961). In 1980 Heinlein recalled in ''[[Expanded Universe (Heinlein)|Expanded Universe]]'':

{{quote|I designed the waterbed during years as a bed patient in the middle thirties; a pump to control water level, side supports to permit one to float rather than simply lying on a not very soft water filled mattress. Thermostatic control of temperature, safety interfaces to avoid all possibility of electric shock, waterproof box to make a leak no more important than a leaky hot water bottle rather than a domestic disaster, calculation of floor loads (important!), internal rubber mattress and lighting, reading, and eating arrangements—an attempt to design the perfect hospital bed by one who had spent too damn much time in hospital beds.}}

Heinlein made no attempt to build his invention.

==The Hall waterbed==
The modern waterbed was created by [[Charles Prior Hall]] in 1968, while he was a design student at [[San Francisco State University]] in [[California]].  Hall originally wanted to make an innovative chair. His first prototype was a vinyl bag with 300 pounds (136&amp;nbsp;kg) of cornstarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Modern Living: The Waves of Morpheus |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902716,00.html |work=Time |accessdate=3 June 2012 |date=7 September 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, he abandoned working on a chair, and settled on perfecting a bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who Made That Water Bed? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/who-made-that-water-bed.html |work=The New York Times Magazine |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall was granted a patent on his waterbed, (#3,585,356) which he originally called "liquid support for human bodies." The patent came to trial in 1991 in ''Intex v. Hall /wbx''. The Patent was upheld in court and Hall received a $4.8 million judgment for infringement. In 1971, he founded Innerspace Environments, a manufacturing and sales company which became the leading retailer of waterbeds in the United States, with 30 owned-and-operated stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Prior Hall and WBX Partners, Plaintiffs-appellants, v.

Some later lawsuits were dismissed because of laches.

Sales peaked in 1987 at 22% of the domestic mattress industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=For Water Bed Holdout, California Dreaming |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/14/garden/for-water-bed-holdout-california-dreaming.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=3 June 2012 |author=Allen Salkin |date=14 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the waterbed was initially advertised for offering "undisturbed sleep", Hall admitted that "[customers] bought it for the sensual or the sexual part of it" and the sexual association advertising was highly effective in the 1970s and early 1980s. Henry Petroski of Duke University said of the waterbed: "Not only was it the cool new gadget, but it emerged during a time when the culture embraced anything different, especially a product that embodied sexual liberation".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/08/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-sexy-icky-practical-waterbed/61426/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Regarding usage===
The waterbed can be useful and comfortable for some and dangerous for others. The main feature of the waterbed found attractive is its form-fitting, pressure-minimizing nature. Not only is this a boon to those seeking mere comfort, but the removal of pressure from the [[Vertebral column|spine]] can provide relief to those with back pain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlywaterbeds.com/Mattresses_and_chronic_lower_back_pain.pdf "Mattresses and chronic lower back pain - Undergraduate research project at the Institute of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics"]. University of Southern Denmark, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the distribution of weight can prevent [[bedsores]] among the paralytic and the comatose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bedsores (pressure sores) |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bedsores/DS00570/DSECTION=prevention |work=Mayo Clinic |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=3 June 2012 |author=Mayo Clinic Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Perali |title=Prevention of bedsores: water or air? |date=December 2005 |url=http://www.katedra.it/English/Publications/Bedsores.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] warns that the form-fitting nature of the water-bed poses a danger to infants, providing a possibility of asphyxiation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs_details.cfm?from=&amp;pubs_id=5794&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage of a waterbed is its easy cleaning. It is impossible for dirt and dead skin particles to penetrate the water mattress, which can then be wiped periodically with a cloth and vinyl cleaner. The cover over the mattress can be regularly washed—thus virtually eliminating [[house dust mite]]s in the bed. Dust mites can trigger [[asthma]], [[eczema]], and [[allergy|allergies]] in people sensitive to them.

===Regarding non-use===
First, since some hard-sided waterbeds are of different sizes than other mattresses, [[bed sheet]]s are harder to find and come in fewer varieties. Soft-sided mattresses are conventionally sized to avoid this problem.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Second, moving a waterbed is a more difficult process than moving a normal bed; the water must be drained and the frame disassembled, then the frame must be reassembled, the mattress refilled with water, and the water heated for a potentially long period to get the new water to the correct temperature. And heating the bed can be costly: a waterbed consumes between 300 and 1500 [[Kilowatt hour|kW·h]]/year (36-180 USD at 12c/kW·h, the US national average for residential energy), depending on the climate, bed size, and other factors. The energy usage can be decreased by about 60% with the use of a soft-sided waterbed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeenergy.org/archive/hem.dis.anl.gov/eehem/94/940911.html Waterbed Heating: Uncovering Energy Savings in the Bedroom] ''Home Energy Magazine'' Online September/October 1994. Retrieved December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The water itself can pose challenges: occasionally, water mattresses may leak. Plastic liners will reduce damage, but emptying, patching, refilling, and reheating it (and sleeping elsewhere until all this is completed) is an inconvenience.

====Contractual inconveniences====
There can be contractual inconveniences; many apartment leases and home insurance policies restrict the use of "water-filled furniture" due to concerns about water damage to the dwelling due to accidental leakage as well as the stress on the floor.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
