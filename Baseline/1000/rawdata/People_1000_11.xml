In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Amazons''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνες}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazónes}}'', singular {{lang|grc|Ἀμαζών}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazōn}}'') were a tribe of women warriors related to [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]. [[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresFamily.html Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, Book 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] place them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]],&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4110.htm Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 52]&lt;/ref&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mytilene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in [[Prometheus Bound]], places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

Notable queens of the Amazons are [[Penthesilea]], who participated in the [[Trojan War]], and her sister [[Hippolyta]], whose magical girdle, given to her by her father [[Ares]], was the object of one of the [[labours of Heracles]]. [[Diodorus]] mentions that the Amazons traveled from Libya under Queen [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Amazon warriors were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in [[amazonomachy|amazonomachies]] in classical art.

Archaeological discoveries of burial sites with female warriors on the Eurasian steppes suggest that the [[Scythian]] women may have inspired the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Worrall|title=Amazon Warriors Did Indeed Fight and Die Like Men|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141029-amazons-scythians-hunger-games-herodotus-ice-princess-tattoo-cannabis/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foreman|first1=Amanda|title=The Amazon Women: Is There Any Truth Behind the Myth?|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/amazon-women-there-any-truth-behind-myth-180950188/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[early modern period]], their name has become a term for female warriors in general. Amazons were said to have founded the cities and temples of Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, Magnesia, Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons also invented the [[cavalry]].&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria| last2=Chesler| first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title= Wonder Woman | publisher= Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn = 0-03-005376-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palaephatus]], who was trying to rationalize the Greek myths in his work ''On Unbelievable Tales'' or ''On Incredible Tales'' ({{lang-grc|Περὶ ἀπίστων ἱστοριῶν}}), stated that the Amazons most probably were men mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards, and also, since they did not exist during his time, most probably they did nοt exist in the past either.&lt;ref&gt;Palaephatus On Unbelievable Tales&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t4EfiGQwgh4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Unbelievable Tales, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]] ''*ha-mazan-'' "warriors", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s gloss {{lang|grc|"ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι"}} ("''{{transl|grc|hamazakaran}}'': 'to make war' in Persian"), where it appears together with the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] root ''*kar-'' "make" (from which [[Sanskrit]] ''[[karma]]'' is also derived).&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, ''Xenia Lidéniana'' (1912), 270ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]], ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'' (1960–1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be derived from ''{{PIE|*ṇ-mṇ-gw-jon-es}}'' "manless, without husbands" ([[privative a|''a-'' privative]] and a derivation of ''[[Man (word)|*man-]]'' also found in Slavic ''muzh'') has been proposed, an explanation deemed "unlikely" by [[Hjalmar Frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsohn, [[Kuhns Zeitschrift|KZ]] 54, 278ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1960–1970).&lt;/ref&gt; 19th-century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym [[Amazigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cadogan Rothery, ''The Amazons'' (1910), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/ama/ama08.htm ch. 7]: "There have been some authors who trace the word Amazon from this term."&lt;/ref&gt; A further explanation proposes Iranian *''ama-janah'' "virility-killing" as source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinge|2005|pp=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The Hittite researcher Friedrich Cornelius assumes that there had been the land Azzi with the capital Chajasa in the area of the Thermodon-Iris Delta on the coast of the Black Sea. He brings its residents in direct relation to the Amazons, namely based on its name (woman of the land Azzi = 'Am'+ 'Azzi' = Amazon) and its customs (matriarchal custom of promiscuous sexual intercourse, even with blood relatives).

Among Classical Greeks, ''amazon'' was given a [[False etymology|folk etymology]] as originating from ''{{transl|grc|a-}}'' ({{lang|grc|ἀ-}}) and ''{{transl|grc|mazos}}'' ({{lang|grc|μαζός}}), "without [[breast]]", connected with an [[etiology|etiological]] tradition once claimed by [[Justin (historian)|Marcus Justinus]] who alleged that Amazons had their right [[mastectomy|breast cut off]] or [[breast ironing|burnt out]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justinus']] "Historiae Phillippicae ex Trogo Pompeio", Liber II, 4: "Virgines (...) armis, equis, venationibus exercebant, inustis infantum dexterioribus mammis, ne sagittarum iactus impediantur; unde dictae Amazones." "They exercised the virgins on weapon-wielding, horse-riding and hunting, and burned the children's right breasts, so that arrow-throwing wouldn't be impeded; and for such reason, they were called Amazons."&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication of such a practice in ancient works of art,&lt;ref name=Mayor&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-amazons-lives--legends-of-warrior-women-across-the-ancient-world-by-adrienne-mayor-book-review-9799090.html|title=The Amazons: Lives &amp; Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World by Adrienne Mayor, book review|last=Haynes|first=Natalie|date=16 October 2014|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although one is frequently covered.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amazons|volume=1|pages=790–791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt; Adrienne Mayor suggests the origin of this myth was due to the word's etymology.&lt;ref name=Mayor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adrienne Mayor, Start the Week, Radio Four|date= 6 April 2015|time= 21:30 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05plghp|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greeks also used some [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktona}}'') ("killers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("against men") and Aeschylus, in his work ''Prometheus Bound'', used ''styganor'' ({{lang|grc|στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men").&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0009%3Acard%3D696 Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Amazon Anıtı (2).jpg|thumb|upleft|Amazons monument in [[Samsun]], [[Turkey]].]]

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] placed them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]] and [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]].&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Herodotus also mentions that some Amazons lived at Scythia because after the Greeks defeated the Amazons in battle, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them, then these Amazons landed at Scythian lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D110%3Asection%3D1 Herodotus Histories]&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo writes that the original home of the Amazons was in Themiscyra and the plains about Thermodon and the mountains that lie above them, but were later driven out of these places, and during his time they were said to live in the mountains above [[Caucasian Albania]] (not to be confused with the modern [[Albania]]), but he also states that some others, among them [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], say that after Themiscyra, the Amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the Gargarians, in the northerly foothills of those parts of the [[Caucasian Mountains]] which are called Ceraunian.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/11E*.html STRABO, GEOGRAPHY, Book XI, Chapter 5] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mitylene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt; According to [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], the Amazons lived in and about the Tanais ({{lang-grc-gre|Τάναϊς}}) river (modern [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]]), formerly called the Amazonian or Amazon ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνιος}}) river, because the Amazons bathed themselves therein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0400%3Achapter%3D14 Pseudo-Plutarch-XIV, TANAIS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Amazons later moved to [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]] (speculated to be modern [[Terme]], though no ruins exist) on the River [[Thermodon]] (the Terme river in northern Turkey).
[[Plutarch]] mentions that the campaign(s) of [[Heracles]] and [[Theseus]] against the Amazons was at [[Euxine Sea]] (modern Black Sea).&lt;ref name="uchicago2"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/theseus*.html Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Theseus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

The Amazons were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], [[Myrina (Aeolis)|Myrina]], [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], [[Paphos]], [[Mitylene]].&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; At [[Patmos]] there was a place called Amazonium.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stadiasm.

Hoffmann&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on the island of [[Lemnos]], there was another Myrina.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; The cities of Myrina had this name after the amazon [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that at Thermodon the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==

Greeks also used other [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktonα}}'') ("killers/slayers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("equivalent to men") and Aeschylus used the ''Styganor'' ({{lang|grc|Στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men")&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; in his work [[Prometheus Bound]].

[[Herodotus]] stated that in the Scythian language they were called ''Oiorpata'', ''oior'' meaning "man", and ''pata'' meaning "to slay".&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

==Mythology==
In some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Strabo]], giving credits to [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], mentions that at his time the Amazons were believed to live on the borders of the [[Gargareans]]. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargarean to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt; He also stated that the Gargareans went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
In addition, he states that the right breasts of all Amazons are seared when they are infants, so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose, and especially that of throwing the javelin and use the bow.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
[[File:Otto van Veen - Amazons and Scythians.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Amazons and Scythians'' by [[Otto van Veen]]]]

Herodotus mentions that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

The King [[Iobates]] sent [[Bellerophon]] against Amazons, hoping that they would kill him, but Bellerophon killed them all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' vi. 186, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] ''On [[Lycophron]]'' 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D13 Pindar, Olympian 13:89]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons appear in [[Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] and in connection with several Greek legends. The tomb of [[Myrine]] is mentioned in the ''Iliad''; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book ii.45-46; book iii.52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diodorus, the Amazons under the rule of Queen Myrina, invaded the lands of the [[Atlantis|Atlantians]]. Amazons defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, treated the captives savagely, killed all the men, led into slavery the children and women, and razed the city. When the terrible fate of the inhabitants of Cerne became known among the other Atlantians, they were struck with terror, surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them. Queen Myrina bearing herself honourably towards the Atlantians, established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of Cerne which had been razed; and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired. Atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours, and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation. Diodorus also mentions that the Amazons of Queen Myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes, from Libya, to protect themselves at battle. Later Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against the [[Gorgons]]. After the battle against the Gorgons, Myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs, which are called "Amazon Mounds" ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνων σωρούς}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[Labours of Hercules|tasks imposed upon Hercules]] by [[Eurystheus]] was to obtain possession of the [[girdle]] of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' iv. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] xi. 244&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' 26-28&lt;/ref&gt; in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]]. 
In another version of this myth, Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;
The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], in marble [[bas-relief]]s such as from the [[Parthenon]] or the sculptures of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]].
[[File:Johann Georg Platzer - Thalestris im Lager Alexander des Großen.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''[[Thalestris]], Queen of the Amazons, visits [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]]]

[[Plutarch]], in his work [[Parallel Lives]]-The Life of Theseus, mentions that Bion said that the Amazons, were naturally friendly to men, and did not fly from Theseus when he touched upon their coasts.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;

Amazons attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' iii. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]] "of [[Thrace|Thracian]] birth", who was slain by [[Achilles]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad''. The epic, by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], is lost: only references to it survive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] i. 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]] ii.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 490&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 11. § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]] ''Her.'' xix. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Dionysus]] and his entourage fought the amazons at [[Ephesus]], the Amazons fled to [[Samos]], but Dionysus pursued them and at Samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema ({{lang|grc|Πάναιμα}}), which means blood-soaked field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rboWBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0216%3Asection%3D56 Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae, Question 56]&lt;/ref&gt; In another myth Dionysus united with the Amazons to fight against [[Cronus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html DIODORUS SICULUS LIBRARY OF HISTORY, Book III, 74]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]]. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

They are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen [[Thalestris]] visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Greek [[Alexander Romance]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander3c.html#25 3.25-26]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded [[secondary source]], [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said "And where was I, then?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html#46 Chapter 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman writer [[Virgil]]'s characterization of the [[Volsci]]an warrior maiden [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.

[[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' ({{circa|560}}), purporting to give the earliest history of the [[Goths]], relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], originally dwelt within Scythia, on the [[Sea of Azov]] between the [[Dnieper]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]]. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh [[Vesosis]], the women formed their own army under [[Marpesia]] and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister [[Lampedo]] remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis|Aeolia]], holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.

In the Grottaferrata Version of ''[[Digenes Akritas]]'', the twelfth century medieval epic of Basil, the Greek-Syrian knight of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier, the hero battles with and kills the female warrior Maximo.

* She was descended from some Amazons.
* Taken by Alexander from the Brahmans.&lt;ref&gt;''Digenis Akritas: the Two-Blood Border Lord'', translated by Denison B. Hull, 1972, Ohio University Press, G-vi, 385-387, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.
* [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' I&lt;/ref&gt; lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: "Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, and [[Antandre]], and [[Bremusa]], [[Hippothoe]], dark-eyed Harmothoe, [[Alcibie]], Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa glorying with the spear."
* [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' IV. 16&lt;/ref&gt; lists twelve Amazons who challenged Heracles to single combat during his quest for Hippolyta's girdle and died against him one by one: [[Aella (Amazon)|Aella]], Philippis, Prothoe, Eriboea, [[Celaeno]], Eurybia, [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], Deianeira, [[Asteria (mythology)|Asteria]], Marpe, Tecmessa, Alcippe. After Alcippe's death, a group attack followed. Diodorus also mentions [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]] as a queen of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another list of Amazons' names is found in [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 163&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Hippolyta]], [[Otrera]], [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]] and [[Penthesilea]], it attests the following names: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, [[Hippothoe]], Laomache, [[Glauce]], [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]], Theseis, Clymene, Polydora.
* Yet another different set of names is found in [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ValeriusFlaccus1.html Argonautica]'', 6. 370-377&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions Euryale, Harpe, Lyce, Menippe and Thoe. Of these Lyce also appears in a fragment preserved in the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' where she is said to have killed the hero Clonus of [[Moesia]], son of Doryclus, with her javelin.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology" /&gt;
* [[John Tzetzes]] in ''Posthomerica''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Posthomerica'', 176-183&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the Amazons who fell at [[Troy]]: Hippothoe, Antianeira, Toxophone, Toxoanassa, Gortyessa, Iodoce, Pharetre, Andro, Ioxeia, Oïstrophe, Androdaïxa, Aspidocharme, Enchesimargos, Cnemis, Thorece, Chalcaor, Eurylophe, Hecate, Anchimache, Andromache the queen. Concerning Antianeira and Andromache, see below; for almost all the other names on the list, this is a unique attestation.
* [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] provides an alternate list of the Amazons who fell against Heracles, describing them as "the most prominent" of their people: Tralla, Isocrateia, Thiba, Palla, Coea (Koia), Coenia (Koinia).&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Thibaïs''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] gives the same list minus the last two names.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on [[Dionysius Periegetes]], 828&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stephanus and Eustathius write of these Amazons in connection with the placename Thibais, which they report to have been derived from Thiba's name.

Other names of Amazons from various sources include:

* [[Aegea]], queen of the Amazons who was thought by some to have been the [[eponym]] of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], s. v. ''Aegeum Mare''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainia, presumably accompanied [[Penthesilea]] to the [[Trojan War]], killed by [[Achilles]]; known only from an Attic terracotta relief fragment.&lt;ref&gt;New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 42.11.33, c. 600. ''LIMC'', "Achilleus" no. 720*.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainippe, an Amazon who confronted [[Telamon]] in the battle against Heracles' troops.&lt;ref name="Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora" /&gt;
* Alce, who was said to have killed the young Oebalus of [[Arcadia]], son of Ida (otherwise unknown), with her spear during the Parthian War.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology"&gt;''[[Latin Anthology]]'', 392 (''Traiani Imperatoris e Bello Parthico versus decori''), ed. Riese&lt;/ref&gt;
* Amastris, who was believed to be the [[eponym]] of the city previously known as Kromna,&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] in [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Amastris&lt;/ref&gt; although the city was actually named after the historical [[Amastrine|Amastris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geography'', 12. 3. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anaea, an Amazon whose tomb was shown at the island of [[Samos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Anaia&lt;/ref&gt;
* Andromache, an Amazon who fought Heracles and was defeated; only known from vase paintings.&lt;ref name="Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Boston%2098.916&amp;object=Vase |title=Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date=1990-01-24 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=Perseus:image:1990.24.0349|title=Perseus:image:1990.24.0349|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Andromache]], wife of [[Hector]].

* Clete, one of the twelve followers of Penthesilea. After Penthesilea's death she, in accord with the former's will, sailed off and eventually landed in Italy, founding the city of [[Clete]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 995&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cyme, who gave her name to the city of [[Cyme (Aeolis)]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. Kyme&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diodorus Siculus, ''Library of History'', 3. 55" /&gt;

''Kynna''. Stephanus does not write out the Amazon's name, simply stating that the town Cynna could have been named "after one of the Amazons".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ephesos, a [[Lydia]]n Amazon, after whom the city of [[Ephesus]] was thought to have been named; she was also said to have been the first to honor [[Artemis]] and to have surnamed the goddess ''Ephesia''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'' 402. 8, under ''Ephesos''&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Amazo was thought of as the eponym of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v.

===Hero cults===
According to ancient sources ([[Plutarch]], [[Theseus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:BiDerPMT15YJ:classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html+Amazon+statues+in+Scotussa&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4 |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; Theseus by Plutarch |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in [[Megara]], [[Athens]], [[Chaeronea]], [[Chalcis]], [[Thessaly]] at [[Skotousa]], in [[Cynoscephalae (Thessaly)|Cynoscephalae]], and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], quoting [[Ephorus]], mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea ({{lang|grc|Ἀναία}}) was at the city of [[Söke|Anaea]] ({{lang|grc|Ἄναια}}), which also has this name after the amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mary Bennett| first = Florence | title = Religious Cults Associated With the Amazons| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm| publisher = Forgotten Books |date= December 2007 | isbn = 978-1605063867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At both Chalcis and Athens, [[Plutarch]] tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. At the entrance of Athens there was a monument to the Amazon [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D2 Pausanias, Description of Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of [[Ephesus]] performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by [[Hippolyta]] and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of [[Artemis]], a ''bretas'' ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ({{floruit|{{circa|AD 160}}}}): ''Description of Greece'', Book I: Attica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/pausanias-bk1.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Pausanias: Description of Greece, Book I: Attica |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
[[File:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[female gladiator]]s with their names ''Amazonia and Achillea''.]]

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as – and often associated with – battles of Greeks and [[centaur]]s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess [[Athena]]. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the ''kidaris''. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
This depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia.&lt;ref name="amaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_amazon/clues.html |title=SECRETS OF THE DEAD . Amazon Warrior Women. Clues and Evidence |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazons were described by Herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The double-sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons.&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"/&gt; Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons ([[Amazonomachy]]) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the [[Temple of Apollo at Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the ''[[Stoa Poikile]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There were also three standard [[Amazon statue types]].

Later in the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], as Amazon myth evolved, artists started to depict warrior women in a new light. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] was often thought of as an Amazon-like warrior during her reign and was sometimes depicted as such.&lt;!-- really? Examples? --&gt; Though, as explained in ''Divinia Viagro'' by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright "has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty). She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the queen directly to an Amazon, and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Divina Virago": Queen Elizabeth as an Amazon|jstor = 4173965|journal = Studies in Philology|date = 1978-04-01|pages = 163–180|volume = 75|issue = 2|first = Winfried|last = Schleiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel]] depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also appear in the [[Rococo]] period in another painting titled ''Battle of the Amazons'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]. As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist [[Anselm Feuerbach]] painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = German masters of the nineteenth century : paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany / The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York :: Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|url = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71300|website = libmma.contentdm.oclc.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

==In historiography==
[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2552.jpg|thumbnail|Amazon in combat, infl. Polyclitus, Rome. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said Herodotus, "No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to Herodotus, the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century BC.

Hippocrates describes them as: "They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;query=Hipp.%20Aer.%2017&amp;getid=2|title=Perseus Under Philologic: Hipp. Aer. 17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Pliny the Elder]] records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the [[Terme River]] as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]], which Pliny locates near the Terme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]] VI.3.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], and retells their mythological story which includes [[Atlantis]] and Greek mythology.

Although Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of Pliny. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudian]]us). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance literature==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were so named by Western observers due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons]]

Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the [[Nhamundá River]], a tributary of the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' ("Brazil's legends and myths"), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amazônia'' in Portuguese, ''Amazonía'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ukert (1849), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:

{{quote|Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that realm is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the ''[[sagaris]]'', an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a "manly weapon" should have been invented by a "tribe of women", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' in "[[The Knight's Tale]]".

==Historical background==
[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, "Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience."&lt;ref&gt;P. Walcot, "Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence" ''Greece &amp; Rome''2nd Series 31.1 (April 1984, pp. 37-47) p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].

==Archaeology==
===Scythians and Sarmatians===
Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been "inspired by real warrior women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Lyn Webster Wilde, "Did the Amazons really exist?" '&amp;#39;Diotima'&amp;#39; |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgan]]s in southern Ukraine and Russia.
David Anthony notes, "About 20% of [[Scythians|Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] 'warrior graves' on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons."&lt;ref name="anthonyd"&gt;{{cite book| last = Anthony| first = David W.| title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World| url = https://books.google.com/?id=mTxQmQEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 0-691-05887-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|Mounted Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, {{circa}}420 BC]]
Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Diotima |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html "Warrior Women of Eurasia"], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.&lt;/ref&gt; giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales, the origin of the Amazon story had been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:

{{quote|While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;}}

===Minoan Crete===
[[File:Departure of the Amazons MET DP318355.jpg|thumb|''Departure of the Amazons'', by [[Claude Deruet]], 1620]]

When [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, "Herodotus and anthropology" in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt; placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres,&lt;ref&gt;(pp.&amp;nbsp;153 ff)&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. &lt;!--The following is a "hard sell" for an outdated idea: "The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's women has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture. Out of all the ancient civilizations which are so far known to archaeologists and historians the Minoans seem to fit most of the aspects that classical Greeks and later scholars have come to associate with the Amazonian culture."--&gt;

==Modern legacy==

[[Francisco de Orellana]] gave the [[Amazon river]] its name after reporting pitched battles with tribes of female warriors, whom he likened to the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Samsun]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] features a recently constructed "Amazon Village" museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism.&lt;ref name="todayszaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |title=Village of Amazons to be recreated in Samsun park - Today's Zaman, your gateway to Turkish daily news |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214800/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival is also held every year in the [[Terme]] district of [[Samsun Province]] to celebrate the Amazons.&lt;ref name="todayszaman" /&gt;

In Greece, female [[equestrians]] are also called "Amazons" ({{lang-el|Αμαζόνες}}).

Amazons became an important subject of the fine arts around 1900, especially in the work of the Munich painter and sculptor [[Franz Stuck]] (1863-1928). 

In Nazi-Germany open air events called "Nacht der Amazonen" ([[Night of the Amazons]]) were performed at [[Nymphenburg Palace]] in [[Munich]] between 1936 and 1939. These revues with bare-breasted girls presented an allegedly emancipated female role as part of the „new race“ intended to be realized by racial fanatics.

'''Amedy Coulibaly''' ({{IPA-fr|amɛdi kulibali}}; 27 February 1982 – 9 January 2015) was a [[Malians in France|Malian-French]] man who was the prime suspect in the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|Montrouge shooting]], in which [[Municipal Police (France)|municipal police]] officer Clarissa Jean-Philippe was shot and killed, and was the hostage-taker and gunman in the [[Hypercacher Kosher Supermarket siege]], in which he killed four hostages before being killed by police.

He was a close friend of [[Charlie Hebdo shooting#Ch.C3.A9rif and Sa.C3.AFd Kouachi|Saïd and Chérif Kouachi]], the gunmen in the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]], to which Coulibaly's shootings were connected.  He said he synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/video-appears-to-show-paris-kosher-grocery-attack-suspect-coulibaly-swearing-allegiance-to-islamic-state-1420977506|title=Islamic State Releases Video Calling Grocery Store Gunman Its ‘Soldier’|author=David Gauthier-Villars in Paris, Asa Fitch in Dubai and Raja Abdulrahim in Beirut|date=12 January 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/01/09/fusillade-de-montrouge-suspect-identifie-deux-nouvelles-interpellations_4552503_3224.html Le suspect de Montrouge, Amedy Coulibaly, était bien le tireur de Vincennes], ''Le Monde'' (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; Coulibaly had pledged allegiance to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref name="janeonyanga-omara,usatoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/01/11/video-gunman-islamic-state/21589723/|title=Video shows Paris gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State|author=Jane Onyanga-Omara|date=11 January 2015|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, [[Hayat Boumeddiene]], is currently being sought by French police as a suspected accomplice of Coulibaly, alleged to have helped him commit his attacks. She arrived in Turkey five days before the attacks.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic State magazine interviews Hayat Boumeddiene|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/islamic-state-magazine-interviews-hayat-boumeddiene|website=Guardian.com|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been described by newspapers as "France's most wanted woman". She was last tracked on 10 January 2015 to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]-controlled border town of [[Tell Abyad]] in Syria.

==Early life==
[[File:GrandeBornePlaineCentrale.jpg|thumb|left|260px| Coulibaly grew up on [[La Grande Borne]] housing estate.]]

There, after the attacks, police discovered automatic weapons, a grenade launcher, smoke grenades and bombs, handguns, industrial explosives, and flags of the Islamic State.&lt;ref name=video/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30832444|title=Paris attacks: Investigators turn up new leads|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kptv.com/story/27852855/paris-gunmans-safe-house-could-hold-clues-to-4th-attacker "Paris gunman's safe house could hold clues to 4th-attacker"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120134326/http://www.kptv.com/story/27852855/paris-gunmans-safe-house-could-hold-clues-to-4th-attacker |date=20 January 2015 }}, Fox 12 Oregon&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shootings on 7–9 January 2015==
{{See also|Hypercacher Kosher Supermarket siege|January 2015 Île-de-France attacks#Fontenay-aux-Roses and Montrouge shootings}}
Coulibaly is said to be responsible for three shootings, and he said he synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt; In the shootings, five people were killed and eleven others were wounded.

The first shooting was of a jogger who was wounded on the evening of 7 January in [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]]. Shell casings found at the scene were later linked to the weapon carried by Coulibaly in his kosher supermarket attack.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt;

The second shooting occurred in [[Montrouge]] on 8 January. Clarissa Jean-Philippe, an unarmed French policewoman, was killed, and a street sweeper was critically injured. DNA found at the scene was a match to Coulibaly.&lt;ref name="coloradonewsday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diondassanayake"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/551314/Jewish-supermarket-siege-Paris-hero-hostage-tried-to-shot-Amedy-Coulibaly|title=Jewish supermarket siege: Heroic hostage executed after trying to turn weapon on gunman |author=Dion Dassanayake|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third shooting took place at [[Porte de Vincennes]], east Paris, on 9 January. Coulibaly killed four more people, all Jewish patrons at a Jewish [[Hypercacher]] supermarket at Porte de Vincennes, at the outset of an hours-long siege in which he demanded that the Kouachi brothers be freed.&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/01/11/french-authorities-hunt-most-wanted-woman-in-france-fears-new-terror-attack/|title=France's most wanted woman may have traveled to Syria, reports say|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBClive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-30722098|title=Charlie Hebdo attack: Manhunt – live reporting|publisher=BBC News|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.636178|title=Paris shooting updates / Charlie Hebdo attackers take hostage after car chase|date=9 January 2015|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/01/11/ce-que-l-on-sait-de-l-agression-d-un-joggeur-a-fontenay-aux-roses_4553732_3224.html Ce que l'on sait de l'agression d'un joggeur à Fontenay-aux-Roses] – ''Le Monde'' –  Emeline Cazi  – 11 January 2014 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/11/paris-gunman-amedy-coulibaly-allegiance-isis|title=Paris gunman Amedy Coulibaly declared allegiance to Isis|date=11 January 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset of that attack, he introduced himself to his hostages, saying: "I am Amedy Coulibaly, Malian and Muslim.

==Aftermath==
After [[Mali]] refused to accept Coulibaly's body for burial, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Muslim section of a cemetery in [[Thiais]].&lt;ref name="coloradonewsday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/01/23/terrorist-buried-near-paris-after-mali-rejects-corpse/|title=Terrorist buried near Paris after Mali rejects corpse|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, [[Hayat Boumeddiene]], is currently being sought by French police as a suspected accomplice of Coulibaly, alleged to have helped him commit his attacks. She arrived in Turkey five days before the attacks.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She has been described by newspapers as "France's most wanted woman". She was last tracked on 10 January 2015 to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]-controlled border town of [[Tell Abyad]] in Syria.

{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}
In [[Christian theology]] and [[ecclesiology]], the '''apostles''' ({{Lang-el|ἀπόστολος|lit=one who is sent away|translit=apóstolos}}), particularly the '''Twelve Apostles''' (also known as the '''Twelve Disciples''' or simply the '''Twelve'''),  were the primary [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of [[Jesus]], the central figure in [[Christianity]]. During the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life]] and [[ministry of Jesus]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century AD]], the apostles were his closest followers and became the primary teachers of [[the gospel]] message of Jesus. The word ''disciple'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''apostle''; for instance, the [[Gospel of John]] makes no distinction between the two terms.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In modern usage, prominent [[missionaries]] are often called apostles, a practice which stems from the [[Latin]] equivalent of ''apostle'', i.e. ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|missio}}}}'', the source of the [[English language|English]] word ''missionary''. For example, [[Saint Patrick]] (AD 373–463) was the "Apostle of Ireland", [[Saint Boniface]] (680–755) was the "Apostle to the [[German people|Germans]]", &lt;ref name="ODCC self" /&gt; [[José de Anchieta|Saint José de Anchieta]] (1534–1597) was the "Apostle of Brazil" and [[Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur|Saint Peter of Betancur]] (1626–1667) was the "Apostle of Guatemala".

While [[Christian tradition]] often refers to the apostles as being twelve in number, different [[Four Evangelists|gospel writers]] give different names for the same individual, and apostles mentioned in one [[gospel]] are not mentioned in others. The [[commissioning of the Twelve Apostles]] during the ministry of Jesus is recorded in the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. After his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], Jesus sent eleven of them (minus [[Judas Iscariot]], who by then had [[Judas Iscariot#Death|died]]) by the [[Great Commission]] to spread his teachings to all nations.  This event is commonly called the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]]. There is also an [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] tradition derived from the [[Gospel of Luke]] of there having been as many as [[Seventy disciples|70 apostles]] during the time of Jesus' ministry. Prominent figures in [[early Christianity]], notably [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], were often called apostles, even though their ministry or mission came after the life of Jesus.

The period of early Christianity during the lifetimes of the apostles is called the [[Apostolic Age]].&lt;ref name="ODCC self" /&gt; During the 1st century AD, the apostles established [[Local church|churches]] throughout the territories of the [[Roman Empire]] and, according to tradition, through the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and [[India]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Synaxis of the Twelve Apostles by Constantinople master (early 14th c., Pushkin museum).jpg|thumb|The [[Synaxis]] of the Twelve Apostles. Russian, 14th century, Moscow Museum.]]

The word "apostle" comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἀπόστολος}}}} (''apóstolos''), formed from the prefix {{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἀπό-}}}} (''apó-'', "from") and root {{lang|grc|{{linktext|στέλλω}}}} (''stéllō'', "I send", "I depart") and originally meaning "messenger, envoy". It has, however, a stronger sense than the word messenger, and is closer to a "delegate".&lt;ref name="Coppieters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Apostles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Bauer lexicon|Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament]]'' argues that its Christian use translated a [[Judaism|Jewish]] position known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as the ''sheliach'' ({{lang|he|{{linktext|שליח}}}}). This ecclesiastical meaning of the word was later translated into [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|missio}}}}'', the source of the English "[[missionary]]".

==Background==
In the New Testament, the majority of the apostles have [[Hebrew name]]s, although some have [[Greek name]]s. Many Jews at the time had Latin or Greek names as well as Hebrew names.&lt;ref&gt;As was not uncommon for Jews at the time, some of them had two names, one Hebrew/Aramaic and the other Greek. Hence the lists of Jesus' twelve apostles contains 14 names not 12; the 4 [[Greek language|Greek]] names are [[Andrew]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], [[Thaddaeus]] and [[Lebbaeus]]. Reference: [[John P. Meier]]'s [[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew|''A Marginal Jew'']].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bibleref2|Mark|6:7–13}} states that Jesus initially sent out these twelve in pairs ([[cf.]] {{Bibleref2|Mt|10:5–42}}, {{Bibleref2|Lk|9:1–6}}) to towns in [[Galilee]]. The text states that their initial instructions were to [[Faith healing|heal the sick]] and [[Exorcism#Jesus|drive out demons]].&lt;ref name="Coppieters" /&gt; They are also instructed to "take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse, but to wear sandals, and not put on two [[tunic]]s", and that if any town rejects them they ought to shake the dust off their feet as they leave, a gesture which some scholars think was meant as a contemptuous threat (Miller 26).{{incomplete citation|date= November 2018}} Their carrying of just a staff (Matthew and Luke say not even a staff) is sometimes given as the reason for the use by Christian [[bishop]]s of a [[Crosier|staff of office]] in those denominations that believe they maintain an [[apostolic succession]].

Later in the Gospel narratives the twelve apostles are described as [[Great Commission|having been commissioned to preach]] the Gospel to "all the nations",&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Mt|28:19}}, {{Bibleref2|Mk|13:10}}, and {{Bibleref2-nb|Mk|16:15}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of whether Jew or Gentile.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. also {{Bibleref2|Acts|15:1–31}}, {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2:7–9}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:4–8}}, and {{Bibleref2|Acts|10:1–11:18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul emphasized the important role of the apostles in the church of God when he said that the household of God is "built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone".{{Bibleref2c|Ephesians|2:19–20}}
{{anchor|The twelve apostles}}

Although not one of the apostles commissioned during the life of Jesus, Paul, a [[Jews|Jew]] named Saul of Tarsus, claimed a special commission from the [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|risen Jesus]] and is considered "the apostle of the [[Gentiles]]",{{Bibleref2c|Romans|11:13|9}} for his missions to spread the gospel message after [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|his conversion]]. In his writings, the [[Pauline epistles|epistles]] to Christian churches throughout the [[Levant]], Paul did not restrict the term "apostle" to the Twelve, and often refers to his mentor [[Barnabas]] as an apostle.&lt;ref name="ODCC self"&gt;"Apostle." Cross, F. L., ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-280290-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restricted usage appears in the [[Revelation to John]].&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 21:14.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century AD]], association with the apostles was esteemed as an evidence of authority. Churches which are believed to have been founded by one of the apostles are known as [[apostolic see]]s. Paul's epistles were accepted as [[Development of the New Testament canon|scripture]], and two of the four [[Biblical canon|canonical]] gospels were associated with apostles, as were other [[New Testament]] works. Various Christian texts, such as the ''[[Didache]]'' and the ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', were attributed to the apostles. [[Bishops]] traced their lines of succession back to individual apostles, who were said to have dispersed from Jerusalem and [[Early centers of Christianity|established churches]] across great territories. Christian bishops have traditionally claimed authority deriving, by [[apostolic succession]], from the Twelve.&lt;ref name="ODCC self" /&gt; Early [[Church Fathers]] who came to be associated with apostles, such as [[Pope Clement I]] with [[St. Peter]], are referred to as the [[Apostolic Fathers]]. The [[Apostles' Creed]], popular in the [[Western Christianity|West]], was said to have been composed by the apostles themselves.

==The Twelve Apostles==

===Calling by Jesus===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Exhortation to the Apostles (Recommandation aux apôtres) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|[[James Tissot]], ''The Exhortation to the Apostles''.]]
{{Main|Commissioning of the Twelve Apostles}}
The three Synoptic Gospels record the circumstances in which some of the disciples were recruited, Matthew only describing the recruitment of Simon, Andrew, James, and John. All three Synoptic Gospels state that these four were recruited fairly soon after Jesus returned from [[Temptation of Jesus|being tempted by the devil]].

Despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, they are all described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets to do so. Traditionally the immediacy of their consent was viewed as an example of divine power, although this statement is not made in the text itself. The alternative and much more ordinary solution is that Jesus was simply friends with the individuals beforehand, as implied by the Gospel of John, which states that  Peter (Simon) and Andrew were disciples of [[John the Baptist]], and started following Jesus as soon as [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus had been baptized]].

Albright and Mann extrapolate from Simon's and Andrew's abandonment of their nets that Matthew is emphasizing the importance of renunciation by converting to Christianity, since fishing was profitable, although required large start-up costs, and abandoning everything would have been an important sacrifice. Regardless, Simon and Andrew's abandonment of what were effectively their most important worldly possessions was taken as a model by later Christian [[ascetics]].

[[File:De zielenvisserij - Fishing for souls (Adriaen Pietersz. van de Venne).jpg|thumb|[[Adriaen van de Venne]]'s ''Fishers of Men''. Oil on panel, 1614]]
Matthew describes Jesus meeting James and John, also fishermen and brothers, very shortly after recruiting Simon and Andrew. Matthew and Mark identify James and John as sons of [[Zebedee]]. Luke adds to Matthew and Mark that James and John worked as a team with Simon and Andrew. Matthew states that at the time of the encounter, James and John were repairing their nets, but readily joined Jesus without hesitation.

This parallels the accounts of Mark and Luke, but Matthew implies that the men have also abandoned their father (since he is present in the ship they abandon behind them), and Carter feels this should be interpreted to mean that Matthew's view of Jesus is one of a figure rejecting the traditional patriarchal structure of society, where the father had command over his children; most scholars, however, just interpret it to mean that Matthew intended these two to be seen as even more devoted than the other pair.

The Synoptic Gospels go on to describe that much later, after Jesus had later begun [[Ministry of Jesus|his ministry]], he noticed, while teaching, a [[tax collector]] in his booth. The tax collector,  called Matthew in {{Bibleref2|Matthew |9:9}}, Levi in {{Bibleref2|Mark|2:14}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|5:27}}, is asked by Jesus to become one of his disciples. Matthew/Levi is stated to have accepted and then invited Jesus for a meal with his friends. Tax collectors were seen as [[villain]]s in Jewish society, and the [[Pharisees]] are described as asking Jesus why he is having a meal with such disreputable people. The reply Jesus gives to this is now well known: "it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the [[righteous]], but sinners".

===Replacement of Judas===
{{Main article|Saint Matthias}}
After Judas Iscariot betrayed Christ and then in guilt committed suicide before Christ's [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] (in one Gospel account), the apostles numbered eleven. When Jesus had been taken up from them, in preparation for the coming of the Holy Spirit that he had promised them, Peter advised the brethren:
{{quote|Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus... For he was numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry... For it is written in the book of Psalms, "Let his habitation be made desolate, Let no one dwell therein", and, "Let another take his office"...&amp;nbsp;So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day he was taken up from us, must become with us a witness to his resurrection|{{Bibleref2|Acts|1:15–26}}}}

So, between the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension of Christ]] and the day of [[Pentecost]], the remaining apostles elected a twelfth apostle by [[Sortition|casting lots]], a traditional Israelite way to determine the will of God (see {{Bibleref2|Proverbs|16:33}}). The lot fell upon [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/who-were-twelve-disciples#replace-judas |title= Who were the 12 disciples?  |accessdate= 2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul the Apostle in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], appears to give the first historical reference to the twelve apostles:
{{quote|For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.|{{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:3–8}}}}

===Paul, Apostle of the Gentiles===
{{Paul}}
{{Main article|Paul the Apostle}}
In his writings, [[Paul the Apostle]], although not one of the original twelve, described himself as an ''apostle'', one "born out of due time" (e.g., {{Bibleref2|Romans|1:1}}, 1 Corinthians 15:8 and other letters). He was called by the resurrected Jesus himself during his [[Road to Damascus]] vision and given the name "Paul".{{Bibleref2c|Acts|9:1–9}} With Barnabas, he was allotted the role of apostle in the church.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|13:2}} He referred to himself as the ''apostle of the Gentiles.''{{Bibleref2c|Rom|11:13|9}}

As the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' states, "It is at once evident that in a Christian sense, everyone who had received a mission from God, or Christ, to man could be called 'Apostle'"; thus extending the original sense beyond the twelve.&lt;ref name="Coppieters" /&gt;

Since Paul claimed to have received the gospel through a revelation of Jesus Christ&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{Bibleref2|Gal|1:12}}; {{Bibleref2|Acts|9:3–19}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|9:26–27}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|22:6–21}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|26:12–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the latter's death and [[resurrection]] (rather than before like the twelve), he was often obliged to defend his apostolic authority ({{Bibleref2|1Cor|9:1||1 Cor. 9:1 "Am I not an apostle?"}}) and proclaim that he had seen and was anointed by Jesus while on the road to Damascus.

James, Peter and John in Jerusalem accepted his calling to the apostleship from the Lord to the [[Gentiles]] (specifically those not [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]]) as of equal authority as Peter's to the [[Jew]]s (specifically those circumcised) according to Paul.{{Bibleref2c|Gal|2:7–9}} "James, Peter and John, those reputed to be pillars&amp;nbsp;... agreed that we [Paul and Barnabas] should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews."{{Bibleref2c|Gal|2:9}}

Paul, despite his divine calling as an apostle, considered himself perhaps inferior to the other apostles because he had originally persecuted Christ's followers.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|15:9||1 Cor. 15:9}} In addition, despite the [[Matthew 10|Little Commission of Matthew 10]], the twelve did not limit their mission to solely Jews as [[Cornelius the Centurion]] is widely considered the first Gentile convert and he was converted by Peter, and the [[Great Commission]] of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrected Jesus]] is specifically to "all nations".

===Deaths===

Of the twelve Apostles to hold the title after Matthias' selection, Christian tradition has generally passed down that all but one were martyred, with [[John the Evangelist|John]] surviving into old age.

{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:5}} says that Judas Iscariot threw the silver he received for betraying Jesus down in the Temple, then went and hanged himself. {{bibleref2|Acts|1:18}} says that he purchased a field, then "falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out".

According to the 18th-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]], early Christians (second half of the second century and first half of the third century) believed that only Peter, Paul, and James, son of Zebedee, were martyred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|author-link1=Edward Gibbon|year=1826|chapter=Chapter XVI.

===List of the Twelve Apostles as identified by the Bible===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 15464 Jesus and the 12 apostles in Domus Galileae.JPG|thumb|Jesus and the 12 apostles in [[Domus Galilaeae]], [[Israel]].]]
Each of the four listings of apostles in the New Testament ({{Bibleref2|Mark|3:13–19|9}}, {{Bibleref2|Matthew|10:1–4|9}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|6:12–16|9}}, and {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:13|9}}) indicate that all the apostles were men. The [[canonical gospels]] and the book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] give varying names of the twelve apostles. The list in the [[Gospel of Luke]] differs from Matthew and Mark at two points. It lists "Judas the son of James" instead of "Thaddeus". (For more information, see [[Jude the Apostle]].) Unlike the Synoptic Gospels, the [[Gospel of John]] does not offer a formal list of apostles. Although it refers to "the Twelve" ({{Bibleref2|John|6:67–71|9}}), the gospel does not present any elaboration of who these twelve actually were, and the author of the Gospel of John does not mention them all by name. There is also no separation of the terms "apostles" and "disciples" in John.

| [[Andronicus of Pannonia|Andronicus]] and [[Junia (New Testament person)|Junia]] || {{Bibleref2|Rom|16:7}} || Paul states that Andronicus and Junia were "of note among the apostles." This has been traditionally interpreted in one of two ways:
* That Andronicus and Junia were "of note among the apostles," that is, distinguished apostles.&lt;ref name="May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That Andronicus and Junia were "well known ''among'' the apostles" meaning "well known ''to'' the apostles"
If the first view is correct then Paul may be referring to a female apostle&lt;ref&gt;Crossan, J. D. and Reed, J. L., ''In Search of Paul'', Harper San Francisco (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;115–116. {{ISBN|978-0-06-051457-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2006"&gt;Ehrman, Bart. ''Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend''. Oxford University Press, US. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-19-530013-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; - the Greek name (Iounian) is in the accusative and could be either Junia (a woman) or Junias (a man)&lt;ref name="CBMW"&gt;CBMW [https://cbmw.org/uncategorized/a-female-apostle/ "A Female Apostle?"], June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. Later manuscripts add accents to make it unambiguously Junias, however while "Junia" was a common name, "Junias" was not&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2006" /&gt;, and both options are favoured by different Bible translations.

In the second view, it is believed that Paul is simply making mention of the outstanding character of these two people which was acknowledged by the apostles.

Historically it has been virtually impossible to tell which of the two views were correct. The second view, in recent years, has been defended from a scholarly perspective by Daniel Wallace and Michael Burer.&lt;ref&gt;See Daniel B. Wallace and Michael H. Burer, "Was Junia Really an Apostle?" NTS 47 (2001): 76–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women who followed Jesus===
In Luke (10:38–42), [[Mary, sister of Lazarus]], is contrasted with her sister [[Martha]], who was "cumbered about many things" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen "the better part," that of listening to the master's discourse.  John names her as the "one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair" (11:2).  In Luke, an unidentified "sinner" in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus' feet.  In Medieval Catholic folklore, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, was seen as the same as Mary Magdalene.

Luke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve.  From among them he names three women: "[[Mary Magdalene|Mary, called Magdalene]], ... and [[Saint Joanna|Joanna]] the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]], and many others, who provided for them out of their resources" (Luke 8:2-3).  Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus' body in Luke's account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the "two men in dazzling clothes".  Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve.  More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers.  There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her.

Other gospel writers differ as to which women witness the [[crucifixion]] and witness to the [[resurrection]].  Mark includes [[Mary Jacobe|Mary, the mother of James]] and [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]] (not to be confused with [[Salome|Salomé]] the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb.  John includes [[Mary, the wife of Cleopas|Mary the wife of Clopas]] at the crucifixion.

===The Seventy disciples===
{{main|Seventy disciples}}

The "seventy disciples" or "seventy-two disciples" (known in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] traditions as the "Seventy Apostles") were early emissaries of [[Jesus]] mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|10:1–24}}. According to Luke, the only [[gospel]] in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.

In [[Western Christianity]], they are usually referred to as [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Disciple]: "The disciples, in this disciples, in this context, are not the crowds of believers who flocked around Christ, but a smaller body of His followers. They are commonly identified with the seventy-two (seventy, according to the received Greek text, although several Greek manuscripts mention seventy-two, as does the Vulgate) referred to (Luke 10:1) as having been chosen by Jesus. The names of these disciples are given in several lists (Chronicon Paschale, and Pseudo-Dorotheus in Migne, P.G., XCII, 521-524; 543-545; 1061–1065); but these lists are unfortunately worthless."&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=100017|title=Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles|work=oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the original [[Greek language|Greek words]], both titles are descriptive, as an ''apostle'' is one sent on a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] (the Greek uses the verb form: ''apesteilen'') whereas a ''disciple'' is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words ''apostle'' and ''disciple''.

===Authorship of the Gospels===
{{main|Gospel|Synoptic Gospels}}
{{Also|Authorship of the Bible#Table IV: New Testament}}
{{off topic section}}
The [[Gospel of Matthew]] is anonymous: the author is not named within the text, and the superscription "according to Matthew" was added some time in the 2nd century.{{sfn|Harrington|1991|p=8}}{{Incomplete short citation}}{{sfn|Nolland|2005|p=16}}{{Incomplete short citation}} The tradition that the author was [[Matthew the Apostle]] begins with [[Papias of Hierapolis]] (c.&amp;nbsp;AD 100–140), an early [[bishop]] and [[Apostolic Father]], who is cited by the [[Church historian]] [[Eusebius]] (AD 260–340), as follows: "Matthew collected the oracles [''[[logia]]'': sayings of or about Jesus] in the [[Hebrew language]] [''Hebraïdi dialektōi''], and each one interpreted [''hērmēneusen—''perhaps 'translated'] them as best he could."{{sfn|Turner|2008|pp=15–16}}{{Incomplete short citation}}&lt;ref group="Notes" name="Eusebius"&gt;Eusebius, "History of the Church" 3.39.14–17, c. 325 CE, Greek text 16: "ταῦτα μὲν οὖν ἱστόρηται τῷ Παπίᾳ περὶ τοῦ Μάρκου· περὶ δὲ τοῦ Ματθαῖου ταῦτ’ εἴρηται· Ματθαῖος μὲν οὖν Ἑβραΐδι διαλέκτῳ τὰ λόγια συνετάξατο, ἡρμήνευσεν δ’ αὐτὰ ὡς ἧν δυνατὸς ἕκαστος. Various English translations published, standard reference translation by [[Philip Schaff]] at [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.viii.xxxix.html CCEL]: "[C]oncerning Matthew he [Papias] writes as follows: 'So then(963) Matthew wrote the oracles in the Hebrew language, and every one interpreted them as he was able.'(964)" Online version includes footnotes 963 and 964 by Schaff.&lt;br&gt;[[Irenaeus]] (died c.&amp;nbsp;202 CE) makes a similar comment, possibly also drawing on Papias, in his ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.ii.html Book III, Chapter 1]: "Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect". See {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vRvCYSw4DIC|title=Irenaeus' Use of Matthew's Gospel in Adversus Haereses|last=Bingham|first=Dwight Jeffrey|publisher=Peeters Publishers|year=1998|isbn=9789068319644|series=''Traditio exegetica Graeca''|volume=7|location=[[Louvain, Belgium]]|pages=64ff|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Gospel of John]] is anonymous,{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=215}}{{Incomplete short citation}} Christian tradition historically has attributed it to [[John the Apostle]], son of [[Zebedee]] and one of Jesus' [[Twelve Apostles]]. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving [[Johannine epistles]] that commentators treat the four books,{{sfn|Lindars|1990|p=63}}{{Incomplete short citation}} along with the [[Book of Revelation]], as a single corpus of [[Johannine literature]], albeit not necessarily written by the same author.{{refn|group=Notes|{{harvnb|Harris|2006|p=479}}{{Incomplete short citation}}: "Most scholars believe that the same person wrote all three documents but that he is not to be identified with either the apostle John or the author of the Gospel."}}

The [[Gospel of Mark]] was written anonymously.{{sfn|Sanders|1995|pp=63–64}}{{Incomplete short citation}} Early Christian tradition, first attested by [[Papias of Hierapolis]], ascribes it to [[John Mark]], a companion and interpreter of the [[apostle Peter]].{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=155–56}}{{Incomplete short citation}} Hence its author is often called [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], even though most modern scholars are doubtful of the Markan tradition and instead regard the author as unknown.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=36}}{{Incomplete short citation}} It was probably written c. AD 66–70, during [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians in Rome or the Jewish revolt, as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution.{{sfn|Perkins|1998|p=241}}{{Incomplete short citation}} The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories (Mark 2:1–3:6), [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] discourse (4:1–35), and collections of sayings (although not the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and probably not the [[Q source]]).{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=13–14}}{{Incomplete short citation}}

According to Church tradition, [[Luke the Evangelist]], the companion of Paul, is believed to have authored the [[Gospel of Luke]], though anonymously written and lacking an author's name; but while this view is still occasionally put forward the scholarly consensus emphasises the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=32}}{{Incomplete short citation}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|pp=172, 235}}{{Incomplete short citation}} The most probable date for its composition is around 80–110 AD, and there is evidence that it was still being revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|pp=250–53}}{{Incomplete short citation}}

[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]] wrote [[Confessions (Augustine)|''Confessions'']], the first Western autobiography ever written, around 400. Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century.]]
An '''autobiography''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]], αὐτός-''autos'' self +  βίος-''bios'' life + γράφειν-''graphein'' to write) is a self-written account of the life of oneself. The word "autobiography" was first used deprecatingly by [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]] in 1797 in the [[English language|English]] [[Periodical publication|periodical]] ''The [[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'', when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as "pedantic". However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by [[Robert Southey]] in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity. Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that "[autobiography] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time".&lt;ref name=Pascal&gt;{{cite book|last = Pascal| first = Roy|title = Design and Truth in Autobiography|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1960 | location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] | pages = | url =| doi =| id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer's life from the moment of composition. While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints, autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory. The [[memoir]] form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends, as Pascal claims, to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer's review of his or her life.&lt;ref name=Pascal/&gt; 

''See also: [[List of autobiographies]] and [[:Category:Autobiographies]] for examples.''

== Biography ==
=== Life ===

Autobiographical works are by nature subjective. The inability—or unwillingness—of the author to accurately recall memories has in certain cases resulted in misleading or incorrect information. Some sociologists and psychologists have noted that autobiography offers the author the ability to recreate history.

=== Spiritual autobiography ===
Spiritual autobiography is an account of an author's struggle or journey towards God, followed by conversion a religious conversion, often interrupted by moments of regression. The author re-frames his or her life as a demonstration of divine intention through encounters with the Divine. The earliest example of a spiritual autobiography is Augustine's ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' though the tradition has expanded to include other religious traditions in works such as [[Zahid Rohari]]'s ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|An Autobiography]]'' and ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]''. The spiritual autobiography works as an endorsement of his or her religion.

=== Memoirs ===
{{Main article|Memoir}}

A memoir is slightly different in character from an autobiography. While an autobiography typically focuses on the "life and times" of the writer, a memoir has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish an account of their public exploits. One early example is that of [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', also known as ''Commentaries on the Gallic Wars''. In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the [[Gallic Wars]]. His second memoir, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' (or ''Commentaries on the Civil War'') is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in [[Caesar's civil war|the civil war]] against [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Gnaeus Pompeius]] and the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. 

[[Leonor López de Córdoba]] (1362–1420) wrote what is supposed to be the first autobiography in Spanish. The [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) provoked a number of examples of this genre, including works by Sir [[Edmund Ludlow]] and Sir [[Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet|John Reresby]]. French examples from the same period include the memoirs of [[Jean François Paul de Gondi, cardinal de Retz|Cardinal de Retz]] (1614–1679) and the [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]].

=== Fictional autobiography ===
The term "fictional autobiography" signifies novels about a fictional character written as though the character were writing their own autobiography, meaning that the character is the first-person narrator and that the novel addresses both internal and external experiences of the character. [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' is an early example. [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' is another such classic, and [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is a well-known modern example of fictional autobiography. [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' is yet another example of fictional autobiography, as noted on the front page of the original version. The term may also apply to works of fiction purporting to be autobiographies of real characters, e.g., [[Robert Nye]]'s ''Memoirs of [[Lord Byron]]''.

== Autobiography through the ages ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}

=== The classical period: Apologia, oration, confession ===

In antiquity such works were typically entitled ''[[wikt:apology|apologia]],'' purporting to be self-justification rather than self-documentation. [[John Henry Newman]]'s Christian confessional work (first published in 1864) is entitled ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' in reference to this tradition.

The Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] introduces his autobiography (''Josephi Vita'', c. 99) with self-praise, which is followed by a justification of his actions as a Jewish rebel commander of Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mason, Flavius Josephus: Translation and Commentary. Life of Josephus : translation and commentary, Volume 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Rhetoric|rhetor]] [[Libanius]] (c. 314–394) framed his life memoir (''Oration I'' begun in 374) as one of his [[Public speaking|orations]], not of a public kind, but of a literary kind that could not be aloud in privacy.

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354–430) applied the title ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' to his autobiographical work, and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] used the same title in the 18th century,  initiating the chain of confessional and sometimes racy and highly self-critical, autobiographies of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era and beyond.  Augustine's was arguably the first Western autobiography ever written, and became an influential model for Christian writers throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. It tells of the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle Augustine lived for a time within his youth, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits; his following and leaving of the anti-sex and anti-marriage [[Manichaeism]] in attempts to seek sexual morality; and his subsequent return to [[Christianity]] due to his embracement of [[philosophical scepticism|Skepticism]] and the [[New Academy]] movement (developing the view that sex is good, and that virginity is better, comparing the former to silver and the latter to gold; Augustine's views subsequently strongly influenced Western theology&lt;ref&gt;Fiorenza and Galvin (1991), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;). ''Confessions'' will always rank among the great masterpieces of western literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=Henry|title=Confessions|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199537822|pages=4 (ix)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spirit of Augustine's ''Confessions'' is the 12th-century ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'' of [[Peter Abelard]], outstanding as an autobiographical document of its period.

=== Early autobiographies ===

[[File:Baburnama.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from the ''[[Baburnama]]'']]

In the 15th century, [[Leonor López de Córdoba]], a Spanish noblewoman, wrote her ''Memorias'', which may be the first autobiography in [[Spanish language|Castillian]].

[[Babur|Zāhir ud-Dīn Mohammad Bābur]], who founded the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal dynasty]] of [[South Asia]] kept a journal ''[[Baburnama|Bāburnāma]]'' ([[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]/{{lang-fa|بابر نامہ}}; literally: ''"Book of Babur"'' or ''"Letters of Babur"'') which was written between 1493 and 1529.

One of the first great autobiographies of the [[Renaissance]] is that of the sculptor and goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500–1571), written between 1556 and 1558, and entitled by him simply ''Vita'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Life''). He declares at the start: "No matter what sort he is, everyone who has to his credit what are or really seem great achievements, if he cares for truth and goodness, ought to write the story of his own life in his own hand; but no one should venture on such a splendid undertaking before he is over forty."&lt;ref&gt;Benvenuto Cellini, tr. George Bull, ''The Autobiography'', London 1966 p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria for autobiography generally persisted until recent times, and most serious autobiographies of the next three hundred years conformed to them.

Another autobiography of the period is ''De vita propria'', by the Italian mathematician, physician and astrologer [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1574).

It is often claimed that the earliest known autobiography in English is the early 15th-century ''[[The Book of Margery Kempe|Book of Margery Kempe]]'', describing among other things [[Margery Kempe|Kempe's]] pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] and visit to [[Rome]] although it is, at best, only a partial autobiography and arguably more a memoir of religious experiences. The book remained in manuscript and was not published until 1936.

Possibly the first publicly available autobiography written in English was Captan John Smith's autobiography published in 1630 &lt;ref&gt;The True Travels, Adventures and Observations of Captain John Smith into Europe, Aisa, Africa and America from Anno Domini 1593 to 1629&lt;/ref&gt; which was regarded by many as not much more than a collection of tall tales told by someone of doubtful veracity. This changed with the publication of Philip Barbour's definitive biography in 1964 which, amongst other things, established independent factual bases for many of Smith's "tall tales", many of which could not have been known by Smith at the time of writing unless he was actually present at the events recounted. &lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Philip L (1964) The Three Worlds of Captain John Smith, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Other notable English autobiographies of the 17th century include those of [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Lord Herbert of Cherbury]] (1643, published 1764) and [[John Bunyan]] (''[[Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners]]'', 1666).

[[Jarena Lee]] (1783 – 1864), was the first African American woman to have a published biography in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Doers_of_the_Word.html?id=jrirQL5L0xgC|title=Doers of the Word: African-American Women Speakers and Writers in the North (1830-1880)|last=Peterson|first=Carla L.|date=1998|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813525143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
[[File:Memoirs of Franklin.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of the first English edition of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s autobiography, 1793]]
Following the trend of [[Romanticism]], which greatly emphasized the role and the nature of the individual, and in the footsteps of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'', a more intimate form of autobiography, exploring the subject's emotions, came into fashion. [[Stendhal]]'s autobiographical writings of the 1830s, ''[[The Life of Henry Brulard]]'' and ''[[Memoirs of an Egotist]]'', are both avowedly influenced by Rousseau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Stendhal|last=Wood|first=Michael|date=1971|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0801491245|location=Ithaca, NY|page=97}}&lt;!--|access-date=July 21, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An English example is [[William Hazlitt]]'s ''Liber Amoris'' (1823), a painful examination of the writer's love-life.

With the rise of education, cheap newspapers and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop, and the beneficiaries of this were not slow to cash in on this by producing autobiographies. It became the expectation—rather than the exception—that those in the public eye should write about themselves—not only writers such as [[Charles Dickens]] (who also incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and [[Anthony Trollope]], but also politicians (e.g. [[Henry Brooks Adams]]), philosophers (e.g. [[John Stuart Mill]]), churchmen such as [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]], and entertainers such as [[P. T. Barnum]]. Increasingly, in accordance with romantic taste, these accounts also began to deal, amongst other topics, with aspects of childhood and upbringing—far removed from the principles of "Cellinian" autobiography.
&lt;!-- work in progress—to be developed --&gt;

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
From the 17th century onwards, "scandalous memoirs" by supposed [[libertine]]s, serving a public taste for titillation, have been frequently published. Typically [[pseudonym]]ous, they were (and are) largely works of fiction written by [[ghostwriter]]s. So-called "autobiographies" of modern professional athletes and media celebrities—and to a lesser extent about politicians, generally written by a [[ghostwriter]], are routinely published. Some celebrities, such as [[Naomi Campbell]], admit to not having read their "autobiographies".{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Some sensationalist autobiographies such as James Frey's ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' have been publicly exposed as having embellished or fictionalized significant details of the authors' lives.

Autobiography has become an increasingly popular and widely accessible form. ''[[A Fortunate Life]]'' by [[Albert Facey]] (1979) has become an Australian literary classic.&lt;ref&gt;about-australia.com.au, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; With the critical and commercial success in the United States of such memoirs as ''[[Angela’s Ashes]]'' and ''[[The Color of Water]]'', more and more people have been encouraged to try their hand at this genre.

A genre where the "claim for truth" overlaps with fictional elements though the work still purports to be autobiographical is [[autofiction]].

Furthermore, in the latter years new impulses at the Autobiographical genre arrived from the italian poet and critic Menotti Lerro. In contrast to what Philippe Lejeune asserts Lerro claims that if the truth can only be grasped in a synchronic manner (also according to postmodernist philosophers point of view) and through fragments, why not entrust this narrative to the verse? Why not consider the role of “autobiography in verse” equally dignified as a form of self-narration? For the critic this, perhaps, is the necessary leap: through poetry it is possible to get the most dramatic and highest form of autobiographical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Menotti Lerro, Autobiographical Poetry in England and Spain (1950-1980): Narrating Oneself in Verse (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2017), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biographical evaluation''' ({{lang-ar|عِلْمُ الرِّجال|`Ilm al-Rijāl}}), literally meaning'' 'Knowledge of Men' ''but more commonly understood as the ''Science of Narration'', refers to a discipline of [[Islam|Islamic]] religious studies within [[hadith terminology]] in which the narrators of [[hadith]] are evaluated. Its goal is to distinguish [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|authentic]] and [[Hadith terminology#Hasan|reliable]] [[hadith|hadiths]] from [[Hadith terminology#Da'if|unreliable]] [[hadith|hadiths]] in establishing the credibility of the narrators, using both historic and religious knowledge.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 101"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 101, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; ''`Ilm ar-rijal'' is synonymous with what is commonly referred to as ''al-jarḥ wa al-taʻdīl'' (discrediting and accrediting) – the criticism and declared acceptance of hadith narrators.{{#tag:ref|Al-[[al-Suyuti|Suyūṭī]] mentioned in the chapter of ''Tadrib al-Rawi'' entitled 'Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable': "''al-Jarḥ wa al-Taʻdīl'' is permissible..."&lt;ref name= "tadrib" /&gt;|group=footnote}}&lt;ref name= "tadrib"&gt;''Tadrib al-Rawi'', vol. 2, p. 495, ''Dar al-'Asimah'', first edition, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=[[Ali ibn al-Madini]], an early authority on the subject, said, "Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge."&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam" /&gt;}}

In his ''[[Introduction to the Science of Hadith]]'', [[Ibn al-Salah]], a renowned [[hadith]] specialist, explained the importance of the study of hadith narrators. Introducing the chapter entitled, 'Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable,' [[Ibn al-Salah]] said, "This is from the most distinguished and noble types (of hadith study) as it results in recognizing the authenticity of a hadith or its weakness."&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, published with ''Muhasin al-Istilah'' by al-Bulqini, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 654, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; He then explained that any criticism directed at a narrator was permissible due to the "maintenance of the [[Sharia]]h, purging it of any mistakes or misinformation".&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"/&gt;

Stressing the importance of biographical evaluation, [[Ali ibn al-Madini]], an early authority on the subject, said, "Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge."{{#tag:ref|The other half of knowledge, according to Ibn al-Madini, is "having understanding of the meanings of hadith".&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam" /&gt;|group=footnote}}&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam"&gt;''Siyar 'Alam al-Nubala’'', by [[al-Dhahabi]], vol. 11, p. 48, ''Mu'assasah al-Risalah'', Beirut, 11th edition, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=The following [[Qur'an]]ic verse established a general principal in '''biographical evaluation''':&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt; "O you who believe, if a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that so as not to fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done."&lt;ref name="Quran"/&gt;}}

===Beginning of narrator evaluation===
The [[Qur'an]]ic verses are numerous that praise the Companions and criticize the hypocrites, both as a group and specific individuals from amongst them–as well as criticism of specific individuals other than the hypocrites. The most well-known of these is a verse of the Quran stating, "O you who believe, if a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that so as not to fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done."&lt;ref name="Quran"&gt;The [[Qur'an|Quran]], ''Surah al-Hujarat'', 6th verse.&lt;/ref&gt; While this verse was revealed regarding a particular individual, it is a general principle. Following this example, were the Prophet and then His [[Sahaba|Companions]].&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"&gt;''ʻIlm al-rijāl wa Ihimmiyyatuh'', by al-Mu'allimee, pp. 18–20, Dar al-Rayah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time of the Companions===
While many [[Sahaba|Companions]] narrated [[hadith]], according to [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] there were six who were the most prolific narrators of them, who lived long lives enabling them narrate to a large extent. They were: [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Umar|Abdullah ibn Umar]], [[Aisha]], [[Jabir ibn Abd-Allah|Jabir ibn Abdullah]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]] and [[Anas ibn Malik]] with [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] being the most prolific of them.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 492"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 492, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn al-Salah]] the most prolific narrators from the [[Sahaba|Companions]] was [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] followed by [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]].&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 492"/&gt;

In spite of the Companions' efforts in narrating their [[hadith]], there was no need for them to evaluate each other's narrating capabilities or trustworthiness. This is because, as [[Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]] said, that Allah and his Prophet declared the [[Sahaba|Companions]] to be upright and trustworthy, and, therefore, there is no need to investigate their reliability, however, one must investigate the condition of those after them.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Kifayah'', by al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, p. 46, ''Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah'', Beirut, Lebanon, 1988; this edition is apparently based upon the original Indian printing.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many established narrations originating from the Companions praising some of the [[Tabi'un|Followers]] with some criticism of specific individuals from them.&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

===After the Companions===
As for the [[Tabi'un|Followers]], the generation following the [[Sahaba|Companions]], their praise of narrators was plentiful, while disparagement from them was seldom. Those narrators who were criticized from the Followers were not criticized for [[Hadith terminology#Mawdo|fabricating hadith]], but, instead, due to heresy, such as the [[Kharijites]], or due to weak memory or due to their condition as narrators being unknown.&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

Evaluating the narrators of [[hadith]] began in the generation following that of the Companions based upon the statement of Muhammad [[Ibn Sirin]], "They did not previously inquire about the [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|''isnad]]''. However, after the turmoil occurred they would say, 'Name for us your narrators.' So the people of the [[Sunnah]] would have their hadith accepted and the people of [[Bid‘ah|innovation]] would not."&lt;ref&gt;Reported by Muslim in the introduction to his [[Sahih Muslim|''Sahih]]'', vol. 1, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''turmoil'' referred to is the conflicting ideologies of the Kharijites and extreme [[Shia Islam|Shias]] that had emerged at the time of the third ''khalifas'' [[Uthman ibn Affan]]'s assassination and the social unrest of the Kharijites in opposition to the succeeding rulers, [[Ali]] and [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]].&lt;ref&gt;This is the explanation provided by al-Qurtubi in ''al-Mufhim'', vol. 1, pgs. 122-3 as quoted in ''Qurrah Ayn Al-Muhtaj'', vol. 2, pg 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Uthman was in the year 35 after the migration.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Bidayah wa Al-Nihayah'', by [[Ibn Kathir]], vol. 10, p. 323, ''Dar Alam al-Kutub''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following generation, [[Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in|that after the Followers]], and afterward, the weak, unacceptable narrators increased in number, necessitating that a group of scholars clarify the condition of the narrators and distinguishing any narrations that were not [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|authentic]].&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

====Early specialists====
According to [[Ibn al-Salah]], quoting an early religious authority, the first to specialize in the study of [[hadith]] narrators was [[Shuʿba Ibn al-Ḥajjāj]], followed by Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Qattan and then [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] and [[Yahya ibn Ma'in]].&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 101"/&gt; Al-Bulqini added some names to the aforementioned: [[Ali ibn al-Madini]] and 'Amr ibn 'Ali al-Fallas, and then mentioned [[Malik ibn Anas]] and [[Hisham ibn Urwah]] as having preceded them in evaluating narrators.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"/&gt;

== Overview ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=The grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision.}}

===Narrator criteria===
A [[hadith]] is subject to criticism on the basis of two matters. The first relates to the continuity of the hadith's [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|chain of narration]]; if there is [[Hadith terminology#Categories of discontinuity|discontinuity]] between two or more narrators, that hadith is criticized on this basis as discussed in depth in the [[hadith terminology]] article. The second relates to criticism of a narrator, or more, in the [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|chain of narration]] of a particular hadith.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', by Ibn Ḥajr, published as ''an-Nukat'', p. 108, ''Dar Ibn al-Jawzi'', Dammam, Saudi Arabia, sixth edition, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hadith]] narrators are evaluated in light of two qualities in determining the overall grading of a hadith. These qualities are derived from the definition of a hadith that is [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|''sahih]]'' constituting two of its five conditions. The first, uprightness (''al-ʻadālah''), is defined as the ability an individual possesses to adhere to moralistic decorum (''al-taqwā'') and maintaining proper social graces (''al-murūʼah''). The second, precision (''al-ḍabṭ''), is of two types, the first is pertaining to memorization and the second to writing. Precision in memorization (''ḍabṭ al-ṣadr'') refers to the ability to retain the specified information, recalling and conveying it at will. Precision in writing (''ḍabṭ al-kitāb'') is the preservation of the written information from the time it was heard until its transmission.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grounds for criticism===
The grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision. [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] identified and enumerated ten qualities in which a narrator could be criticized. Five relate to trustworthiness and the other five to precision; however, he presented these ten qualities in order according to severity:
# A narrator intentionally lying, claiming a statement to be a Prophetic [[hadith]] when it is not. The inclusion of a narrator of a hadith as such renders that hadith [[Hadith terminology#Maw.E1.B8.8D.C5.AB.CA.BB|fabricated (''Mawḍūʻ'')]].
# An accusation of fabricating a hadith. This would be due a narration that clearly contradicts established religious principles originating from the direction (as it pertains to that hadith's chain of narration) of that individual. Or, that a narrator is known to lie in his ordinary speech but not while narrating hadith.
# Plenitude of mistakes in a narrator's hadith.
# Lack of attention to accuracy.
# The commission of wrongdoing by statement or action as long as it does not constitute apostasy.
# Misconception due to narrating on the basis of misunderstanding.
# Contradiction of that narrator's hadith of another established narrator.
# Unspecification of that narrator's standing in their narrating capabilities.
# [[Bid‘ah|Heresy]], being the belief in an innovated matter that contradicts the established religious practice originating with the Prophet due to a misconception, not obstinateness.
# Poor memory, differing from number three above in that the mistakes of that narrator outnumber instances in which they are correct.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', pgs. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of evaluation===
[[Hadith]] scholars of the past employed various methods by which to evaluate the narrating abilities of a narrator. From these means are the following:
# Observing that narrator's religiosity and asking others about it.
# Requesting the narrator in question to narrator from a particular living scholar and then returning to that scholar and comparing his narrations with those of the narrator under examination.
# If the narrator narrates from a deceased scholar, inquiring when he, the narrator in question, was born, when he met that scholar and where and then comparing the dates provided in his response to the recognized dates of that scholars death and travels. So, perhaps, the dates provided by the narrator may contradict the established dates, for example, claiming that he heard from a particular scholar after the recognized death of that scholar.
# Comparing the narrations of the narrator with those of narrators of established reliability, comparing them seeking any distinctions that might be unique to that narrator, in particular, while contradicting the others.
# Examination of the narrations either written or memorized by that narrator after the passage of time observing any discrepancies with their initial narrations.&lt;ref&gt;''Ilm al-rijāl wa Ihimmiyyatuh'', pp. 22–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Deliberately altering the wording of a hadith or more for the purpose of examining the ability of the narrator being examined to detect those alterations. This is considered an acceptable practice as long as those alterations are brought to light following the examination process.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', [ 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation terminology ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator...}}

As a result of the evaluation of narrators, each scholar would then conclude by describing the standing of each narrator. A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator, with some variation in usage of terms between the individual evaluators. These are divided into two categories, those terms that constitute praise (''taʻdīl'') and those that constitute criticism (''jarḥ''). [[al-Suyuti|al-Suyūṭī]] gathered the various terms and arranged them in order of strength. He quoted four levels of strength for praise from Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah, adding that [[al-Dhahabi]] and [[Abd al-Rahim ibn al-Husain al-'Iraqi]] added an additional level and [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] one above that. Thus according to al-Suyūṭī, there are six levels of praise. Similarly, al-Suyūṭī described six levels of terms used to criticize a narrator; he arranged them beginning with the least severe and concluding with the most severe criticism.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"&gt;''Tadrib al-Rawi'', by al-Suyūṭī, vol. 1, pp. 573-8, ''Dar al-'Asimah'', Riyadh, first edition, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of praise===
#[[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] held that the highest level of praise was expressed was through the use of the superlative, for example, ''the most established of the people'' (''athbat al-nās''), or ''the most reliable of the people'' (''awthaq al-nās'').
#Al-'Iraqi and al-Dhahabi were of the opinion that the highest level was the repetition of adjective, or adjectives, in praising a narrator. For example, ''reliably reliable'' (''thiqah thiqah''), or ''reliable, firm'' (''thiqah thabt'').
#The highest level according to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah the highest is the use of a single adjective in describing a narrator. Examples of this are: ''reliable'' (''thiqah''), ''precise'' (''mutqin'') or ''firm'' (''thabt'').
#''Trustworthy'' (''ṣadūq'') and ''worthy of trust'' (''maḥallahu al-ṣidq'') are both examples of the next category to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah while al-'Iraqi and al-Dhahabi consider the latter term to be from the next level.
#Next is ''respectable'' ([[Sheikh#Religious usage|''shaykh]]'') along with ''worthy of trust'' (''maḥallahu al-ṣidq'') according to some. This level would also be inclusive of an individual accused of heresy.
#The lowest of the levels of praise is, for example, ''satisfactory in hadith'' (''ṣāliḥ al-ḥadīth''), meaning according to [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]], this includes ''acceptable'' (''maqbūl'') meaning, when supported by other narrators.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As he explained in the introduction to ''Taqrib al-Tahthib'', pp. 14, ''Mu'assasah al-Risalah'', Beirut, first edition, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of criticism===
#The least severe level for the criticism of a narrator is ''soft in hadith'' (''layyin al-ḥadīth'') and, according to al-'Iraqi, ''they have spoken about him'' (''takallamū fīhi''). This level would also be taken into consideration as a corroborating narrator, but at a level less than the lowest level of praise.
#Next is ''he is not strong'' (''laysa bi l-qawī''). The hadith of a narrator determined to be at this level would also be taken into consideration, as with the previous level, however, this narrator is weaker than one of the previous level.
#More severe than ''he is not strong'' is ''weak in hadith'' (''ḍaʻīf al-ḥadīth''), however, none of these first three categories are rejected outright.
#The fourth of the levels of severity of criticism includes terms such as: ''his hadith is rejected'' (''rudd al-ḥadīth'') and ''very weak'' (''ḍaʻīf jiddan'').
#The fifth includes terms such as: ''his hadith is abandoned'' (''matrūk al-ḥadīth'') and ''destroyed'' (''hālik'').
#From the most severe level of terms of criticism are: ''compulsive liar'' (''kadhdhāb''), ''he lies'' (''yakdhib'') and ''fabricator'' (''waḍḍāʻ'') among other terms.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"/&gt;

[[File:Soviet Union-1964-stamp-Chapayev (film).jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'']]
A '''biographical film''', or '''biopic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|əʊ|p|ɪ|k}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forvo.com/word/biopic/#en|title=biopic pronunciation: How to pronounce biopic in English, German|first=Forvo|last=Team|date=|website=forvo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; abbreviation for ''biographical motion picture''), is a film that dramatizes the life of a [[non-fictional]] or [[historically]]-based person or people. Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character's real name is used.&lt;ref name=bas2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastin|first=Giselle|title=Filming the Ineffable: Biopics of the British Royal Family|journal=Auto/Biography Studies|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/abs/summary/v024/24.1.bastin.html|date=Summer 2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=34–52|accessdate=29 May 2013|doi=10.1353/abs.2009.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from films "[[docudrama|based on a true story]]" or "[[historical drama film]]s" in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives.{{Original research inline|date=October 2015}}

Because the figures portrayed are actual people, whose actions and characteristics are known to the public (or at least historically documented), biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Jamie Foxx]] all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics:{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Ben Kingsley as [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), Depp as [[Ed Wood]] in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), Carrey as [[Andy Kaufman]] in ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999), and Foxx as [[Ray Charles]] in ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'' (2004).

In rare cases, sometimes called '''auto biopics''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/autobiopic|title=autobiopic - definition of autobiopic in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the subject of the film plays himself or herself: [[Jackie Robinson]] in ''[[The Jackie Robinson Story]]''; [[Muhammad Ali]] in ''[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]]''; [[Audie Murphy]] in ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]''; [[Patty Duke]] in ''[[Call Me Anna (film)|Call Me Anna]]''; [[Bob Mathias]] in ''[[The Bob Mathias Story]]'', [[Arlo Guthrie]] in ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]''; [[Fantasia Barrino]] in ''[[Life Is Not a Fairytale: The Fantasia Barrino Story|Life Is Not a Fairytale]]''; and [[Howard Stern]] in ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]''.

Biopic scholars include [[George F. Custen]] of the [[College of Staten Island]] and [[Dennis P. Bingham]] of [[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]]. Custen, in ''Bio/Pics: How Hollywood Constructed Public History'' (1992), regards the genre as having died with the [[Studio system|Hollywood studio era]], and in particular, [[Darryl F. Zanuck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Custen |first=George F. |title=Bio/pics : how Hollywood constructed public history |page= |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=1992 |oclc=24247491 |isbn=9780813517551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, Bingham's 2010 study ''Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bingham |first=Dennis |title=Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre |page= |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=2010 |oclc=318970570 |isbn=9780813546582}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by [[Rick Altman]] in his study, ''[[Film/Genre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Film/genre |last=Altman |first=Rick |year=1999 |publisher=British Film Institute |page= |oclc=41071380 |isbn=9780851707174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other, the former generally dealing with great accomplishments, the latter generally dealing with female victimization. Ellen Cheshire's ''Bio-Pics: a life in pictures'' (2014) examines UK/US films from the 1990s and 2000s. Each chapter reviews key films linked by profession and concludes with further viewing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheshire |first=Ellen |title=Bio-Pics: a life in pictures |page= |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2014 |oclc= |isbn=9780231172059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Robé has also written on the gender norms that underlie the biopic in his article, "Taking Hollywood Back" in the 2009 issue of ''Cinema Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robé |first=Christopher |title=Taking Hollywood Back: The Historical Costume Drama, the Biopic, and Popular Front U.S. Film Criticism |jstor=20484449 |journal=Cinema Journal |volume=48 |issue=2 |date=Winter 2009 |pages=70–87 |doi=10.1353/cj.0.0082}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Anchor|Ebert}} [[Roger Ebert]] defended ''The Hurricane'' and distortions in biographical films in general, stating "those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother. ... ''The Hurricane'' is not a [[Documentary film|documentary]] but a [[parable]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-hurricane-2000 |date=January 7, 2000 |title=The Hurricane |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|stretch}} Some biopics purposely stretch the truth. ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]'' was based on [[game show]] host [[Chuck Barris]]' widely debunked yet popular [[memoir]] of the same name, in which he claimed to be a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,404266,00.html|title=Chuck Barris: Lying to Tell the Truth |last=Stein |first=Joel |date=2003-01-07 |newspaper=Time |issn=0040-781X |access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kafka (film)|Kafka]]'' incorporated both the life of author [[Franz Kafka]] and the [[surrealism|surreal]] aspects of his fiction.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The [[Errol Flynn]] film ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'' tells the story of [[George Armstrong Custer|Custer]] but is highly romanticized. The [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', mainly about [[Jim Morrison]], was highly praised for the similarities between Jim Morrison and actor [[Val Kilmer]], look-wise and singing-wise, but fans and band members did not like the way Val Kilmer portrayed Jim Morrison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gary James' Interview with Ray Manzarek |url= http://www.classicbands.com/RayManzarekInterview.html |publisher=Classicbands |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a few of the scenes were even completely made up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crystal-ship.com/entrevues.php?cht=03 |title=Chat with Ray Manzarek |publisher=Crystal-ship|date=17 November 1997 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casting can be controversial for biographical films. Casting is often a balance between similarity in looks and ability to portray the characteristics of the person. [[Anthony Hopkins]] felt that he should not have played [[Richard Nixon]] in ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' because of a lack of resemblance between the two.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The casting of [[John Wayne]] as [[Genghis Khan]] in ''[[The Conqueror (1956 film)|The Conqueror]]'' was objected to because of the American Wayne being cast as the Mongol warlord. Egyptian critics criticized the casting of [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]], an African American actor, as Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] in the 1982 TV miniseries ''[[Sadat (film)|Sadat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/02/movies/upset-by-sadat-egypt-bars-columbia-films.html|title=UPSET BY 'SADAT,' EGYPT BARS COLUMBIA FILMS|last=Times|first=Judith Miller, Special To The New York|date=1984-02-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some objected to the casting of [[Jennifer Lopez]] in ''[[Selena (film)|Selena]]'' because she is a New York City native of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] descent while [[Selena]] was [[Mexican-American]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, Kathleen (2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4709">'''Cleopatra VI Tryphaena''' ({{lang-el|Κλεοπάτρα Τρύφαινα}}) was an Egyptian Ptolemaic queen. She may be identical with [[Cleopatra V of Egypt|Cleopatra V]].

There were at least two, perhaps three Ptolemaic women called ''Cleopatra Tryphaena'':

==Tryphaena, daughter of Ptolemy VIII Physcon and Cleopatra III==
[[Tryphaena]] was a sister of [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros]], [[Ptolemy X Alexander I]], [[Cleopatra IV of Egypt|Cleopatra IV]] and [[Cleopatra Selene of Syria|Cleopatra Selene]].&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.sfagn.info/information/kritt.html|title=Numismatic Evidence for a New Seleucid King: Seleucus (VII) Philometor|author=Brian Kritt|journal=The Celator|volume=16|issue=4|date=April 2002|postscript=.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103357/http://www.sfagn.info/information/kritt.html|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this ''Tryphaena'' also bore the name ''Cleopatra'', has not been attested. This Tryphaena may have been born in early 140 or 141 BC. She married [[Antiochus VIII Grypus]], king of [[Seleucid Empire|Syria]], in 124 BC, and bore him five sons: [[Seleucus VI Epiphanes]], the twin [[Antiochus XI Epiphanes]] and [[Philip I Philadelphus]], [[Demetrius III Eucaerus]], and [[Antiochus XII Dionysus]]. The couple also had a daughter called [[Laodice VII Thea|Laodice]].  Tryphaena was killed in [[Antioch]] (Greek: Αντιόχεια), capital of Syria, by [[Antiochus IX Cyzicenus]], as a revenge for his own wife's (Cleopatra IV) death by the orders of her sister Tryphaena (in 111 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Justin | title = Epitoma historiarum Philippicarum Pompei Trogi | pages = 39.2.3, 39.3.4–12 | authorlink = Justin (historian)}}, our only source for these events.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleopatra V Tryphaena, wife of Ptolemy XII Auletes==
[[Cleopatra V of Egypt|Cleopatra V Tryphaena]] was a Queen of Egypt until her mysterious disappearance from the records in 69 BC. If, as some scholars believe, her disappearance is attributable to her death, then it must be assumed that she had a daughter also called ''Cleopatra Tryphaena''.&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;

==Cleopatra Tryphaena, daughter of Cleopatra V and Ptolemy XII Auletes==
She is called ''Cleopatra VI Tryphaena'' by some modern historians&lt;ref name = "Tyldesley" /&gt; and she would have been an older sister of the famous [[Cleopatra VII]].&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames &amp; Hudson. 2004. {{ISBN|0-500-05128-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, her birth year would correctly be c. 75 BC. The only instance she is mentioned in historical sources is by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]. He says that when Ptolemy XII fled to Rome to avoid an uprising in Alexandria against him (in 58 BC), [[Berenice IV of Egypt|Berenice IV]] took control of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and ruled alongside her sister, Cleopatra Tryphaena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], cited by [[Felix Jacoby]], ''[[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker]]'', no. 260 F 2, 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] | title = ''Chronicle'' | page = 167 | publisher = Schoene | url = http://www.attalus.org/translate/eusebius1.html#167}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strabo, however, states that Ptolemy had three daughters, of whom only the eldest (Berenice) was legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = [[Strabo]] | title = Geographica | page = 17.1.11 | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17A2*.html#1.11 | publisher = University of Chicago}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that the Cleopatra Tryphaena referred to by Porphyry may have been Ptolemy's wife, not his daughter. Some, though not all, experts now identify Cleopatra VI with [[Cleopatra V of Egypt]], Ptolemy's wife.&lt;ref name= "Tyldesley"&gt;{{citation | last = Tyldesley | first = Joyce | title = Thames &amp; Hudson | year = 2006 | page = 200 | isbn = 0-500-05145-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor''', or '''Charles I of Spain''', was the heir of four of Europe's leading royal houses.  [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] was the first sole [[List of Spanish monarchs|monarch of Spain]], inheriting the kingdoms first united by his maternal grandparents, [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] (the [[Catholic Monarchs]]).  From his father, [[Philip I of Castile]], he inherited the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], which came from his paternal grandmother, [[Mary of Burgundy]].  Finally, on the death of his paternal grandfather, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], he inherited the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] lands in [[Austria]].  His [[coat of arms]], representing much of the land he inherited, is [[blazon]]ed as follows:

{{cquote|''[[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]]: I and IV grand-quarterly i and iv great-grand-quarterly 1 and 4 [[gules]] a three towered castle [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] [[Mortar (masonry)|masoned]] [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] and ajouré [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] (for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]), 2 and 3 [[argent]] a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] [[Lion (heraldry)#Positions|rampant]] [[purpure]] crowned Or [[List of heraldic charges#Attitude of animals|langued]] and armed gules (for [[Kingdom of León|Leon]]), ii [[Division of the field|per pale]], dexter [[Division of the field|per fess]], in chief Or four [[Pale (heraldry)|pallets]] gules (for [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]]), in base gules a [[cross]], [[saltire]], and [[Ordinary (heraldry)#Subordinaries|orle]] of chains linked together Or and a centre point [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]] (for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]), sinister party per pale argent a [[Cross|cross potent]] and four crosslets Or  impaling [[Variation of the field|barry]] of eight gules and argent (for [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]), iii per pale, dexter per fess, in chief Or four pallets gules (for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]), in base gules a cross, saltire, and orle of chains linked together Or and a centre point vert (for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]), sinister [[Division of the field|per saltire]], 1 and 4 Or four pallets gules, 2 and 3 argent an [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle displayed]] sable (for [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]]); II and III grand-quarterly, i gules a [[fess]] argent (for [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]]), ii azure [[Variation of the field#Semé|semy-de-lis]] Or a [[bordure]] [[Compone|compony]] argent and gules (new [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundy]]), iii [[Variation of the field|bendy]] of six Or and azure a bordure gules (old [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundy]]), iv sable a lion rampant Or langued and armed gules (for [[Duke of Brabant|Brabant]]), overall at the fess point of the quarter an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] Or a lion rampant sable armed and langued gules (for [[Counts of Flanders|Flanders]]) [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] argent an eagle displayed gules, armed, beaked, and langued Or (for [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]]); enté en point argent a [[pomegranate]] proper seeded gules, supported, sculpted and slipped vert (for [[Granada]]).''

''[[Supporters]]: A [[Double-headed eagle|bicephalous eagle]] displayed sable imperially crowned proper in front of a saltire ragulée gules, the whole between two columns argent issuing from the sea proper in base, the one to dexter crowned imperially proper, the one to sinister crowned with the [[Spanish Royal Crown|Royal Crown of Spain]] proper.  The motto, [[Plus ultra (motto)|PLVS VLTRA]] or [[Plus Oultre|PLVS OVLTRE]], wraps around the columns.''

The first and fourth quarters represents holdings derived from the Spanish crowns:  that is, the quartered arms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of León|Leon]] themselves quartered with the quartered arms of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Sicily]]. After 1520 the Aragon/Sicily quartering also incorporated the arms of [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Kingdom_of_Naples#Aragonese_and_Spanish_Kingdom_of_Naples|Naples]], and [[Navarre]].

The second and third quarters represents holdings derived from Charles's Austrian and Burgundian inheritance: these quarters shows further quartering of [[Austria]], [[Duchy of Burgundy]], [[County of Burgundy]], and the [[Duchy of Brabant]], with the escutcheon in the middle showing [[Flanders]] on the left and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] on the right.

The [[Kingdom of Granada (Crown of Castile)|Granada]] [[pomegranate]] is represented at the bottom between the two.

==The Burgundian Inheritance and the Order of the Golden Fleece==
In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] had been conquered and annexed by France. In the same year, [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary "the Rich"]], the [[Charles the Bold|last Burgundian duke]]'s only child, had married Charles' grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the Burgundian Inheritance: although the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy itself remained in the hands of France, the Habsburgs remained in control of the title of [[Duke of Burgundy]] and the other parts of the Burgundian inheritance, notably the [[Low Countries]] and the [[County of Burgundy|Free County of Burgundy]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].  They often used the term [[Burgundy (disambiguation)|Burgundy]] to refer to it until the late 18th century, when the [[Southern Netherlands|Austrian Netherlands]] were lost to the [[France|French Republic]].  Although Charles V had inherited the grand mastership of numerous orders, the only order which he habitually wore and awarded was that of the Burgundian [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].

[[File:Coat of arms of Joseph Ratzinger.svg|thumb|right|250px|The coat of arms of Cardinal Ratzinger]]

The [[papal coats of arms|personal papal coat of arms]] of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] was designed by Archbishop [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]] (who was later created a Cardinal) soon after the [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal election in 2005]].

==Shield==
The shape of the [[shield (heraldry)|shield]] varies from artist to artist. In the official rendering of the coat of arms of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] the shape chosen is that of a [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]].

===Blazon===
The [[blazon]] (the written description, in terminology peculiar to heraldry, of the contents of the coat of arms) given on the Vatican [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html website] is as follows:
:''Gules, chape ployé Or, with the scallop shell Or; the dexter chape with a moor's head Proper, crowned and collared Gules, the sinister chape a bear trippant (*passant) Proper, carrying a pack Gules belted Sable.'
This means, in non-technical English:
: A red shield mantled in gold and with a gold scallop shell; the right (for the bearer of the shield, the left for the viewer) part of the mantle has the head of a moor in her natural colour (brown) wearing a red crown and red collar; the left part of the mantle has a walking bear in its natural colour (brown) carrying a red pack tied with black bands.

Note 1. A mantle outside the shield does not normally contain ''charges'' (an heraldic term for objects). Within the shield, as here, it is a religious symbol, and indicates ideals inspired in monastic spirituality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is also a reference to the [[Order of Saint Benedict]].

Note 2. The black bands tying the red pack is one of several existing contraventions of the heraldic [[rule of tincture]], which in general does not allow the placing of colour on colour or metal (gold or silver) on another metal.

===Charges===
The charges of the arms &amp;mdash; the [[Maure|Moor's head]], [[Corbinian]]'s bear, and [[scallop]] &amp;mdash; appeared on Ratzinger's previous coat of arms, used when he was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich|Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]. However, they relate not only to his origins, but also to his trust in God, as well his calling to spread this faith to others.

====Scallop shell====
The symbolism of the [[scallop]] shell is multiple. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] is said to have been walking along the seashore, meditating on the unfathomable mystery of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]. A boy was using a shell to pour sea water into a little hole. When Augustine asked him what he was doing, he replied, "I am emptying the sea into this hole."  Thus did [[Augustine]] understand that man would never penetrate to the depths of the mystery of God. While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Fr. Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on ''The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church'', and the shell therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church.

The scallop shell is also an allusion to the [[Sacrament]] of Holy [[Baptism]]. In the Roman Catholic Church, a sea shell is often used to pour water over the head of the child being baptized. Thus, a sea shell is used to evoke the imagery of this rite which is fundamental to the Christian life.

The shell also stands for [[pilgrimage]]. When topped with a [[Shell of Saint James|scallop shell]] a [[pilgrim's staff]], or "[[Jacob's staff]]", is the sign of a pilgrim. In Church art it is a symbol of the apostle [[Saint James the Great]], and his sanctuary at [[Santiago de Compostela]] in Spain, perhaps the principal place of pilgrimage during the Middle Ages. This symbol also alludes to "the pilgrim people of God", a title for the Church which Joseph Ratzinger championed at the [[Second Vatican Council]] as ''[[peritus]]'' (theological adviser) to Cardinals [[Josef Frings]] of Cologne and [[Julius Döpfner]] of Munich-Freising (his episcopal predecessor). When he became Archbishop he took the shell in his coat of arms. It is also found in the insignia of the Schottenkloster in Regensburg, where the major seminary of that diocese is located, a place where Benedict taught as a professor of theology.

Finally, the [[pilgrimage]] [[symbol]]ism of the shell may also refer both to the reconfigured role of the pope as not only ruler, but also pilgrim among the peoples and nations of the world. [[Pope Paul VI]]&amp;mdash;who created Joseph Ratzinger as a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1977&amp;mdash;was often called the "Pilgrim Pope" for his ground-breaking travels to the [[Holy Land]], [[India]], the [[United States]], [[Colombia]], the [[Philippines]], and elsewhere. This precedent was greatly elaborated upon by [[Pope John Paul II]] with his historic trips, numbering over a hundred. As a result, Benedict may be paying homage to these men and the new role for the papacy.

====Moor of Freising====
[[File:Hochstift Freising coat of arms.svg|right|150px|Moor's head of Freising, from the coat of arms of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Freising]].]]
The [[maure|Moor's head]] is a heraldic charge associated with [[Wörth, Upper Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. The origin of the Moor's head in Freising is not entirely known. Typically facing to the heraldic right, the viewer's left (''[[dexter and sinister|dexter]]'' in heraldic terms) and depicted in natural brown colour ''caput Aethiopum'' (literally "Ethiopian head") with red lips, crown and collar. This is the ancient emblem of the Diocese of Freising, founded in the 8th century, which became a [[Metropolitan Archdiocese]] with the name of München und Freising in 1818, subsequent to the [[Concordat]] between [[Pius VII]] and [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria]] (5 June 1817).

The Moor's head is fairly common in European heraldry. It still appears today in the arms of [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]], as well as in the [[blazons]] of various noble families. Italian heraldry, however, usually depicts the Moor wearing a white band around his head instead of a crown, indicating a slave who has been freed; whereas in [[German heraldry]] the Moor is shown wearing a crown. The Moor's head is common in the [[Bavaria]]n tradition and is known as the ''caput Ethiopicum'' or the ''Moor of Freising''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110021140/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html |archivedate=2007-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corbinian's bear====
A legend states that while traveling to Rome, Saint [[Corbinian]]'s pack [[horse]] was killed by a [[bear]]. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned        to Bavaria. The implication is that "[[Christianity]] tamed and domesticated the ferocity of [[paganism]] and thus laid the foundations for a great civilization in the Duchy of [[Bavaria]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The bear and the scallop-shell &amp;mdash; a unique papal coat of arms | work=Catholic World News| url= http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=36801   | date =27 April 2005 | accessdate=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolizes the weight of office that Benedict carried.

==External ornaments==
[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|200px|The coat of arms of the Holy See.]]
[[File:Guardia Svizzera Bandiera.svg|thumb|right|200px|Banner of the Swiss Guard, with the coat-of-arms of Pope Benedict XVI modified to include the papal tiara.]]
Traditionally, a pope's coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered [[Papal Tiara|papal tiara]] with lappets and the crossed keys of [[Saint Peter]] with a cord. No other objects nor a motto was added. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind on heaven and earth ({{bibleverse||Matt|16:19|63}}). Pope Benedict's arms maintain the keys, but replace the tiara with a mitre and add a pallium. However, the tiara and keys remain the symbol of the papacy, and appear on the coat of arms of the [[Holy See]] and (reversed) on the flag of [[Vatican City]].

===Mitre===
In Pope Benedict's arms, the tiara is replaced with a silver [[mitre]] with three gold stripes.&lt;ref name= "cns2005"&gt;{{cite news | last=Glatz | first=Carol  |  title=Pope drops papal crown from coat of arms, adds miter, pallium | date=2005-05-18 | publisher=Catholic News Service | url= http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0502625.htm| accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stripes recall the three crowns of the tiara, which came to represent the three powers of the Bishop of Rome: Orders, Jurisdiction and Magisterium. The stripes preserve that meaning and are joined at the centre to show their unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).

===Pallium===
The [[pallium]] with red crosses is also a new addition.&lt;ref name="cns2005"/&gt; It represents a bishop's role of being pastor of the flock entrusted to him by Christ. The form of the pallium included in the coat of arms recalls that used by metropolitan archbishops (but with black crosses) rather than the much larger pallium worn by Pope Benedict at his inauguration.

==Early controversy==
Some{{Specify|date=March 2012}} have voiced objection to Pope Benedict's use of the mitre and pallium in his coat of arms, and the absence of the traditional [[papal tiara]].

Their arguments include:
* The use of mitres in the personal arms of [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and [[bishop]]s was banned by an instruction of the Holy See in April 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church | title= Instruction on the Dress, Titles, and Coat-of-Arms of Cardinals, Bishops, and Lesser Prelates |url= http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm |publisher=Salvador Miranda via [[Florida International University|FIU]] | accessdate= 2012-03-23|date=April 17, 1969 | quote= 28. The use of coats-of-arms by Cardinals and Bishops is permitted. The shield of the coat-of-arms must be simple and clear. The use of the crozier and mitre in the coat-of-arms is suppressed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously a crozier and mitre were used as external ornaments, being placed behind the shield, beneath the clerical hat, the [[galero]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sahw.bravehost.com/c-ecc.htm Ecclesiastical Heraldry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000802/http://sahw.bravehost.com/c-ecc.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An example of an episcopal coat-of-arms ensigned with mitre and crozier, curiously granted a few months ''after'' the official exclusion of these ornaments, is [http://www.sonasmor.net/CD23.html that of Bishop Colin A. MacPherson of Argyll and the Isles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803150729/http://www.sonasmor.net/CD23.html |date=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rom - Vatikanische Gärten Papstwappen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pope's arms with a tiara, Vatican Garden]]
Regardless of the validity of such arguments, the Pope, as supreme legislator and interpreter of Church law,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6YCpraE-7xcC&amp;pg=PA71 John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green, ''New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law''] (Paulist Press 2002 {{ISBN|9780809140664}}), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; had full authority to decide the form of his armorial bearings.

Some{{Specify|date=March 2012}} claimed that Benedict's arms could still properly be rendered with the tiara and keys and without the pallium. This was done in the Vatican gardens behind [[St. Peter's Basilica]], viewable from atop the dome. Shortly after the death of John Paul II, the contents of his shield were removed from the flowerbed, but the tiara was left in place.  After the [[Papal conclave, 2005|election of Benedict XVI]], the gardeners put the design of the new Pope's arms within the shield, but rather than digging up the flowers depicting the tiara and replacing them with a mitre design, they left the tiara in place and omitted the pallium.

{{clear|left}}

==Later controversy==

In a 2013 interview, Cardinal [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]], designer of the coat of arms, said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms now that he was no longer the pontiff. “The problem now is whether the Pope Emeritus can keep that same coat of arms or not,”. “And as a person who has always dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no,’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter from the back of the coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But this is only a proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/benedict-xvi-needs-new-coat-of-arms-designer-says/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426013511/http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/benedict-xvi-needs-new-coat-of-arms-designer-says/ |archivedate=26 April 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4585">'''Creirwy''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈkrəirʊɨ}}) is a figure in the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and the ''[[s:The Mabinogion/Taliesin|Hanes Taliesin]]'' (the story of [[Taliesin]]'s life), daughter of the enchantress [[Ceridwen]] and [[Tegid Foel]] ("Tacitus the Bald"). The [[Welsh Triads]] name her one of the three most beautiful maids of the Isle of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Triads of Britain|Triads of Britain]]&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Penllyn (cantref)|Penllyn]] in [[Powys]], Wales, Creirwy (also known as ''Llywy'') has a dark, hideous brother named [[Morfran]] and a foster brother, [[Gwion Bach]] (who would become the bard Taliesin). She does not appear in the stories about [[Afagddu]] and Taliesin.

==Interpretation as a goddess==
[[Celtic Revival|Celtic]] researcher [[Edward Davies (Celtic)|Edward Davies]] deemed Creirwy "the [[Proserpina|Proserpine]] of the [[Britons (historical)|British]] [[Druid]]s"—also [[Comparative mythology|comparing]] her mother Ceridwen to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] of Roman myth.&lt;ref name=virago&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mythologyritesof00davirich ''The Mythology and Rites of the British Druids''], [https://archive.org/stream/mythologyritesof00davirich#page/205/mode/1up/ page 205]&lt;/ref&gt; Mythographer [[Jacob Bryant]] theorized that Creirwy and Ceridwen were essentially "the same mystical personage."&lt;ref name=virago /&gt;

Her name possibly means "sacred symbol of the egg" (i.e., "[[mundane egg]]", "[[adder stone]]") from the Welsh elements ''creir'' "a token, jewel, sacred object, relic, talisman, treasure, richly decorated article, object of admiration or love, darling, safeguard, strength, hand-bell, church-bell"&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, August. [http://thedarkavalonbooks.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/creirwy-the-lake-monster-of-bala-lakellyn-tegid/ "Creirwy, the Lake Monster of Bala Lake/Llyn Tegid?"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719142009/http://thedarkavalonbooks.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/creirwy-the-lake-monster-of-bala-lakellyn-tegid/ |date=2012-07-19 }} ''Dark Avalon Books''. Retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''wy'' "egg".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ŵy|Wiktionary: "ŵy"]]&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Druids, the mundane egg allegedly symbolized chaos, the beginning of all things, and upon it oaths were administered.

==Saint Creirwy==
This was also the name of a 6th-century Breton saint from Wales, daughter of Saint [[Gwen Teirbron|Gwen the Triple-Breasted]] and sister of the great regional saint [[Winwaloe]]. According to [[hagiographies]] of Winwaloe, Saint Creirwy ({{lang-la|Creirvia}}; {{lang-br|'''Klervi'''}}) as a young girl had one or both eyes gouged out by a wild [[goose]], but Winwaloe retrieved the eyeball(s) from the gander's belly and returned it/them to his little sister's [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit(s)]], and Creirwy's eyesight was miraculously restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://louis.buchillot.perso.sfr.fr/page369.htm#fiche5 "Sainte Chreirbia" (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, she is allegedly a patron saint of the blind. The story is memorialized in a 16th-century statue in Keravézan, [[Saint-Frégant]]; known as ''la fontaine de Saint Guénolé'', it depicts Winwaloe (Guénolé) holding the goose and the eyeball, with little Creirwy at his feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saint-fregant.e-monsite.com/pages/patrimoine/fontaine-de-saint-guenole.html Fontaine de Saint-Guénolé (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:br:Restr:St Frégant 2.jpg|A photo of the statue of Winwaloe and Creirwy on Breton Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the legend is dismissed by [[Sabine Baring-Gould|Baring-Gould]] and Fisher, who say it originated with an expression that "Creirwe" used; supposedly she would often say she "owed her eye to Winwaloe", but in reference to a much more ordinary childhood event, in which her brother stepped in and protected her when a wild goose flew at Creirwy and almost pecked out her eye.&lt;ref&gt;Anna of the blog ''Early Western Saints''.

== Early life ==
Boyd grew up in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] and [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=age/&gt; and attended [[Manheim Township High School]] from 1992–1996. According to her website, she was born Danah Michele Mattas.&lt;ref name="db_hompage_name"/&gt; Once she reached college, she chose to take her maternal grandfather's name, Boyd, as her own last name. She decided to spell her name in lowercase so as "to reflect my mother's original balancing and to satisfy my own political irritation at the importance of capitalization."&lt;ref name=age/&gt;&lt;ref name="db_hompage_name"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
After her parents' divorce, in 1982, she moved to [[York County, Pennsylvania|York]], [[Pennsylvania]], with her mother and her brother. Her mother married again during danah's third grade and the family moved to [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]. She used online discussions forums to escape from high school. She called Lancaster a "religious and conservative" city. Having had online discussions on the topic, she decided to start identifying as [[queer]].&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/festival/article/2014/08/20/danah-boyd-anthropologue-de-la-generation-numerique_4473731_4415198.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, her brother taught her how to use [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] and [[Usenet]]. Even though she thought computers were "lame" at the time, the possibilities for connecting with others intrigued her. She became an avid participant on Usenet and IRC in her junior year in high school, spending a lot of time browsing, creating content, and conversing with strangers.&lt;ref name="danah.org"&gt;http://www.danah.org/aboutme.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though active in many extra-curricular activities and excelling academically, boyd had a difficult time socially in high school. She assigns "her survival to her mother, the Internet, and a classmate whose misogynistic comments inspired her to excel."&lt;ref name="danah.org"/&gt;

Her initial ambition was to become an astronaut but after an injury, she became more interested in the Internet.&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite news|title=A space of her own – Encounter with Danah Boyd|work=The Age |location=Australia|date=August 4, 2007|author=Debelle, Penelope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education ==
[[File:Danah Boyd.jpg|thumb|danah boyd in 2005, a speaker at Digital Identity conference in Chicago.]]
Boyd initially studied [[computer science]] at [[Brown University]], where she worked with [[Andries van Dam]] and wrote an undergraduate thesis about how "3-D computer systems used cues that were inherently sexist."&lt;ref name=age/&gt;  She pursued her master's degree in sociable media with [[Judith Donath]] at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. She worked for the New York-based activist organization [[V-Day (movement)|V-Day]], first as a volunteer (starting in 2004) and then as paid staff (2007–2009). She eventually moved to San Francisco, where she met the individuals involved in creating the new [[Friendster]] service. She documented what she was observing via her blog, and this grew into a career.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | work=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/technology/circuits/27frie.html | title=Decoding the New Cues in Online Society | last=Erard | first=Michael | date=November 27, 2003 | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604185643/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/technology/circuits/27frie.html | archivedate=June 4, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2006–07 academic year, boyd was a fellow at the [[Annenberg Center for Communication]] at the [[University of Southern California]]. She was a long-time fellow at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at Harvard University, where she co-directed the Internet Safety Technical Task Force,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/isttf/members | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | title=Members of the Internet Safety Technical Task Force | publisher=[[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then served on the Youth and Media Policy Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/digitalnatives/policy|title=Youth and Media Policy Working Group Initiative|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Danah Boyd (12776738645).jpg|thumb|Visualisation from one of boyd's lectures by Willow Brugh]]
While in graduate school, she was involved with a three-year ethnographic project funded by the MacArthur Foundation and led by [[Mimi Ito]]; the project examined youths' use of technologies through interviews, focus groups, observations, and document analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitallearning.macfound.org/site/c.enJLKQNlFiG/b.4773555/k.27DE/Mizuko_Ito.htm |title=MacArthur Foundation Project Summary |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalyouth.ischool.berkeley.edu/report |title=Final Report |work=The Digital Youth Project |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her publications included an article in the ''MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Learning, Identity Volume'' called "Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life."&lt;ref name=SocialNetwork&gt;{{cite journal |last=boyd |first=danah |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Buckingham |editor1-link= |title=Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life |journal=Youth, Identity, and Digital Media |series=The John D. and Catherine T.

The project culminated with a co-authored book "Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media."&lt;ref name="HangingOut"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ito |first=Mimi |title=Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |date=September 2009 |isbn=0-262-01336-3|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She published untraditional research on youth using Facebook and MySpace in 2007. She demonstrated that most young users of Facebook were white and middle-to-upper class, while MySpace users tended to be lower-class black teenagers. Her work is often translated and relayed to major media.&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr" /&gt; In addition to blogging on her own site, she addresses issues of youth and technology use on the [http://dmlcentral.net DMLcentral] blog. boyd has written academic papers and [[op-ed]] pieces on online culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |authorlink=Clay Shirky |title=[[Here Comes Everybody]] |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |date=February 28, 2008 |pages=224–5 |isbn=978-1-59420-153-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her career as a fellow at [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society|Harvard's Berkman Center]] started in 2007. In January 2009, boyd joined [[Microsoft Research]] New England, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], as a Social Media Researcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10047795-36.html|title=Microsoft hires social-net scholar Danah Boyd|author=McCarthy, Caroline|date=September 22, 2008|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, boyd founded [https://datasociety.net/ Data &amp; Society Research Institute] to address the social, technical, ethical, legal and policy issues that are emerging from data-centric technological development.

She was interviewed in the 2015 web documentary about internet privacy, ''[[Do Not Track (documentary)|Do Not Track]]''.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/14/brett-gaylor-do-not-track-interactive-documentary-privacy|title=Do not Track: an online, interactive documentary about who’s watching you|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=14 April 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, boyd is president of [[Data &amp; Society]],&lt;ref&gt;https://datasociety.net&lt;/ref&gt; a Principal Researcher at [[Microsoft Research]] and a Visiting Professor at [[New York University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4608">'''Domentzia''' was a name shared by the mother of the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Phocas]] (r. 602–610), and a daughter of the same emperor, likely named after her paternal grandmother.&lt;ref name=PLRE409&gt;Martindale, Jones &amp; Morris (1992), p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The mother is only named by [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]], who renders her name in [[Greek language|Greek]] as "Dysmenziane" (Δυσμενζιανή). All other occurrences of the name refer to the daughter. The more familiar form "Domentzia" (Δομεντζία) is given by [[Theophanes the Confessor]]. [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]], who translated the work of Theophanes to [[Latin]], renders the name "Domnentzia". The later historian [[Joannes Zonaras]] gives the name as "Domnentia" (Δομνεντία), while [[Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos]] gives her name as "Dysmenziane", indicating that both women used the same name.&lt;ref name=PLRE409/&gt;

== Mother of Phocas ==

Phocas and his family were likely of [[Thraco-Roman]] origin.&lt;ref name=Bury197&gt;Bury (2009), p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; The husband of the elder Domentzia is unknown.She had three known sons: Phocas, [[Comentiolus (brother of Phocas)|Comentiolus]]&lt;ref name=PLRE326&gt;Martindale, Jones &amp; Morris (1992), p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Domentziolus (brother of Phocas)|Domentziolus]]. The latter seems to have been ''[[magister officiorum]]'' by 610.&lt;ref name=Bury201&gt;Bury (2009), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; A grandson, also named [[Domentziolus (nephew of Phocas)|Domentziolus]], was granted the title of ''[[curopalates]]'' on the ascension of Phocas to the throne in 602.&lt;ref name=Bury199&gt;Bury (2009), p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

== Daughter of Phocas ==

The younger Domentzia was a daughter of Phocas and [[Leontia]]. In 607, she married the general [[Priscus (general)|Priscus]], who served as ''[[comes excubitorum]]'', commander of the [[Excubitors]] bodyguard.&lt;ref name=PLRE409/&gt; As she was the only known child of the Emperor, the marriage effectively made Priscus an [[heir apparent]] to the throne. Her husband fell into disfavour however when the citizenry of [[Constantinople]] began erecting statues in their honour.&lt;ref name=PLRE1056&gt;Martindale, Jones &amp; Morris (1992), p. 1056&lt;/ref&gt;

Her marriage took place in the palace of Marina, named after its original owner, a daughter of [[Arcadius]] and [[Aelia Eudoxia]]. A [[chariot racing]] event was arranged to be held in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], in honor of the newlyweds. The leaders of the Blues (''Vénetoi'') and the Greens (''Prásinoi'') racing factions (''demoi'') decided to honor the occasion by erecting statues of the royal family. Thus they placed images of Phocas, Leontia, Domentzia, and Priscus in the Hippodrome. The images of the reigning imperial couple belonged there by tradition, but the latter two implied that Priscus was the heir or co-emperor of Phocas. Phocas was enraged at the implication and ordered the depictions of his daughter and son-in-law to be destroyed.&lt;ref name=Bury202&gt;Bury (2009), p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Phocas further treated the matter as an attempted [[coup d'état]], demanding further investigation of the matter, arresting the demarchs responsible with accusations of [[treason]]. While their lives may have been spared due to popular demand, Phocas likely viewed Priscus himself as the culprit, and seems to have started viewing his son-in-law as a potential rival.&lt;ref name=Bury202/&gt; By alienating Priscus however, Phocas undermined his own hold on the throne. By 608, John of Antioch reports Priscus initiating contact with [[Heraclius the Elder]], the [[Exarchate of Africa|Exarch of Africa]], and instigating the revolt that would eventually remove Phocas from power.&lt;ref name=Bury202-203&gt;Bury (2009), pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;

The council of '''Eight Men''' was an early representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous [[Twelve Men]] and was followed by the [[Nine Men]].

==Council==
In 1643 [[Abraham Pietersen Van Deusen]] who had served on the [[council of twelve men]] was appointed to a new council of eight men. The council contacted the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] and blamed governor [[Willem Kieft]] for the declining economic condition of the nascent colony, and the [[Kieft's War|war]] with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. They requested that a new [[Director-General of New Netherland]] be appointed and that the people themselves be given more influence in the new government. Director General Kieft was dismissed, and [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took his place and Stuyvesant remained in power until the colony was turned over to the British in 1664. Kieft returned to Holland, but the vessel, the [[Princess Amelia (1634 ship)|''Princess Amelia'']] was lost at sea and his body was never recovered. John Franklin Jameson (1859–1937) writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commonalty were called together; they were sore distressed. They chose eight, in the stead of the previous twelve, persons to aid in consulting for the best; but the occupation every one had to take care of his own, prevented anything beneficial being adopted at that time. nevertheless it was resolved that as many Englishmen as were to be got in the country should be enlisted, who were indeed now proposing to depart; the third part of these were to be paid by the commonalty; this promise was made by the commonalty but was not followed by the pay.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1643 a minor altercation with Indians evolved into a serious uprising followed by an ugly slaughter of Weckquaskeek Indians on Manhattan Island. Kieft feared a major Indian assault. Allerton was asked by Kieft to join a "group of 8 men" to help New Amsterdam. Because he was English and respected in New Haven, Kieft sent Allerton and another Englishman to New Haven in 1643 to ask for men and materials to help defend New Amsterdam. In addition, the "group of 8" was asked to propose measures to improve civility and law-and-order in New Amsterdam. New Haven refused to send men to support the Dutch but Kieft entered into an agreement with the Indians in 1645 that settled the dispute. Because of Kieft's dictatorial manner, several of the eight men petitioned the WIC directors to recall Kieft as Director-General. In time Kieft was replaced by Peter Stuyvesant, and the men initiating the recall petition were accused of insurrection and faced punishment. Allerton was the second signatory of the petition but was not the group's primary spokesman. In 1646, Allerton established a permanent residence in New Haven.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38766">The '''Eight Tigers''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|八|虎}}|p=Bā Hǔ}}), sometimes referred to as the '''Gang of Eight''' (八党/八黨), were a powerful group of [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s (宦官) that controlled the Chinese imperial court during the reign of the [[Ming Dynasty]] [[Zhengde Emperor]] (r. 1505-1521 CE).

Led by [[Liu Jin]], the remaining members of the coterie were [[Ma Yongcheng]] (馬永成), [[Gao Feng (Ming Dynasty)|Gao Feng]] (高鳳), [[Luo Xiang (Ming dynasty)|Luo Xiang]] (羅祥), [[Wei Bin]] (魏彬), [[Qiu Ju (Ming dynasty)|Qiu Ju]] (丘聚), [[Gu Dayong]] (谷大用) and [[Zhang Yong (Ming dynasty)|Zhang Yong]] (張永).

== Background ==

=== Eunuchs in China ===
[[Eunuch]]s are [[Castration|castrated]] men who have often been used as servants in imperial and noble households, due to the belief that they would not be distracted by or a danger to women. Eunuchs were often utilized in the imperial household as [[harem]] guards and attendants. The [[Imperial Chinese harem system|harems]] were considered necessary in order to help produce a male heir, and the eunuchs were trusted protectors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34515572|title=East Asia : a new history|last=1919-2012.|first=Murphey, Rhoads,|date=1997|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman, Inc|isbn=0673993507|location=New York|oclc=34515572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Ming Dynasty, eunuchs had long been a powerful political force in China. In the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]], from 821 until the dynasty's end, eunuchs were "the real power holders". They controlled the [[Imperial Guards (Tang dynasty)|Imperial Guard]] and the Palace Secretariat, chose seven out of eight emperors, and possibly killed two emperors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/643762927|title=A history of East Asia : from the origins of civilization to the twenty-first century|last=1956-|first=Holcombe, Charles,|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521515955|location=New York|oclc=643762927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Ming emperor, [[Hongwu Emperor|Hongwu]] (1328-1398), was worried about the power of eunuchs. He erected a tablet that said, "Eunuchs must have nothing to do with administration", and he worked to disempower them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He warned, "Anyone using eunuchs as his eyes and ears will be blind and deaf". Despite these measures, many of emperors who followed Hongwu were more willing to leave ruling to the eunuchs, and the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Dynasty]] became the peak of eunuch influence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the end of the 15th century, there were 10,000 eunuchs working in the palace.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hucker|first=Charles O.|date=1958|title=Governmental Organization of The Ming Dynasty|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2718619|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=21|pages=1–66|doi=10.2307/2718619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to close access to the emperor and his wives and [[Concubinage|concubines]], they were often trusted with imperial sons. Oftentimes this trust extended to eunuchs being given command as palace guards, military commanders, or imperial inspectors. They controlled the court's luxury workshops and managed the [[Imperial Chinese Tributary System|tributes]] from the provinces and foreign countries, and they were often made the heads of official missions abroad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This power gave the eunuchs many chances to become rich through [[Graft (politics)|graft]]. They also eventually controlled the [[Eastern Depot|secret police]], which meant they could control the nation through blackmail and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=明清時代の政治と社会|last=小野|first=和子|publisher=京都大学人文科学研究所 中西印刷株式会社|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Rise to Power of the Eight Tigers ===
[[Zhengde Emperor|Emperor Zhengde]] ascended to the imperial throne in 1505, aged 14, after the death of [[Hongzhi Emperor|his father]].

From the early days of his rule it was clear that the young emperor distrusted government officials and was partial to eunuchs who took an active role in raising him. The emperor's inner circle consisted of 8 eunuchs who served him when he was still heir apparent and became his personal staff shortly after Zhengde began his reign. Shortly after the emperor's ascension to the throne, the Eight Tigers swiftly took control of important positions not only in the imperial court but in the secret service and the army. In addition to this, they appointed their relatives to influential ranks and roles in the dynasty.

One of the eunuchs, [[Liu Jin]], who would emerge as the leader of the group, was put in charge of palace music in early 1506, putting him in position of control over the emperor's entertainment. He excelled in this role, coming up with ideas for pastimes that proved to be much to the emperor's liking.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of China, Vol. 7: The Ming Dynasty, 1368-1644, Part 1|last=Mote|first=Frederick|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1988|isbn=0521243327|location=|pages=403–412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups within the imperial elites were alarmed with Liu Jin's promotion and the group's apparent influence over the young ruler, and so they began plotting against the Eight Tigers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Troubled Empire: China in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties|last=Brook|first=Timothy|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780674046023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[Grand Secretariat|grand secretaries]], inherited from the emperor's father and supported by the ministers, demanded the group's execution, while senior eunuchs insisted on banishment as a punishment that the Emperor would be more likely to consider. A joint plan was finally agreed upon and set in motion with a direct petition to the emperor, asking for Liu Jin's execution and banishment of the other members of the group from the imperial court.

Liu Jin was notified of the plot by one of his agents and led seven other eunuchs to ask for mercy before Emperor Zhengde on October 27, 1506.

The emperor heeded their plea, and on the following day it was announced that he would decide upon their fate at his leisure. All but one grand secretaries resigned immediately upon hearing the news and a number of senior officials followed suit.

The plot was averted and most checks on the eunuchs' power eliminated with it.

Liu Jin proceeded to retaliate against those who spoke out against him, leading to a string of dismissals, incidents of torture and imprisonments of a number of high government figures.

In February 1507, twenty-one officials who had protested the dismissal of the senior grand secretaries were beaten and reduced to the status of commoners.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

By the end of 1507 very few in the palace were willing to challenge the reign of terror of Liu Jin, who was known to many at the time as "Emperor Liu",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bandits, Eunuchs and the Son of Heaven: Rebellion and the Economy of Violence in Mid-Ming China|last=Robinson|first=David|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2001|isbn=0824823915|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his fellow eunuchs.

== Members ==

===Liu Jin 劉瑾 (1451-1510) ===
[[Liu Jin]] was from the area of [[Xingping]], [[Shaanxi]]. He was born on February 28, 1451 into the Tan family. His original name was Tan Jin. He considered himself very eloquent, so he decided to become a eunuch, as he considered that his best path to success. After becoming a eunuch, he was adopted by another eunuch named Liu, and changed his name to Liu Jin.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/649680414|title=Ming dai huan guan|last=Gongyi.|first=Wen,|last2=温功义.|date=2010|publisher=Zi jin cheng chu ban she|isbn=9787800479236|edition=Di 1 ban|location=Beijing Shi|oclc=649680414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began working in the imperial palace in the 1480s, where he began to consolidate the group that later became the Eight Tigers.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In 1492, he was removed from his post at the [[Chenghua Emperor|Chenghua emperor]]'s tomb to serve the new heir apparent, the future Zhengde emperor. Liu became a favorite of his, and he became the head of the bureau of bells and drums after Zhengde's rise to the throne in 1505. From there, Liu Jin gradually gained more power and influence, and became known as the leader of the Eight Tigers.

Most Ming and modern historians regard Liu Jin's rise to power as tyrannic and describe him as "rapacious, cruel, and wily".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Robinson, David M. ''Banditry and Rebellion in the Capital Region during the Mid-Ming (1450-1525)''. Dissertation, Princeton University, 1995. UMI, 9528935.&lt;/ref&gt; He became the Head of the [[Ming dynasty#Bureaus and offices for the imperial household|Directorate of Ceremonies]], in which role he was notorious for altering rescripts in transit to and from the emperor. This meant he essentially controlled what the emperor knew and what the emperor approved.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Tong, James W. ''Collective Violence in a Premodern Society: Rebellions and Banditry in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)''. Dissertation, University of Michigan, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he became the chief of the imperial staff, and became known for taking bribes from senior officials.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; For example, he required the thirteen provincial administration officials to pay him 20,000 [[tael]]s of silver when they visited the capital, three times a year.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; He also was very influential in the military. At the height of his power, all military actions had to be approved by him, giving him more power than the generals.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

After the re-establishment of the Western Depot under Gu Dayong, Liu Jin convinced the emperor to create the ''Neixinchang'', or Inner Branch Depot, which would supervise direct dangers to the throne and the emperor's safety. This Depot was made supervisor to the other two, the East and West Depots, thus consolidating Liu Jin's power. The depot persecuted many of the opponents to Liu Jin and his policies. It is estimated that more than one thousand people were killed by the Inner Branch Depot.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

From the money he gained through corruption, he went on to flaunt his glory and wealth by building a palace in his hometown.

During the fall of his reign, officials were sent to detain him and confiscate his belongings. During the house search, the officials found a total of 12,057,800 taels of gold and 259,583,600 taels of silver, as well as gems, false seals, and fans with concealed knives, ostensibly for use in his plot against the emperor.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; He was ordered to be executed by the punishment of [[Lingchi|death by a thousand cuts]]. He was cut 3,357 times over a period of three days.

=== Zhang Yong 張永情 (1470-1532) ===
Zhang Yong, a native of Xincheng, [[Baoding]], is fairly absent in historical records until his time in the Eight Tigers. During Emperor Zhengde's reign, he took control of many important posts and developed a tight bond between him and the Emperor. By doing this, he began to disregard the government's policies and plans. For instance, despite heavy opposition from the [[Ministry of Revenue (imperial China)|Ministry of Revenue]], he successfully acquired some privatised land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=三田村 |first1=泰助 |title=東洋史論叢 : 三田村博士古稀記念 |date=1980 |publisher=立命館大学人文学会 |location=京都}}&lt;/ref&gt; He controlled the [[Eastern Depot]], one of the secret police and intelligence operations that reported to the emperor. He also was given control of the Shen-Chi garrison, which had been established to practice with firearms.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Robert B.|date=1961|title=Eunuch Power in the Ming Dynasty|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4527509|journal=T'oung Pao|volume=49|issue=3|pages=115–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1510, Zhang Yong was appointed Supreme Commander of the military and sent to put down the [[Prince of Anhua rebellion|Prince of Anhua's rebellion]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

During Liu Jin's reign, Zhang Yong was his right-hand in the battlefield and at home. He did not get along with Liu Jin, but could not be removed from power due to his military prowess. He conspired with [[Yang Yiqing]] to remove Liu Jin from power,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and became the most powerful member of the remaining Eight Tiger's after Liu Jin's death.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In October 1511, he asked the emperor to allow him to select 6,000 troops from the Capital Garrison reserves to be specially trained as assault forces for times of crisis. The emperor approved the request due to his need to fight the rebel forces of Liu the Sixth.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In July 1514, Zhang Yong was put in charge of an operation to defend against [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasion.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

However, after Emperor Zhengde's death, his status fell to that of a regular eunuch,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=w1PsYGwQdesC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;lpg=PP2&amp;dq=29+chinese+mysteries+roy+bates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=63JU_yUuSB&amp;sig=1-KWfC_lGzU8RJyzlzQ9klZZh64&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo1LD0qezbAhVHQN4KHSyMCq8Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=29%20chinese%20mysteries%20roy%20bates&amp;f=false|title=29 Chinese Mysteries|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780557006199|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was ordered to retire by the new emperor, [[Jiajing Emperor|Jiajing.]]&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However, by 1529 he had begun to regain some power, and was made the Grand Secretary of Integrated Divisions. He died shortly after this appointment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Gao Feng 高鳳 (died 1526) ===
After the fall of Liu Jin, Gao Feng was made one of the new heads of the Directorate of Ceremonies,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; along with Wei Bin.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Besides this, information on Gao Feng is limited.

=== Ma Yongcheng 馬永成 (1468-1526) ===
Ma Yongcheng was from the [[Bazhou, Hebei|Bazhou]] or [[Wen'an County|Wenan]] area. He grew rich off of the [[Banditry|bandit]] situation, accepting bribes from them so they could gain favor with the emperor.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ma Yongcheng took control of the Eastern Depot, which operated as a spy and secret police agency during the Ming dynasty.

=== Gu Dayong 谷大用 ===
Gu Dayong is known for his place at the head of the Western Depot, a secret-police style intelligence agency. Emperor Zhengde reopened it in 1506&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; after 25 years of dormancy, with Gu Dayong as its leader, due to his desire to have a more comprehensive intelligence agency. The Western Depot was closed down after Liu Jin's arrest, although Emperor Zhengde still considered Gu Dayong quite favorably.

In August 1511, Gu Dayong was appointed overall superintendent of military affairs, and he led a group of troops south of the capital to fight the rebel forces of the Liu brothers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As a reward for defeating the rebellion, his younger and older brothers became earls.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Members of his family assumed important positions and roles inside the dynasty. For instance, Gu Dayong's father was given the right to command the [[Embroidered Uniform Guard]] alongside Zhang Young's father.

He also worked in charitable construction projects in [[Peking]]. In 1508, he donated a large bell to the [[Taoism|Daoist]] [[White Cloud Temple|Baiyunguan]] (White Cloud Temple), which had built a new hall. In 1510 and 1512, he restored the Southern Park's Lingtongmiao, the Yanfasi outside of the city's western gate, and the Huguosi (so that it could house Central Asian monks). He used donations from the emperor and the imperial family to carry out these projects, which seem to have been authorized and requested by the emperor. Gu Dayong also seems to have chosen at least one of his one projects, restoring an old temple in the far [[Western Hills]], turning it into "a bright and glittering precinct".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41368371|title=Peking : temples and city life, 1400-1900|last=Susan.|first=Naquin,|date=2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520219910|location=Berkeley|oclc=41368371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of the Zhengde Emperor, he was temporarily honored, before being banished to [[Nanjing|Nanking]], where he died.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Qiu Ju 丘聚 ===
He was in charge of the Eastern Depot, but lost his job after the arrest of Liu Jin. He does not have any of his own records, but is only mentioned sometimes in biographies of the other Eight Tigers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Besides this, information on Qiu Ju is limited.

=== Wei Bin 魏彬 ===
Wei Bin was given command of the ''san qian ying'' (三千營) garrison, which was made of 3,000 [[Barbarian#China|barbarians]] who had surrendered to the throne.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Wei Bin is also known for building the Hongshangshi. He used divination to find a suitable burial place in Peking's southern suburbs, and built Hongshangshi there in 1514. The land was officially endowed by the emperor, and the temple became known as Sir Wei's Temple. It was famous for its [[Crab Apple|crab-apple]] orchards and other unusual trees.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After Liu Jin's execution, Wei Bin was made one of the heads of the Directorate of Ceremonial,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; along with Gao Feng.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Wei Bin was made to retire upon the ascension of the Jiajing Emperor.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Luo Xiang 羅祥 ===
There is almost no available information on Luo Xiang, although it is known that he was a member of the Eight Tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Ming/personsbahu.html|title=The Eight Tigers 八虎 (www.chinaknowledge.de)|last=Theobald|first=Ulrich|website=www.chinaknowledge.de|language=en|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political Influence ==

=== The Zhengde Emperor ===
[[File:明武宗.jpg|thumb|The Zhengde Emperor, also known as Emperor Wuzong]]
At the beginning of the Zhengde Emperor's reign, Liu Jin and seven other eunuchs who had served him were added to his personal staff. He ignored the advice of his grand secretaries, who told him to limit the roles of his eunuchs in government. Having been raised by eunuchs, he liked them, and, starting in 1506, he gave them important financial and military roles. He enjoyed spending time with them, practicing riding, archery, wrestling, and music.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Geiss, J. (1988). The Cheng-te reign, 1506–1521. In F. Mote &amp; D. Twitchett (Eds.), ''The Cambridge History of China'' (The Cambridge History of China, pp. 403-439). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CHOL9780521243322.009&lt;/ref&gt; Liu Jin was responsible for palace entertainment, and "provided dancing, wrestling matches, a menagerie of exotic animals, and of course music". He also encouraged the Zhengde Emperor to leave the palace in disguise to explore the streets of [[Peking]], which the emperor grew to love. He was thus disinterested in ruling his own government, so he began to leave matters of state solely to his eunuchs.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Since he didn't want to deal with manners of state, he left most of the empire's affairs to the eunuchs. For instance, he needed money to implement various imperial projects, but did not want to use his personal funds, so he listened to and implemented the ideas of the Eight Tigers, which mostly meant raising new taxes.

Although Zhengde spent all his money and time on palace entertainments, the Eight Tigers never criticized him and always obeyed his wishes, which caused him to trust them greatly. One example of this is when, in 1516, he decided he wanted to leave the imperial palace and move to [[Xuanhua District|Xuanhua]] for a more entertaining life. Since his grand secretaries and many other officials opposed this, he was prevented from doing so. On September 8, 1517, he attempted the move again, instructing Gu Dayong not to let anyone else follow him past the [[Juyong Pass|Juyong pass]] on the way to Xuanhua. Due to Gu Dayong's dutiful execution of this order, the other government officials could do nothing but wait until the emperor got bored with his new life and returned to Peking in 1518.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Zhengde's trust in his eunuchs transcended many attempts to remove the Eight Tigers from power. He gave them [[dragon robe]]s to wear, which symbolized that they were immune to charges for any crimes they might have committed.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The only real challenge to this trust manifested in the arrest of Liu Jin, who had always been his favorite, and was accomplished only with the help of all the other Eight Tigers.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Policies and Reforms ===
'''Government Control'''

After the failed 1506 petition to remove the Eight Tigers from power, Liu Jin began removing anyone opposed to him from power. In March 1507, he issued an edict that made he and the other Eight Tigers equal in rank and authority to the highest provincial officials, as well as the right to investigate any administrative or judicial matter. All official documents had to be approved by him first before they could be sent to the ministries or grand secretariat. He also broke custom by sentencing officials to punishment by [[cangue]] for minor offenses, namely not acknowledging his authority, which had previously never been used on officials, and only for serious crimes. Liu Jin had control of the imperial administration in both the capital and the provinces by the summer of 1507.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
[[File:Dragon robe - Taiping Kingdom History Museum.jpg|thumb|The dragon robe which the Zhengde emperor gifted to the Eight Tigers to wear, even though it had traditionally been a privilege reserved only for royalty&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;]]
The eunuchs were able to expand their roles within the palace to control the rest of the government structure. Many of these positions became available for the Eight Tigers after the governmental purge after the 1506 petition. For instance, the eunuch Director of Ceremonial usually controlled the Western or Eastern Depots, as well as the [[Embroidered Uniform Guard|Embroidered-Uniform guard]], who "exercised almost unlimited police and governmental authority", with a greatly feared prison.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The Depots, which were intelligence and terror organizations, were run by the Eight Tigers. Qiu Ju ran the [[Eastern Depot]], Gu Dayong ran the Western Depot, and Liu Jin ran the Inner Branch Depot. Many suspects, including Imperial Ministers, censors, soldiers, and civilians, were arrested, beaten heavily, and sometimes killed. The Inner Branch Depot's embroidered-uniform guards conducted much of the beating and torture. Those arrested number in the several thousands.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The Western and Inner Branch Depots were shut down after Liu Jin's arrest for extortion, although the emperor remained fond of Gu Dayong and contemplated reopening the Western Depot. There was too much backlash, however, and it remained closed.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The Eastern Depot, on the other hand, remained operational for the next few years, under different directors, until its disbandment after Emperor Zhengde's death.

When he was in power, Liu Jin managed to drastically change government structure in the favor of him and his fellow eunuchs, but he was aiming for much more that was never realized. He wanted to create an empire where eunuchs were the superiors of every official in every branch of government, a scale which would have been unprecedented in Chinese history. Most of his radical reforms to this end are not known, because they were rigorously opposed by the civil officials and so were never implemented.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

'''Financial'''

In 1506, Liu Jin was given the task of raising revenue for the emperor. He claimed that the decline in revenues was due to mismanagement and corruption, and decided to run a general investigation and fine the ineffective officials.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Liu Jin implemented many new taxes and worked against corruption and ineffectiveness of government officials. He also became known for accepting large bribes.

For example, in June 1508, Liu ordered grain inventory inspections. He dispatched secretaries and censors around China to see how much fodder and hay had been purchased, as well as if it had been changed for silver or remained in storage in the warehouses. He also targeted abuses by the local elites, punishing ineffectual officials with jail time or heavy fines paid in grain, which was then shipped to the north and west.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In [[Fujian|Fukien]] and [[Sichuan|Szechwan]], Liu Jin added a [[surtax]] on silver mines, event though the officials had reported that there was no more silver in them. Since he gave heavy fines to officials who displeased him, many began to pay him bribes to avoid those fines.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Liu Jin also implemented surveys of the military agricultural colonies, which is what eventually led to the [[Prince of Anhua rebellion]] in 1510.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Resistance to the Eight Tigers ===
'''Early Opposition'''

Censor Jiang Qin objected to Liu Jin driving important officials out of office. Calling Liu Jin "a minor servant", he questioned why the emperor should trust Liu Jin so fully when everyone else hated and feared him. He also stated he would give his head if it meant removing Liu Jin from power. For these statements, Jiang Qin was given 30 lashes and imprisoned. Three days later, he again urged Zhengde to execute Liu Jin, but he was beaten again. Finally, after a final flogging, he died.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

After Liu Jin was appointed the head of the imperial household in June 1506, the grand secretaries were alarmed. They questioned the action but were ignored.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Han Wen's 1506 Petition ====
The first real plan to remove Liu Jin from power came from other, senior eunuchs who felt threatened by his influence. They wanted him either banished to [[Nanjing|Nanking]] or executed. On October 27, 1506, Han Wen, the minister of revenue, submitted a petition to the emperor, requesting that he execute the Eight Tigers. The emperor was unwilling to consider this. Minister of personal Hsu Chin warned that the emperor would not change his mind on so drastic a request, but the grand secretaries were resolute, and convinced the senior eunuchs to get the emperor to sign the petition. The court officials agreed to ask the emperor to carry out the sentence on the morning of October 28.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

However, one of Liu Chin's agents in the court told him about the plan. On the night of October 27, the Eight Tigers begged the emperor for mercy. Liu Jin told the emperor that it was all a conspiracy and that the eunuch Director of Ceremonial was cooperating with the grand secretaries to limit the emperor's power. The emperor believed Liu Jin, and removed the conspirators from their posts, designating Liu Jin as Director of Ceremonial. The rest of the Eight Tigers took over several other important eunuch agency and military positions. The deposed senior eunuchs were banished to Nanking, but were assassinated en route.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

On October 28, 1506, the morning the court had agreed would be the end of the Eight Tigers, the officials realized that something was strange when they were all summoned to the morning audience. A senior official announced that the emperor had decided he would decide what to do about the Eight Tigers by himself. Almost all the grand secretaries then resigned, realizing the battle was lost, and Liu Jin accepted the resignations personally.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Liu Jin went on to consolidate his control and exact revenge over those who had opposed him. He framed Han Wen for fraud, and dismissed him on December 13, 1506. In February 1507, the twenty-one senior officials who had protested the removal of the grand secretaries were beaten and given commoner status. From then on, officials who opposed Liu Jin were beaten, tortured, and dismissed.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== 1508 Anonymous Letter ====
On July 23, 1508, a group of eunuchs submitted an anonymous letter to the emperor about Liu Jin's crimes. Liu Jin thought it must have been written by an official, and began investigating them, arresting all the palace officials. He released them once he discovered a eunuch had written the letter, and then he established a security agency to investigate them. He banished the eunuchs involved to Nanking.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== The Prince of Anhua Rebellion====
Liu Jin raised the tax rate in [[Shaanxi]], and he had tax delinquents arrested and beaten.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This angered the soldiers in the province. The local prince, [[Prince Anhua]], was already angry about the power of the eunuchs. He believed that they gained their positions through persuasiveness, not through any real helpfulness to the empire.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Therefore, Prince Anhua decided to take the opportunity to rebel. On May 12, 1510, he held a banquet, then had the soldiers come in and kill the officials, officers, and eunuchs in attendance. He then announced he was raising an army to defeat Liu Jin. However, the rebellion only lasted 19 days before he was betrayed by one of his own cavalry commanders. Zhang Yong and [[Yang Yiqing]], who had been dispatched to defeat the rebellion, arrived to escort the prince back to the capital for his execution.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Internal Opposition to Liu Jin ====
Liu Jin was not on good terms with Zhang Yong, who could not be removed from his post like Liu Jin's other enemies due to his military prowess. Liu Jin considered himself the dictator of the rest of the Eight Tigers, and often delegated the work he did not want to do to them.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; This attitude caused the rest of the Eight Tigers to resent him as well.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This rift led to the eventual toppling of Liu Jin.

== Fall from Power ==

=== Liu Jin ===
By 1510 the relations between Liu Jin and Zhang Yong have significantly deteriorated. As an inspector of the army Zhang Yong was sent to [[Shaanxi]] to oversee the suppression of the [[Prince of Anhua rebellion]] by the imperial forces. His companion during the travels was [[Yang Yiqing]], the supreme commander of the army, who was once forced out of office by Liu Jin in 1507 and held a grudge against him. Yang Yiquing managed to convince the eunuch that Liu Jin was planning an operation that would put Zhang Yong's life in danger.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He claimed that Liu Jin was planning to assassinate the emperor and put his own grand-nephew on the throne, and that the plan would begin on September 17, 1510.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

On September 13, the emperor held a banquet with the Eight Tigers, and Liu Jin left first. Zhang Yong told the emperor about Liu Jiu's plan, and he and the rest of the Eight Tigers convinced him to send guards to arrest Liu Jin and confiscate his property. The emperor decided he was guilty when he saw Liu Jin's hordes of wealth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

At his trial, Liu Jin at first tried his normal tactics of controlling those who defied him. He appealed to the people who he claimed he had helped over the years, saying they owed him. When an imperial consort asked why he had so much armor hidden away if not to attack the emperor, he stopped speaking. The emperor was convinced, and Liu Jin was sentenced to [[Lingchi|death by a thousand cuts]]. The execution began on September 27 and lasted for 3 days. His property was taken and used to prop up the emperor's finances.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== After Liu Jin ===
The execution of Liu Jin, which took place in 1510, greatly diminished the ability of the group to influence emperor's decisions. The system built by Liu Jin that bestowed significant authority upon the eunuchs was swiftly dismantled by the government officials after his death.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, the Zhengde emperor continued to entrust the remaining members of the Eight Tigers with authority. He still needed financial security, so he gave the eunuchs the power to take whatever supplies and labor they needed from civil officials,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; in order to make their jobs easier. He appointed Wei Bin and Gao Feng as the new Directors of Ceremonial, and had the rest continue to run the garrisons and surveillance agencies.

After the death of the Zhengde emperor, many of the Eight Tigers were banished.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholars viewed the eunuchs as usurpers, as they rose to power independent of the [[Imperial examination|examination system]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Additionally, the imperial censors, who sometimes criticized powerful eunuchs directly to the emperor, viewed the defeat of Liu Jin as a victory for the strength of China's empire. In 1624, [[Censorate|censor]] Yang Lien implored the emperor to impeach eunuch [[Wei Zhongxian]] in a letter which said that eunuchs must be kept from interfering in anything outside palace life. He mentioned Liu Jin: "Even such arrogant and lawless eunuchs as [[Wang Zhen (eunuch)|Wang Zhen]] and Liu Jin were promptly executed. Thus the dynasty lasted until today".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the histories, written by the Confucian scholars, eunuchs, including the Eight Tigers and especially Liu Jin, are portrayed negatively. Liu Jin is blamed for the outbreak of rebellions at the end of Emperor Zhengde's reign. In the earliest complete narrative of the 1510 rebellion, "Rebellion Quelled at Jianghuai", written in 1513, Wang Ao argued that Liu Jin was responsible for the rebellion, writing, "In the early Zhengde reign, the traitorous eunuch unlawfully seized the power of the sovereign. By [his] cruel punishments and tyranny, [he] poisoned all within the seas. All within the seas was confused and in upheaval. [When] the traitorous eunuch was executed, the masses of bandits/rebels arose". In Jianghai jianqu ji, Zhu Yunming asserted that Liu Jin's abuses pushed the empire to rebellion.

One Ming historian who portrays Liu Jin in a more positive light is Liao Xinyi in "A Brief Study of Liu Jin's 'Change of Established Regulations", in which he argues that the grain inventory inspections were motivated more by the need to supplement the grain of the northern and western borders than by a desire by Liu Jin to extract bribes or revenge.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In the ''Veritable Records of Wuzong'', Liu Jin is again described in a very negative way. There seems to be disagreement on his relation to the rebellions, for while it is agreed that he sometimes worked tirelessly to stop banditry, it is also sometimes claimed that he was personally linked to the bandits and supported them in their rebellions. It is true that rebellions rose along with Liu Jin's fall, but the relationship between those events is unclear.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Nishimura Gensho, the leading Japanese scholar of the 1510 rebellion, attributes the rebellion to the weakness of Emperor Zhengde as his court was overrun by scheming eunuchs. He claims that the extensive intelligence network run by the eunuchs caused the empire to fall into a period of panic, and that the imperial estates uprooted peasants from their land and livelihoods, lending more support to the rebellion.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== The Powerful Eunuch ===
The dragon cloaks worn by the emperor's chosen Eight Tigers came to symbolize great power, which was desirable to young men trying to make a career. The Eight Tigers convinced many young boys and men to become castrated, as they believed that was the path towards a successful life.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

Overall, the Eight Tigers add credence to the many stories told in the classical Chinese histories and in modern scholarship about how much power eunuchs had in imperial China. In a book of classical Chinese tales, the Eight Tigers and their infamy are mentioned several times. A few examples: Liu Jin, as head of the Inner Branch Depot, was powerful enough to demand that officials kneel before him and to order flogging punishments, sometimes until death. The Inner Branch Depot is infamous for arresting people numbering in the several thousands. It also mentions the Eastern Depot, calling it an "imperial terror establishment" and "[[Gestapo]]-like organization".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Classical Culture ===
Liu Jin is featured in several plays and novels.

Hang Kai, who was instrumental in Lin Jiu's removal from power, wrote many plays featuring Liu Jin, as they were both from [[Xinping Yi and Dai Autonomous County|Xinping]].

However, the most famous play with Liu Jin, Famensi ([[Famen Temple]]) became popular during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]], its earliest known record in 1845. This classic [[Peking opera|Peking Opera]] included the lines, "My last name is Liu, my first name is Jin… At age seven, I was castrated and entered the imperial palace two years later… I helped Emperor Zhengde ascend the throne". In the play, Liu Jin is a painted-face role (xiahualian), whose face is painted red to indicate Liu Jin's "rough characteristics and compelling power".

Famen Temple tells the story of a famous murder case. The murderers got away, and an innocent man was falsely accused, by Liu Jin ordered the court to be reviewed, which led to the punishment of the perpetrators. Throughout the play, he is decisive, but his decisions are backed up or checked by the [[Empress Zhang (Hongzhi)|Empress Dowager]]. The play thus portrays Liu Jin in a relatively positive light. Famen Temple is a famous classic opera, and was a favorite of [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]. It has a famous video recording from 1950 and a few famous audio recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/china/beijing-english/20170803/281560880882015|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two novels written in the [[Qing dynasty]] feature Liu Jin in a treacherous plot. In ''Bajian qixia wuyi pingmen qianhou zhuan'' and ''Sanmenjie'', Liu Jin lures the emperor from the capital's safety to [[Suzhou]], promising him beautiful women and scenery. Using his connections with three bandit chiefs, who have an army of ten-thousand men based in [[Qingzhou]], [[Shandong]], Liu Jin has the imperial entourage attacked. The emperor is saved by the bravery of a set of fraternal twins.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The '''Facebook real-name policy controversy''' refers to the controversy over [[Social networking service|social networking]] site [[Facebook]]{{'}}s "[[real-name system]]" dictating how people register their accounts and configure their [[user profile]]s.  The controversy stems from a policy that those who have been adversely affected describe as penalizing users who are in fact using their real names which Facebook has nevertheless deemed to be "fake", while simultaneously allowing anyone to create fake yet plausible-sounding names, as well as obviously implausible-sounding names comprising word combinations that Facebook's software fails to recognize as unlikely to be real because their alleged nonstandard spelling or confusion with fictional characters. Facebook furthermore prohibits users from accurately representing names which according to the site have "too many words", and prohibits initializing first names, preventing users who do so in real life from formatting their own names as they see fit.

== Background ==
The social networking website [[Facebook]] has maintained the [[real-name system]] policy for user profiles.  According to Facebook, the real-name policy stems from the position "that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/16/living/facebook-name-policy/ |title=Facebook 'real name' policy stirs questions around identity |last=Grinberg |first=Emanuella |date=September 18, 2014 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576|title=What names are allowed on Facebook?|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise per this policy, a "real name" is defined by "your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, driver's license or student ID."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apologizes-for-real-name-policy-2014-10|title=Facebook Apologizes For 'Real Name' Policy That Forced Drag Queens To Change Their Profiles|last=Levy|first=Karyne|date=October 1, 2014|work=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Facebook estimated that more than 83&amp;nbsp;million Facebook accounts are fake accounts.&lt;ref name="usa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook: About 83 million accounts are fake |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-08-03/cnbc-facebook-fake-accounts/56759964/1 |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this revelation, the share price of Facebook dropped below $20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook share price slumps below $20 amid fake account flap |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/02/facebook-share-price-slumps-20-dollars |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |location=London |first=Dominic |last=Rushe |date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has asserted that "authentic identity is important to the Facebook experience, and our goal is that every account on Facebook should represent a real person."&lt;ref name="usa" /&gt;

However, after reaching out to Facebook, they instead deactivated her account without explanation.

====Chamoru====
In the Spanish-influenced indigenous [[Chamoru]] culture of the [[Marianas]], the standard naming convention has historically been for a person to use their mother's [[maiden name]] as their middle name. (Chamoru culture, having been colonized by Spain, went through a period where indigenous names and naming conventions were forcibly eradicated and replaced by what the conquering Spanish deemed acceptable.) Furthermore, using one's full name rather than simply the first and last is commonplace, if only for disambiguation purposes due to a relatively small pool of surnames. Therefore, middle names such as De Leon Guerrero and De La Cruz are frequently encountered. However, attempting to register such names as one's middle name results in a message telling users that "Names can't have too many words." Therefore, many Chamoru users are forced to either run all of the words together as if they were one single word, or to initialize each word to a common acronym such as DLG or DLC.

In cases where the acronym is employed, Facebook automatically changes to lower-case all letters except the first. (Use of periods, e.g. D.L.G., will result in a message telling users that "Profile names can't have too many periods.") Therefore, someone commonly known in real life by a name such as Mary De Leon Guerrero Mafnas would have to resort to using what on Facebook would end up being "Mary Dlg Mafnas". The message is not accompanied by an option to challenge/appeal the restriction or to send Facebook documentation that the format is how one normally formats their name in real life.

====Vietnamese====
In January 2015, a 23-year-old Australian bank employee claiming to be named Phuc Dat Bich posted a photo of his passport identification page to Facebook, protesting that the company had unfairly shut down his account for being "false and misleading".&lt;ref name=BBCBich&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-34897404|title=Phuc Dat Bich: Australian with 'misleading' name thanks supporters|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?" he asked. The BBC reported that in Vietnamese the name is pronounced similarly to "Phoo Da Bi" (IPA: [[Help:IPA/Vietnamese|{{ipa|/fukp˦˥ ɗat˩ ɓic˦˥/}}]]).&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; After his reinstatement, Bich posted a thank you note to supportive Facebook fans, stating he was "glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous".&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; Subsequently "Phuc Dat" published a further message admitting it was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phuc Dat Bich admits hoax in Facebook name battle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-34918491|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=BBC|date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tamils====
Tamils do not have surnames: They have their father or mother or both father and mother's first name as initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bumpahead.net/tamil-name-structure-10dd63730563|title=Tamil name structure… |author=moulee|date=19 July 2009|publisher=bumpahead.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard naming practice has not been acknowledged by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/facebook-should-scrap-its-regressive-real-names-policy/article7797302.ece|title=Really harassed by Facebook’s ‘real names’|author=G. Sampath|date=24 October 2015|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=15 April 2018|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender users===
Facebook's real-name policy does not reflect adopted names or [[pseudonym]]s used by the [[transgender]] community, and has led to suspending users with real names that might be thought to be fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-05-25/business/20872135_1_accounts-with-fake-names-facebook-facebook-guidelines-and-features|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=Barbara|last=Ortutay|date=May 25, 2009|title=Real users caught in Facebook fake-name purge|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A user via the anonymous [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] app [[Secret (app)|Secret]] began reporting "fake names" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the [[stage name]]s of [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still freezing accounts despite apology to drag queens over 'real names.'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/17/facebook-still-freezing-accounts-despite-apology-drag-queens-real-names|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people have also been affected by the policy, including one former Facebook employee who initiated development on Facebook's custom gender options, who was suspended on the day the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://medium.com/@zip/my-name-is-only-real-enough-to-work-at-facebook-not-to-use-on-the-site-c37daf3f4b03|title=My name is only real enough to work at Facebook, not use on the site|publisher=[[Medium.com]]|author=Zip|date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/06/28/woman-responsible-for-facebook-gender-options-kicked-off-for-violating-real-names-policy/|title=Woman responsible for Facebook gender options kicked off for violating real names policy|date=June 28, 2015|first=Naith|last=Payton|publisher=[[Pink News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to gender non-conforming activist D. Dragonetti, Facebook even disregarded their government identification when supplied.{{Better source|date=March 2015|reason=Daily Dot.  This is an opinion piece.  Author admits the article is about his/her personal experience, and it may or may not be completely factual or verifiable}}&lt;ref name="Daily Dot"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dragonetti| first1=D.| title=Is Facebook easing up on its 'real names' policy—or cracking down? | work=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=October 20, 2014|accessdate=October 23, 2014|url= http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/facebook-real-names-cracking-down-transgender/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2014, [[Chris Cox (Facebook)|Chris Cox]], Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology to the LGBT community and drag kings and queens: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.&lt;ref name="chriscoxpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.cox/posts/10101301777354543|title=Chris Cox - I want to apologize to the affected community of drag...|last=Cox|first=Chris|date=October 1, 2014|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Users target of religious persecution ===
Secular, atheist, agnostic, humanist, or users who comment or blog expressing views critical of particular religions, sects or religion in general, as well as religious people who express the opposing views critical of atheism or agnosticism very often have a legitimate need to use an alias. Some of these users could suffer rejection, retaliation or violence if their views – contrary to those of their family, friends or community – are known. In some cases, secular bloggers are exposed to imprisonment by an intolerant government, violent attacks in the street or even being killed by religious fanatics. Examples are the incarceration of activist and blogger [[Raif Badawi]] in Saudi Arabia and a string of attacks and murders of secular activists in [[Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] or Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/abdullah-sharif/pakistans-religious-extremism_b_9577338.html|title=Pakistan's Religious Extremism: A World Menace|first=Abdullah|last=Sharif|date=1 April 2016|website=huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
International non-profit [[digital rights]] group [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] stated they were "alarmed to hear that Facebook's 'real name' policy is disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ community."&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/facebooks-real-name-policy-can-cause-real-world-harm-lgbtq-community |title=Facebook's 'Real Name' Policy Can Cause Real-World Harm for the LGBTQ Community |last1=Kayyali |last2=York |first1=Nadia |first2=Jillian |date=September 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Online magazine]] ''[[Queerty]]'' called Facebook's policy "a frankly creepy overreach of authority", adding "There are a million reasons why someone would choose to self-identify with a name other than the one that's printed on their birth certificate. And really, it's absolutely none of your business in the first place."&lt;ref name="Queerty"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.queerty.com/facebook-targeting-drag-queens-forcing-them-to-use-their-legal-names-20140911 |title=Facebook Targeting Drag Queens, Forcing Them To Use Their Legal Names |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 11, 2014 |work=[[Queerty]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for MAGE Magazine, Second Life entrepreneur Jennifer Ceara Firehawk stated: "If we are not using our page to abuse or grief others they just need to leave us be. We are not hurting anyone…  FB does not realize some SL people earn lindens to turn into RL (real life) money and that is how they make a living. Once you force a person to change the SL name they will lose money due to not being able to find them on FB or SL as they may use FB for their buisness [sic] or advertise. So they end up losing buisness [sic] and money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://0zymandius.wix.com/magemagazine#!September-18-The-Day-F-Book-killed-the-King-Part-1/c112t/55fc2bae0cf256c0bf936f60|title=The Day F Book killed the King : Part 1|date=September 18, 2015|first=Ian|last=Thomson|magazine=MAGE Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compromise to protect those with special circumstances  ==
On December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/12/community-support-fyi-improving-the-names-process-on-facebook/|title=Community Support FYI: Improving the Names Process on Facebook |last1=Osofsky |first1=Jason |last2=Gage |first2=Todd |date=December 15, 2015 |website=Facebook Newsroom |publisher=Facebook |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/facebook-modifies-real-names-policy-testing-use-of-assumed-names-1.2702400 |title=Facebook modifies 'real names' policy, testing use of assumed names |last=AFP |date=December 16, 2015 |website=CTV News |publisher=Bell Media |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their "special circumstance" or "unique situation" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/15/facebook-change-controversial-real-name-policy?subid=17310058&amp;CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2 |title=Facebook changes controversial 'real name' policy in wake of criticism  |last1=Holpuch |first1=Amanda |date=December 15, 2015 |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was criticised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pointed out that it forces the most vulnerable users to reveal intimate details of their personal lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/changes-facebooks-real-names-policy-still-dont-fix-problem|title=Changes to Facebook’s "Real Names" Policy Still Don’t Fix the Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as of January 2018, there is no evidence in Facebook's policies that this measure was ever implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/229715077154790?helpref=related|title=What other names are allowed on Facebook?|publisher=Facebook|access-date=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Flag of the President of Azerbaijan was confirmed by the decree №828 of the [[President of Azerbaijan]] on “The Standard (flag) of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan” dated September 15, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://azertag.az/xeber/Sentyabrin_15_de_Prezident_Ilham_Aliyev_Azerbaycan_Respublikasi_Prezidentinin_standarti_bayragi_haqqinda_Ferman_imzalamisdir-418434|title=President of Azerbaijan signs Decree on Presidential Standard of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-04-19|archive-url=https://azertag.az/xeber/Sentyabrin_15_de_Prezident_Ilham_Aliyev_Azerbaycan_Respublikasi_Prezidentinin_standarti_bayragi_haqqinda_Ferman_imzalamisdir-418434|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree came into force on the same day of its issuance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://e-qanun.az/alpidata/framework/data/15/f_15400.htm|title=Decree on the Presidential Standard of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=e-qanun.az|archive-url=http://e-qanun.az/alpidata/framework/data/15/f_15400.htm|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/remz_bayraq.pdf|title=Standard of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=Administrative Department of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Presidential Library|archive-url=http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/remz_bayraq.pdf|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
[[File:Inauguration Ceremony 2013.jpg|thumb|Inauguration ceremony of the President of Azerbaijan with Flag of Azerbaijan (left) and Presidential Flag (right)]]
According to the Decree, the Standard of the President of Azerbaijan is the official symbol of the [[President of Azerbaijan]]. The original version of the Presidential Standard is kept in the office of the President at the Presidential Palace. The duplicates of Presidential Flag can be placed, hung or raised on the buildings of Presidential Palace and Presidential residences; also can be placed in the halls or rooms of Presidential Palace or Presidential residences if any official event is intended to be conducted in the presence of the President; on other premises when the President of Azerbaijan is visiting; in the halls or on the building, where official or other types of events are being held with the participation of the [[President of Azerbaijan]]; and on the vehicles of the President.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Presidential flag is also used during inaugural ceremony. It is brought onto the stage by the soldiers of the Armed Forces under the accompaniment of the ceremonial march during inauguration ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.president.az/articles/9667|title=Official inauguration of Ilham Aliyev 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=en.president.az|language=en|archive-url=https://en.president.az/articles/9667|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://azertag.az/xeber/XALQA_VATANA_VA_DOVLATA_SADAQAT_ANDI_AZARBAYCAN_RESPUBLIKASININ_PREZIDENTI_ILHAM_ALIYEVIN_ANDICHMA_MARASIMI-422046|title=Inauguration ceremony of the President of Azerbaijan (2008)|last=|first=|date=|work=AZERBAIJAN STATE NEWS AGENCY|access-date=2018-04-19|archive-url=https://azertag.az/xeber/XALQA_VATANA_VA_DOVLATA_SADAQAT_ANDI_AZARBAYCAN_RESPUBLIKASININ_PREZIDENTI_ILHAM_ALIYEVIN_ANDICHMA_MARASIMI-422046|archive-date=2018-04-19|dead-url=|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The Presidential Flag is like a square version of the tricolor [[Flag of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani flag]] with the [[National emblem of Azerbaijan|Coat of Arm of Azerbaijan]] on both sides of red stripe instead of white crescent and eight-pointed star. The Presidential Flag is framed with golden fringes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is silver cord attached to the pole of the Presidential Flag illustrating the full name of the [[President of Azerbaijan]] and the date of his term of office. The pole of the flag is covered with a metal hood in crescent and 8 point star shape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Forgotten Ten''' ({{lang-ga|An Deichniúr Dearmadta}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.com/the_forgotten_ten__an_deichni%C3%BAr_dearmadta_part_1|title=The Forgotten Ten An Deichniúr Dearmadta Part 1|work=World News|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the term applied to ten members of the [[Irish Republican Army]] who were executed in [[Mountjoy Prison]], [[Dublin]] by British forces following [[court martial|courts martial]] from 1920–21 during the [[Irish War of Independence]].

Based upon military law at the time, they were buried within the prison precincts, their graves unmarked in the [[Consecration|unconsecrated ground]].  The names of the Forgotten Ten are [[Kevin Barry]], [[Patrick Moran (Irish republican)|Patrick Moran]], [[Frank Flood]], [[Thomas Whelan]], [[Thomas Traynor]], [[Patrick Doyle (Irish republican)|Patrick Doyle]], [[Edmond Foley]], Thomas Bryan, Bernard Ryan, and Patrick Maher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.ie/history.htm A Brief History Of The National Graves Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120173433/http://www.nga.ie/history.htm |date=November 20, 2007 }}, nga.ie; accessed 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The executioner was [[John Ellis (executioner)|John Ellis]], one of the United Kingdom's hangmen at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/ireland.html Southern Irish executions 1900-1954], capitalpunishmentuk.org; accessed 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign for reburial==
Following the [[Irish War of Independence]], Mountjoy Prison was transferred to the control of the [[Irish Free State]], which became the State of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1937. In the 1920s, the families of the dead men requested their remains be returned to them for proper burial. This effort was joined in the later 1920s by the [[National Graves Association]].  Through the efforts of the Association, the graves of the men were identified in 1934, and in 1996 a [[Celtic cross]] was erected in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] to commemorate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.ie/history.htm Source 1. above] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120173433/http://www.nga.ie/history.htm |date=November 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State funeral==
[[Image:The Forgotten Ten.jpg|thumb|The grave of nine of the Forgotten Ten in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin]]
The campaign to rebury the men dragged on for 80 years from their deaths. Following an intense period of negotiations, the Irish government relented. Plans to exhume the bodies of the 10 men were announced on 1 November 2000, the 80th anniversary of the execution of Kevin Barry. On 14 October 2001, the Forgotten Ten were afforded full state honours, with a private service at Mountjoy Prison for the families of the dead, a [[requiem mass]] at [[St Mary's Pro-Cathedral]] and burial in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', some criticised the event as glorifying militant [[Irish republicanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/15/northernireland.ireland Dublin State Funeral for IRA Men], Guardian.co.uk; accessed 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It coincided with the [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Ardfheis|party conference]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/15/northernireland.ireland|title=Dublin state funeral for IRA men|author=Rosie Cowan|work=the Guardian|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The progress of the cortège through the centre of Dublin was witnessed by crowds estimated as being in the tens of thousands who broke into spontaneous applause as the coffins passed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/1359518/Ahern-defends-1921-IRA-men's-state-funeral.html Ahern defends 1921 IRA men's state funeral ] 14 Oct 2001 Telegraph.co.uk : Accessed 1 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On [[O'Connell Street]], a lone piper played a lament as the cortege paused outside the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]], the focal point of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; In his homily during the requiem mass, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Cahal Daly]], a long-time critic of [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|the IRA campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]], insisted that there was a clear distinction between the conflict of 1916–22 and the paramilitary-led violence of the previous 30 years:

{{quote|
The true inheritors today of the ideals of the men and women of 1916 to 1922 are those who are explicitly and visibly committed to leaving the physical force tradition behind... Surely this state funeral can be an occasion for examination of conscience about the ideals of the men who died, and about our responsibility for translating those ideals into today's realities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06EFDD113FF936A25753C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Irish Rebury 10 Republicans Hanged by British in 1920s], New York Times; accessed 1 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his graveside oration the [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] echoed these sentiments and also paid tribute to the Ten:{{quote|These 10 young men were executed during the War of Independence.

'''Gaitelgrima''' is a [[Lombards|Lombard]] feminine name. There are several notable Gaitelgrimas in history.  The identities of these five women (as well as some others of the same name) are often confused because they were all closely related to each other and to two men: [[Guaimar III of Salerno]] and his son, [[Guaimar IV of Salerno|Guaimar IV]]; they were the princes of Salerno from about 983 to 1027 and from 1027 to 1052.

The first was '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''', daughter of [[Atenulf I of Capua]], married [[Guaimar II of Salerno]] and was the mother of [[Gisulf I of Salerno]]. 

The second, also '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''' or '''Gaitelgrima of Benevento''' (died after 1027), was the daughter of [[Pandulf II of Benevento]] and sister of [[Pandulf IV of Capua]].  She was the second wife of Guaimar III and mother of Guaimar IV (his successor), [[Guy, Duke of Sorrento|Guy]] (later duke of [[Sorrento]]), and [[Pandulf of Capaccio|Pandulf]] (later lord of [[Capaccio]]).  She was also the mother of the third Gaitelgrima.  

This third was '''Gaitelgrima of Salerno''', also known as '''Altrude''', who married successively two brothers, [[Drogo of Hauteville]] and [[Humphrey of Hauteville]], who were [[counts of Apulia]].  Through the latter, she was mother to [[Abelard of Hauteville|Abelard]] and [[Herman of Hauteville|Herman]].  

The fourth, also named after Gaitelgrima of Benevento, was also a '''[[Gaitelgrima, daughter of Guaimar IV|Gaitelgrima of Salerno]]'''.  She was the daughter of Guaimar IV of Salerno (see above) and Gemma.  She was married off by her brother [[Gisulf II of Salerno]] to [[Jordan I of Capua]] as was her sister, [[Sichelgaita]], to [[Robert Guiscard]]. 

The last was '''Gaitelgrima, [[Duke of Apulia|Duchess of Apulia]]''', the second wife of [[William II, Duke of Apulia]].  She was the daughter of [[Jordan II of Capua]]. She deeply loved her husband and cut off her hair to cover his coffin at his funeral.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">'''Generación del 51''' is a designation for one of a series of "generations" of Spanish composers, identifying a group born between 1924 and 1938.

Members of this group of composers from the Basque and Castilian-speaking regions of Spain include {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}:
*[[Carmelo Bernaola|Carmelo Alonso Bernaola]] (1929–2002)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Miguel Alonso (composer)|es|3=Miguel Alonso Gómez|lt=Miguel Alonso}} (1925–2002)
*[[Angel Arteaga]]
*[[Cristóbal Halffter]] (b. 1930)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Ramón Barce|es}} (1928–2008)
*[[Agustín Bertomeu]] (b. 1929)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Amando Blanquer|es|3=Amando Blanquer Ponsoda}} (1935–2005)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Francisco Calés|es|3=Francisco Calés Otero}} (1925–1985)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Manuel Castillo|es}} (1930–2005)
*[[Juan José Falcón Sanabria]] (b. 1936)
*[[Antón García Abril]] (b. 1933)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Agustín González Acilu|es}} (b. 1929)
*[[Juan Hidalgo Codorniu|Juan Hidalgo]] (b. 1927)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Ángel Oliver|es|3=Ángel Oliver Pina}} (1937–2005)
*[[Luis de Pablo]] (b. 1930)
*[[Claudio Prieto]] (b. 1934)
In their earlier works, members of this generation tended toward the avant-garde, with post-Webernian [[serialism]] evident in the work of Halffter and Luis de Pablo in particular. By the end of the 1970s a mellowing of their language becomes apparent, and during the 1980s many of them began to turn to [[tonality]] of one sort or another {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}. 

The Catalan members of this generation are associated with the reforming and renewing tendencies that emerged after the post-Civil War isolation ({{harvnb|Gómez|2001}}; {{harvnb|Perez Castillo|2001}}):
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Xavier Benguerel i Godó|ca}} (b. 1931)
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Joan Guinjoan Gispert|ca}} (b. 1931)
* [[Josep Mestres Quadreny]] (b. 1929)
* [[Josep Soler i Sardà]] (b. 1935)
Soler's compositional palette involves serial techniques, and he is particularly noted for his dramatic music {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}.

'''George A. Best''' was an English [[association footballer|football]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. He played professionally for [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in the early 20th century, either side of spells with his hometown club, [[Worksop Town F.C.|Worksop Town]].

Best made his debut for Blackpool just over halfway through the [[1925–26 Blackpool F.C. season|1925–26]] season, as deputy for [[Len Crompton]], in a 5–2 defeat at Derby County. He appeared in the two successive games — a 3–0 home victory over Bradford City and a 5–0 reversal at Port Vale — before Crompton returned to the line-up.

The following [[1926–27 Blackpool F.C. season|1926–27]] campaign saw Best make 24 [[Football League|League]] appearances. He played his final game for the club on 18 April, in a 2–2 draw at South Shields.

'''Hans Heiling''' (Jan Svatoš in [[Czech language|Czech]]) is a legendary person in [[Germany|German]] and [[Bohemia]]n mythology.

The stories originate from German inhabitants of [[Loket (Sokolov District)|Loket]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]). The son of a water fairy from the river [[Ohře]], who taught him to master magic and command spirits. Once he had become rich and powerful, he ordered the spirits under his command to build a great city. The granite rocks above the Ohře, named [[Hans-Heiling-Felsen]] (Svatošské Skály in Czech), were believed to be the ruins of this city.&lt;ref name="cz"&gt;[http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5492 COT.cz tourism site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011002443/http://www.cot.cz/zobrazcl.php?id=5492 |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hans Heiling discovered that he could not achieve human happiness even with his supernatural powers, he discarded them and died fighting a bear. Another variant of the story is that the rock formation is a [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]] wedding party. A notable [[opera]] of the [[Hans Heiling|same name]] was inspired by the tale.

The poem "Ballad", by [[Gerda Mayer]], is based on the wedding party variant and appears in The Oxford Book of Story Poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Book of Story Poems|year=1990|publisher=OUP|isbn=0 19 276087 4|pages=27–29|editor=Michael Harrison and Christopher Stuart-Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland – Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|proporzec Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej – Zwierzchnika Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej}}) is a [[Maritime flag#Jacks|jack flag]] used in the [[Polish Armed Forces]] to mark the presence and pay respect to the [[President of the Republic of Poland]] who is also ''ex officio'' the [[commander-in-chief]] of the Armed Forces. The jack is raised on [[Polish Navy]] ships when the president is officially on board, as well as on land, if the president is present. The design of the jack is based directly on the [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|pre-war]] [[Banner of Poland|Banner of the Republic of Poland]] which used to be part of presidential insignia.

== Legal specifications ==
[[File:Presidential jack unknown soldier.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Presidential jack flying at the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw]] during a [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution Day]] ceremony]]

The jack of the President is defined in the Ordinance of the Minister of National Defense on the Use of Insignia of the Armed Forces of January 26, 1996 with subsequent amendments. The ordinance defines the jack of the President as "a piece of red cloth with the image of the state eagle (i.e. the White Eagle from the [[Coat of Arms of Poland|national coat of arms]]) in the middle, bordered with a ''wężyk generalski''", an ornate wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of [[generał|general's]] rank. The [[Hoist (flag)|hoist]] to [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|fly]] ratio is 5:6. The proportion of the eagle's height to the fly is 3:5.&lt;ref name=ordinance&gt;{{pl icon}} ''Zarządzenie Ministra Obrony Narodowej z dnia 29 stycznia 1996 r. w sprawie szczegółowych zasad używania znaków Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz ustalenia innych znaków używanych w Siłach Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'' ([http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/1996/0178.htm M.P.96.14.178] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015219/http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/1996/0178.htm |date=2007-09-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

The presidential jack is used in military ceremonies attended by the commander-in-chief. Celebrations of the Constitution Day, May 3; Polish Armed Forces Day, August 15; and Independence Day, November 11 (see [[Public holidays in Poland]]) are typical occasions. For example, during the grand military parade on August 15, 2007 in [[Warsaw]], President [[Lech Kaczyński]] rode in a convertible jeep preceded by a mounted [[Polish cavalry|cavalry]] officer carrying the presidential jack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

while a smaller jack was attached to the president's jeep as a car flag. The jack also draped the coffins of President Kaczyński (see [[Death and state funeral of Lech Kaczyński and Maria Kaczyńska]]) and former President-in-exile [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]] after both died in the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk air crash]] of 2010.

{{Main article|Banner of Poland}}

A state banner was used in Poland as insignia of the head of state (king, president, etc.) as early as the 11th century CE. Although its design changed with time, it was always a heraldic banner, i.e. one based directly on the national coat of arms: a crowned White Eagle in a red field. In 1919, the [[Sejm]] (lower house of parliament) established the [[Banner of the Republic of Poland]], reserved for use by the head of state &amp;ndash; the State Leader (''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]'') and, later, President of the Republic. In 1927, it was modified to reflect the adoption of a new official rendering of the national coat of arms. At this point the banner was virtually identical to the current design for the presidential jack.&lt;ref name=znamier&gt;{{cite book

After the [[Second World War]], the Banner of the Republic was still used by [[Polish government-in-exile|presidents-in-exile]] while a variant with a crownless eagle was used by Communist authorities at home. Officially abandoned in 1955, the banner continued to be used in practice by the [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland|prime minister]] and, during the 1960s, by the [[Polish Council of State|Council of State]], a collective head of state of the time.&lt;ref name=znamier/&gt;

The modern Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland was established by the Minister of National Defense on January 29, 1996 with the sole purpose of flying it on Polish Navy ships while the commander-in-chief is on board.&lt;ref name=ordinance/&gt; On December 14, 2005, the use of the presidential jack was extended to all branches of Polish Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} ''Zarządzenie Ministra Obrony Narodowej z dnia 14 grudnia 2005 r. zmieniające zarządzenie w sprawie szczegółowych zasad używania znaków Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz ustalenia innych znaków używanych w Siłach Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'' ([http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/2005/1165.htm M.P.05.82.1165] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033325/http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/2005/1165.htm |date=2007-09-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt; It was first flown on land during a Constitution Day ceremony at the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw]] on May 3, 2005.

The '''Jackie Chan Stunt Team''' ({{zh|t=成家班|cy=Sing Ga Ban|l=Chan's Family Group}}), also known as '''Jackie Chan's Stuntmen Association''' is a group of [[stunt double|stuntmen]] and [[martial arts|martial artists]] who work alongside [[Jackie Chan]].

==History==
The JC Stunt Team was established in 1976 and originated from the relationships Chan formed in his early starring roles in [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action movies]]. Several of his co-stars and stuntmen hired by the [[movie studio|film studios]] began working together regularly. This engendered a familiarity of one another's skills and abilities and it made sense for them to become a working team. Some of the members had received training at the [[Peking Opera school]]s, similar to Chan.

By 1983, and the release of the film ''[[Project A]]'', the stunt team had become an official organisation of 6 members. The organisation meant that the stuntmen not only received [[Insurance|insurance coverage]], but also a monthly salary and higher pay.
By the time of ''[[Police Story 2]]'' in 1988, the team had expanded to around 20 members.
This incarnation of the team was disbanded in 1990 and thereafter, individual members were contracted and used on a film-by-film basis rather than all members remaining on the payroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The formation of Chan's team influenced others in the [[Film industry|business]] to follow suit, particularly his former co-stars and "brothers" [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]] (their stunt teams known as "Hung Ga Ban" and "Yuen Ga Ban" respectively). Other actors who formed their own stunt teams include [[Lau Kar-leung]], [[Philip Ko]], [[Stanley Tong]] and [[Bruce Law]].
Chan's stunt team worked in collaboration with Sammo Hung's team on films including [[Thunderbolt (1995 film)|Thunderbolt]] and [[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]].
A small number of films that Chan produced but did not appear in, or was not involved in at all, have utilised his stunt team. These include ''The Gold Hunters'' (1981), ''[[Rouge (film)|Rouge]]'' (1988), ''The Inspector Wears Skirts 2'' (1989), ''Stage Door Johnny'' (1990) and ''Angry Ranger'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Jane Grossman Stern''' and '''Michael Stern''' (both born 1946) are American writers who specialize in books about travel, food, and popular culture. They are best known for their ''[[Roadfood]]'' books, website, and magazine columns, in which they find [[road food]] restaurants serving classic American regional specialties and review them. Starting their hunt for regional American food in the early 1970s they were the first food writers to regard this food as being as worthy to report on as the [[haute cuisine]] of other nations. 

Since the Sterns began documenting regional American food in the 1970s many other writers and television personalities have used their pioneering work as inspiration. In addition to their early work with regional American food the Sterns' book ''Square Meals'' (Knopf 1985) put "[[comfort food]]s" like mac and cheese, meatloaf, and mashed potatoes on the culinary map. ''Square Meals'' did an audacious reverse spin on the tricked up and precious nouvelle cuisine that was beloved by food critics at that time.     

Jane Grossman grew up in [[New York City]], where she attended the [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden School]] and received a BFA in graphic design at [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn. Michael Stern grew up in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], and graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1968. They met as graduate students in art at [[Yale University]] and their first date, at [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana|Pepe's Pizza]] in New Haven, had a food focus.&lt;ref name=Ephron&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in 1970. The following year, Jane earned an MFA in painting from Yale and Michael changed schools and earned an MFA from [[Columbia University]] in film. Neither found work in their fields of study.

After a short stint of producing documentaries for WNBC, a teaching job at [[Hunter College]] and another at [[Wesleyan University]] they began work on the book that eventually became the first ''Roadfood''. The book was conceived as a book on "truck-stop dining," funded with an advance from a publisher. The Sterns set out in their car to travel through the United States and eat up to 12 meals daily at diners and local cafes.&lt;ref name=Ephron/&gt; The resulting first edition of ''Roadfood'' was published in 1977; the most recent edition was released in 2017.

In addition to their food writing, the Sterns have written books on American popular culture, including [[New York Times bestseller list|''The New York Times'' bestselling]] ''Elvis World'' (1987) and ''The Encyclopaedia of Bad Taste'' (1990). In all, they have written over 30 books. They were staff writers for ''[[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet]]'' magazine for 18 years, have written for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', and are now contributing editors at ''[[Saveur]]''. 

They are regular guests on [[American Public Media]]'s public radio program, ''[[The Splendid Table]]''. They have won numerous awards, including [[James Beard award]]s, and were inducted into [[James Beard Foundation Award#Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America|Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesbeard.org/index.php?q=james_beard_awards_whos_who Who’s Who of Food &amp; Beverage in America], the James Beard Foundation website, accessed September 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Sterns founded Roadfood.com; the site was sold to Fexy Media in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Gordinier| first = Jeff| title = Serious Eats and Roadfood Are Sold to Fexy Media| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2017-11-13| date = 2015-06-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/dining/serious-eats-roadfood-websites-sold-to-fexy-media.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, the Sterns remained in charge of editorial content of their website.&lt;ref name="eater-2015jun02"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.eater.com/2015/6/2/8704397/serious-eats-roadfood-seattle-fexy-media |title=Serious Eats Is Acquired by Seattle-Based Fexy Media: Roadfood has also been sold to Fexy Media. |website=Eater |date=June 2, 2015 |first=Daniela |last=Galarza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Jane Stern published ''Ambulance Girl: How I Saved Myself by Becoming an EMT'', a memoir in which she described suffering from severe [[clinical depression]] when she was in her early 50s and overcame her depression by training and working as an [[emergency medical technician]] in Connecticut. In 2005 the book was made into a [[television movie]], ''[[Ambulance Girl]]'', for which actress [[Kathy Bates]] was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]]. The Sterns wrote a joint memoir, ''Two for the Road: Our Love Affair With American Food'', in 2006. 

The couple divorced in 2008; they still write as a team.&lt;ref&gt;Nanci G.

In 2011 the former couple published ''The Lexicon of Real American Food'', and Jane Stern published a book on her little known but long-standing career as a [[tarot card reader]]. &lt;ref&gt;Nanci G.

'''Keibu keioiba''' is a mythological or fictional character based on [[Meitei people|Meetei]] folklore. It is a creature having half tiger and half human features, depicted to be transformed from a learned ancient Manipuri physician. He was experimenting his magical skills and powers, and came up with this idea of turning himself into a powerful man with strength of a tiger. He became this creature with the head, limbs and strength of a tiger but failed to remember how to revert to his normal human form, owing to low memory or thinking capacity of a tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=manipur.Folks.Folk_Tales.Keibu_Keioiba_By_Nganthoi_Lourembam |title=Keibu Keioiba – Fungawari Singbul |publisher=E-Pao|author=B. Jayantakumar Sharma }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tale==
This is a story of a kind, dedicated and skilled ancient Manipuri physician, who used to ride on a horse and visit places to heal the suffering ailments. As his knowledge and skill kept on increasing day by day, he kept on wanting to learn more and more. At a time, he was able to do whatever he wanted. He kept on conducting experiments until he decided to turn himself into a tiger one day, for he wanted the power of a tiger.

He taught his wife how to help him turn into a tiger and how to return to his human form. But, as soon as he became the tiger-like creature/ keibu keioiba, he developed the tiger-instinct of roaring and frightening people. So, his wife ran away from him before he could be subjected to return to his human form. Instead, he even tried to kill his wife and ran away in the wild far from home.
When he got hungry, he would come to human villages to steal poultry or fish or livestock, as he never learned how to hunt like a real tiger in the wild. He became the feared and the hated. He began to target humans for food.

He came to a village and took a young girl called Thabaton, who was home alone, left by her seven brothers for work. He was avenged by the brothers and the girl was saved.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=manipur.Folks.Taming_Keibu_Keioiba |title=Taming 'Keibu Keioiba': Translation as Recovery |publisher=E-Pao|author=Sumitra Thoidingjam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Morale==
The story depicts the never-ending desire of man for getting more which ultimately ruins himself. It teaches a lesson to us about the evil effects of this human nature. We can witness many examples of this today- e.g., global warming because of the never-ending industrial race, world devastation by never ending arms race in world wars, etc.

==Impacts in Manipur or Meetei society==
Almost every Manipuri grow up listening to this folktale from their elders. It is a common story told to kids over many generations.

==Movie/s==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Keibu keioiba movie.jpg|thumb|Keibu keioiba, tigerhead film poster.]] --&gt;
A 2-D Manipuri animated film, titled as "keibu keioiba", has been made, directed by Bhumenjoy konsam, released in 2009, based on the original folktale. The movie has increased awareness of the story to the selfie-generation kids of present Manipur as well as to other communities.&lt;ref&gt;keibu keioiba / tigerhead&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Llwyd ap Cil Coed''' is a character in the Third Branch of The [[Mabinogi]], known also as the story of ''[[Four Branches of the Mabinogi#Manawyddan, son of Llyr|Manawydan ap Llŷr]]''. 

==Role in the Third Branch==

Llwyd is a friend of [[Gwawl]] ap Clud, who had been insulted by [[Pwyll]] in the First Branch. Llwyd decides to avenge this insult upon [[Pryderi]] son of Pwyll by making barren and empty the kingdom of [[Dyfed]]. Later, by means of an enchanted bowl in a mysterious fortress, he imprisons Pryderi and [[Rhiannon]], Pwyll's widow and Pryderi's mother. Llwyd apparently makes Rhiannon bear the yokes of his horses, while Pryderi had to carry the gate hammers, while they are in captivity. 

Only [[Manawydan]], Rhiannon's new husband, and Pryderi's wife [[Cigfa]] remain in Dyfed. They try to plant grain, but their crop is destroyed by mice. Manawydan chases the pests away, but catches one that is fat and slower than the others, and sets out to hang it for theft. A cleric, a priest, and a bishop come by one at a time and beg Manawydan to spare the mouse, but he refuses until the bishop agrees to remove the enchantment from Dyfed. He finally reveals himself as Llwyd in disguise, and admits that the mice were really his attendants magically transformed. The mouse is his pregnant wife, Gwenaby, but Manawydan refuses to free her until Llwyd also releases Rhiannon and Pryderi and pledges to take no further revenge. Llwyd agrees to these terms, and turns his wife back into a beautiful woman.

==Other appearances==

A character named '''Llwydeu ap Cilcoed''' appears in the early [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'' in which he is named as one of the many knights of [[King Arthur|Arthur's]] court. After stealing a [[cauldron]] from Diwrnach the Irishman, Arthur and his men land at Llywdeu's house in Porth Cerddin in [[Dyfed]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5012">'''Llŷr''' ({{lang-cy|Llŷr Llediaith}} ({{IPA-cy|ˈɬɨːr ˈɬɛdjaiθ}}); ''Lleddiaith'' meaning "half-speech"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bromwich|1961}}, triads #8 and #52&lt;/ref&gt; or "half-language"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a figure in [[Welsh mythology]], probably originally a deity, probably derived from Irish [[Lir|Ler]] ("the Sea"), father of ''[[Manannán mac Lir]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998}}, "Llŷr is often assumed to be borrowed from the Irish Lir, the patronym of the sea-god Manannán&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other than his progeny and odd tidbits, his identity remains obscure.

Llŷr appears as the father of [[Brân the Blessed|Brân]], [[Branwen|Brânwen]] and [[Manawydan]] by [[Penarddun]] in the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi#Branwen, Daughter of Llyr|''Branwen, Daughter of Llyr'']], the Second Branch of the ''[[Mabinogion|Mabinogi]]''.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Jones|1949}}, New Revised ed. 1993, p. 21, "Bendigeidfran son of Llŷr was crowned king.. His two brothers on the mother's side (Nisien and Efnisien) were sons of Euroswydd by his mother Penarddun."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[King Lear]]'' is based on material taken secondhand (through [[Holinshed]]) from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s mythical king [[Leir of Britain|King Leir]], who has often been connected, but is likely unrelated, to Llŷr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998}}, "Many trace Shakespear's.. Lear to Llŷr, but the route is tortuous; Shakespeare drew from Holinshed's Chronicles (1577)", etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Melchior Lotter the Elder (1470-1549).jpg|thumb|Melchior Lotter the Elder]]
[[File:Lotterbibel.jpg|thumb|Bible printed by Lotter]]

'''Lotter''' was the last name of a family of [[Germany|German]] printers, intimately connected with the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

The founder of the family was '''Melchior Lotter''', the elder, born at [[Aue]], and well-known at [[Leipzig]] as early as 1491. He published [[missal]]s, [[Breviary|breviaries]], a ''[[Aulus Persius Flaccus|Persius]]'' (1512), ''Horatii Epistol&amp;aelig;'' (1522), and ''Luther Tessaradecos Consolatoria pro Laborantibus'' (1520). His relations with the Reformation are not perfectly clear, but he seems to have been a sympathizer.  An innovation by the elder Lotter was his use of [[Latin alphabet|Roman letters]] for [[Latin]], reserving the [[Gothic type]]s for [[German language|German]].

His son was also named Melchior (died c. 1542), which has resulted in some bibliographical confusion. '''Melchior''', the younger, is best known for printing [[Martin Luther]]'s Bible, ''[[Luther Bible|Das Neue Testament]]'' (1522), and the impressions of 1523 and 1524 of the [[Old Testament]], which was transferred afterward to [[Hans Lufft]].  He published many other German writings of Luther.  Only a little less important was his bringing a [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Typeface|font]] to [[Wittenberg]], thus giving [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] the means to carry on classes in Greek.  When he returned to Leipzig, about 1525, Lotter carried on his father's business.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5977">'''Metabiography''' is the literary study of the relation of [[Biography|biographies]] to the temporal, geographical, institutional, intellectual or ideological locations of their writers (the biographers). It is a [[hermeneutics]] of biography that sees the biographical subject (the “biographee”) as a collective construct of different [[cultural memory|memory cultures]], proposing an essential instability of historical lives.&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas, 2008. ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'' (corrected edition). Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Steven Shapin]], metabiography stresses “that shifting biographical traditions make one person have many lives,” none of these necessarily more real than any other, because all are “configured and reconfigured according to the sensibilities and needs of the changing cultural settings.”&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, Steven, 2006. “Lives after death,” ''Nature'', vol. 441: 286.&lt;/ref&gt;   In this sense, metabiography expresses a belief in the observer-dependence of historical knowledge.

== Metabiography vs. traditional biography ==
As part of the preparations for their own writings, biographers have traditionally examined previous biographical studies. For these authors, dealing with predecessors has served such purposes as establishing the factual inadequacy of earlier efforts, staking one’s own claim against prior “myths” and “mistakes,” or has been intended simply as laying the groundwork for a new and more “definitive” study. Metabiography, however, goes beyond writing about the strengths or weaknesses of preceding biographical studies in interpreting a life. It is less concerned with the authenticity of biographical representations than with their relational nature.&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas, 2008. ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'' (corrected edition). Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been argued that in the history of science, metabiography has a long tradition of over fifty years,&lt;ref&gt;Söderqvist, Thomas, 2007. Untitled review of Nicolaas A. Rupke, ''Alexander von Humboldt: a Metabiography'', ''Isis'', vol. 98: 203-204; Söderqvist however defines metabiography as the critical appraisal of biographical literature about a particular person in the traditional way.&lt;/ref&gt; stretching from [[Henry Guerlac]]’s study of “[[Lavoisier]] and his biographers”&lt;ref&gt;Guerlac, Henry, 1954. “Lavoisier and his biographers,” ''Isis'', vol. 45: 51-62.&lt;/ref&gt; to A. Rupert Hall’s edition of eighteenth-century [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] biographies&lt;ref&gt;Hall, A. Rupert, 1999. ''Isaac Newton: Eighteenth-Century Perspectives''. Oxford [etc.]: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and beyond. However, to these scholars, the study of former biographers had a [[Propaedeutics|propaedeutic]] function vis-à-vis the biographical works of their own time. They did not follow a relational approach and thus do not meet the crucial criterion for metabiographical studies.

== Examples of metabiography in general history ==
In the field of biographies of artists and writers, the metabiographical approach was followed e.g. by David Dennis for [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770–1827),&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, David B., 1996. ''Beethoven in German Politics, 1870-1989''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Lucasta Miller]] who used it to good effect in the case [[Emily Brontë]] (1818–48).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Lucasta, 2001. ''The Brontë Myth''. London: Cape&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Gordon S. Wood]]’s study on the Americanization of [[Benjamin Franklin]],&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Gordon S., 2004. ''The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin''. New York, NY: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; however, is not metabiography, although the Franklin literature would provide ideal material for such a study.

== Examples of metabiography in the field of scientific biography ==
Examples of scientific metabiography are [[Jan Sapp]]’s “The nine lives of [[Gregor Mendel]],”&lt;ref&gt;Sapp, Jan, 1990. “The nine lives of Gregor Mendel” in Le Grand, Homer E. (ed.), ''Experimental Inquiries''. Dordrecht: Kluwer, pp. 137-166. Sapp analyses the different interpretations of Mendel’s work in genetics by later practitioners in the field, who variously described him as a Darwinian, a non-Darwinian, an evolutionist, an opponent of evolutionary theory, a Mendelian geneticist, not a Mendelian geneticist, a man who did or did not falsify his data or even as someone who completely fabricated his experiments on plant hybrids.&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Fara’s ''Newton: the Making of Genius''&lt;ref&gt;Fara, Patricia, 2002. ''Newton: the Making of Genius''. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Nicolaas Adrianus Rupke|Nicolaas Rupke]]’s ''Alexander von Humboldt: a Metabiography''.&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas, 2008. ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'' (corrected edition). Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press; Rupke shows how from the middle of the nineteenth century to the present day Humboldt has served as a nucleus of crystallisation for a variety of successive socio-political ideologies in Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; James Moore and Ralph Colp have applied the metabiographical approach to Charles Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, James, 1994. ''The Darwin Legend''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Books; Moore, James, 1999. “Telling tales: Evangelicals and the Darwin legend” in Livingstone, David N., Hart, D.G., and Noll, Mark A. (eds), ''Evangelicals and Science in Historical Perspective''. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 220-233; Colp, Ralph, 1989. “Charles Darwin’s past and future biographies,” ''History of Science'', vol. 27: 167-197.&lt;/ref&gt;  A metabiographical slant is also discernible in the ''Reader’s Guide to the History of Science'' (2000).

The council of '''Nine Men''' was a citizens board and a form of representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous councils, the [[Twelve Men]] and the [[Eight Men]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs  |first=Jaap  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Netherland: A Dutch Colony In Seventeenth-Century America |year=2005  |publisher= |quote=Both in the way it was set up and in the extent of its rights, the council of Twelve Men, as did the two later advisory bodies ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uex2budtSOUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA136&amp;dq |isbn=90-04-12906-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the council were elected in 1647, 1649, 1650 and 1652. On July 26, 1649, eleven current and former members of the board signed the ''Petition of the Commonality of New Netherland'', which requested that the States General take action to encourage [[economic freedom]] and force local government like that in the Netherlands, removing the colony from the control of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. It became the basis for the municipal government when the city of [[New Amsterdam]] received its charter in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = About the City Council   | publisher = New York City Council   | date =    | url = http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | accessdate = 2013-01-01   | deadurl = yes   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120620053608/http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | archivedate = 2012-06-20   | df =    }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Poitiers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Battle of Poitiers]] 1356. The oriflamme can be seen on the top left.]]

The '''Oriflamme''' (from Latin ''aurea flamma'', "golden flame") was the [[battle standard]] of the [[King of France]] in the Middle Ages. It was originally the sacred banner of the [[Abbey of St. Denis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenophongroup.com/montjoie/orifl-fa.htm Oriflamme Society]&lt;/ref&gt; a monastery near Paris. When the oriflamme was raised in battle by the French royalty during the Middle Ages, most notably during the [[Hundred Years War]], no prisoners were to be taken until it was lowered. Through this tactic they hoped to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, especially the nobles, who could usually expect to be taken alive for ransom during such military encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Southey (1841) '' Joan of Arc: a poem'', Longman et autres. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TPRAhDvWDrwC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=oriflamme+no+quarter+given&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k7Nfv2vzz-&amp;sig=v2VEcfsGqIA6hlWsT62p_Jgrodg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAmoVChMIo6Du2dmMxwIVBL1yCh38WwSD#v=onepage&amp;q=oriflamme%20no%20quarter%20given&amp;f=false p. 280]&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, the term "''oriflamme''" has come to mean any banner with pointed ends; by association with the form of the original.

==Legendary origin==
{{multiple image

 }}
The  Oriflamme was mentioned in the eleventh-century ballad the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' (vv. 3093-5) as a royal banner, first called ''Romaine'' and then ''Montjoie''.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt; According to legend, [[Charlemagne]] carried it to the Holy Land in response to a prophecy regarding a knight possessing a golden lance, from which flames would burn and drive out the [[Saracens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Distant Mirror |last=Tuchman |first=Barbara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1978|publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0140054073 |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the ''lance'' was originally the important object, with the banner simply a decoration, but this changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/oriflamm.htm Heraldica.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Oriflamme was first used by [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] in 1124 and was last flown in battle at Agincourt in 1415,&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Barber (1984) ''The Penguin guide to medieval Europe'', Penguin Books. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A9MYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;dq=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;pgis=1 p. 224]&lt;/ref&gt; though a version of it remained in the Abbey of St. Denis until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Book of Heraldry|last=Slater |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Hermes House |location= |isbn=1846819601 |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis VI replaced the earlier banner of Saint Martin with the oriflamme of the Abbey of St. Denis, which floated about the tomb of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the abbey by king Dagobert.
Until the 12th century the standard-bearer was the [[Comte de Vexin]], who, as vowed to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the abbey. Louis VI, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as war began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the tomb of the saint to carry it to the combat.

It is recorded as having been carried at the following battles/campaigns:{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Appearance ==
The banner was red or orange-red silk and flown from a gilded lance.&lt;ref&gt;Slater (2002), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, its colour stems from it being dipped in the blood of the recently beheaded [[Denis|St. Denis]].

The surviving descriptions of the Oriflamme are in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the "Chronicle of Flanders" (fourteenth century), in the "Registra Delphinalia" (1456) and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536). They show that the primitive Oriflamme was succeeded in the course of the centuries by newer Oriflammes which bore little resemblance to one another except for their colour.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Oriflamme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance on the battlefield ==
When the Oriflamme was displayed on the battlefield it indicated that [[no quarter]]
was to be given, its red colour being symbolic of cruelty and ferocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The laws of War in the late Middle Ages |last=Keen |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Keen |coauthors= |year=1965 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |location= London|isbn= |page= |pages= 105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the azure ground (from the blue cope of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]]) strewn with gold [[fleur-de-lis]] remained the symbol of royalty until the 15th century, the Oriflamme became the royal battle standard of the King of France, and it was carried at the head of the king's forces when they met another army in battle. In the fifteenth century, the fleur-de-lis on the white flag of [[Joan of Arc]] became the new royal standard replacing both the symbol of royalty and the Oriflamme on the battle field.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;&lt;!--cited for last sentence--&gt;

==Porte oriflamme==
The bearer of the standard, the ''porte-oriflamme'', became an [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|office]] (like that of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] or [[Constable of France|Constable]]) and a great honour, as it was an important and very dangerous job to take charge of such a visible symbol in battle.  If things went badly, the bearer was expected to die rather than relinquish his charge.

Froissart vividly describes ''porte-oriflamme'' Geoffroi de Charny's fall at the side of his king at the Battle of Poitiers in this passage:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“There Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him because he was carrying the king’s sovereign banner [the Oriflamme]. He also had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open the king’s battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jean Froissart; trans Geoffrey Brereton, ''Chronicles'' ( Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, 1978), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The Oriflamme in literature ==
The 19th-century poet [[Robert Southey]] refers to the Oriflamme and its reputation in his poem ''Joan of Arc''{{cquote|
:::::"Dark-minded man!"
:The Maid of Orleans answered, "to act well
:Brings with itself an ample recompense.
:I have not reared the oriflamme of death —
:Now God forbid! The banner of the Lord
:Is this; and, come what will, me it behooves,
:Mindful of Him whose minister I am,
:To spare the fallen foe: that gracious God
:Sends me a messenger of mercy forth,
:Sends me to save this ravaged realm of France,
:To England friendly as to all the world;
:Only to those an enemy, whose lust
:Of sway makes them the enemies of man."

A '''patronymic''', or '''patronym''', is a component of a [[personal name]] based on the [[given name]] of one's father, grandfather (i.e., an '''avonymic'''),&lt;ref&gt;Willy van Langendonck. 2007. ''Theory and Typology of Proper Names''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eichler, Ernst et al. (eds.). 1995. ''Namenforschung''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; or an earlier male ancestor. A component of a name based on the name of one's mother or a female ancestor is a [[matronymic]]. Each is a means of conveying [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]].

Patronymics are still in use, including mandatory use, in many countries worldwide, although their use has largely been replaced by or transformed into [[patronymic surname]]s. Examples of such transformations include common English surnames such as [[Johnson]] (son of John).

==Origins of terms==

The usual noun and adjective in English is ''patronymic'', but as a noun this exists in [[free variation]] alongside ''patronym''. (The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records the corresponding ''metronymic'' and ''metronym'', alongside ''matronymic'' but not, however, ''matronym''.) The first part of the word ''patronym'' comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] πατήρ ''patēr'' "father" (&lt;small&gt;[[Genitive case|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; πατρός ''patros'' whence the [[combining form]] πατρο- ''patro''-);&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|path/r|πατήρ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the second part comes from Greek ὄνυμα ''onyma'', a variant form of ὄνομα ''onoma'' "name".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o)/noma|ὄνομα|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the form ''patronymic'', this stands with the addition of the suffix [[wikt:-ικός|-ικός]] (''-ikos''), which was originally used to form adjectives with the sense ‘pertaining to’ (thus 'pertaining to the father's name'). These forms are attested in [[Hellenistic Greek]] as πατρώνυμος (''patrōnymos'') and πατρωνυμικός (''patrōnymikos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|patrw/numos|πατρώνυμος}}, {{LSJ|patrwnumiko/s|πατρωνυμικός|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The form ''patronym'', first attested in English in 1834, was borrowed into English from French ''patronyme'', which had previously borrowed the word directly from Greek. ''Patronymic'', first attested in English in 1612, has a more complex history. Both Greek words had entered Latin, and, from Latin, French. The English form ''patronymic'' was borrowed through the mutual influence of French and Latin on English.&lt;ref&gt;"patronym, n."; "patronymic, n. and adj.", ''OED Online'' (3rd edn). March 2018. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In many areas around the world, patronyms predate the use of [[family name]]s. Family names in many [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[English language|English]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]], [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] surnames originate from patronyms, e.g. [[Wilson (surname)|Wilson]] (son of [[William (name)|William]]), [[FitzGerald (surname)|FitzGerald]] (son of [[Gerald]]), [[Powell (surname)|Powell]] (from "ap [[Hywel]]"), [[Fernández]] (son of [[Fernando]]), [[Rodríguez (surname)|Rodríguez]] (son of [[Rodrigo]]), [[Anderson (surname)|Anderson]] or [[Andersen]] (son of [[Anders]], [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] form of [[Andrew (given name)|Andrew]]), [[Carlson (name)|Carlson]] or [[Carlsen (name)|Carlsen]] (son of [[Carl (name)|Carl]]), [[Ilyin]] (of [[Ilya]]), [[Petrov (surname)|Petrov]] (of [[Peter (given name)|Peter]]), [[Grigorovich]] (son of [[Grigory]], [[Russian language|Russian]] form of [[Gregory (given name)|Gregory]]), [[Stefanović]] (son of [[Stefan (given name)|Stefan]], little Stefan), [[MacAllister]] (from "mac Alistair", meaning son of [[Alistair]], anglicized Scottish form of [[Alexander]]) and [[O'Conor]] (from "Ó Conchobhair", meaning grandson/descendant of [[Conchobhar]]). Other cultures which formerly used patronyms have switched to the more widespread style of passing the father's last name to the children (and wife) as their own.
In [[Iceland]], [[Icelandic name|family names]] are unusual; Icelandic law favours the use of patronyms (and more recently, matronyms) over family names.

==Historical and current use==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

===Africa===
Traditionally Muslim and non-Arabic speaking African people, such as [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Fulani]] people usually (with some exceptions) follow the Arab naming pattern.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The word or phrase meaning "son of" is, however, omitted. So Mohamed son of Ibrahim son of Ahmed is "Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed", and Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed's son Ali is "Ali Mohamed Ibrahim".

====Ethiopia and Eritrea====
{{Main|Naming conventions in Ethiopia and Eritrea}}
Ethiopians and Eritreans have no concept of family name and surname. If one is to refer to a person with a single name he/she will always use the person's given name. Ethiopian and Eritreans use a naming pattern very similar to the Arab naming pattern, but with one exception: no suffix or prefix. The full name is written as: First name (given name) followed by the father's name, and last by the grandfather's name. For example, Sara Yohannes Petros is Sara (given name) Yohannes (father's name) Petros (grandfather's name). The grandfather's name is usually only used in official documents. The father's name is not considered a middle name. Instead, it is considered a last name. The same is true for females; they do not take their husband's last name. They go independently by their given name, followed by their father's name, and then their grandfather's name, even after marriage.

====Kenya====
Some Kenyan communities used patronyms. As of 2010 the practice has largely dropped off with the use of just the father's last name as a surname.
[[Kalenjin language|Kalenjin]] use 'arap' meaning 'son of'; 
[[Gikuyu language|Kikuyu]] used 'wa' meaning 'of'. Because of polygamy, matronyms were also used and 'wa' used to identify which wife the child was born of; 
[[Maasai language|Maasai]] use 'ole' meaning 'son of'; 
[[Meru language|Meru]] use 'mto' abbreviated M' thus son of Mkindia would be M'Mkindia, pronounced Mto Mkindia.

====Mozambique====
Patronymic naming is very common in parts of Mozambique.  Although the practice is not universal, patronymic naming has been documented in the Zambezia province.

====Nigeria====
Now not as prominent as before, Many people of southern Nigeria took their father's given name (father's first name) as their surname. It could also be the father's prominent nickname, which takes the place of a first name. An example would be a man named Kolade Fabiyi, who had a son named Dele. The son's name would now be Dele Kolade, not Dele Fabiyi. This is used to distinguish between extended family who would have the same last name, like cousin. This custom has dropped to the modern English one due to increase in British style education.

====Somalia====
Somalis use their paternal grandfather's given name as their legal surname for documentation purpose. They also use the term "ina" or "iña" meaning "the son of" or "the daughter of," which is similar to other African- and the Arab-naming patterns. For example, the name "Ahmed Mohamed Ali Farah" means "Ahmed son of Mohamed son of Ali son of Farah." When stating one's lineage, one will say "Ahmed ina Mohamed" (Ahmed, the son of Mohamed). To identify themselves and the sub=clan they belong to, Somalis memorize their long lineage back a common ancestor. Women never adopt their husbands' patronym but keep theirs for life.

====South Africa====
Among the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] patronymics were used in the pre-colonial era. The prefix "ka" was attached to the father's name, for example [[Shaka kaSenzangakhona]] means Shaka son of Senzangakhona. The practice disappeared from everyday use with the introduction of the modern European style surname system but still remains part of traditional cultural practices, particularly in the case of chieftains and royalty where reciting lineages forms a part of many ceremonial occasions.

===Asia===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

====China====
[[Yi people]]'s sons' given names are based on the last one or two syllables of father's name. [[Hani people]] also have patronymic customs.

====Taiwan====
[[Atayal people]]'s names are followed by the name of their father, both son and daughter are patronymic. 
[[Amis people]]'s son names are also followed by the father's name, while a daughter's name is followed by her mother's name.

====India====

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}

Patronymy is common in parts of [[India]]. For example, if a father is named Khurram Suleman (a Muslim masculine name), he might name his son Taha Khurram, who in turn might name his son Ismail Taha. As a result, unlike [[surname]]s, patronymics will not pass down through many generations.

In [[Tamil Nadu]] and some parts of [[Kerala]] and [[South Karnataka]], patronymy is predominant. This is a significant departure from the rest of the country where caste names are mostly employed as surnames. This came into common use during the 1950s and 1960s when the Dravidian movement campaigned against the use one's caste as part of the name.

However, rather than using the father's full name, only the first letter — popularly known as the initial — is prefixed to the given name. For example, if a person's given name is ''Saravanan'' and his father's ''Krishnan'', then the full name is ''K. Saravanan'' and is seldom expanded, even in official records. Only where it is forced by stipulation — such as when applying for an Indian passport which does not usually allow initials — is the initial expanded and the name rendered as "Krishnan Saravanan". Some families follow the tradition of retaining the name of the hometown, the grandfather's name, or both as initials. The celebrated Indian English novelist [[R. K. Narayan]]'s name at birth was Rasipuram Krishnaswami Ayyar Narayanaswami, which was shortened at the behest of his writer friend, [[Graham Greene]]. Rasipuram, the first name, is a [[toponym]] and Krishnaswami Ayyar, the second name, is a patronym.

In Tamilnadu the use of initials and/or surname is up to the prerogative of the person with no strict rules. The late chief minister Karunanidhi preferred to be referred as M. Karunanidhi where the initial M stood for Muthuvel - his father's given name. M.Karunanidhi's son prefers to be referred as M.K.Stalin incorporating both his fathers and grandfather's names. However M.K.Stalin's son prefers to be referred as Udhayanidhi Stalin. Where Udhayanidhi is his given name and Stalin his father's given name as his surname rather than as an initial.

Likewise, cricketer Ashwin son of Ravichandran prefers to be referred to as R.Ashwin or Ravichandran Ashwin. This is because commentators in sports often call players by their last names only and it would be embarrassing to call him by his fathers name, therefore he puts his own given name in the last.

Another upcoming trend is to expand the initials to reflect how it would sound in the native language. For example Karuppiah prefers to be called Pala. Karuppiah instead of P. Karuppiah and his son Palaniappan prefers Karu. Palaniappan. Cinema director Ranjith prefers Pa. Ranjith instead of P. Ranjith as Pa sounds closer to the name in Tamil rather than P which sounds like Pe unlike the first syllable Pa.

Celebrated scientist M. Annadurai would expand his name as Mayilsami Annadurai, however he has to be referred to as Annadurai as referring to him as Mayilsami would be referring to him with his father's given name which could be embarrassing for him.

While the usage of caste names as surnames/last names is discouraged(but not banned) in Tamil Nadu, such usage by out of state people is greeted with indifference. So Lakshmi Menon, Shilpa Shetty, Pranab Mukherjee, Somnath Chaterjee etc. are referred by their preferred names which include their caste names. Likewise old tamil names with caste in them are also fully used while referring to them such as Pasumpoan Muthuramalinga Thevar, U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer etc.

In [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Gujarat]], a very common convention among the Hindu communities is to have the patronymic as the middle name. Examples:

* Cricketer [[Sunil Gavaskar]]'s full name is Sunil Manohar Gavaskar, where Manohar is his father's given name. Sunil Gavaskar's son [[Rohan Gavaskar]] would be Rohan Sunil Gavaskar, and so on.
* Cricketer [[Sachin Tendulkar]]'s full name is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, where Ramesh is his father's given name.
* First Deputy Prime Minister and first Home Minister [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]]'s full name is Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, where Jhaverbhai is his father's given name.
* India's 15th Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], famously took oath of office as the Prime Minister of India as Narendra Damodardas Modi, where in Damodardas is his father's given name. He prefers to write his full name including his father's name as his middle name.

This system works for both boys and girls, except that after marriage, a woman takes her husband's given name as her middle name – her new middle name is no longer a patronymic.

Indians, particularly [[Tamils]] in [[Singapore]], often continue the patronymic tradition; this entails having a single given name, followed by son / daughter of, followed by their father's name.

[[Malaysian Indians]] may also follow this custom with "son" or "daughter" of being replaced by "anak lelaki" or "anak perempuan", respectively.

Indians of the [[Muslim]] [[Isma'ili]] [[Fiqh|sect]] also have patronymic middle names which use the father's first name and the grandfather's first name plus a family name. Someone called "Ramazan Rahim Ali Manji" might call his son "Karim Ramazan Rahim Manji" and his granddaughter might be called "Zahra Karim Ramazan Manji".

====Southeast Asia====
In [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]], ethnic Malays generally follow the Arabic patronymic naming system of ''given name'' + bin/binti + ''father's name''.

In [[Brunei]], the ruling family of the monarch uses ''given name'' + ''ibni'' + ''father's name'' instead of using bin/binti.

In Indonesia, there are a number of ethnic groups with different naming systems. The [[Batak people|Batak]] of [[North Sumatra]] (Sumatra Utara) give every child the family's name. Sometimes the family's name is prefixed by Huta-, Batu-, etc., but most use Si-, such as Sitanggang, Sihombing, Sibutar-butar, Sinaga, or Sitohang. The family's name is given from the father's family. For example, if the father's name is Boggi Sinaga who married to Moetia Siregar then all children will be given family's name of Sinaga.

In Sunda a similar cultural rule is used to that of the Batak. The family's name for [[Sunda language|Sunda]] is -Wijaya, but this isn't true for all [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] families.

====Middle East====

=====Arabic=====
{{See also|Arabic name#Nasab}}

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word "[[Wiktionary:ibn|ibn]]" ({{lang|ar|ابن}} or {{lang|ar|بن}}: "bin", "ben" and sometimes "ibni" and "ibnu" to show the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Case|grammatical case]] of the noun) is the equivalent of the "-son" suffix discussed above. (The prefix ben- is used similarly in Hebrew.) In addition, "[[Wiktionary:bint|bint]]" ({{lang|ar|بنت}}) means "daughter of". Thus, for example, "Ali ibn `Amr" means "Ali son of `Amr". In Classical Arabic, the word ''ibn'' is written as ''bn'' between two names, since the case ending of the first name then supplies a vowel. Consequently, ibn is often written as "b.", as bint is often written as "bt.," in name formulas rendered from Arabic into Roman characters. Thus Hisham ibn al-Kalbi is alternatively written as Hisham b. al-Kalbi. However, the pronunciation "bin" is dialectal and has nothing to do with either the spelling or pronunciation in Classical Arabic. The word "Abu" ("Aba" or "Abi" in different grammatical cases) means "father of", so "Abu `Ali" is another name for "`Amr".

In medieval times, an [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate child]] of unknown parentage would sometimes be termed "ibn Abihi", "son of his father" (notably [[Ziyad ibn Abihi]].) In the [[Qur'an]],  [[Jesus]] ([[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]] in Arabic) is consistently termed "`Isa ibn Maryam" - a [[matronymic]] (in the Qur'an, Jesus has no father; see [[Islamic view of Jesus]]). An Arabic patronymic can be extended as far back as family tree records will allow: thus, for example, [[Ibn Khaldun]] gives his own full name as "`Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Jabir ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn `Abd ar-Rahman ibn Khaldun".

Patronymics are still standard in parts of the Arab world, notably [[Saudi Arabia]] and Iraq. (In the case of Iraq, with the omitted ibn or bint.) However, most of the Arab world has switched to a family name system.{{When|date=May 2015}}  As in English, the new family names are sometimes based on what was formerly a patronymic. Another form widely used in the Arab world is the usage of both the patronymic and a family name, often using both the father's and paternal grandfathers given name in sequence after the own given name, and then the family name. In [[Iraq]] for example, full names are formed by combining the given name of an individual with the given name of their father (sometimes the father is skipped and the paternal grandfather's given name is used instead, sometimes both father and paternal grandfather are used), along with the town, village, or clan name. For instance, Hayder Muhammed al-Tikriti is the son of Muhammed named Hayder, and he is from the town of [[Tikrit]]. In Saudi Arabia naming conventions are similar to Iraq's but family names are used much more often.

=====Aramaic=====
In [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the prefix '''''bar-''''' means "son" and is used as a prefix meaning "son of". In the Bible, Peter is called Bar-Jonah in [[Matthew 16:17]] and Nathanael is possibly called Bartholomew because he is the son of Tolmai (or son of Ptolemy, with "P" being reduced). The titles can also be figurative, for example in [[Book of Acts|Acts]] 4:36-37 a man named Joseph is called [[Barnabas]] meaning "son of consolation".

=====Assyrian=====
The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] for centuries have used the patronymic '''''bet''''' or '''''bit''''' literally meaning "house" in [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]; however, in the context of the name it means "from the house of [the father's name]."

=====Jewish=====
{{details|Jewish name}}

[[Jew]]s have historically used [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] patronymic names after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], before which the most common language was [[Aramaic]]. In the Jewish patronymic system the first name is followed by either '''''ben-''''' or '''''bat-''''' ("son of" and "daughter of", respectively), and then the father's name, mother's name, or both. In [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the first name was followed by '''''bar-''''' or '''''bat-''''' ("son of" and "daughter of", respectively).

Permanent family surnames exist today, first by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]] in 10th or 11th century [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the late 18th century, when Austria passed the first law requiring Jews adopt surnames. Similar laws were passed in [[Prussia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], France, regions of Germany, and other countries.

While Jews now have permanent surnames for everyday life, the patronymic form is still used in religious life. It is used in [[synagogue]] and in documents in [[Halakha|Jewish law]] such as the [[ketubah]] (marriage contract). Many Sephardic Jews used the Arabic ''ibn'' instead of ''bat'' or ''ben'' when it was the norm. The Spanish family [[Ibn Ezra (disambiguation)|Ibn Ezra]] is one example.

There is a strong cultural pressure for [[Aliyah|immigrants]] to [[Israel|modern Israel]] to [[Hebraization of surnames|Hebraize]] their names.&lt;ref name="Kaganoff"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Jewish Names and Their History|author=Benzion C.

This practice is especially common among Ashkenazic immigrants, because most of their names were taken during the period from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century. For example, [[Golda Meir]] was born "Golda Mabovitch", took the name "Golda Meyerson" after her marriage to American Morris Meyerson, and, upon making [[Aliyah]] and at the urging of [[Moshe Sharett]], [[Hebraization of surnames|Hebraized]] her last name to [[Meir (name)|Meir]].&lt;ref name="Neil Caplan"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 1956 Sinai Campaign Viewed from Asia: Selections from Moshe Sharett's Diaries|author=Neil Caplan|publisher=Indiana University Press|journal=Israel Studies|volume=7|number=1|date=Spring 2002|pages=81–103|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/is/summary/v007/7.1caplan.html|accessdate=June 3, 2014|doi=10.1353/is.2002.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Persian=====
In [[Persian language|Persian]], patronymics پَتوَند are formed by names ending with the suffix "Pur" "پور" for men and "Dokht" "دُخت" for women. For example: Shahpoor (son of king) and Sinapoor (Ebne sina). Depending on country, some suffixes are more common than others. For example, in [[Iran]], the suffix "pur" is common while in [[Afghanistan]], the suffix "Zadah" "زاده" or "Zad" "زاد" is common.

===Europe===
In Western Europe patronyms were formerly widespread but later became confined to Scandinavia and Iceland.

====English====
In England, names ending with the suffix "son" were often originally patronymic. In addition, the archaic [[French language|French]] (more specifically, [[Norman language|Norman]]) prefix ''fitz'' (cognate with the modern French ''[[wikt:fils|fils]]'', meaning "son"), appears in England's aristocratic family lines dating from the [[Norman Conquest]], and also among the [[Anglo-Irish]]. Thus there are names such as Fitzgerald and Fitzhugh. Of particular interest is the name "Fitzroy", meaning "son of [the] king", which was used by illegitimate royal children who were acknowledged as such by their fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-258669.html |title=Another Name Question [Archive&amp;#93; - Straight Dope Message Board |publisher=Boards.straightdope.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish, Scottish and Manx====

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}
The use of "Mac" in some form was prevalent in [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]], in all of which it denotes "son". "Mc" is also a frequent anglicisation in both Scotland and Ireland. In Ireland, the forms "Mag" and "M'" are encountered. The prefix "Mac" is used to form a patronym, such as "Mac Coinnich" – or the anglicized 'Mackenzie' – son of Coinneach/Kenneth. The female equivalent of ''Mac'' is ''Nic'', condensed from ''nighean mhic'' (in Scottish Gaelic) or ''iníon mhic'' (in Irish), both meaning daughter. For example, the Scottish Gaelic surname, ''Nic Dhòmhnaill'' meaning 'daughter of a son of Dòmhnall' (in English, Donald), as in ''Mairi Nic Dhòmhnaill'', or Mary MacDonald.

At the north end of the [[Irish Sea]], in [[Ulster]], the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Galloway]] (indeed as far north as [[Argyll]]), "Mac" was frequently truncated in speech to /k/, leading to such anglicisations as "Qualtrough" (Son of Walter) &amp; "Quayle" (son of Paul, cf. [[MacPhail (disambiguation)|MacPhail]]) – usually beginning with "C", "K" or "Q". In Ireland, this truncation resulted in surnames such as "Guinness" (son of Aonghus, cf. MacAonghusa) beginning usually in "C" or "G" for patronymics prefixed with Mac, and in "H" (e.g. "Hurley" (descendant of Jarlath, cf. Ua h-Iarfhlatha/O'Hurley)) for surnames prefixed with "O". Colloquial Scottish Gaelic also has other patronymics of a slightly different form for individuals, still in use (for more information please see: [[Scottish Gaelic personal naming system]]).

====Welsh and Cornish====
{{anchor|Wales|Cornwall}}
{{see also|Welsh surnames|Cornish surnames}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Before the 1536 [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Act of Union]], the Welsh did not generally employ surnames, but instead used [[epithet]]s (e.g. [[Selyf Sarffgadau]], "Selyf the Battle-Serpent"), patronyms (e.g. [[Rhodri the Great|Rhodri ap Merfyn]], "Rhodri son of Merfyn"), and (much less often) matronyms (e.g. [[Rhodri the Great|Rhodri ap Nest]], "Rhodri son of Nest") to identify people. Welsh, as a [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|P-Celtic language]], originally used ''map'' or ''mab'' instead of the [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|Q-Celtic]] ''mac'' employed in Ireland and Scotland. These were later simplified to the [[modern Welsh]] ''ap'' and ''ab''. A common practice is to use ''ab'' before a father's name beginning with a vowel (e.g., [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]]), but they{{clarify|date=August 2015}} are also employed arbitrarily in many sources.

Daughters were indicated by ''ferch'' or ''verch'' ([[Welsh language#mutation|mutated]] from ''merch'', "girl, daughter"). ''Angharad verch Owain'' would be "Angharad, daughter of Owain".

After the Acts of Union, this led to many Welsh surnames being variants of their father or ancestor's personal name: ''ap'' or ''ab Ieuan'' often became "Evans"; ''ap Rhys'', "Price"; ''ap'' or ''ab Owain'', "Bowen"; ''ap Hywel'', "Powell" or "Howell". In addition to these Anglicised baptismal and official names, patronyms continued to be commonly employed in Welsh until the [[Industrial Revolution]], particularly in the north and west of Wales. Patronyms were sometimes employed within the English names as well by using the father's personal name as the sons' [[middle name]].

Similar rules might apply in [[Cornish surnames|Cornwall]] were it not for its earlier inclusion into England; and therefore patronyms (e.g.[m]ap Ros&gt;Rouse, [m]ap Richard&gt;Pritchard, Davies, Evans) are less common than [[Toponymic surname|toponyms]] (e.g. [[Tresillian]], Trevithick, [[Nankivell|Nanskeval/Nankeville]]) and occupational surnames (e.g. [[An Gof]], [An] Gove, ''([[Blacksmith]])''; Helyer (Cornish dialect - possibly a [[slater]] or [[Hunter|huntsman]] (helgher)).&lt;ref name="Kernow names"&gt;[reepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~kernow/names_h.htm Rootsweb Ancestry.com - Kernow names]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dutch====
In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], patronymics were often used in place of [[family name]]s or as middle names. Patronymics were composed of the father's name plus an ending ''-zoon'' for sons, ''-dochter'' for daughters. For instance, [[Abel Tasman|Abel Janszoon Tasman]] is "Abel son of Jan Tasman", and [[Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer]]: "Kenau, daughter of Simon Hasselaer". In written form, these endings were often abbreviated as ''-sz.'' and ''-dr.'' respectively e.g. Jeroen Corneli'''sz'''. "Jeroen son of Cornelis", or [[Dirck Jacobsz.|Dirck Jacobsz]]. The endings ''-s'', ''-se'' and ''-sen'' were also commonly used for sons and often for daughters too. In the northern provinces, ''-s'', as [[genitive case]], was almost universally used for both sons and daughters. The suffix -''x'' as in "Tacx" also denoted the son or daughter of Tac, and is now integrated as a complete name.

Patronymics were common in the Dutch [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] until the [[France|French]] invasion in 1795 and subsequent annexation in 1810. As the Netherlands were now a province of France, a registry of births, deaths and marriages was established in 1811, whereupon [[emperor]] [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] forced the Dutch to register and adopt a distinct surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republikanisme.nl/naamgeving.html|title=Decreet van Naamsaanneming (Napoleon, 18 augustus 1811)|accessdate=2009-04-29|language=Dutch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912024314/http://www.republikanisme.nl/naamgeving.html|archivedate=2009-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====French====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In France, the terms ''patronyme'' and ''nom patronymique'' had long been used interchangeably to designate the family name, meaning that it is inherited from the father.

The tradition of patronymic lineage is still used among some Canadian descendants of French colonists: in the oral tradition of many [[Acadians]], for example, ''Marc à Pierre à Gérard'' (lit. "Marc of Pierre of Gérard"), means "Marc, son of Pierre, grandson of Gérard".

====Iberian peninsula====
{{see also|Spanish naming customs|Portuguese naming customs}}
In the past, both in Spanish and Portuguese, the endings ''-ez'' and ''-es'' tended to be conflated since pronunciation was quite similar in the two languages. Today, Portuguese has been fully standardized to ''-es''; Spanish is also standardized to ''-ez'', but it is very common to see archaic endings in ''-es''. For instance, [[Pires (disambiguation)|Pires]]/[[Peres]] and [[Pérez]] are the modern forms of "[[Peterson (name)|Peterson]]" in Portuguese and Spanish.

In [[Portugal]], there are some surnames which had a patronymic genesis, while still common they no longer indicate patronymic usage. For instance, ''Álvares'' was the son of ''Álvaro'' and ''Gonçalves'' was the son of ''Gonçalo'' (it was the case of [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]], son of Álvaro Gonçalves Pereira, son of Gonçalo Pereira). Other cases include ''Rodrigues'' (''son of Rodrigo''), ''Nunes'' (''son of Nuno'') and ''Fernandes'' (''son of Fernando'').
In the same way the surname Soares means son of Soeiro (in Latin Suarius). It comes from Latin Suaricius (son of Suarius); the Latin [[genitive]] suffix ''-icius/a'' was used to indicate a patronymic. Later it became Suáriz, Suárez and eventually Soares. Another theory attributes the Iberian -ez style patronymics to Germanic (Visigothic) rather than Latin influence.&lt;ref name=port-names1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=port-names2 /&gt;

[[Spain|Spanish]] patronyms follow a similar pattern to the Portuguese (e.g., [[López]]: of Lope; [[Hernández]]: of Hernán; [[Álvarez (surname)|Álvarez]]: of Álvaro). Common endings include -ez, -az, -is, and -oz. However, not all names with similar endings are necessarily patronymic. For example, Chávez is not the son of ''Chavo'', but comes from [[Galician language|Galician]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Chaves'', meaning "keys", and its "s" stands for the plural form, as in key/keys in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kvs/heraldry/spanish16/ |title=16th Century Spanish Names |author=Elsbeth Anne Roth (Kathy Van Stone) |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science |date=2002 |accessdate=2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scandinavian languages====
{{see also|Icelandic name}}

In Norse custom patronyms and matronyms were formed by using the ending -son (later -søn and -sen in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[German language|German]]) to the [[genitive case|genitive]] form of the father's name to indicate "son of", and -dóttir ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and Faroese -dóttir, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and Norwegian -dotter, Danish and Norwegian -datter) for "daughter of". This name was generally used as a last name although a third name, a so-called byname based on location or personal characteristic, was often added to differentiate people and could eventually develop into a kind of [[family name]]. Some [[Early Modern]] examples of the latter practice, where the patronymic was placed after the given name and was followed by the surname, are Norwegian [[Peder Claussøn Friis]], the son of Nicolas Thorolfsen Friis (Claus in Claussøn being short for Nicolas) and Danish [[Thomas Kingo|Thomas Hansen Kingo]], the son of Hans Thomsen Kingo.

Eventually, most Nordic countries replaced or complemented this system with the prevailing "international" standard of inherited family names. In Norway, for example, the [[Storting|parliament]] passed a family name act in 1923, citing the rising population and the need to avoid the confusion of new last names in every generation. The law does allow a person to retain a patronymic as a [[middle name]] in addition to the surname, as was common in Early Modern times; this is not a common practice, but does occur, a modern example being [[Audhild Gregoriusdotter Rotevatn]]. The Danish government outlawed the practice in 1856 and eased the regulations in 1904 to deal with the limited number of patronymics. In Sweden the practice of children keeping their father's and wives keeping their husband's patronymic as a surname occurred in the 1700s but was first prevalent in the late 1800s, still present yet uncommon in the 1900s and finally abolished in 1966. In 1982 the right to use patronyms (and matronyms) was partially restored, and from 1 July 2017 parents in Sweden are free to give their children patronyms/matronyms at birth instead of inherited family names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=En ny lag om personnamn|url=http://www.regeringen.se/rattsdokument/lagradsremiss/2016/04/en-ny-lag-om-personnamn/|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matronyms were used exceptionally if the child was born out of wedlock or if the mother was much more high-born or well known than the father, a historical example being [[Sweyn Estridsson]].

[[Icelandic name|In Iceland]], patronymics or matronymics are still used as last names and this is in fact compulsory by law, with a handful of exceptions. The father's name (occasionally with a minor alteration for genitive) plus the word ''son'' for sons, ''dóttir'' for daughters.&lt;ref name="namelaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/lagas/135a/1996045.html|title=Lög um mannanöfn |author=Alþingi Íslands|accessdate=2008-04-02|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] (to be read in English as "Jóhanna, daughter of Sigurð[ur]").

====Finnish====

In [[Finland]], the use of patronymics was a result of relatively recent Swedish influence and remained uncommon outside official documents. Only in the 19th century did the use of patronymics gain any sort of popularity among the [[Finnish language|Finnish-speaking]] lower classes.&lt;ref name="paikkala"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paikkala|first1=Sirkka|title=Patronyymit ja matronyymit sukututkimuksissa|url=http://www.genealogia.fi/nimet/nimi16s.htm|website=genealogia.fi|publisher=Suomen Sukututkimusseura|accessdate=2 August 2015|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family names became obligatory in Finland by law in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fi:Nimilaki]]{{Better source|date=June 2017|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, patronymics were composed in Swedish fashion: the father's name and the suffix -n for genitive plus the word ''poika'' for sons, ''tytär'' for daughters. For example, Tuomas Abrahaminpoika (to be read in English as "Tuomas, Abraham's son") and Martta Heikintytär (to be read in English as "Martta, Heikki's daughter").&lt;ref name="paikkala" /&gt;

====Bulgarian====
In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the patronymics are ''-ov''/''-ev'' and ''-ova''/''-eva'' for men and women, respectively. These are identical to the endings of ''family'' names in Bulgarian and some other Slavic family names (such as names in Russian and [[Czech language|Czech]]). In Bulgarian official documents, the patronymic is inserted before the surname - e.g. ''Ivan Marinov Yordanov'' would be the son of ''Marin Yordanov''.

====Caucasus====

=====Armenian=====
{{main|Armenian surnames}}

The use of patronymics was introduced in Armenia by Russians during the times of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Previously to that the use of patronymics was very limited. Patronymics are usually formed by addition of "i" ("of", pronounced as ee) to the father's name, e.g. if father's name is "Armen", the corresponding patronymic would be "Armeni" (of Armen). Russified version of the same patronymic would be "Armenovich" for males and "Armenovna" for females. After Armenia re-gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 a massive decline in the use of Russified patronymics occurred; nowadays few Armenians use patronymics outside of official contexts.

Many Armenian surnames were once patronymics first used by distant ancestors or clan founders. These are characterized by the suffix "-ian" in Western Armenian, often transliterated as "-yan" in Eastern Armenian. These are appended to the given name, i.e. Kardash'''ian''', Asdvadzadour'''ian''', Hagop'''ian''', Khachadour'''ian''', Mardiros'''ian''', Bedros'''ian''', Sarkiss'''ian''', etc. Note that the suffix "-ian" was also appended to trades, as in Adakhtsakordz'''ian''' (issued from the carpenter), Chalian (issued from the candlemaker, using the Turkish word "chal", meaning candle).

Of particular note are the surnames of the children of married priests, or kahanas. Though not as common nowadays, it was customary for a long time for these children (particularly the sons) to change their last names to the name-in-religion of their father. For example, the son of Ter (Reverend) Bartev would change his last name to Ter Bartevian.

=====Azerbaijani=====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], patronymics are formed through ''[[:wikt:oğul|-oğlu]]'' (sometimes transliterated as ''ogly'') for males and ''[[:wikt:qız|qızı]]'' (often transliterated as ''gizi'' or ''kizi'') for females. Prior to the late 19th–early 20th century, patronymics were used as an essential part of a person's full name, i.e. ''Sardar Ilyas oğlu'' ("Sardar, son of Ilyas") and ''Mina Nabi qızı'' ("Mina, daughter of Nabi"), since surnames were mostly non-existent before [[Sovietization]] (with the exception of the upper and some middle-class families). After surnames were commonly adopted in [[Azerbaijan]] in the 1920s, patronymics still remained parts of full names, i.e. ''Sardar Ilyas oğlu Aliyev'' ("Sardar Aliyev, son of Ilyas"). Nowadays in Azerbaijan, patronymics sometimes replace surnames in unofficial use. Normally in such case, they are spelled as one word (i.e. ''Eldar Mammadoğlu'', ''Sabina Yusifqızı''). Many Azeri surnames are also derived from Persian-style patronymics ending in ''-zadeh'' (''Kazimzadeh'', ''Mehdizadeh'', etc.). They are found among both Caucasian and Iranian Azeris. However unlike the former, Azeris in Iran do not generally use patronymics in ''oglu'' / ''qizi''. Azeri patronymics are not to be confused with [[Turkish language|Turkish]] surnames in ''-oğlu'' and [[Greek language|Greek]] surnames in -ογλού (''-oglou''), which do not have specific female versions and do not reflect names of fathers.

=====Georgian=====
{{main|Georgian surname}}
In Georgian, patronymics, when used, come with the addition of ''s'' to the end of the father's name, followed by ''dze'' for a man and ''asuli'' for a woman. For example, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s actual name was Ioseb Besarionis Dze Jugashvili. ''s'' in Georgian is a possessive, and ''dze'' and ''asuli'' mean male and female descendant. After collapse of the USSR, patronymics in Georgia are disused as part of Russian tradition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Georgian last names derive mostly from patronymics, nicknames and places of origin. Two common elements in Georgian last names, ''dze'' and ''shvili'' mean son of, and child, respectively.

====Greek and Greek Cypriot====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Most [[Greek language|Greek]] surnames are patronymics by origin, albeit in various forms depending on ancestral locality. Diminutive suffixes which denote "''son of''", or more generally "''descendant of''", are produced as follows: starting with the given name Δημήτριος, ''Dēmétrios'', for example, the patronymic surnames Dēmētr''ópoulos'' ([[Peloponnese]]), Dēmētr''ákos'' ([[Laconia]]), Dēmētr''éas'' ([[Messenia]]n [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]]), Dēmētr''átos'' ([[Cephalonia]]), Dēmētr''ákēs'' ([[Crete]]), Dēmētr''iádēs''/Dēmētr''-ídēs'' ([[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Asia Minor]]), Dēmētr''éllēs'' ([[Lesbos]]), Dēmétr''oglou'' ([[Asia Minor]]) (identical to Turkish patronym ''-oğlu''), or simply ''Dēmētríou'' (esp. common in [[Cyprus]], the first name in the [[Genitive]]) are formed. The same principle can apply to surnames deriving from professions, for example from παπάς, ''papás'', priest, one derives the surnames ''Papadópoulos, Papadákos, Papadéas, Papadátos, Papadákēs, Papadéllēs, Papazoglou'' etc., all of which signify a "priest's son". The same principle(s) may apply in combination, e.g. ''Papanikoláou, Papanikolópoulos'', "the son of the priest Nikolaos". A daughter's family name is the same as the son's, but ''always'' declined in the [[Genitive]], e.g. ''Dēmētropoúlou, Papanikoláou'' etc.

In addition to these surnames, ''actual'' patronymics are used in official documents as "middle names" preceding the surname. For example, the children of a ''Giánnēs Papadópoulos'' are, say, ''María Ioánnou Papadopoúlou'' and ''Andréas Ioánnou Papadópoulos'' (''Ioánnou'' is the [[genitive case]] form of ''Ioánnēs'', which is the formal form of the father's name, ''Giánnēs''). Traditionally, a married woman would adopt her husband's family name. Now, however, women in Greece can keep their own surname if they so choose.

In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], patronyms were traditionally formed with the ending ''-fi'' (sometimes spelled as ''-fy'' or ''-ffy''). This system is no longer in common use, though traces of it can still be found in some frequent present-day surnames such as ''Pálfi'' (son of Paul), ''Győrfi'', ''Bánfi'' or in the name of the famous poet [[Sándor Petőfi]] (who chose this Hungarian form instead of his Slavic birth name ''Petrovics''). In the Old Hungarian period (10th−16th century, see [[History of Hungarian]]), when surnames were not in common use, the full genitive was represented as in ''Péter fia András'' (''Peter's son Andrew''); these forms are in frequent use in charters and legal documents dated back to that time.

====Romanian====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the endings ''-escu'' and ''-eanu'' were used, as in ''Petrescu'', 'son of Petre (Peter)'; many modern Romanian family names were formed from such patronymics. Less commonly, matronymics formed with the [[Genitive case|genitive]] form (using the prefix ''a-'') were used, as in ''Amariei'', '(son/daughter) of Maria'.

====Russian====
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
In [[East Slavic languages]], the endings ''-ovich'', ''-evich'' and ''-ich'' are used to form patronymics for men. It would be cognate to the Latin genitive -ici, used for marking family line, and also as equivalent to: 'little' -Vladic= 'the little Vlad'-. For women, the ending is ''-yevna'', ''-ovna'' or ''-ichna''. For example, in [[Russian language|Russian]], a man named Ivan with a father named Nikolay would be known as Ivan Nikolayevich or "Ivan, son of Nikolay" (''Nikolayevich'' being a patronymic). Likewise, a woman named Lyudmila with a father named Nikolay would be known as Lyudmila Nikolayevna or "Lyudmila, daughter of Nikolay" (''Nikolayevna'' being a patronymic). For masculine names ending in a vowel, such as Ilya or Foma, when they are used as a base for patronymic, the corresponding endings are ''-ich'' (for men) and ''-inichna'' (for women). Examples in titles  of classical Russian literature include'' [[The Belkin Tales|The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin]]'', ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'' and "[[The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich]]".

In Russia, the patronymic is an official part of the name, used in all official documents, and when addressing somebody both formally and among friends.&lt;ref name=rus1&gt;{{cite book |last=Cubberley |first=Paul |date=17 October 2002 |title=Russian: A Linguistic Introduction |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=355 |isbn=9780521796415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rus2&gt;{{cite book |last=Stakhnevich |first=Julia |date=2007 |title=The Everything Learning Russian Book |publisher=Everything Books |page=74 |isbn=9781598693874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are addressed by their given name followed by patronymic (e.g., "Mikhail Nikolayevich") in many situations including on formal occasions, by colleagues at work, by acquaintances, or when addressed by someone younger in age.&lt;ref name=rus1/&gt;&lt;ref name=rus3&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Smorodinskaya |editor1-first=Tatiana |editor2-last=Evans-Romaine |editor2-first=Karen |editor3-last=Goscilo |editor3-first=Helena |date=2007 |title=Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Russian |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=412 |isbn=9781136787867}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is becoming more common for younger individuals (under 50) to drop the patronymic at work.&lt;ref name=rus3/&gt; In informal situations, if a person is called by a [[diminutive]] (such as Misha for Mikhail or Nastya for Anastasia), the patronymic is not used.&lt;ref name=rus2/&gt;

In [[colloquial]], informal speech, it is also possible to contract the ending of a patronymic: thus Nikolayevich becomes Nikolaich, and Stepan Ivanovich becomes Stepan Ivanych or simply Ivanych as the [[given name]] may be omitted altogether. In this case the contraction, if possible, is obligatory: Ivan Sergeyevich Sidorov may be called "Sergeich" or, more rarely, "Sergeyevich". In contrast to male names, if a woman is called by her patronymic name without a given name, the patronymic is usually not contracted: "Ivanovna" but "Mar' Ivanna"; "Sergeyevna"/"Sergevna" is one exception, where both forms are fine. Typically, a patronymic name alone is a familiar form of addressing an older female.

====Serbian====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
[[Vuk Karadžić]] reported in the 19th century that Serbs sometimes used their old family names, and sometimes patronymics. Vuk Karadžić himself used patronymic Stefanović (son of Steven), and sometimes Karadzić, old family name. However, nowadays, the patronymic names in Serbia are mostly used on legal documents, and have the form of the father's name that says the child is 'of so and so'... example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlovic, where Dragoljub is the father's name and 'Dragoljuba' literally means 'of Dragoljub'.

In Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, the patronymic names do not change form between [[Grammatical gender|masculine]] and [[Grammatical gender|feminine]].  Example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlović (Dragoljub is the father's name; Dragoljuba is the form that says she is his daughter, or literally 'of Dragoljub').

====Turkish&lt;!--Turkish not Turkic: see talk page--&gt;====
{{main|Turkish name}}
In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the [[suffix]]es used to indicate paternal ancestry are ''[[:wikt:oğul|-oğlu]]'' and ''[[:wikt:zadeh|-zade]]'', which indicate the ancestry as coming from a certain man. Like many other patronymics in other languages, with the formalization of naming conventions by laws in the [[late modern history|late modern]] [[Contemporary history|contemporary age]] many turned into surnames. After the '[[Surname Law|Surname revolution]]' in 1934, many people chose professions or habitat as surnames with or without the suffix ''-oğlu'', such as ''Elbeyioğlu'', ''Bakkaloğlu'' or ''Giritlioğlu'' and with ''-zade'' such as ''[[Begzada|Beyzade]]'', ''Mehmedzade'', ''Yusufzade''.

====Ukrainian====
In [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], the female patronymic always ends with ''-івна'' ''(-ivna)'' or ''-ївна'' ''(-yivna)''.&lt;ref name=LPUkraine/&gt; The male patronymic always ends with -''ович'' ''(-ovych)'' or ''-йович'' ''(-yovych)''.&lt;ref name=LPUkraine&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MUmCGXMhQuYC&amp;pg=PA52 Ukrainian:Lonely Planet Phrasebook] by [[Marko Pavlyshyn]], [[Lonely Planet]], 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-74104-605-2}} (page 52)&lt;/ref&gt; Exception: ''Illia (Ілля)'' -&gt; ''Illich (Ілліч)'' (e.g. [[Élie Metchnikoff|Illia Illich Mechnikov]]), ''Sava (Сава)'' -&gt; ''Savych (Савич)'', ''Iakiv (Яків)'' -&gt; ''Iakovych (Якович)''&lt;ref&gt;Потелло Н.

'''Petiese''' (alt. '''Peteese''', '''Pediese''') was the name of a number of high ancient Egyptian officials who served the pharaohs during the seventh and sixth centuries BCE. Their family history is known from a petition (pRylands 9) which the priest Petiese (referred to below as Petiese III) wrote during the reign of [[Darius I of Persia]], although some have claimed that, rather than a real petition, this is a [[Ancient Egyptian literature|work of literature]] or at best a draft for a petition.

==The Petition of Petiese==
Petiese I, son of Ireturu, administered [[Upper Egypt]] jointly with his cousin Petiese, son of Ankhshesheq, who held the position of Ships Master. In 651 BCE he had his priestly offices confirmed by [[Psamtik I]], above all that of prophet of [[Amun]] of [[Al-Hibah|Teudjoi]]. After he had resigned from his powerful office of administrator of Upper Egypt, the priests of Teudjoi decided in 621 to wrest his priestly offices, which were well paid, from him and killed two of his grandsons. Pediese received police protection. He restored the fortunes of the temple at Teudjoi. Pediese's rights were inscribed on a stela. He signed over his prophet's portion to his son Wedjasematawi I.

In 591, Petiese II, son of Wedjasematawi I, accompanied [[Psamtik II]] on a campaign to Syria. While he was away, the priests of Teudjoi bribed an official and Petiese on his return lost his case against the priests in court.

After his death, his son Wedjasematawi II had to flee from Teudjoi as the priests tried to force him to sign over his rights to them. They destroyed his house in his absence, but had to pay a small compensation when Petiese III, the son of Wedjasematawi II, brought an action against them.

If the petition of Petiese III is to be believed there was little justice in the Egypt of his time and only bribery brought results.

The '''Rat Pack''' is a term used by the media to refer to an informal group of entertainers centered on the [[Las Vegas]] casino scene.  Having its origins in a group of friends that met at the Los Angeles home of [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], by the 1960s, it was the name used by the press and the general public to refer to a later variation of the group that called itself "the Summit" or "the Clan", featuring [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Peter Lawford]] and [[Joey Bishop]] among others; they appeared together on stage and in films in the early 1960s, including the movies ''[[Ocean's 11]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=michel, peter |url=http://www.library.unlv.edu/speccol/dino/ratpack.html |title=UNLV Libraries, The Rat Pack, retrieved May 2, 2007 |publisher=Library.unlv.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908094745/http://www.library.unlv.edu/speccol/dino/ratpack.html |archivedate=September 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sergeants 3]]'', and ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' (in the last film, [[Bing Crosby]] replaced Lawford). Sinatra, Martin, and Davis were regarded as the group's lead members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-movie-portal.com/sergeants-3-1962/ |title=Sergeants 3 (1962) |publisher=The Movie Portal |date=1962-02-10 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hmv.com/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?sku=877346 |title=Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra: Dean Martin: Sammy Davis Jr): Big Three: 3cd (2008): CD |publisher=hmv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950s==
[[File:Sabrina9.jpg|left|thumb|[[Humphrey Bogart]], original Rat Pack leader (from [[Sabrina (1954 film)|''Sabrina'', 1954]])]]
The name "The Rat Pack" was first used to refer to a group of friends in New York.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Shawn Levy, ''Rat Pack confidential'', Doubleday, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Lawrence J. Quirk and William Schoel, ''The Rat Pack'', Taylor Publishing Company 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Several explanations have been offered for the famous name over the years.  According to one version, the group's original "Den Mother", [[Lauren Bacall]], after seeing her husband, [[Humphrey Bogart]], and his friends return from a night in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], said words to the effect of "You look like a goddamn rat pack."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; "Rat Pack" may also be a shortened version of "[[Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California|Holmby Hills]] Rat Pack", a reference to the home of Bogart and Bacall&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; which served as a regular hangout.

Visiting members included [[Errol Flynn]], [[Ava Gardner]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[Tony Curtis]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Cesar Romero]].

According to Stephen Bogart, the original members of the Holmby Hills Rat Pack were: Frank Sinatra (pack master), [[Judy Garland]] (first vice-president), Nicole Bassing (den mother), [[Sid Luft]] (cage master), Bogart (rat in charge of public relations), [[Swifty Lazar]] (recording secretary and treasurer), [[Nathaniel Benchley]] (historian), [[David Niven]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[George Cukor]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Rex Harrison]], and [[Jimmy Van Heusen]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In his autobiography ''[[The Moon's a Balloon]]'', David Niven confirms that the Rat Pack originally included him but neither Sammy Davis, Jr. nor Dean Martin.

==1960s==
The 1960s version of the group included [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[Joey Bishop]]. [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Juliet Prowse]], [[Buddy Greco]], and [[Shirley MacLaine]] were often referred to as the "Rat Pack Mascots". 

The post-Bogart version of the group (Bogart died in 1957) was reportedly never called that name by any of its members – they called it ''the Summit'' or ''the Clan''. "The Rat Pack" was a term used by journalists and outsiders, although it remains the lasting name for the group.

Often, when one of the members was scheduled to give a performance, the rest of the Pack would show up for an impromptu show, causing much excitement among audiences, resulting in return visits. They sold out almost all of their appearances, and people would come pouring into Las Vegas, sometimes sleeping in cars and hotel lobbies when they could not find rooms, just to be part of the Rat Pack entertainment experience. The Rat Pack's appearances were of unprecedented value because the city would always become flooded with [[high roller]]s, wealthy gamblers who would routinely leave substantial fortunes in the casinos' coffers. The marquees of the hotels at which they were performing as individuals would read, for example, "DEAN MARTIN - MAYBE FRANK - MAYBE SAMMY" as seen on a [[Sands Hotel]] sign.

Peter Lawford was a brother-in-law of President [[John F. Kennedy]] (dubbed "Brother-in-Lawford" by Sinatra),&lt;ref&gt;Spada, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; and Kennedy spent time with Sinatra and the others when he visited Las Vegas, during which members sometimes referred to the group as "the Jack Pack". Rat Pack members played a role in campaigning for Kennedy and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], appearing at the July 1960 [[Democratic National Convention]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Spada, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Lawford had asked Sinatra if he would have Kennedy as a guest at his [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] house in March 1962, and Sinatra went to great lengths (including the construction of a [[helipad]]) to accommodate the President.&lt;ref&gt;Spada, pp. 292-293&lt;/ref&gt; When Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] advised his brother to sever his ties to Sinatra because of the entertainer's association with Mafia figures such as [[Sam Giancana]], the stay was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Spada, p.293&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy instead chose to stay at rival [[Bing Crosby]]'s estate, which further infuriated Sinatra.&lt;ref name="Spada1"&gt;Spada, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Lawford was blamed for this, and Sinatra "never again had a good word for [him]" from that point onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Spada, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Lawford's role in the upcoming ''[[4 for Texas]]'' was written out, and his part in ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' was given to Bing Crosby.&lt;ref name="Spada1"/&gt;

On June 20, 1965, Sinatra, Martin, and Davis, with [[Johnny Carson]] as the [[Master of Ceremonies|emcee]] (substituting for Bishop, who was out with a bad back), performed their only televised concert together during the heyday of the Pack at the [[Peabody Opera House|Kiel Opera House]] in St. Louis, a closed-circuit broadcast done as a fundraiser for Dismas House (the first halfway house for ex-convicts) and fed live to movie theatres across the country. Thirty years later [[Paul Brownstein]] tracked down a print of the "lost" show in a St. Louis closet after someone noticed mysterious cameras onstage during a CBS documentary on Sinatra which filmed part of the show. It has since been broadcast on [[Nick at Nite]] (in 1998) as part of The [[Museum of Television &amp; Radio]] Showcase series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvclassics.com/ratpack.htm |title=The Rat Pack Captured |publisher=Tvclassics.com |date=1965-06-20 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released on DVD as part of the ''Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live &amp; Swingin''.

==Later years==
In 1981, [[Dean Martin]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], appeared together in the film ''[[Cannonball Run (film)|Cannonball Run]]'', and were joined by Sinatra in the sequel ''[[Cannonball Run II]]''. This would be the last time that the three would appear in a movie together ([[Shirley MacLaine]] also appears in the latter film).

==Revival==
[[File:Sammy Davis Jr 1989 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Sammy Davis, Jr. in 1989]]
In December 1987, at [[Chasen's]] restaurant in Los Angeles, Sinatra, Davis, and Martin announced a 29-date tour, called ''Together Again''. At the press conference to announce the tour, Martin joked about calling the tour off, and Sinatra rebuked a reporter for using the term "Rat Pack", referring to it as "that stupid phrase".&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Shawn. ''Rat Pack Confidential''. Fourth Estate. London, 1999. p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean Martin's son, [[Dean Paul Martin]], died in a plane crash in March 1987 on the [[San Gorgonio Mountain]] in California, the same mountain where Sinatra's mother, Dolly, was killed in a plane crash ten years earlier. Martin had since become increasingly dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs.

Random House. New York, 2003. p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; Davis was also experiencing severe financial difficulties, and was promised by Sinatra's people that he could earn between six and eight million dollars from the tour.&lt;ref name="Haygood p. 466"&gt;Haygood p. 466&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin had not made a film or recorded since 1984, and Sinatra felt that the tour would be good for Martin, telling Davis, "I think it would be great for Dean. Get him out. For that alone it would be worth doing".&lt;ref name="Levy, p. 339"&gt;Levy, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Sinatra and Davis still performed regularly, yet had not recorded for several years. Both Sinatra and Martin had made their last film appearances together in 1984's ''Cannonball Run II'', a film which also starred Davis. This marked the trio's first feature film appearance since 1964's ''Robin and the 7 Hoods''. Martin expressed reservations about the tour, wondering whether they could draw as many people as they had in the past. After private rehearsals, at one of which Sinatra and Davis had complained about the lack of black musicians in the orchestra,&lt;ref name="Haygood p. 466"/&gt; the tour began at the [[Oracle Arena|Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena]] on March 13, 1988, to a sold-out crowd of 14,500.&lt;ref name="Levy, p. 339"/&gt; 

Davis opened the show, followed by Martin and then Sinatra; after an interval, the three performed a medley of songs. During the show, Martin threw a lit cigarette at the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Anthony, Swan, Robbyn. ''Sinatra: The Life''. Corgi. New York, 2006 p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin withdrew from the tour after just five shows, with the official reason stated as being a flare-up of a kidney problem. Sinatra and Davis continued the tour under the title "The Ultimate Event" with [[Liza Minnelli]] replacing Martin as the third member of the trio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Takiff |first1=Jonathan |title=Frank, Liza &amp; Sammy The Ultimate Event! |url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-09-27/news/26230935_1_susan-reynolds-sammy-davis-frank-sinatra |accessdate=2016-05-01 |work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |date=1988-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis's associate stated that Sinatra's people were skimming the top of the revenues from the concerts, as well as stuffing envelopes full of cash into suitcases after the performances.&lt;ref&gt;Birkbeck, Matt. ''Deconstructing Sammy''. Amistad. New York, 2008. p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 1989, after Davis experienced throat pain, he was diagnosed with throat cancer which caused his death in May 1990. Davis was buried with a gold watch that Sinatra had given him at the conclusion of ''The Ultimate Event Tour''.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Swan, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1988 performance of ''The Ultimate Event'' in Detroit was recorded and shown on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] the following year as a tribute to the recently deceased Davis. A review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Davis's performance, describing him as "pure, ebullient, unapologetic show business."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957179,00.html |title= With Sammy Davis, the Spirit Lingers |accessdate=2009-06-05|publisher=The New York Times | date=March 6, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
Concerning the group's reputation for womanizing and heavy drinking, [[Joey Bishop]] stated in a 1998 interview: "I never saw Frank, Dean, Sammy or Peter drunk during performances. That was only a gag! And do you believe these guys had to chase broads? They had to chase 'em away!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,139509,00.html time.com]{{spaced ndash}}

[[Shirley MacLaine]] appeared in the 1958 film ''Some Came Running'' along with Sinatra and Martin. She had a major role (and Sinatra a cameo) in the 1956 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''. MacLaine played a Hindu princess who is rescued by, and falls in love with, original Rat Pack associate [[David Niven]], and Sinatra had a non-speaking, non-singing role as a piano player in a saloon, whose identity is concealed from the viewer until he turns his face toward the camera during a scene featuring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[George Raft]]. MacLaine appeared alongside Sinatra in the 1960 film ''[[Can-Can (film)|Can-Can]]''. She also had an appearance in the 1960 film ''Ocean's 11'' as a drunken woman. The 1984 film ''Cannonball Run II'', with MacLaine, marked the final time members of the Rat Pack shared theatrical screen-time together.

A biopic, ''[[The Rat Pack (film)|The Rat Pack]]'', made by [[HBO]] in 1998, starred [[Ray Liotta]] as Sinatra, [[Joe Mantegna]] as Martin and [[Don Cheadle]] as Davis, dramatizing their private lives and, in particular, their roles in the 1960 presidential campaign of [[John F. Kennedy]].

==Music==
''[[Christmas with the Rat Pack]]'', a collection of holiday tunes sung by Sinatra, Martin and Davis, was released in 2001. ''[[The Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live &amp; Swingin']]'' went on sale in 2003. A concert featuring the three men, ''[[Sands Hotel|Live from the Sands]]'' in [[Las Vegas]], also is available on CD.

==Stage==
''[[The Rat Pack: Live from Las Vegas]]'' tribute show originated on stage in [[London]] in 2000 and has been running continuously since then throughout Europe and North America.

[[File:Coat of Arms of Great Britain (1714-1801).svg|thumb|The Royal Arms of Great Britain from 1714 to 1801, with crest, supporters and motto]]

The '''Royal coat of arms of Great Britain''' was the [[coat of arms]] representing royal authority in the sovereign state of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], in existence from 1707 to 1801. The kingdom came into being on 1 May 1707, with the [[political union]] of the [[kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[kingdom of England]], which included [[Wales]]. With the 1706 [[Treaty of Union]] (ratified by the [[Acts of Union 1707]]), it was agreed to create a single kingdom, encompassing the whole of the island of Great Britain and its outlying islands, but not Ireland, which remained a separate realm under the newly created British crown.

On 1 January 1801, the royal arms of Great Britain were superseded by those of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], when Great Britain was united with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] by the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union of 1800]] following the suppression of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Scaea''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Σκαιήν means "left, on the left hand"), was one of the [[Daughters of Danaus|Danaids]].

==Family==
Scaea was the daughter of [[Danaus]], king of [[Libya]] and of [[Europa (Greek myth)|Europe]], a queen. She was the full sister of other Danaids namely Automate, [[Amymone]] and [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]]. ''Bibliotheca, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.1.5&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 Book 2.1.5]''&lt;/ref&gt; Scaea was married to [[Daiphron]], son of [[Aegyptus]] and later to [[Archander]] of whom she had begotten a son, [[Metanastes]].

==Mythology==
Scaea like her other sisters, except [[Hypermnestra]], killed their husbands on their wedding night at the behest of their father Danaus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the murder, later on, Scaea and her sisters were punished in afterlife, being forced to carry a jug to fill a bathtub (pithos) without a bottom (or with a leak) to wash their sins off. The water was always leaking that they would forever try to fill the tub.

In some accounts, Scaea remarried Archander while her sister Automate took as husband his brother [[Architeles]]. These two were sons of [[Achaeus (son of Xuthus)|Achaeus]], coming from [[Phthiotis]] to settle in [[Argos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].

'''The Twelve Imams''' are the spiritual and political successors to the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] in the [[Twelver]] or ''Athnā‘ashariyyah'' branch of [[Shia Islam]], including that of the [[Alawite]] and the [[Alevi]] sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Olsson|Ozdalga|Raudvere|2005|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[theology of Twelvers]], also the Twelve Imams are exemplary human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice, but also are able to keep and interpret ''[[sharia]]'' and the [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric meaning of the Quran]]. Muhammad and Imams' [[Sunnah|words and deeds]] are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as ''[[ismah]]'', or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or ''[[Nass (Islam)|nass]]'', through the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabataba'i|1977|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Twelvers1 copy copy.png|thumb|Calligraphic representation of the Twelve Imams along with that of the Prophet Muhammad.]]
==The belief of Imamah==
{{main|Imamate (Twelver doctrine)}}
It is believed in [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]] that [[Aql (Shiasm)|‘aql]], divine wisdom, is the source of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called ''[[Hikmah]]'' and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabataba'i|1977|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corbin|2014|pp=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Imam is not the recipient of a [[wahy|divine revelation]], he has a close relationship with [[Allah|God]], through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as [[Al-Jafr (book)|al-Jafr]] and [[al-Jamia]]. [[Imamate]], or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.&lt;ref name="Imamat"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam and the Muslim world; vol.1  | last = Gleave | first = Robert | title=Imamate | publisher = MacMillan | ISBN = 0-02-865604-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Twelvers, there is at all times an Imam of the era who is the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. [[Ali]] was the first of the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the [[Succession to Muhammad|rightful successor to Muhammad]], followed by male [[descendants of Muhammad]] through his daughter [[Fatimah]]. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], who was the brother of [[Hasan ibn Ali]]. The twelfth and final Imam is [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in [[The Occultation#Major Occultation|the Major Occultation]] until he returns to bring justice to the world.&lt;ref name="Imamat" /&gt; It is believed by [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] and [[Alevi]] [[Muslims]] that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors]]. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.

The Twelve Imams also have a leading role within some [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders and are seen as the spiritual heads of Islam, because most of the [[Silsila]] ''(spiritual chain)'' of Sufi orders lead back to one of the Twelve Imams.

The '''widowhood effect''' is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time  after their long-time [[spouse]] has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called "dying of a [[broken heart]]". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas &amp; Kuttichira, 2013).

Psychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement.  The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing.  Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically.  During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising.  Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide.  Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, P. J., Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011). Does Widowhood Increase Mortality Risk? Epidemiology, 22(1), 1-5. doi:10.1097/ede.0b013e3181fdcc0b&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}}It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-widowhood-effect-idUSBRE9AD0VU20131114|title='Widowhood effect' strongest during first three months|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jegtvig, 2013).

Although there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=J.

==Gender differences==

Both men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women.  Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136854 Widowhood and Depression: Explaining Long-Term Gender Differences in Vulnerability.] ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior.'' (1992). Retrieved on 2016-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 [[National Survey of Families and Households]]. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies]]— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 18, 2016 |title=Is Broken Heart Syndrome Difficult? |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Is-Broken-Heart-Syndrome-Difficult_UCM_448547_Article.jsp |location=Dallas |publisher=American Heart Association |access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lee|DeMaris|Bavin|Sullivan|2001}}

Experimenters involved in the study regarding: ''The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes'', took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).

In a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).

Nicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.

&lt;ref&gt;In conclusion to this, other research that has been conducted has gathered similar statistics regarding widowhood effect between genders. A comparable study taken place in the U.S found that “The death of a husband is associated with a greater rate in all-cause mortality for women, and the death of a wife is associated with a lesser rate in all-cause mortality for men, after adjusting for covariates (Elwert, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects of widowhood==
The death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, &amp; Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, &amp; Sullivan, 2001).

==Takotsubo and the widowhood effect==

Recently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the [[broken heart syndrome]] (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016.)

==Effects of widowhood on social life==

Elderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}} It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.

==Urban, rural and race variations==

A study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.

In a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2008).

The widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).

==Possible causes==

It was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased [[mortality rate]] of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.{{sfn|Boyle|Feng|Raab|2011}}

In April 2016, the [[American Heart Association]] published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as "broken heart syndrome". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"/&gt;


== Widowhood Effect Solution == 
	Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. 


== Coping Mechanisms ==
There is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.

The '''Witches Belvoir''' were a mother and her two daughters accused of [[witchcraft]] in England in the deaths of two young nobles, Henry (died 1613) and Francis Manners (died 1620), the heirs to [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland]], whose seat was at [[Belvoir Castle]] .

==Charge of witchcraft==
Three years after Henry's death, on 16 July 1616, nine women were hanged as witches in [[Leicestershire]] for having bewitched a young boy and, in charges similar to those in the Flowers' case, were said to have kept cats as familiars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Briscoe | first1 = J.

[[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Robert Bertie, Lord Willoughby de Eresby]], Sir George Manners, Sir William Pelham, Sir Henry Hastings, clergyman Samuel Fleming and others,&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt; the women were to be taken to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] [[gaol]].&lt;ref name="bookdays"/&gt;

When arrested Joan Flower professed her innocence. She was not known to be a Church-goer, but at [[Ancaster, Lincolnshire|Ancaster]], en route to the prison at [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]],&lt;ref name="bygone"/&gt; she asked for bread as a substitute for the Eucharist.&lt;ref name="BormanRev"&gt;{{cite news | first = Bella | last = Bathurst | title = Witches: A Tale of Sorcery, Scandal and Seduction by Tracy Borman – review | date = 2013-08-25 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/25/witches-sorcery-scandal-borman-review | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that something so blessed could not be consumed by a witch but she was to choke and die, after the first bite.&lt;ref name="BormanRev"/&gt;

At Lincoln, Margaret was to accuse her mother of witchcraft, while Phillipa admitted to witchcraft on behalf of herself, Margaret and Joan.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt; The sisters said they had entered into communion with [[familiar spirit]]s that had assisted them with their schemes. The mother's familiar was a cat named ''Rutterkin''.&lt;ref name="bookdays"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Chambers | first1 = Robert | title = The Book Of Days | chapter = March 11th | year = 1869 | url = http://www.thebookofdays.com/months/march/11.htm | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women admitted that they stole the glove of Lord Ros and gave it to their mother, who had dipped it in boiling water, stroked it along Rutterkin's back, and pricked it.&lt;ref name="bookdays"/&gt; Combined with some incantations this supposedly caused Lord Ros to become ill and die. An attempt to harm [[Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Lady Katherine]], the Earl's daughter, had failed when it was found that ''Rutterkin'' had no power over her. The women had also taken some feathers from the quilt of Rutland's bed and a pair of gloves. By boiling these in water mixed with blood they cast spells to prevent the Earl and Countess from having any more children.&lt;ref name="bookdays"/&gt; Both women admitted to experiencing visions of devils and that their familiar spirits visited them and sucked at their bodies.&lt;ref name="bookdays"/&gt;

==Others accused==
[[File:Threewitches.jpg|right|250px|thumb|left|A contemporary sketch of three other women accused: Anne Baker, Joan Willimot &amp; Ellen Greene.]]
During the examination, they revealed the names of other women who had aided them: Anne Baker of [[Bottesford, Leicestershire|Bottesford]]; Joan Willimot of [[Goadby, Leicestershire|Goadby]]; and Ellen Greene of [[Stathern]].&lt;ref name="bottshist2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bottesfordhistory.org.uk/page_id__62_path__0p2p46p.aspx | title = The Bottesford Witches, The Wonderful Discovery of the Witchcrafts of Joan, Margaret and Phillipa Flower | accessdate = 2013-11-01 | last = Bob | first = Sparford | work = Bottesford Living History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three women were taken for examination and revealed that they too had visions and consorted with familiar spirits.&lt;ref name="bottshist2"/&gt; Willimott said her familiar was called ''Pretty'' and had been blown into her mouth by her former master in the form of a fairy, later reappearing in the form of a woman who asked her to give up her soul. Willimott testified more as a [[Cunning folk in Britain|cunning woman]] than a witch, and insisted ''Pretty'' only helped her to inquire about the health of people she had attempted to heal:

{{quote|She never hurt any body, but did help divers persons that were stricken or fore-spoken (bewitched): and that her Spirit came weekly to her, and would tell of divers persons that were stricken and fore-spoken: and she saith that the use which she had of the Spirit, was to know those did which she had undertaken to amend and she did help them by certain prayers which she used.&lt;ref name="bottshist2"/&gt;}}

Greene claimed that she had accompanied Willimot into a wood where she said Willimot had conjured up two spirits in the form of a kitten and a "moldewarp" ([[mole (animal)|mole]]) which had climbed on her shoulders and sucked at her ears. Greene sent these familiars to kill a man and woman with whom she had argued and both died within a fortnight. Baker also confessed to possessing a familiar in the form of a white dog, but most of her testimony concerned the visions she had witnessed.

==Aftermath and legacy==
[[File:Inscription on Tomb of 6th Earl of Rutland.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Images of memorial text at Bottesford|'died in their infancy by wicked practises and sorcerye' – part of the memorial at [[Bottesford, Leicestershire|Bottesford]]]]
Margaret and Philippa Flowers were tried before [[Sir Henry Hobart, 1st Baronet|Henry Hobart]], Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and [[Edward Bromley]], a [[Exchequer of Pleas|Baron of the Exchequer]], and found guilty.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt; and Margaret was hung at [[Lincoln castle]] on 11 March 1619.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt;

Later that year a ballad, ''Damnable Practises of Three Lincolnshire Witches Joane Flower and Her Two Daughters'', printed by 'G. Eld for John Barnes' appeared.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt;

The Earl and Countess remained so convinced that their son had been killed by the effects of witchcraft that they had it inscribed on their monument at [[Bottesford, Leicestershire|Bottesford]] church. It reads, in part:

{{quote|In 1608 he married ye lady Cecila Hungerford, daughter to ye Honorable Knight Sir John Tufton, by whom he had two sons, both of which died in their infancy by wicked practises and sorcerye&lt;ref name="bottshist"/&gt;}}

In 1953, Hilda Lewis published a historical romance, ''The Witch and the Priest'', which consists of a series of conversations between Samuel Fleming, the clergyman who oversaw the Flowers' examinations, and the ghost of Joan Flower.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt;

In 2013, historian Tracey Borman suggested that the Flowers women may have been framed by a favourite of [[James VI and I|King James I]], the [[Lincolnshire]] born George Villiers, who was created [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] in 1623.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; Watson's theory is that Villiers had plans to marry the [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland|Rutland's]] daughter [[Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Katherine]] and, with her two brothers dead, inherit the title.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; Watson argues 'he had them poisoned – then framed Joan Flower and her two daughters as witches to create a smokescreen to cover up his own guilt'.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; After the execution of the Flowers sisters, [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Villiers]] went on to marry the [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland|Rutland's]] sole heir [[Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Katherine]] on 16 May 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Manners, Francis|volume=36|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13788">The '''Witches of Warboys''' were Alice Samuel and her family, who were accused of, and executed for [[witchcraft]] between 1589 and 1593 in the village of [[Warboys]], in the [[fens]] of England.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..."&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Strange and Admirable Discouerie of the Three Witches of Warboys Arraigned, Conuicted, and Executed at the Last Assises at Huntington, for the Bewitching of the Fiue Daughters of Robert Throckmorton Esquire, and Other Persons (1593), Reprint|year=2010|publisher=BiblioBazaar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of many [[witch trials in the early modern period]], but scholar Barbara Rosen claims it "attracted probably more notice than any other in the sixteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen |first=Barbara |title=Witchcraft in England 1558–1618 |location=Amherst |publisher=University  of Massachusetts |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The trials of the witches occurred during the sixteenth century at [[Warboys]] in Huntingdonshire. The first allegations were made in November 1589 by Jane Throckmorton, the 10-year-old daughter of Robert Throckmorton the [[Squire]] of Warboys when she started suffering from fits (see Initial Allegations below). She accused the 76-year-old Alice Samuel of being the cause; this was echoed by Jane’s four sisters and some household servants who began exhibiting similar symptoms. When Alice Samuel was brought forward to the children, they became more ill and had the urge to scratch her.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

Robert Throckmorton was a close friend of [[Henry Williams (alias Cromwell)|Sir Henry Cromwell]], one of the wealthiest commoners in England and the grandfather of [[Oliver Cromwell]].  In March 1590, Lady Cromwell came to Warboys to visit. At the Throckmorton house, she interviewed Alice Samuel and what came after the interview served to confirm the suspicions the Throckmortons had. Lady Cromwell was tormented by Alice Samuel in her dreams, and after some time she became ill and died (buried 1592). This was enough proof to put Alice Samuel through a trial that would find her and the rest of her family guilty.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

==Initial allegations==

===Throckmorton family===
The first allegations declaring Alice as a practitioner of witchcraft were made in November 1589.  Following this, there were a total of twelve maid-servants of the Throckmorton household (in addition to the five daughters) who experienced fits and the torment of Alice Samuell’s witchcraft. Jane’s fits were described as such: "Sometimes she would neese [sneeze] very loud and thick for the space of half an hour together; and evidently as one in a great trance and sound lay quietly as long, soon after would begin to swell and heave up her belly so as none was able to bend her or keep her down, sometime thee would shake one leg and no other part of her, as if the palsie had been in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of her arms and then the other, and soon after her head, as if she had been infected with the running palsie".&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discouerie of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane's mother and grandmother were by the child’s side while other neighbors came to see her. When Alice Samuel came in, the child proclaimed: "Grandmother look where the old witch sitteth (pointing to Samuell) did you ever see one more like a witch than she is: Take off her black thrumbed [shaggy or fringed] cap, for I cannot abide to look on her". Jane's mother  thought nothing of this at first, thinking her child was sleep deprived and sick.  However, because Jane continued to get worse, her parents sent her urine to Doctor Barrow of Cambridge, who sent medicine to Jane three separate times thinking it would heal her.  It did not.  After the third time, the Doctor inquired whether there were any signs of sorcery or witchcraft involved that the parents could see. Jane’s urine was then sent to a family acquaintance, Master Butler, for examination and he sent back the same remedies that Doctor Barrow had sent. Exactly a month later, on the same day almost to the hour, two more of Master Throckmorton’s daughters fell sick to the same illness  that was afflicting Jane.&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"/&gt;

These daughters, two to three years older than Jane, cried out: "Take her away, look where she standeth here before us in a black thrumbed cap it is she that hath bewitched us and she will kill us if you do not take her away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discovery of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents were then worried, but could not understand why any such harm would come to them, for they had only moved into the town the "Michaelmas before" (September 29, 1588).{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}} Their youngest daughter, nine years old, fell sick less than a month later. Soon after this, the oldest daughter, fifteen years old, fell sick. She was sickest out of the five. Both cried out against Alice Samuell. Their eldest sister, having been the strongest, strived with the spirit, and was grievously tortured not being able to overcome it. This caused her to "(neefe), screech and groan very fearfully, sometimes it would heave up her belly and bounce up her body with such violence that she was not kept upon her bed".{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}}   When sitting in a chair, her fits often caused her to break that chair.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The daughters could not see, hear or feel while in these fits. They accused Mother Samuell, asking for her to be taken away. These fits would sometimes last for half a day and happened up to six or seven times a day.  They believed that God freed them of this [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and afterwards, the sisters remembered nothing of what they had been saying.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

===Lady Cromwell===
In March 1590, Lady Cromwell and Alice had a discussion regarding the accusations made against Alice.  During this conversation, Lady Cromwell reportedly grabbed a pair of [[scissors]] and cut a lock of hair off Alice, and gave it to Mrs. Throckmorton to burn (a [[folk tradition|folk]] remedy believed to weaken a witch's power). That night, Lady Cromwell had nightmares, became ill and later died in 1592.&lt;ref name="Luke Matin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matin |first1=Luke |title=The Witch Trials – Witches of Warboys Witch Trials |url=http://www.witchcraftandwitches.com/trials_warboys.html|publisher=Luke Matin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Following the death of Lady Cromwell, a local parson convinced Alice to admit to witchcraft, which she retracted the very next day.  However, she confessed again when she was brought before the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], and taken to [[Huntingdon]] where she was imprisoned with her daughter and husband.  The family was tried in April 1593 for the murder by witchcraft of Lady Cromwell. Alice’s words to Lady Cromwell ("Madam, why do you use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet") were used against her at the trial, and all three were found guilty and eventually hanged.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luke Matin" /&gt;

==Posthumous proof==
The jailer and his wife examined the corpses.
{{quote|[H]e found upon the body of the old woman Alice Samuel a little lump of flesh, in manner sticking out as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an inch; which both he and his wife perceiving, at the first sight thereof meant not to disclose because it was adjoining so secret a place which was not decent to be seen. Yet in the end, not willing to conceal so strange a matter, and decently covering that privy place a little above which it grew, they made open show thereof unto diverse that stood by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations |first=Diane |last=Purkiss |publisher=Routledge |year=2013|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Jim Kermode argues that the discovery of a [[witches' mark]] (also known as a "devil's mark") was important legal proof at this period in England. "[I]t gradually became accepted that the mark, with women, most commonly took the form of a teat-like growth in the pudenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kermode |first=J.I. |last2=Walker |first2=Garthine |title=Women, crime and the courts in early modern England |date=1994 |publisher=UCL Press |location=London |isbn=1857281403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tale of the jailer's postmortem examination has been widely quoted in modern scholarship, for example with reference to the animal/human divide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Creager |editor-first=Angela N.H. |last=Jordan|first=William Chester |title=The animal-human boundary: historical perspectives |date=2002 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location=Rochester, N.Y |isbn=9781580461207 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "sado-erotic fascination of the witches' teat",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Words like daggers: violent female speech in early modern England |date=2015 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=[S.l.] |isbn=978-0-8032-5488-6 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly in [[feminist interpretations of the Early Modern witch trials]]. It is also cited by writers such as [[Lynn Picknett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Picknett |first1=Lynn |title=The secret history of Lucifer: the ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci code |date=2005 |publisher=Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1845292638 |edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The scholar [[George Lyman Kittredge|George Kittredge]] (1860–1941) called the Warboys trial "the most momentous witch-trial that had ever occurred in England", partially because it had "demonstrably produced a deep and lasting impression on the class that made laws". He makes a case that the Warboys trial influenced the passage of the [[Witchcraft Acts#Witchcraft Act 1604|Witchcraft Act of 1604]].

Following the hangings, Robert Throckmorton left Warboys hastily, his wife allegedly dying shortly before his departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeWindt |first=Anne |title=Witchcraft and Conflicting Visions of the Ideal Village Community |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=34 |year=1995 |pages=427–463}} JSTOR.

'''Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker''' (abbreviated to '''ZAZ''') were an American comedy filmmaking trio consisting of [[Jim Abrahams]] and brothers [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] who specialized in writing [[slapstick comedy]] films during the 1980s. The trio knew each other during their childhood years, growing up in [[Shorewood, Wisconsin]] and attending [[Shorewood High School (Wisconsin)|Shorewood High School]] which is sometimes referenced in their work. While attending the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the trio founded a small theater known as The Kentucky Fried Theater in 1971 which led to their [[sketch comedy]] film ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]''.

This was followed in 1980 by the trio's breakout hit ''[[Airplane!]]'', which remains a revered comedic milestone. Subsequent collaborations include the TV series ''[[Police Squad!]]'', its subsequent ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' trilogy and the films ''[[Top Secret!]]'' and ''[[Ruthless People]]''. All of their projects relied heavily on [[Parody|parodies]], [[visual gag]]s and [[Fourth wall|breaking of the fourth wall]], and established a strong cult following. The notable stylistic exception is ''Ruthless People'', a more traditional farce that was directed by the trio but unlike their other productions, not written by them.

Prominent ZAZ actors and actresses include [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Lloyd Bridges]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Charlie Sheen]]. The trio's status as a three-person team of co-directors is highly unusual, although some of their later projects were directed by David Zucker working solo and with Jerry Zucker and Abrahams credited only as producers and/or writers. Each member of the group also had individual solo careers:

* David Zucker directed ''[[BASEketball]]'', ''[[My Boss's Daughter]]'', ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie 4|4]]''.
* Abrahams directed ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' and ''[[Mafia!|Jane Austen's Mafia!]]''.
* Jerry Zucker directed ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[First Knight]]'' and ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]''. Of the three, Jerry Zucker has found the most mainstream non-comedic success including ''Ghost'' and ''First Knight'', which grossed $505 million and $127 million worldwide respectively.

==Filmography==
&lt;!--Do NOT add Police Squad! It's a TV show, not an actual film. Also do NOT add the Naked Gun movies. They were not directed by ZAZ, only written. Thank you.!--&gt;
Below is a filmography chart on which films the trio have directed together and solo:
