'''''A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction''''' is a 1977 book on [[architecture]], [[urban design]], and community [[livability]].  It was authored by [[Christopher Alexander]], [[Sara Ishikawa]] and [[Murray Silverstein]] of the [[Center for Environmental Structure]] of [[Berkeley, California]], with writing credits also to Max Jacobson, Ingrid Fiksdahl-King and Shlomo Angel. Decades after its publication, it is still one of the best-selling books on architecture.&lt;ref&gt;review: [http://www.katarxis3.com/Review_Nature_Order.htm Towards a New Science of Architecture, and a New Architecture of Science, KATARXIS No 3, London UK, September 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book creates a new language, what the authors call a [[pattern language]] derived from timeless entities called patterns. As they write on page xxxv of the introduction, "All 253 patterns together form a language." Patterns describe a problem and then offer a solution. In doing so the authors intend to give ordinary people, not only professionals, a way to work with their neighbors to improve a town or neighborhood, design a house for themselves or work with colleagues to design an office, workshop or public building such as a school.

== Structure ==
Written in the 1970s at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], ''A Pattern Language'' was influenced by the then-emerging language to describe computer programming and design. "A pattern language has the structure of a network," the authors write on page xviii. Thus, each pattern may have a statement that is referenced to another pattern by placing that pattern's number in brackets, for example: '''(12)''' means go to the ''Community of 7,000'' pattern. In this way, it is structured as a [[hypertext]].

It includes 253 patterns such as ''Community of 7000'' (Pattern 12) given a treatment over several pages; page 71 states: "Individuals have no effective voice in any community of more than 5,000–10,000 persons." It is written as a set of problems and documented solutions.

According to Alexander &amp; team, the work originated from an observation that {{quote|text=At the core […] is the idea that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets and communities. This idea […] comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=front bookflap}}

The book uses words to describe patterns, supported by drawings, photographs and charts. It describes exact methods for constructing practical, safe, and attractive designs at every scale, from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs. The patterns are regarded by the authors not as infallible, but as hypotheses: {{quote|text=[…] each pattern represents our current best guess as to what arrangement of the physical environment will work to solve the problem presented. The empirical questions center on the problem—does it occur and is it felt in the way we have described it?—and the solution—does the arrangement we propose in fact resolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our degree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no matter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still hypotheses, all 253 of them—and are therefore all tentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new experience and observation. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=p. xv}}

Some patterns focus on materials, noting that some ancient systems, such as concrete, when adapted by modern technology, may become one of the best future materials: {{quote|text=We believe that ultra-lightweight concrete is one of the most fundamental bulk materials of the future. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=p. 958}} Other patterns focus on life experiences such as the Street Cafe (Pattern 88):{{quote |text=The street cafe provides a unique setting, special to cities: a place where people can sit lazily, legitimately, be on view, and watch the world go by […]. Encourage local cafes to spring up in each neighborhood. Make them intimate places, with several rooms, open to a busy path, where people can sit with coffee or a drink and watch the world go by. Build the front of the cafe so that a set of tables stretch out of the cafe, right into the street. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=p. 437,439}}

When these patterns are taken together, the authors say, they begin to form a kind of language, each pattern forming a word or thought of a true language rather than being a prescriptive way to design or solve a problem. As the authors write on p xiii, "Each solution is stated in such a way that it gives the essential field of relationships needed to solve the problem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you can solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by adapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions at the place where you are making it."

A notable value is that the architectural system consists only of timeless patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality. The patterns include provision for future modification and repair, in keeping with the principle that the most satisfying living spaces are those which, like the lives of their occupants, tend to change and evolve over time.

The book values human rights such as freedom, and it shows how architecture can enhance or reduce an individual's sense of freedom {{quote|text=[…] we are saying that a centralized entrance, which funnels everyone in a building through it, has in its nature the trappings of control; while the pattern of many open stairs, leading off the public streets, direct to private doors, has in its nature the fact of independence, free comings and goings. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=p. 742}}

== Reception ==
This book's method was adopted by the [[University of Oregon]], as described in ''[[The Oregon Experiment]]'', and remains the official planning instrument.&lt;ref name="UOCampusPlan"&gt;University of Oregon Campus Plan -- Principle 11: Patterns. {{citation|title=UO Campus Plan|year=2018|location=Eugene, Oregon|url=https://cpfm.uoregon.edu/campus-plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been adopted in part by some cities{{which|date=April 2014}} as a building code.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Alexander's conception of [[pattern]]s, and [[pattern language]]s, were major factors in the creation of [[Ward Cunningham]]'s [[WikiWikiWeb]], the first [[wiki]], which was intended as an archive and discussion web application for the [[Portland Pattern Repository]].&lt;ref name="artima"&gt;{{cite web |title=Exploring with Wiki: A Conversation with Ward Cunningham, Part I |author=Bill Venners |date=October 20, 2003 |url=http://www.artima.com/intv/wiki.html |publisher=artima developer |accessdate=December 12, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205091836/http://www.artima.com/intv/wiki.html |archivedate=February 5, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a [[pattern language]] appears to apply to many complex engineering tasks, and has been applied to some of them. It has been especially influential in [[software engineering]] where [[Software design pattern|design patterns]] have been used to document collective knowledge in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Berna L. Massingill, Timothy G. Mattson, and Beverly A.

A '''Bachelor of Arts''' ('''BA''' or '''AB''', from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus artium}}'' or ''{{lang|la|artium baccalaureus}}'') is a [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] course or program in either the [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]], sciences, or both. Bachelor of Arts programs generally take three to four years depending on the country, institution, and specific specializations, majors, or minors. The word ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus}}'' (from the Latin ''{{lang|la|bacca}}'', a berry, and ''{{lang|la|laureus}}'', "of the [[bay laurel]]") should not be confused with ''{{lang|la|baccalaureatus}}'' (translatable as "gold-plated [[sceptre|scepter]]" by using the Latina ''{{lang|la|bacum}}'' and ''{{lang|la|aureatus}}''), which refers to the one- to two-year postgraduate ''Bachelor of Arts [[honors degree|with Honors]]'' degree (''{{lang|la|Baccalaureatus in Artibus Cum Honore}}'') in some countries.

[[Diploma]]s generally give the name of the institution, signatures of officials of the institution (generally the president or rector of the [[university]] as well as the secretary or dean of the component [[college]]), type of degree conferred, conferring authority, and location at which the degree is conferred. Diplomas generally are printed on high-quality [[paper]] or [[parchment]]; individual institutions set the preferred abbreviation for their degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvard.edu/degree-abbreviations An Explanation of Degree Abbreviations - Harvard University Commencement]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Bachelor of Arts is usually attained in four years in [[Afghanistan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Armenia]], [[Kenya]], [[Canada]], [[Greece]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Nigeria]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Russia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[South Korea]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Turkey]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[United States]], and most of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US5/REF/gpa.html FAST-US-5 United States Education Reference File&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Degree attainment generally takes three years in nearly all of the [[European Union]] and [[Albania]], [[Australia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Singapore]], [[the Caribbean]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]] and the Province of [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]]. In [[Pakistan]], the Bachelor of Arts can also be attained within two years as an ''[[external degree]].''

==Australia, Canada, India, Nepal, New Zealand, South Africa==
In colleges and universities in Australia, New Zealand, [[Nepal]] and South Africa, the BA degree can be taken over three years of full-time study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144 Bachelor of Arts degrees] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401072859/http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144 |date=2010-04-01 }}, [[Australian National University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Students must pursue at least one [[academic major|major]] area of study, and units from that subject are usually studied in each year, though sometimes students may choose to complete upper-level classes in the same year and as a result, can leave space for elective subjects from a different field. At some universities students may choose to pursue a second major; alternatively, the remainder of the degree is taken up with a minor area of study (in the first two years) and other individual or stream-based subjects make up the degree.

Unlike in other countries, students do not receive an overall grade for their Bachelor of Arts degree with varying levels of honours ("honours" is a distinction but not part of the degree itself). Qualified students may be admitted, after they have achieved their (general) Bachelor's program with a high overall grade point average, to a further one year Bachelor (with) Honours degree program (''(with) Honours'' is part of the degree itself). Thus, to achieve a Bachelor (with) Honours degree (abbr. e.g. BA (Hons.) or BA hons.), an extra "[[postgraduate]]" year and a high research honour's thesis must be completed; see [[Honours Degree]]s. A student who holds a (with) Honours degree is eligible for direct entry to either a Doctorate (Ph.D.) or a very high research master's degree program.

Education in [[Canada]] is controlled by the Provinces and can be very different depending on the province in Canada.  Canadian universities typically offer a 4-year Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees. In many universities and colleges, Bachelor of Arts degrees are differentiated either as Bachelors of Arts or as honours Bachelor of Arts degree. The term "Honours" is an academic distinction, which indicates that students must achieve their Bachelor of Arts degree with a sufficiently high overall grade point average; in addition, some programs may require more education than non-honours programs.

The honours degrees are sometimes designated with the abbreviation in brackets of '(Hon(s))'. It should not be confused with the consecutive [[honours degree|Bachelor of Arts degree "with Honours"]], Latin "Baccalaureatus in Artibus Cum Honore", abbr. 'BA hon.' ''de jure'' without brackets and with a dot. It is a "postgraduate" degree. Going back in history, a three-year Bachelor of Arts degree (also known e.g. in Québec as grade de bachelier ès arts) was also called a ''pass degree'' or ''general degree''.

A student who first achieves a general Bachelor of Arts degree with a sufficiently high overall average may be admitted to a "postgraduate" Baccalaureatus cum Honore degree in the same field; it requires a minimum of one year but may also take longer; it typically does not exceed two years. Students may be required to undertake a long high-quality research empirical thesis (Honours Seminar Thesis) combined with a selection of courses from the relevant field of studies. The consecutive B. cum Honore degree is essential if students ultimate goal is to study towards a two- or three-year very high research master's degree qualification. A student holding a Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree also may choose to complete a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program without the requirement to first complete a master's degree. Over the years, in some universities certain Baccalaureatus cum Honore programs have been changed to corresponding master's degrees.

In general, in all four countries, the B.A. degree is the standard required for entry into  a [[Master of Arts|master's]] programme. In science, a BA hons degree is generally a prerequisite for entrance to a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] program or a very-high-research-activity master's programme. As such, for example the UK awarded ''honours'' are designed and should not be confused with Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and South African awarded BA hons/BA (Hons) degree.

For further clarification, in other countries the so-called ''honours'' bachelor may not be an actual degree, but the name of a (vocational) programme which can be completed through specified course work, a high grade average, and the completion of possibly a short paper or project; students who completed such a ''honours'' BA programme sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' after the degree abbreviation without a space, in parentheses and after the 'Hon(s)' without a dot, for example 'B.A.(Hon)'. The 3 and 4 year B.A. degree is also accepted for entry into graduate professional programmes such as [[LLB#Structure of LL.B. programmes|law]] or a [[M.B.A.|Master of Business Administration]] program.

==Netherlands / Europe==
In the [[Netherlands]], the Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees were introduced in 2002. Until then there was a single program which led to the [[doctorandus]] degree. This comprised the same course load as the Bachelor and Master programs combined. The title ''doctorandus'' was used in almost all fields of study; other titles were used for legal studies (''meester'', Dutch for master, abbreviated ''Mr.'') and engineering (''[[ingenieur]]''). Those who had already started the doctorandus program could, on completing it, opt for the doctorandus degree (entitling them to use "Drs." in front of their name), or could use the master's degree (post-nominal letters) in accordance with the new standard.
A similar practice has been introduced in other EU countries, according to the [[Bologna Process]].

==Germany==
In Germany, university-level education usually happens in either a ''Universität'' (plural: ''Universitäten'') or a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' (plural: ''Fachhochschulen''); both can be referred to as a ''Hochschule'', which is the generic term in Germany for all institutions awarding academic degrees. Fachhochschule is often translated as "University of Applied Sciences". Universitäten place greater emphasis on fundamental science and theoretical background, while Fachhochschulen are generally designed with a focus on teaching professional skills. Degrees earned at Universitäten and Fachhochschulen are legally equivalent.

In Germany, the B.A. normally lasts between 3 and 3 ½ years – 6 or 7 semesters – and is awarded after the student earns between 180 and 210 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].

==United Kingdom and Ireland==
{{Main|British undergraduate degree classification}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] (excluding [[Scotland]]) and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the first degree course normally lasts three years, but nomenclature varies: 19th-century and later universities usually distinguish between arts and sciences subjects by awarding either a B.A. or B.Sc. degree. However, some older or [[ancient universities]], such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] traditionally award B.A.s to undergraduates having completed the final examinations, e.g. Part II [[Tripos]] (Cambridge), Final Honour Schools (Oxford), Moderatorship (Dublin), in most subjects including the sciences. Some new [[plate glass university|plate glass universities]] established in the 1960s, such as [[University of York|York]] and [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] originally followed the practice of Oxford and Cambridge by awarding B.A.s in all subjects, but have since changed to awarding B.Sc. degrees in science subjects. At Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] can be claimed, usually 21 terms after [[matriculation]]. For many centuries, the bachelor's degree was an intermediate step and was awarded for much of the work carried out in later times at secondary schools. The names of the final secondary school exams in France and Spain (and increasingly in the UK—the [[International Baccalaureate]]) come from this: le [[Baccalauréat]] and el ''Bachillerato'', respectively.

The [[Ancient Universities of Scotland]] award a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degree to humanities or arts graduates, but a B.Sc. to science graduates. This course takes four years for an honours degree and three for an ordinar.  In Scotland, it is possible to opt to take an ordinary degree rather than this simply ranking below a third class honours (for example, B.A. with distinction, merit or pass).

A Bachelor of Arts is entitled to the designation B.A. for an ordinary/pass degree and B.A. (Hons) for an honours degree. Students who completed an honours B.A. sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' or '(Hons)' after the degree abbreviation in parentheses. An honours degree is always awarded in one of four classes depending upon the marks gained in the final assessments and examinations. The top students are awarded a first-class degree, followed by an upper second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:1), a lower second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:2), and those with the lowest marks gain a third-class degree. An ordinary or unclassified degree (which does not give the graduate the right to add '(Hons)') may be awarded if a student has completed the full honours degree course but has not obtained the total required passes sufficient to merit a third-class honours degree. Typically these degrees lack the last year requirement of a dissertation.

'''Biblical languages''' are any of the [[language]]s employed in the original writings of the [[Bible]]. Partially owing to the significance of the Bible in society, Biblical languages are studied more widely than many other [[dead language]]s. Furthermore, some debates exist as to which language is the original language of a particular passage, and about whether a term has been properly translated from an ancient language into modern editions of the Bible. Scholars generally recognize three languages as original biblical languages: [[Hebrew]], [[Aramaic]], and [[Koine Greek]].

==Language of the Hebrew Bible==
The [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{hebrew|תנ"ך}}), also known as the [[Tanakh]], consists of 39 books. "Hebrew" in "[[Hebrew Bible]]" may refer to either the [[Hebrew language]] or to the [[Hebrew people]] who historically used Hebrew as a spoken language, and have continuously used the language in prayer and study, or both. The texts were mainly written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with some portions (notably in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]]) in [[Biblical Aramaic]]. Biblical Hebrew, sometimes called ''Classical Hebrew'', is an archaic form of the Hebrew language.

The very first translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] was into [[Greek language|Greek]]. This is known as the [[Septuagint]] (LXX), which later became the received text of the [[Old Testament]] in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]] and the basis of its [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon|canon]]. This began sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century BC, with the first portion of the Hebrew Bible, the [[Torah]], being translated into [[Koine Greek]]. Over the next century, other books were translated (or composed) as well. This translation became known as the [[Septuagint]] and was widely used by [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek-speaking Jews]], and later by Christians. It differs somewhat from the later standardized Hebrew ([[Masoretic Text]]). This translation was promoted by way of a [[Letter of Aristeas|legend]] that seventy separate translators all produced identical texts.

The Latin [[Vulgate]] by [[Jerome]] was based upon the Hebrew for those books of the Bible preserved in the Jewish canon (as reflected in the [[Masoretic Text]]), and on the Greek text for the rest. Other ancient Jewish translations, such as the Aramaic [[Targum]]s, conform closely to the [[Masoretic Text]], and all medieval and modern Jewish translations are based upon the same. Christian translations also tend to be based upon the Hebrew, though some denominations prefer the Septuagint (or may cite variant readings from both). Bible translations incorporating modern textual criticism usually begin with the Masoretic Text, but also take into account possible variants from all available ancient versions.

==Languages of the New Testament==
{{main|Language of the New Testament}}
The books of the [[Christian]] [[New Testament]] are widely agreed to have originally been written in Greek, specifically [[Koine Greek]], even though some authors often included translations from Hebrew and Aramaic texts. Certainly the Pauline Epistles were written in Greek for Greek-speaking audiences. See [[Greek primacy]] for further details. Koine Greek was the popular form of Greek which emerged in post-classical antiquity (c.300 [[Before Christ|BC]] – [[Anno Domini|AD]] 300), and marks the third period in the history of the [[Greek language]].&lt;ref name=andriotes&gt;Andriotis, Nikolaos P. History of the Greek language&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called ''Alexandrian'', ''Hellenistic'', ''Common'', or ''New Testament'' Greek. 

Some scholars believe that some books of the Greek New Testament (in particular, the [[Gospel of Matthew]]) are actually translations of a Hebrew or Aramaic original. A famous example of this is [[Logos|the opening]] to the [[Gospel of John]], which some scholars argue to be a Greek translation of an Aramaic hymn. Of these, a small number accept the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Peshitta]] as representative of the original. See [[Aramaic primacy]].

Likewise, some traditional Roman Catholic scholars believed the [[Gospel of Mark]] was originally written in Latin.

However, the received text of the New Testament is Greek and nearly all translations are based upon the Greek text.

In the music context, the term '''chroma feature''' or '''chromagram''' closely relates to the twelve different [[pitch classes]]. Chroma-based features, which are also referred to [[Harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]], are a powerful tool for analyzing music whose pitches can be meaningfully categorized (often into twelve categories) and whose tuning approximates to the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered scale]]. One main property of chroma features is that they capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation.

==Definition==

The underyling observation is that humans perceive two musical pitches as similar in color if they differ by an octave. Based on this observation, a pitch can be separated into two components, which are referred to as ''tone height'' and ''chroma''.&lt;ref name=Shepard64_pitch_ASA&gt;

|title=Circularity in judgments of relative pitch
|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America
|volume=36
|issue=212
|date=1964
|pages=2346–2353}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered scale]], one considers twelve chroma values represented by the set

:{C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}, E ,F, F{{music|#}}, G, G{{music|#}}, A, A{{music|#}}, B}

that consists of the twelve pitch spelling attributes as used in Western music notation. Note that in the equal-tempered scale different pitch spellings such
C{{music|#}} and D{{music|b}} refer to the same chroma. Enumerating the chroma values, one can identify the set of chroma values with the set of integers {1,2,...,12}, where 1 refers to chroma C, 2 to C{{music|#}}, and so on. A [[pitch class]] is defined as the set of all pitches that share the same chroma. For example, using the [[scientific pitch notation]], the pitch class corresponding to the chroma C is the set

:{..., C&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ...}

consisting of all pitches separated by an integer number of octaves. Given a music representation (e.g. a musical score or an audio recording), the  main idea of chroma features is to aggregate for a given local time window (e.g. specified in beats or in seconds) all information that relates to a given chroma into a single coefficient. Shifting the time window across the music representation results in a sequence of chroma features each expressing how the representation's pitch content within the time window is spread over the twelve chroma bands. The resulting time-chroma representation is also referred to as [[chromagram]]. The figure above shows chromagrams for a C-major scale, once obtained from a musical score and once from an audio recording. Because of the close relation between the terms chroma and pitch class, chroma features are also referred to as [[Harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]].

==Applications==
Identifying pitches that differ by an octave, chroma features show a high degree of robustness to variations in timbre and closely correlate to the musical aspect of harmony. This is the reason why chroma features are a well-established tool for processing and analyzing music data.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_FundamentalsMusicProcessig_SPRINGER&gt;

==Computation of audio chromagrams==
There are many ways for converting an audio recording into a chromagram. For example, the conversion of an audio recording into a chroma representation (or chromagram) may be performed either by using short-time Fourier transforms in combination with binning strategies&lt;ref name=BartschW05_chroma_IEEEMULTIMEDIA&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; or by employing suitable multirate filter banks.&lt;ref name=MuellerKC05_ChromaFeatures_ISMIR/&gt;
Furthermore, the properties of chroma features can be significantly changed by
introducing suitable pre- and post-processing steps modifying spectral, temporal,
and dynamical aspects. This leads to a large number of chroma variants, which
may show a quite different behavior in the context of a specific music analysis scenario.&lt;ref name=MuellerE11_ChromaToolbox_ISMIR&gt;

[[File:Homeros Caetani Louvre Ma440 n2.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of [[Homer]], the ancient Greek epic poet]]
'''Classics''' or '''classical studies''' is the study of [[classical antiquity]]. It encompasses the study of the [[Greco-Roman world]], particularly of its languages and literature (Ancient Greek and Classical Latin) but also of Greco-Roman philosophy, history, and archaeology. Traditionally in the [[Western world|West]], the study of the [[Greek classics|Greek]] and [[Latin Classics|Roman classics]] was considered one of the cornerstones of the [[humanities]] and a fundamental element of a rounded education. The study of Classics has therefore traditionally been a cornerstone of a typical elite education.

Study encompasses specifically a time-period of history from the mid-2nd millennium BC to the 6th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[The British Library]] - [https://www.bl.uk/subjects/classics# Classics] Accessed December 13th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''Classics'' is derived from the [[Latin]] [[adjective]] ''[[wikt:classicus|classicus]]'', meaning "belonging to the highest class of citizens". The word was originally used to describe the members of the highest class in ancient Rome. By the 2nd century AD the word was used in literary criticism to describe writers of the highest quality.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-17"&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Aulus Gellius]], in his ''Attic Nights'', contrasts "classicus" and "[[wikt:proletarius|proletarius]]" writers.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', 19.8.15.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century AD, the word had acquired a second meaning, referring to pupils at a school.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-17"/&gt; Thus the two modern meanings of the word, referring both to literature considered to be of the highest quality, and to the standard texts used as part of a curriculum, both derive from Roman use.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-17"/&gt;

==History==

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Catullus, Itally.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of a bronze bust of a man. It rests on a stone plinth, on which the words "Gaius Valerius Catullus 87 AC–54 AC" are written.|The Roman poet Catullus was virtually unknown during the medieval period, in contrast to his modern popularity.]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], classics and education were tightly intertwined; according to Jan Ziolkowski, there is no era in history in which the link was tighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval education taught students to imitate earlier classical models,&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-21"&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin continued to be the language of scholarship and culture, despite the increasing difference between literary Latin and the vernacular languages of Europe during the period.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-21"/&gt;

While Latin was hugely influential, however, Greek was barely studied, and Greek literature survived almost solely in Latin translation.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-22"&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of even major Greek authors such as [[Hesiod]], whose names continued to be known by educated Europeans, were unavailable in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-22"/&gt; In the thirteenth century, the English philosopher [[Roger Bacon]] wrote that "there are not four men in Latin Christendom who are acquainted with the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic grammars."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sandys|1921|p=591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the unavailability of Greek authors, there were other differences between the classical canon known today and the works valued in the Middle Ages. [[Catullus]], for instance, was almost entirely unknown in the medieval period.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-22"/&gt; The popularity of different authors also waxed and waned throughout the period: [[Lucretius]], popular during the [[Carolingian renaissance|Carolingian]] period, was barely read in the twelfth century, while for [[Quintilian]] the reverse is true.&lt;ref name="Ziolkowski07-22"/&gt;

===Renaissance===
The [[Renaissance]] led to the increasing study of both ancient literature and ancient history,&lt;ref name="Kristeller78-586"/&gt; as well as a revival of classical styles of Latin.&lt;ref name="Kristeller78-587"/&gt; From the [[14th century]], first in Italy and then increasingly across Europe, [[Renaissance Humanism]], an intellectual movement that "advocated the study and imitation of classical antiquity",&lt;ref name="Kristeller78-586"&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed. Humanism saw a reform in education in Europe, introducing a wider range of Latin authors as well as bringing back the study of Greek language and literature to Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Kristeller78-587"&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=587}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reintroduction was initiated by [[Petrarch]] (1304–1374) and [[Boccaccio]] (1313–1375) who commissioned a Calabrian scholar to translate the [[Homeric poems]].&lt;ref&gt;Pade, M. (2007). The Reception of Plutarch's Lives in Fifteenth-Century Italy. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum&lt;/ref&gt; This humanist educational reform spread from Italy, in Catholic countries as it was adopted by the Jesuits, and in countries that became Protestant such as England, Germany, and the Low Countries, in order to ensure that future clerics were able to study the New Testament in the original language.&lt;ref name="Kristeller 1978 590"&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassicism===
The late 17th and 18th centuries are the period in Western European literary history which is most associated with the classical tradition, as writers consciously adapted classical models.&lt;ref name="Kaminski 2007 57"&gt;{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical models were so highly prized that the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] were rewritten along neoclassical lines, and these "improved" versions were performed throughout the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 18th century, the study of Greek became increasingly important relative to that of Latin.&lt;ref name="Kristeller 1978 591"&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=591}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this period [[Johann Winckelmann]]'s claims for the superiority of the Greek visual arts influenced a shift in aesthetic judgements, while in the literary sphere, [[G.E. Lessing]] "returned Homer to the centre of artistic achievement".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United Kingdom, the study of Greek in schools began in the late 18th century. The poet [[Walter Savage Landor]] claimed to have been one of the first English schoolboys to write in Greek during his time at [[Rugby School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
The 19th century saw the influence of the classical world, and the value of a classical education, decline,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|2001|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the US, where the subject was often criticised for its elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|2001|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, little new literature was still being written in Latin – a practice which had continued as late as the 18th century – and a command of Latin declined in importance.&lt;ref name="Kristeller 1978 590"/&gt; Correspondingly, classical education from the 19th century onwards began to increasingly de-emphasise the importance of the ability to write and speak Latin.&lt;ref name="Kristeller 1978 591"/&gt; In the United Kingdom this process took longer than elsewhere. Composition continued to be the dominant classical skill in England until the 1870s, when new areas within the discipline began to increase in popularity.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 81"&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same decade came the first challenges to the requirement of Greek at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, though it would not be finally abolished for another 50 years.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 83"&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the influence of classics as the dominant mode of education in Europe and North America was in decline in the 19th century, the discipline was rapidly evolving in the same period.  Classical scholarship was becoming more systematic and scientific, especially with the "new philology" created at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Rommel 2001 169"&gt;{{harvnb|Rommel|2001|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its scope was also broadening: it was during the 19th century that ancient history and classical archaeology began to be seen as part of Classics, rather than separate disciplines.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 81"/&gt;

===20th century to present===
During the 20th century, the study of classics became less common. In England, for instance, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities stopped requiring students to have qualifications in Greek in 1920,&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 83"/&gt; and in Latin at the end of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 85"&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] was introduced in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland in 1988, it did not mention the classics.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 85"/&gt; By 2003, only about 10% of state schools in Britain offered any classical subjects to their students at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[AQA]], the largest exam board for [[A-Levels]] and [[GCSE]]'s in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, announced that it would be scrapping A-Level subjects in Classical Civilization, Archaeology, and Art History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/17/scrapping-archeology-classics-a-levels-barbaric-tony-robinson/| title=Scrapping of archaeology and classics A-levels criticized as 'barbaric act'| author=Sally Weale| publisher=The Guardian| date=2016-10-17| access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left just one out of five exam boards in England which still offered Classical Civilization as a subject. The decision was immediately denounced by archaeologists and historians, with Natalie Haynes of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stating that the loss of the A-Level would deprive state school students, 93% of all students, the opportunity to study Classics, while making it once again the exclusive purview of wealthy private-school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/aqa-classics-classical-civilisation-a-level-exam-archaeology| title=Ditching classics at A-level is little short of a tragedy| author=Natalie Haynes| publisher=The Guardian| date=2016-10-19| access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the study of classics has not declined as fast elsewhere in Europe. In 2009, a review of ''Meeting the Challenge'', a collection of conference papers about the teaching of Latin in Europe, noted that though there is opposition to the teaching of Latin in Italy, it is nonetheless still compulsory in most secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balbo|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same can be said in the case of France or Greece, too. Indeed, Ancient Greek is one of the compulsory subjects in Greek secondary education, whereas in France, Latin is one of the optional subjects that can be chosen in a majority of middle schools and high schools. Ancient Greek is also still being taught, but not as much as Latin.

==Sub-disciplines==
One of the most notable characteristics of the modern study of Classics is the diversity of the field. Although traditionally focused on ancient Greece and Rome, the study now encompasses the entire ancient Mediterranean world, thus expanding the studies to Northern [[Africa]] as well as parts of the [[Middle East]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Philology&lt;!--'Classical philology' redirects here--&gt;===
{{further|Philology}}
{{for|the journal|Classical Philology (journal)}}
[[File:Friedrich August Wolf - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white image of Friedrich August Wolf in profile|The eighteenth-century classicist [[Friedrich August Wolf]] was the author of ''Prolegomena to Homer'', one of the first great works of classical philology.]]
Philology is the study of language preserved in written sources; '''classical philology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is thus concerned with understanding any texts from the classical period written in the classical languages of Latin and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackay|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The roots of classical philology lie in [[the Renaissance]], as humanist intellectuals attempted to return to the Latin of the classical period, especially of [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shorey|1906|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as scholars attempted to produce more accurate editions of ancient texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the principles of philology still used today developed during this period. For instance, the observation that if a manuscript could be shown to be a copy of an earlier extant manuscript, then it provides no further evidence of the original text, was made as early as 1489 by [[Angelo Poliziano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|pp=173–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other philological tools took longer to be developed: the first statement, for instance, of the principle that a more difficult reading should be preferred over a simpler one, was in 1697 by [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean Le Clerc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern discipline of classical philology began in Germany at the turn of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Rommel 2001 169"/&gt; It was during this period that scientific principles of philology began to be put together into a coherent whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|pp=174–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to provide a set of rules by which scholars could determine which manuscripts were most accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "new philology", as it was known, centred around the construction of a genealogy of manuscripts, with which a hypothetical common ancestor, closer to the original text than any existing manuscript, could be reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
{{Main|Classical archaeology}}
[[File:Lion Gate Mykene with Wilhelm Dörpfeld and Heinrich Schliemann.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black and white photograph of the Lion Gate at Mycenae.|Schliemann and Dörpfeld's excavation at Mycenae was one of the earliest excavations in the field of classical archaeology.]]
Classical archaeology is the oldest branch of archaeology,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its roots going back to [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|J.J. Winckelmann's]] work on [[Herculaneum]] in the 1760s.&lt;ref name="Renfrew80-288"&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|1980|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the last decades of the 19th century, however, that classical archaeology became part of the tradition of Western classical scholarship.&lt;ref name="Renfrew80-288"/&gt; It was included as part of Cambridge University's [[Classical Tripos]] for the first time after the reforms of the 1880s, though it did not become part of Oxford's [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] until much later.&lt;ref name="Stray 1996 83"/&gt;

The second half of the 19th century saw [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann's]] excavations of [[Troy]] and [[Mycenae]]; the first excavations at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and [[Delos]]; and [[Arthur Evans]]' work in Crete, particularly on [[Knossos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|1980|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the foundation of important archaeological associations (e.g. the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] in 1879),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|2010|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; including many foreign archaeological institutes in Athens and Rome (the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]] in 1881, [[British School at Athens]] in 1886, [[American Academy in Rome]] in 1895, and [[British School at Rome]] in 1900).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|2010|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, classical archaeology has taken little part in the theoretical changes in the rest of the discipline,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely ignoring the popularity of "[[New Archaeology]]", which emphasised the development of general laws derived from studying material culture, in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Archaeology is still criticized by traditional minded scholars of classical archaeology despite a wide acceptance of its basic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darvil|first1=Timothy|title=New Archaeology|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/view/10.1093/acref/9780199534043.001.0001/acref-9780199534043-e-2752|website=Oxford Reference|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art history===
{{Main|Art history}}
Some art historians focus their study on the development of art in the classical world. Indeed, the art and architecture of Ancient Rome and Greece is very well regarded and remains at the heart of much of our art today. For example, Ancient Greek architecture gave us the Classical Orders: [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]. The [[Parthenon]] is still the architectural symbol of the classical world.

Greek sculpture is well known and we know the names of several Ancient Greek artists: for example, [[Phidias]].

===Ancient history===
With philology, archaeology, and art history, scholars seek understanding of the history and culture of a civilisation, through critical study of the extant literary and physical artefacts, in order to compose and establish a continual historic narrative of the Ancient World and its peoples. The task is difficult due to a dearth of physical evidence: for example, [[Sparta]] was a leading Greek [[city-state]], yet little evidence of it survives to study, and what is available comes from [[Athens]], Sparta's principal rival; likewise, the [[Roman Empire]] destroyed most evidence (cultural artefacts) of earlier, conquered civilizations, such as that of the [[Etruscans]].

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Ancient philosophy}}
The English word "philosophy" comes from the Greek word φιλοσοφία, meaning "love of wisdom", probably coined by Pythagoras. Along with the word itself, the discipline of philosophy as we know it today has its roots in ancient Greek thought, and according to Martin West "philosophy as we understand it is a Greek creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2001|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient philosophy was traditionally divided into three branches: logic, physics, and ethics.&lt;ref name="Mann 1996 178"&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all of the works of ancient philosophers fit neatly into one of these three branches. For instance, Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' and ''Poetics'' have been traditionally classified in the West as "ethics", but in the Arabic world were grouped with logic; in reality, they do not fit neatly into either category.&lt;ref name="Mann 1996 178"/&gt;

From the last decade of the eighteenth century, scholars of ancient philosophy began to study the discipline historically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, works on ancient philosophy had been unconcerned with chronological sequence and with reconstructing the reasoning of ancient thinkers; with what Wolfgang-Ranier Mann calls "New Philosophy", this changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|pp=180–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception studies===
{{main|Classical reception studies}}
A relatively recent new discipline within the classics is "reception studies",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bulwer|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which developed in the 1960s at the [[University of Konstanz]].&lt;ref name="Kallendorf07-02"&gt;{{harvnb|Kallendorf|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reception studies is concerned with how students of classical texts have understood and interpreted them.&lt;ref name="Kallendorf07-02"/&gt;
As such, reception studies is interested in a two-way interaction between reader and text,&lt;ref name="Martindale07-298"/&gt; taking place within a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|2007|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the idea of an "aesthetics of reception" was first put forward by [[Hans Robert Jauss]] in 1967, the principles of reception theory go back much earlier than this.&lt;ref name="Martindale07-298"&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|2007|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As early as 1920, [[T.S. Eliot]] wrote that "the past [is] altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|1920|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Martindale describes this as a "cardinal principle" for many versions of modern reception theory.&lt;ref name="Martindale07-298"/&gt;

==Classical Greece==
{{Main|Ancient Greece|Outline of ancient Greece|Timeline of ancient Greece}}

Ancient Greece was the civilization belonging to the period of Greek history lasting from the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]], beginning in the eighth century BC, to the [[Roman conquest of Greece]] after the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Battle of Corinth]] in 146 BC. The [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], during the fifth and fourth centuries BC, has traditionally been considered the height of Greek civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical period of Greek history is generally considered to have begun with the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first]] and [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second Persian invasions of Greece]] at the start of the Greco-Persian wars,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to have ended with the death of [[Alexander the Great]].

Classical Greek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe; thus Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of Western civilization.

===Language===
[[File:AncientGreekDialects (Woodard) en.svg|right|thumb|alt=|Map showing the regional dialects of Greek during the Classical period]]
{{Main|Ancient Greek|Mycenaean Greek language|Koine Greek}}

Ancient Greek is the historical stage in the development of the Greek language spanning the Archaic (c. 8th to 6th centuries BC), Classical (c. 5th to 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic (c. 3rd century BC to 6th century AD) periods of ancient Greece and the ancient world. It is predated in the 2nd millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. Its Hellenistic phase is known as Koine ("common") or Biblical Greek, and its late period mutates imperceptibly into Medieval Greek. Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own, although in its earlier form it closely resembles Classical Greek. Prior to the Koine period, Greek of the classical and earlier periods included several regional dialects.

Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of classical Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to the vocabulary of English and many other European languages, and has been a standard subject of study in Western educational institutions since the Renaissance. Latinized forms of Ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in other scientific terminology.

===Literature===
{{Main|Ancient Greek literature}}
The earliest surviving works of Greek literature are [[epic poetry]]. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' are the earliest to survive to us today, probably composed in the eighth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early epics were oral compositions, created without the use of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Around the same time that the Homeric epics were composed, the [[Greek alphabet]] was introduced; the earliest surviving inscriptions date from around 750 BC.&lt;ref name="Kirk-45"&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Need to put something about archaic poetry here...
Some of the earliest Greek poetry to be composed in written form was that of [[Archilochus]], around a century after the introduction of the Greek alphabet.&lt;ref name="Kirk-45"/&gt; --&gt;
European [[drama]] was invented in ancient Greece. Traditionally this was attributed to [[Thespis]], around the middle of the sixth century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winnington-Ingram|Gould|Easterling|Knox|1985|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the earliest surviving work of Greek drama is [[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'', which dates to 472 BC.&lt;ref name="WIGEK-258"&gt;{{harvnb|Winnington-Ingram|Gould|Easterling|Knox|1985|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Greek tragedy was performed by a chorus and two actors, but by the end of Aeschylus' life, a third actor had been introduced, either by him or by [[Sophocles]].&lt;ref name="WIGEK-258"/&gt; The last surviving Greek tragedies are the ''[[Bacchae]]'' of [[Euripides]] and Sophocles' [[Oedipus at Colonus]], both from the end of the fifth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winnington-Ingram|Gould|Easterling|Knox|1985|pp=339–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving Greek comedy begins later than tragedy; the earliest surviving work, [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Acharnians]]'', comes from 425 BC.&lt;ref name="Handley-355"&gt;{{harvnb|Handley|1985|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, comedy dates back as early as 486 BC, when the [[Dionysia]] added a competition for comedy to the much earlier competition for tragedy.&lt;ref name="Handley-355"/&gt; The comedy of the fifth century is known as [[Old Comedy]], and it comes down to us solely in the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes, along with a few fragments.&lt;ref name="Handley-355"/&gt; Sixty years after the end of Aristophanes' career, the next author of comedies to have any substantial body of work survive is [[Menander]], whose style is known as [[New Comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Handley|1985|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two historians flourished during Greece's classical age: Herodotus and Thucydides. Herodotus is commonly called the father of history, and his "History" contains the first truly literary use of prose in Western literature. Of the two, Thucydides was the more careful historian. His critical use of sources, inclusion of documents, and laborious research made his History of the Peloponnesian War a significant influence on later generations of historians.&lt;!-- Should talk about post-Thucydidean history: Xenophon, Polybius, Diodorus, Arrian, Plutarch etc. --&gt; The greatest achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy. There were many Greek philosophers, but three names tower above the rest: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. These have had a profound influence on Western society.&lt;!-- Socrates wrote nothing! What is he doing in this section?! --&gt;

===Mythology and religion===
{{Main|Greek mythology|Religion in Ancient Greece}}

Greek mythology is the body of myths and legends belonging to the ancient Greeks concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. They were a part of religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to the myths and study them in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.

Greek religion encompassed the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These different groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or "cults" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities. Also, the Greek religion extended out of Greece and out to neighbouring islands.

Many Greek people recognized the major gods and goddesses: Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Ares, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Athena, Hermes, Demeter, Hestia and Hera; though philosophies such as Stoicism and some forms of Platonism used language that seems to posit a transcendent single deity. Different cities often worshipped the same deities, sometimes with epithets that distinguished them and specified their local nature.

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A bust of Socrates|So influential was Socrates to classical philosophy that earlier philosophers are today known as [[pre-Socratics]].]]

The earliest surviving philosophy from ancient Greece dates back to the 6th century BC, when according to Aristotle [[Thales of Miletus]] was considered to have been the first Greek philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential pre-Socratic philosophers include [[Pythagoras]] and [[Heraclitus]]. The most famous and significant figures in classical Athenian philosophy, from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BC, are [[Socrates]], his student [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], who studied at [[Plato's Academy]] before founding his own school, known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Later Greek schools of philosophy, including the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], [[Stoics]], and [[Epicureans]], continued to be influential after the Roman annexation of Greece, and into the post-Classical world.

Greek philosophy dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including political philosophy, [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[logic]], as well as disciplines which are not today thought of as part of philosophy, such as biology and rhetoric.

==Classical Rome==
{{Main|Ancient Rome|Culture of Ancient Rome}}

===Language===
{{main|Latin}}
[[File:Praeneste fibula.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of a gold brooch|The [[Praeneste fibula]] is believed to bear the oldest known Latin inscription. The inscription means "Manius made me for Numerius".]]
The language of ancient Rome was Latin, a member of the [[Italic languages|Italic family of languages]]. The earliest surviving inscription in Latin comes from the 7th century BC, on a [[Praeneste fibula|brooch from Palestrina]]. Latin from between this point and the early 1st century BC is known as [[Old Latin]]. Most surviving Latin literature is [[Classical Latin]], from the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD. Latin then evolved into [[Late Latin]], in use during the [[Late antiquity|late antique period]]. Late Latin survived long after the end of classical antiquity, and was finally replaced by written Romance languages around the 9th century AD. Along with literary forms of Latin, there existed various vernacular dialects, generally known as [[Vulgar Latin]], in use throughout antiquity. These are mainly preserved in sources such as graffiti and the [[Vindolanda tablets]].

===Literature===
{{main|Latin literature}}
The earliest surviving Latin authors, writing in Old Latin, include the playwrights [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]]. Much of the best known and most highly thought of Latin literature comes from the classical period, with poets such as [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], and [[Ovid]]; historians such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Tacitus]]; orators such as [[Cicero]]; and philosophers such as [[Seneca the Younger]] and [[Lucretius]]. Late Latin authors include many Christian writers such as [[Lactantius]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Ambrose]]; non-Christian authors, such as the historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], are also preserved.

===History===
{{main|Timeline of ancient Rome}}
According to legend, the city of Rome was founded in 753 BC;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reality, there had been a settlement on the site since around 1000 BC, when the [[Palatine Hill]] was settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was originally ruled by kings, first Roman, and then Etruscan – according to Roman tradition, the first Etruscan king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus, ruled from 616 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the 6th century BC, the city expanded its influence over the entirety of [[Latium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the end of the 6th century – traditionally in 510 BC – the kings of Rome were driven out, and the city became a republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 387 BC, Rome was sacked by the Gauls following the [[Battle of the Allia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon recovered from this humiliating defeat, however, and in 381 the inhabitants of [[Tusculum]] in Latium were made Roman citizens. This was the first time Roman citizenship was extended in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome went on to expand its area of influence, until by 269 the entirety of the Italian peninsula was under Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, in 264, the [[First Punic War]] began; it lasted until 241.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Punic War]] began in 218, and by the end of that year, the Carthaginian general [[Hannibal]] had invaded Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war saw Rome's worst defeat to that point at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]; the largest army Rome had yet put into the field was wiped out, and one of the two consuls leading it was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rome continued to fight, annexing much of Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually defeating Carthage, ending her position as a major power and securing Roman preeminence in the Western Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Three more paragraphs probably needed: one on the late Republic and civil war, one on the early empire, and one on the later empire to the fall of the Western empire --&gt;

==Legacy of the classical world==
The classical languages of the Ancient Mediterranean world influenced every European language, imparting to each a learned vocabulary of international application. Thus, Latin grew from a highly developed cultural product of the Golden and Silver eras of Latin literature to become the ''international lingua franca'' in matters diplomatic, scientific, philosophic and religious, until the 17th century. Long before this, Latin had evolved into [[Romance languages|the Romance languages]] and Ancient Greek into [[Modern Greek]] and its [[Modern Greek dialects|dialects]]. In the specialised science and technology vocabularies, the influence of [[Latin influence in English|Latin]] and [[English words of Greek origin|Greek]] is notable. [[Ecclesiastical Latin]], the Roman Catholic Church's official language, remains a living legacy of the classical world in the contemporary world.

Latin had an impact far beyond the classical world. It continued to be the pre-eminent language for serious writings in Europe long after the fall of the Roman empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|pp=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Romance languages]] – such as French, Spanish, and Italian – all derive from Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin is still seen as a foundational aspect of European culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of the classical world is not confined to the influence of classical languages. The Roman empire was taken as a model by later European empires, such as the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[British Empire|British]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical art has been taken as a model in later periods – medieval Romanesque architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Enlightenment-era neoclassical literature&lt;ref name="Kaminski 2007 57"/&gt; were both influenced by classical models, to take but two examples, while [[James Joyce|Joyce's]] ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is one of the most influential works of twentieth century literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|2007|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative education''' Comparative education is a discipline in the social sciences which entails the scrutiny and evaluation of different educational systems, such as those in various countries. Professionals in this area of endeavor are absorbed in advancing evocative terminologies and guidelines for education worldwide, enhancing educational structures and producing a context to which the success and effectivity of education programs and initiatives can be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bray|first=M|date=1995|title=Levels of Comparison in Education Studies.|url=|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=65|pages=472-490|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives and Scope ==
According to [[Harold J. Noah|Harold Noah]] (1985),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} and Farooq Joubish (2009),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} comparative education has four purposes:
#To describe educational systems, processes, or outcomes.
#To assist in the development of educational institutions and practices.
#To highlight the relationships between education and society.
#To establish generalized statements about education that are valid in more than one country.
#To help the current generation, understand the nowardays education systems, with reference to the past.
Comparative education is often incorrectly assumed to exclusively encompass studies that compare two or more different countries. In fact, since its early days researchers in this field have often eschewed such approaches, preferring rather to focus on comparisons within a single country over time. Still, some large scale projects, such as the [[PISA]] and [[TIMSS]] studies, have made important findings through explicitly comparative macroanalysis of massive data sets. Recent examples in this regard include studies analyzing intra-European &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2018-03-29|title=Elementary Teacher Education in the Top Performing European TIMSS Countries: A Comparative Study|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ies/article/view/74480|journal=International Education Studies|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=152|doi=10.5539/ies.v11n4p152|issn=1913-9039}}&lt;/ref&gt; and intra-American&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2018-04-09|title=Comparing the Costs and Benefits of Attending the Top Three U.S. Elementary Teacher Education Programs|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/hes/article/view/74711|journal=Higher Education Studies|language=en-US|volume=8|issue=2|pages=70|doi=10.5539/hes.v8n2p70|issn=1925-475X}}&lt;/ref&gt; teacher education.

== Rationale for the Field ==
Many important educational questions can best be examined from an international and comparative perspective. For example, in the [[United States]] there is no nationwide certificate of completion of [[secondary education]]. This raises the question of what the advantages and disadvantages are of leaving such certification to each of the 50 states.{{By whom|date=June 2018}} Comparative education draws on the experience of countries such as [[Japan]] and [[France]] to show how a centralized system works, and what the advantages and disadvantages of a centralized certification are.

Critics of comparative education refer to it as Policy Borrowing.{{Definition needed|date=June 2018}}

== Disciplinary Identity ==
Comparative education is closely allied to, and may overlap with, [[international education]], [[international development education]], and [[comparative sociology]].

== Comparative and International Education Society ==
The [[Comparative and International Education Society]] (CIES) was founded in 1956 to foster "cross-cultural understanding, scholarship, academic achievement, and societal development through the international study of educational ideas, systems, and practices."

The intention is that this understanding will prevent students from contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] in the future, including [[HIV]] and [[HPV]]. CSE is also designed with the intention of reducing teenage and unwanted pregnancies, as well as lowering rates of domestic and [[sexual violence]], thus contributing to a healthier society, both physically and mentally.&lt;ref name="Loeber 2010 169–176"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeber|first=O.|author2=Reuter, S. |author3=Apter, van der Doef |author4=Lazdane, Pinter |title=Aspects of sexuality education in Europe – definitions, differences and developments|journal=European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care|date=June 2010|volume=15|issue=3|pages=169–176|pmid=20465399|doi=10.3109/13625181003797280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive sex education ultimately promotes [[sexual abstinence]] as the safest sexual choice for young people. However, CSE curriculums and teachers are still committed to teaching students about topics connected to future sexual activity, such as [[age of consent]], [[safe sex]], [[Birth control|contraception]] such as: [[birth control]], [[abortion]], and use of [[condoms]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubenstein|first=Rachel|date=January 1, 2017|title=Sex Education: Funding Facts, Not Fear|url=http://p8888-ucelinks.cdlib.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/sfx_local?genre=article&amp;atitle=Sex%20Education%3A%20Funding%20Facts%2C%20Not%20Fear%20%5Bnotes%5D&amp;title=Health%20Matrix:%20Journal%20of%20Law-Medicine&amp;issn=0748383X&amp;isbn=&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=&amp;date=20170101&amp;aulast=Rubenstein,%20Rachel&amp;spage=525&amp;pages=&amp;sid=EBSCO:HeinOnline:hein.journals.hmax27.19#|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine.|volume=27|pages=525–553|via=MasterFILE Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This also includes discussions which promote safe behaviors, such as communicating with partners and seeking testing for sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, comprehensive sex education curricula may include discussions surrounding pregnancy outcomes such as parenting, adoption, and abortion.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; The most widely agreed benefit of using comprehensive sex education over [[abstinence-only sex education]] is that CSE acknowledges the student population will be sexually active in their future. By acknowledging this, CSE can encourage students to plan ahead to make the healthiest possible sexual decisions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|title=Comprehensive sexuality education|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unfpa.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology of arming students to most successfully survive their future sexual experiences underlies the majority of topics within CSE, including condoms, contraception, and refusal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclunc.org/docs/executive_summary_-_2003_statewide_school_district_survey.pdf|title=Sex Education in California Public Schools: Are Students Learning What They Need to Know?|last=Burlingame|first=Julianne|date=August 2003|website=www.aclu.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of CSE ==
Studies have found that comprehensive sex education is more effective than receiving no instruction and/or those who receive abstinence-only instruction.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Acknowledging that people may engage in premarital sex rather than ignoring it (which abstinence-only is often criticized for) allows educators to give the students the necessary information to safely navigate their future sexual lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|title=Comprehensive Sex Education: Research and Results|date=2010-12-08|website=advocatesforyouth.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208154235/http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|archive-date=December 8, 2010|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CSE advocates argue that promoting abstinence without accompanied information regarding safe sex practices is a disregard of reality, and is ultimately putting the student at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|title=Comprehensive Sex Education and Academic Success|date=2015-02-26|website=www.futureofsexed.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226100613/http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|archive-date=February 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|access-date=2016-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, programs funded under AEGP are reviewed for compliance with the 8 standards (listed below in "Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements), but are not screened for medical accuracy. Therefore, critics believe that students under these educational programs are put at a disadvantage because it prevents them from making informed choices about their sexual health. Additionally, under these AEGP programs, health educators have referred to those that engage in sex, especially females, as "dirty" and "used." They have also used phrases such as "stay like a new toothbrush, wrapped up and unused"  and "chewed-up gum" to teach abstinence. Under a CSE model, language would be more sensitive.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

There is clear evidence that CSE has a positive impact on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), notably in contributing to reducing [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]], HIV and [[unintended pregnancy]]. Sexuality education does not hasten sexual activity but has a positive impact on safer sexual behaviours and can delay sexual debut.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2009. ''International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education: An Evidence-informed approach for schools, teachers and health educators''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001832/183281e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review of school-based sexuality education programmes has demonstrated increased HIV knowledge, increased self-efficacy related to condom use and refusing sex, increased contraception and condom use, a reduced number of sexual partners and later initiation of first sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Fonner et al. 2014. ''School based sex education and HIV prevention in low and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis''. PLoS ONE 9(3): e89692. Doi: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal&lt;/nowiki&gt;. pone.0089692&lt;/ref&gt; A Cochrane review of 41 randomized controlled trials in Europe, the United States, Nigeria and Mexico also confirmed that CSE prevents unintended adolescent pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Oringanje, C. et al. 2009. ''Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents''. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt; CSE is very beneficial in regards to teen pregnancy because studies show that, teen pregnancy and childbearing have a significant negative impact on high school success and completion, as well as future job prospects.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; A study in Kenya, involving more than 6,000 students who had received sexuality education led to delayed sexual initiation, and increased condom use among those who were sexually active once these students reached secondary school compared to more than 6,000 students who did not receive sexuality education.&lt;ref&gt;Maticka-Tyndale, E. 2010. A multi-level model of condom use among male and female upper primary school students in Nyanza, Kenya. Soc Sci Med, Aug 5, Vol. 71, No. 3, pp. 616–25. Epub 2010, May 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; CSE also reduces the frequency of sex and the number of partners which in turn also reduces the rates of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

[[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]] and the [[African Union]] have recognized CSE’s impact on increasing condom use, voluntary HIV testing and reducing pregnancy among adolescent girls and have included comprehensive, age-appropriate sexuality education as one of the key recommendations to fast track the HIV response and end the AIDS epidemic among young women and girls in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;UNAIDS and the African Union. 2015. ''Empower Young Women and Adolescent Girls: Fast tracking the end of the AIDS epidemic in Africa''. Geneva, UNAIDS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As the field of sexuality education develops, there is increasing focus on addressing gender, power relations and human rights in order to improve the impact on SRH outcomes. Integrating content on gender and rights makes sexuality education even more effective.&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA. 2014a. ''Operational Guidance for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: A focus on human rights and gender''.

These programmes were five times as effective as those programmes that did not address gender or power.&lt;ref&gt;Haberland, N.A. 2015.

''International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health'', Vol. 41, No. 1, pp. 31–42. https:// www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4103115.html&lt;/ref&gt; CSE empowers young people to reflect critically on their environment and behaviours, and promotes gender equality and equitable social norms, which are important contributing factors for improving health outcomes, including HIV infection rates. The impact of CSE also increases when delivered together with efforts to expand access to a full range of high- quality, youth-friendly services and commodities, particularly in relation to contraceptive choice.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2011a.

A global review of evidence in the education sector also found that teaching sexuality education builds confidence,&lt;ref&gt;Unterhalter, E., North, A., Arnot, M., Lloyd, C., Moletsane, L., Murphy-Graham, E., Parkes, J. and Saito, M. 2014.

CSE has a demonstrated impact on improving knowledge, self-esteem, changing attitudes, gender and social norms, and building self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Criticism of CSE ==

=== How comprehensive is CSE ===
While CSE implementation is on the rise in the United States, it remains difficult for state officials to regulate what is and is not taught in the classroom. This is due in large part to the undefinability of CSE; CSE has the potential to comprise such a wide range of sexual information, and over-all focus varies widely between curriculums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators have also accused CSE as fundamentally operating as a form of "abstinence-plus," due to the reality that CSE often involves minimal body related information and excessive promotions of abstinence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Ed for Caring Schools Creating an Ethics-Based Curriculum|last=Lamb|first=Sharon|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So-called Comprehensive Sex Ed" says Sharon Lamb, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, "has been made less comprehensive as curricula are revised to meet current federal, state, and local requirements."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== LGBTQIA+ community not included CSE ====
The term "comprehensive" is also often misleading because some comprehensive programs do not show the holistic picture of human sexuality.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curvino|first=Melissa and Meghan Grizzle Fischer|date=April 21, 2015|title=Claiming Comprehensive Sex Education is a Right Does Not Make it So|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=16&amp;sid=e0097ff0-d647-4666-83a3-1229b73b3d13%40sessionmgr120|journal=The New Bioethics|volume=20|issue=1|pages=72–98|via=Taylor and Francis Online|pmid=24979877}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT|LGBTQIA+]] advocates have long been critical of the ways in which comprehensive sex education generally promotes marriage as the end goal for students. Even when curriculums claim to be inclusive of LGBT experiences, they often promote heteronormative lifestyles as "normal." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erevelles|first=Nirmala|date=2011|title=Coming Out Crip in Inclusive Education|url=|journal=Teachers College Record|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusion of LGBT identities and health topics is necessary for LGBTQIA+ students to feel safe and seen in their sex ed classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risky Lessons|last=Fields|first=Jessica|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these students do not have access to or an interest in marriage they are practically erased from the CSE narrative. 

A cross sectional study done in New York City analyzed the sexual behaviors of high school girls. Studies found that, "high school girls who identified as LGBTQIA+ were more likely to report substance use such as: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth, ecstasy and prescription drugs. They also had higher rates of contemplating and/or attempting suicide."&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobel M.D|first=Chanelle et. al|date=August 2017|title=Description of Sexual Orientation and Sexual Behaviors among High School Girls in New York City|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/science/article/pii/S1083318817300980?via%3Dihub|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|volume=30|issue=4|pages=460–465|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect|pmid=28279826|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2017.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that "the LGBTQIA+ youth accesses health information online five times more than the [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] population, and these rates are even higher for LGBTQIA+ youth that identify as a person of color which stems from the fact that they lack health resources. &lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manduley|first=Aida, et al|date=February 8, 2018|title=The role of social media in sex education: Dispatches from queer, trans, and racialized communities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/abs/10.1177/0959353517717751|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|volume=28|pages=152–170|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0959353517717751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, as of May 2018, only 12 states require discussion of sexual orientation and of these, only 9 states require that discussion of sexual orientation be inclusive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|title=State Laws and Policies Regarding Sex and HIV Education|last=|first=|date=2018-05-01|website=|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several states have passed legislation that bans teachers from discussing gay and transgender issues, such as sexual health and HIV/AIDS awareness, in a positive light.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Furthermore, three states require that teachers only portray LGBTQIA+ people in a negative light.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a Canada, a federal report showed that LGBTQIA+ community has less access to health services and faces more comprehensive health challenges compared to the general population. As a result of lack of support for the LGBTQIA+ population, the Comprehensive Health Education Workers (CHEW) Project emerged in October 2014. Their goal is to educate the LGBTQIA+ community  about topics such  sexual and gender identity, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), healthy social relationships, and depression. They do this though workshops, arts‐based projects, and one‐on‐one meetings.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lévesque|first=Michel|date=November 29, 2017|title=The Comprehensive Health Education Workers Project and Caring Professionals as Asset‐Builders|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/full/10.1002/nha3.20200|journal=New Horizons in Adult Education and Human Resource Development|volume=29|issue=4|pages=51–55|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/nha3.20200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Who's role is it to deliver sexual education ===
Many people regard health education as a moral or religious issue, and therefore should be taught not in schools.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; "Before the late 1800s, delivering sex education in the United States and Canada was primarily seen as a parent’s responsibility.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Today, programs under the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) begin comprehensive sex education in pre-kindergarten, which many people believe is not age appropriate.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Many of those in favor of abstinence only education, usually fear any type of sexual education that encourages sexual behavior at a young age.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Is it necessary ===
Although CSE is seen as the polar opposite of abstinence only education, some critics believe that they are very similar. They both aim at preventing STIs and teen pregnancy. The only way in which they differ is through their primary goal. Abstinence only education aims at reducing premarital sex while comprehensive sex education acknowledges that premarital sex may happen and therefore seeks to reduce the unintended consequences of premarital sex through education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Studies in developing counties surrounding sex education have also shown that comprehensive sex education is not needed. General education, such as literacy skills, was seen to delay sexual initiation and reduced the likelihood of pregnancy. Therefore, some people believe general education is of more importance.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== Federal funding for sexual education ==
Although there is no federal mandate that requires states to teach sexual education, there is federal funding available to assist with sexual education programs.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malone|first=Patrick and Monica Rodriguez|date=Spring 2011|title=Comprehensive Sex Education vs. Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Programs|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/23032415|journal=Human Rights|volume=38|pages=5-22|via=JSTOR Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) ===
Historically, funding for abstinence education has always been favored over CSE. In 1996, during Bill Clinton's presidency, legislation was passed to promote abstinence in education programs. Under Title V Section 510 of the Social Security Act, the Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP), was passed. AEGP has always been renewed before its expiration date, and each time funds gradually increase from fifty million dollars per year to seventy-five and as high as $6.75 million per state grant in 2015. The way the funds are disbursed are based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. So far, thirty-six states have been given AEGP funds.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

==== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements ====
Part of Section 510(b) of Title V of the Social Security Act, contains the "A-H guidelines," which are the eight criteria that programs must abide by order to be eligible to receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; They are as follows:

A. Has as its exclusive purpose teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;

B. Teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school-age children;

C. Teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;&lt;p&gt;D. Teaches that a mutually faithful, monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of sexual activity;&lt;/p&gt;E. Teaches that sexual activity outside the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;

F. Teaches that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society;&lt;p&gt;G. Teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increase vulnerability to sexual advances; and&lt;/p&gt;H. Teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

In addition to abiding by these 8 conditions, AGEP compliant programs cannot discuss contraception, STIs, or methods for protecting against STIs, except only when describing failure rates.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) ===
More recently legislation has pushed for funding that goes beyond abstinence only education.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; In 2010, President Obama introduced the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP),  which provides a total of $114.5 million annually to sex education programs that are "medically accurate and age-appropriate."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; TPP falls under a subsection of United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") which is overseen by the Office of Adolescent Health. Funding for TPP is dispersed if "they emulate specific evidence-based programs promulgated under TPP."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; 

=== California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act ===
In January 2016, the California Healthy Youth Act, amended the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act to include minority groups and expand health education. Before it authorized schools to provide comprehensive sex education and required that all materials are made accessible to students with a variety of needs. It also focused solely on marital relationships. It now mandates that schools provide comprehensive sex education and states that "materials cannot be biased and must be appropriate for students of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as those with disabilities and English language learners." Additionally, education must now include "instruction about forming healthy and respectful committed relationships," regardless if marital status. Furthermore, it is now required to have discussions about all FDA-approved contraceptive methods in preventing pregnancy, including the morning after pill.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In conclusion now requires that all sex education programs promulgated in the state should&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

*normalize sexuality as part of human development;
*ensure people receive integrated, comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased sexual health and HIV prevention and  instruction; and
*provide pupils with the knowledge and skills to have healthy, positive, and safe relationships.

== CSE as a human right ==
Some critics state that young people’s access to CSE is grounded in internationally recognized [[human rights]], which require governments to guarantee the overall protection of health, well-being and dignity, as per the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration on Human Rights]], and specifically to guarantee the provision of unbiased, scientifically accurate sexuality education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002431/243106e.pdf|title=Emerging evidence, lessons and practice in comprehensive sexuality education: A global review 2015|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100139-0|location=|pages=14, 15, 25, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights are protected by internationally ratified treaties, and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education remains a barrier to complying with the obligations to ensure the rights to life, health, non-discrimination and information, a view that has been supported by the Statements of the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) Committee, and the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The commitment of individual states to realizing these rights has been reaffirmed by the international community, in particular the [[Commission on Population and Development]] (CPD), which – in its resolutions 2009/12 and 2012/13 – called on governments to provide young people with comprehensive education on human sexuality, SRH and [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other analysis show that comprehensive sex education is not an international right nor a human right because it not clearly stated in either a treaty nor custom. By international law, states are required to provide access to information and education about reproductive health, but this does not require a sex education curriculum. It may take different forms such as mandating that local school districts create a system for providing information to students, or mandating that health clinics and practitioners dispense information to patients.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== CSE in curricula ==

=== CSE teaching methods ===
As CSE gains momentum and interest at international, regional and national levels, governments are increasingly putting in place measures to scale-up their delivery of some form of life skills-based sexuality education, as well as seeking guidance on best practice, particularly regarding placement within the school [[curriculum]]. Sexuality education may be delivered as a stand-alone subject or integrated across relevant subjects within the school curricula. These options have direct implications for implementation, including teacher training, the ease of evaluating and revising curricula, the likelihood of curricula being delivered, and the methods through which it is delivered.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Within countries, choices about implementing integrated or stand-alone sexuality education are typically linked to national policies and overall organization of the curricula. The evidence base on the effectiveness of stand-alone vs. integrated sexuality education programming is still limited. However, there are discernible differences for policy-makers to consider when deciding the position of CSE within the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As a stand-alone subject, sexuality education is set apart from the rest of the curriculum, whether on its own or within a broader stand-alone health and life skills curriculum. This makes it more vulnerable to potentially being sacrificed due to time and budget constraints, since school curricula are typically overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

However, a stand-alone curriculum also presents opportunities for specialized teacher training pathways, and the use of non-formal teaching methodologies that aim to build learners’ critical thinking skills. The pedagogical approaches promoted through sexuality education – such as learner-centred methodologies, development of skills and values, group learning and peer engagement – are increasingly being recognized as transformative approaches that impact on learning and education more widely. As a standalone subject, it is also significantly easier to monitor, which is crucial in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of programming, and revising curricula where it is not delivering the desired learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

When sexuality education is integrated or infused, it is mainstreamed across a number of subject areas, such as biology, social studies, home economics or religious studies. While this model may reduce pressure on an overcrowded curriculum, it is difficult to monitor or evaluate, and may limit teaching methodologies to traditional approaches.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== CSE terminology ===
Apart from the different teaching methods, termiology also differs. Abortion, homosexuality, abstinence have connotations and definitions that vary state. For example, the word "abstinence" may refer to disengaging from all forms of sexual activities until marriage or may refer to only disengaging from sexual intercourse. Furthermore, the degree of sexual activity that "abstinence" connotates is often unclear, because sexual behavior that is not sexual intercourse may or may not be included in its definition. As a result, students are left confused about what activities are risky and teachers do not know what they can and cannot teach.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

The term "comprehensive," is also falls on spectrum, therefore can be considered an umbrella term. CSE means something radical for some institutions while it can mean something moderate and even conservative for others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sex Ed Debates|last=Kendall|first=Nancy|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chicago and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), the guidelines for comprehensive sexuality education are as follows:&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;appropriate to the age, developmental level, and cultural background of students;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;respects the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;complements and augments the sexuality education children receive from their families, religious and community groups, and healthcare professionals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches not only about abstinence, but also contraception, including emergency contraception and reproductive choice;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) issues and questions issues;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches anatomy, development, puberty, and relationships;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches all of the other issues one would expect to be covered in a traditional sexuality education class; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;should be science-based and medically accurate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Sexual education exemption ===
Just as teaching methods and curricula vary by state,  excusal from sex education also varies by state. States may have with an opt out or opt in produce. In some states, students can opt out of receiving sexual education without specifying a particular reason. In other states, students can only opt out for religious or moral reasons. In an opt-in provision, parents must actively agree to allow their children to receive sex education prior to the start of the sexual education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

== Sexual content in the media  ==
Since 1997, the amount of sexual content on TV has nearly doubled in the United States.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skull|first=Tracie Marie et. al|date=2014|title=A Media Literacy Education Approach to Teaching Adolescents Comprehensive Sexual Health Education|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1043483|journal=Journal of Media Literacy Education|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–14|via=ERIC|pmid=27081579|pmc=4828968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study done in 2008 showed that nearly 40% of popular music lyrics contained sexual references which were often sexually degrading. These lyrics were also often accompanied with mentions of other risk behaviors, such as substance use and violence. &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Teens (ages 13-15) in the United States, use entertainment media as their top source for education in regards to sexuality and sexual health. Additionally, a study found that 15-19 year olds in the U.S use media far more than parents or schools to obtain information about birth control.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Some studies have found that, "very few teen television shows mention any of the responsibilities or risks (e.g., using contraception, pregnancy, STIs) associated with sex and almost none of the shows with sexual content include precaution, prevention, or negative outcomes as the primary theme." &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Television shows 16 and Pregnant and its spin-off, Teen Mom, which first aired on MTV in 2009 received major disapproval from some parents as they thought the shows glamorized teen pregnancy and motherhood. However, 16 and Pregnant actually led to a 4.3 percent reduction in teen pregnancy, mostly as a result of increased contraceptive use.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; In contrast, other data shows that exposure to high levels of sexual content on the television causes adolescents to have twice the risk of becoming pregnant in the following 3 years, compared to those who were exposed to low levels.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

The film Mean Girls, directed by Mark Waters shed light on the state sex education in some parts of the United States. In the film the health instructor states, "At your age, you're going to have a lot of urges. You're going to want to take off your clothes and touch each other. But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia and die." This line is meant to be satirical, but it illustrates common flaws within sex education in the U.S. It depicts simplistic descriptions of sexual activity and implementation of fear without any legitimate basis.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

Comprehensive sex education is the main topic in the documentary ''[[The Education of Shelby Knox]]'' released in 2005 about [[Lubbock, Texas]], which has one of the highest [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] rates in the nation. The "solution" to which is a strict [[abstinence-only sex education]] curriculum in the public schools and a conservative preacher who urges kids to pledge abstinence until marriage.

In 2013, ''[[How to Lose Your Virginity]]'' was released, a documentary that questioned the effectiveness of the [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only sex education movement]] and observed how [[sexuality]] continues to define a young woman's morality and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/24/how-to-lose-your-virginity-an-interview-with-therese-shechter/|title=How to Lose Your Virginity: An Interview with Therese Shechter|last=Dove-Viebahn|first=Aviva|date=June 24, 2010|publisher=Ms. Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/5548592/losing-your-virginity-is-harder-than-you-think|title=Losing Your Virginity Is Harder Than You Think|last=Stein|first=Sadie|date=May 26, 2010|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning and necessity of virginity as a [[social construct]] is also examined through narration and interviews with notable sexuality experts, such as former Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders|Dr. Joycelyn Elders]], "Scarleteen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarleteen.com/about_scarleteen|title=About Scarleteen|website=www.scarleteen.com|accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; creator and editor [[Heather Corinna]], historian [[Hanne Blank]], author [[Jessica Valenti]], and [[sex education|comprehensive sex education]] advocate [[Shelby Knox]].

Not only have films portrayed sex education, but so has [[social media]].  Platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], [[Vine (service)|Vine]], and others are used as a tool to uplift the narratives of marginalized communities such as [[Person of color|persons of color]]  and LGBTQIA+ persons in hopes to "strengthen sexual health equity for all."&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

As a result of the mass amount of sex content in media, media literacy education (MLE) has emerged. It was created to address the influence of unhealthy media messages on risky health decisions, such as intention to use substances, body image issues, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; A study analyzed the effectiveness of a teacher-led MLE program, called Media Aware Sexual Health (MASH), which provides students with accurate health information and teaches them how to apply that information to critical analysis of media messages. This comprehensive sex education resulted in increased intentions to talk to a parent, partner and medical professional prior to sexual activity, and intentions for condom use.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Due to knowledge gaps in most sex education curricula for teens, free online resources like [[Sex, Etc.]] and teensource.org&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teensource.org/content/about-us|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=teensource.org|publisher=TeenSource|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created to promote comprehensive, inclusive sex education for teenagers.

'''Creativity''' is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an [[idea]], a [[scientific theory]], a [[musical composition]], or a [[joke]]) or a physical object (such as an [[invention]], a [[Literature|literary work]], or a [[painting]]).

Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily [[psychology]], [[business studies]], and [[cognitive science]], but also [[education]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]] (particularly [[philosophy of science]]), [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]],  and [[economics]], covering  the relations between creativity and general [[intelligence]], personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or [[artificial intelligence]]; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

== Etymology ==
The [[lexeme]] in the English word ''creativity'' comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō'' "to create, make": its [[Morphological derivation|derivational suffixes]] also come from Latin. The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Runco|first=Mark A.|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9|author2=Albert, Robert S.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Creativity Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[The Parson's Tale]]&lt;ref&gt;"And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath '''created''' all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order."&lt;/ref&gt;). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=RuncoAlbert /&gt;

== Definition ==
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;110),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mumford | first1 = M. D. | year = 2003 | title = Where have we been, where are we going? Taking stock in creativity research | url = | journal = [[Creativity Research Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2–3| pages = 107–120 | doi=10.1080/10400419.2003.9651403}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in [[Robert Sternberg]]'s words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".&lt;ref name="Sternberg Cognitive Psychology 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-38701-5|page=479|edition=6|chapter=Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="Meusburger1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meusburger|first=Peter|title=Milieus of Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Spatiality of Creativity|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9876-5 |editor=Meusburger, P. |editor2=Funke, J. |editor3=Wunder, E.|chapter=Milieus of Creativity: The Role of Places, Environments and Spatial Contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an illustration, one definition given by [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Dr. E. Paul Torrance]] described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."&lt;ref name="Torrance Test Manual Verbal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Paul|title=The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Norms-Technical Manual Research Edition|publisher=Personnel Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=6|chapter=Verbal Tests. Forms A and B-Figural Tests, Forms A and B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to [[James Melvin Rhodes|Mel Rhodes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Rhodes: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20342603?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103750220081''An Analysis of Creativity.''] in Phi Delta Kappan 1961, Vol. 42,  No. 7, p. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on ''process'' is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]]), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative ''product'' usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful [[memetics|memes]].&lt;ref name="Gabora"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Liane Gabora|Gabora, Liane]]|year=1997|title= The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity|journal=Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|volume=1|url=http://cogprints.org/794/1/oecc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=CENGAGE Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|page=468|editor=Jaime A. Perkins |editor2=Dan Moneypenny |editor3=Wilson Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A focus on the nature of the creative ''person'' considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of [[Ideation (creative process)|ideation]], autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on ''place'' considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468" /&gt;

== History of the concept ==
{{Main|History of the concept of creativity}}
[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity, preferring to see art as a form of discovery. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", Plato answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Ancient views ===
Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt; [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Outline of ancient India|Ancient India]],&lt;ref name="Albert99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "''poiein''" ("to make"), which only applied to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who made it. [[Plato]] did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, The Republic, Book X – [[wikisource:The Republic/Book X]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt;

It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in [[Western culture]] through [[Christianity]], as a matter of [[Revelation|divine inspiration]].&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; According to the historian [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], "the early Western conception of creativity was the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical story of creation]] given in the ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''."&lt;ref name="Albert2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the [[Renaissance]]. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0091265|last=Niu|first=Weihua|author2=Sternberg, Robert J.|title=The Philosophical Roots of Western and Eastern Conceptions of Creativity|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|year=2006|volume=26|pages=18–38|url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/641OBVx0d?url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=}}; cf. [[Michel Weber]], "[https://www.academia.edu/3640181/_Creativity_Efficacy_and_Vision_Ethics_and_Psychology_in_an_Open_Universe_2006_ Creativity, Efficacy and Vision: Ethics and Psychology in an Open Universe]," in Michel Weber and Pierfrancesco Basile (eds.), ''Subjectivity, Process, and Rationality'', Frankfurt/Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought XIV, 2006, pp. 263-281.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture, for instance, [[Muse]]s were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods.&lt;ref name="Dacey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dacey|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity, Vol. 1|year=1999|isbn=978-0-12-227076-5|editor=Mark A. Runco |editor2=Steven R. Pritzer|chapter=Concepts of Creativity: A history|publisher=[[Elsevier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "[[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]" (Greek) or "[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Albert3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "[[Great Man theory|great men]]".&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt;

=== The Enlightenment and after ===
The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the [[Renaissance]] and even later.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg" /&gt; The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the [[Renaissance]], when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named [[humanism]], which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Humanism - Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture {{!}} Exhibitions - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|website = www.loc.gov|date = 1993-01-08|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this philosophy arose the [[Renaissance man]] (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leonardo da Vinci {{!}} Italian artist, engineer, and scientist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt; By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], mention of creativity (notably in [[aesthetics]]), linked with the concept of [[imagination]], became more frequent.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz80"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tatarkiewicz, Władysław |authorlink=Władysław Tatarkiewicz |title=A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics |location=Translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], The Hague |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the writing of [[Thomas Hobbes]], imagination became a key element of human cognition;&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; [[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]] was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of [[genius]], typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt;

As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt; Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of [[Darwinism]]. In particular, they refer to the work of [[Francis Galton]], who through his [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.

=== Twentieth century to the present day ===
The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]]&lt;ref name="Wallas26"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallas, G. |title=Art of Thought |year=1926 |authorlink=Graham Wallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Wertheimer]]. In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name="Simonton99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simonton, D. K. |year=1999 |title=Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

In 1927, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ''[[Process and Reality]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|title=Process and reality : an essay in cosmology ; Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Edinburgh during the session 1927–28|year=1978|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-934580-1|edition=Corrected}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Steven|title=Introduction: Whitehead Now|journal=Configurations|year=2005|volume=1|issue=13|pages=1–33}}. Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008) and Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[Psychology|psychological]] literature, is usually considered to have begun with [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name="Sternberg99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sternberg, R. J. |author2=Lubart, T. I. |chapter=The Concept of Creativity: Prospects and Paradigms |editor=Sternberg, R. J. |title=Handbook of Creativity |year=1999 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |isbn=978-0-521-57285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargreaves | first1 = H. L. | year = 1927 | title = The faculty of imagination: An enquiry concerning the existence of a general faculty, or group factor, of imagination | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = Monograph Supplement 3 | issue = | pages = 1–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.&lt;ref name="Kozbelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozbelt|first=Aaron|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9 |author2=Beghetto, Ronald A. |author3=Runco, Mark A.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Theories of Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Four C" model ===
[[James C. Kaufman]] and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), ''little-c'' (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.&lt;ref name="KaufBeg2009"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0013688|last=Kaufman|first=James C.|author2=Beghetto, Ronald A.|title=Beyond Big and Little: The Four C Model of Creativity|journal=[[Review of General Psychology]]|year=2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–12|authorlink=James C. Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.&lt;ref name=Kozbelt /&gt; [[Margaret Boden]] distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).&lt;ref name="Boden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boden|first=Margaret|title=The Creative Mind: Myths And Mechanisms|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-297-82069-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.&lt;ref name="Simonton97"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.104.1.66|last=Simonton|first=D.

== Theories of creative processes ==
There has been much empirical study in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.

=== Incubation ===
Incubation is a temporary break from [[creative problem solving]] that can result in insight.&lt;ref name="EoC Incubation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=S. M.|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity Volume I|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-375039-6|pages=653–657|edition=2nd|editor=M. A. Runco |editor2=S. R. Pritzker|chapter=Incubation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of "incubation" in [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref name="Ward2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, T. |year=2003 |chapter=Creativity |editor= Nagel, L. |title=Encyclopaedia of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some [[empirical evidence]] is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Smith1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Steven M.|title=The Creative Cognition Approach|year=1995|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|editor=Steven M. Smith |editor2=Thomas B. Ward |editor3=Ronald A. Finke|chapter=Fixation, Incubation, and Insight in Memory and Creative Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref name=Anderson2000&gt;"{{cite book |author=Anderson, J. R. |year=2000 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-1686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This earlier hypothesis is discussed in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]'s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1996). ''Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention.'' New York: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-092820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergent and divergent thinking ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]&lt;ref name="Guilford67"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guilford, J. P. |year=1967 |title=The Nature of Human Intelligence |authorlink=J. P. Guilford}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed [[convergent thinking|convergent]] and [[divergent thinking]]). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Creative cognition approach ===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.&lt;ref name="Ward1995"&gt;Ward, T.B. (1995). What’s old about new ideas. In S. M. Smith, T. B. Ward &amp; R. A. &amp; Finke (Eds.) ''The creative cognition approach'', 157–178, London: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisberg&lt;ref name="Weisberg93"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weisberg, R. W. |year=1993 |title=Creativity: Beyond the myth of genius |publisher=Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-2119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

=== The Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory ===
Helie and Sun&lt;ref name="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Helie S. |author2=Sun R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861|citeseerx=10.1.1.405.2245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently proposed a unified framework for understanding [[creative problem-solving|creativity in problem solving]], namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).

The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:
# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 
# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;
# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. 
A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

=== Conceptual blending ===
{{Main|Conceptual blending}}
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.&lt;ref name="Koestler64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

=== Honing theory ===
Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.

A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L. &amp; Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20–23, 2011, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.

Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.

=== Everyday imaginative thought ===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".&lt;ref&gt;Roese, N. J. &amp; Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. Klein, W. &amp; Suhr, E. (eds) (2009). ''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M. J. Byrne|Byrne, R. M. J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessing individual creative ability ==
=== Creativity quotient ===
There was a ''creativity quotient'' developed similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415–419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric approach ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name="Guilford67" /&gt; which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://people.uncw.edu/caropresoe/GiftedFoundations/SocialEmotional/Creativity-articles/Kim_Can-we-trust-creativity-tests.pdf|title=Can We Trust Creativity Tests?|author=Kim, Kyung Hee|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

Such tests, sometimes called ''Divergent Thinking (DT)'' tests have been both supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K.

Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of [[divergent thinking]] tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, [[Natural language processing|NLP]] techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E. A., &amp; Dunbar, K. N. (2009). Creativity evaluation through latent semantic analysis. In Proceedings of the 31st Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 602–607).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, I. J., &amp; Haarmann, H. (2014). Automated scoring of originality using semantic representations. In Proceedings of the 36th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (poster paper).&lt;/ref&gt; The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.

Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = S. | last2 = Runco | first2 = M.

Runco&lt;ref&gt;Other members include Kenes Beketayev PhD Computer Science; Liberty Lidz, PhD Linguistics; Perman Gochyyev, PhD Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing (SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system).

=== Social-personality approach ===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternberg99" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.&lt;ref name=Feist /&gt; Within the framework of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.&lt;ref name="Batey, M. 2006 p. 355-429"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Creativity, intelligence and personality: A critical review of the scattered literature | url = | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 355–429 | doi=10.3200/mono.132.4.355-430}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Openness to experience]] has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. F. | last3 = Safiullina | first3 = X. | year = 2010 | title = Intelligence, General Knowledge and Personality as Predictors of Creativity | url = | journal = Learning and Individual Differences | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 532–535 | doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2010.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other Big Five traits, research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, [[Conscientiousness|conscientious]], and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=Feist&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feist | first1 = G. J. | year = 1998 | title = A meta-analysis of the impact of personality on scientific and artistic creativity | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychological Review | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 290–309 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0204_5| pmid = 15647135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-report questionnaires ===
An alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as [[Self-report study#Questionnaires and interviews|self-report questionnaires]] supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire|Creative Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ying-Yao|first=Wang, Chia-Chi{{!}}Ho, Hsiao-Chi{{!}}Cheng, Chih-Ling{{!}}Cheng|date=2014-00-00|title=Application of the Rasch Model to the Measurement of Creativity: The Creative Achievement Questionnaire.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1088863|journal=Creativity Research Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|issn=1040-0419}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendetowicz|first=David|last2=Urbanski|first2=Marika|last3=Aichelburg|first3=Clarisse|last4=Levy|first4=Richard|last5=Volle|first5=Emmanuelle|date=2017-01|title=Brain morphometry predicts individual creative potential and the ability to combine remote ideas|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010945216303161|journal=Cortex|volume=86|pages=216–229|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.10.021|pmid=27919546|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German-speaking&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017-11|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees' creative achievement.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X}}&lt;/ref&gt; version. It is the self-report questionnaire most frequently used in research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Creativity and intelligence ==
The potential relationship between creativity and [[intelligence]] has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962"&gt;Getzels, J. W., &amp; Jackson, P. W. (1962). Creativity and intelligence: Explorations with gifted students. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron,&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963"&gt;Barron, F. (1963). Creativity and psychological health. Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallach &amp; Kogan,&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965"&gt;Wallach, M. A., &amp; Kogan, N. (1965). Modes of thinking in young children: A study of the creativity-intelligence distinction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; and Guilford&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967"&gt;Guilford, J. P. (1967). The nature of human intelligence. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.&lt;ref&gt;Plucker, J., &amp; Renzulli, J. S. (1999). Psychometric approaches to the study of human creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 35–60). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:

*Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967" /&gt;
*Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, J. R. (1989). Cognitive processes in creativity. In J. A. Glover, R. R. Ronning, &amp; C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 135–145). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996"&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1996). Successful Intelligence. NewYork: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg and O’Hara&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; O’Hara, L. A. (1999). Creativity and intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 251–272). Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
#Creativity is a subset of intelligence
#Intelligence is a subset of creativity
#Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs
#Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)
#Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)

=== Creativity as a subset of intelligence ===
A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.

''Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence''

*Gardner’s  [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] (MIT)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1993). Creating minds. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; – implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT. To demonstrate this, Gardner cited examples of different famous creators, each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e.g. Picasso (spatial intelligence); Freud (intrapersonal); Einstein (logical-mathematical); and Gandhi (interpersonal).
*Sternberg’s Theory of Successful intelligence&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J., Kaufman, J. C., &amp; Grigorenko, E. L. (2008). Applied intelligence. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Triarchic theory of intelligence]]) includes creativity as a main component, and comprises 3 sub-theories: Componential (Analytic), Contextual (Practical), and Experiential (Creative). Experiential sub-theory – the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems – is directly related to creativity.
*The [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically, it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Lichtenberger | first3 = E.

New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.
*The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, J.C., Kaufman, S.B., &amp; Plucker, J.A. (2013). Contemporary theories of intelligence. In J. Reisberg (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology (pp. 811-822). New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process, and concerns goal directed thoughts, which are explained by ''g''. Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.

=== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ===
In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.

*Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1991 | title = An investment theory of creativity and its development | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.1159/000277029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R.

Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.
*Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T. M. | year = 1982 | title = Social psychology of creativity: A consensual assessment technique | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 997–1013 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1996). Creativity in context: Update to "The Social Psychology of Creativity". Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.
*Amusement Park Theoretical Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2005 | title = Bridging generality and specificity: The Amusement Park Theoretical (APT) Model of creativity | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 158–163 | doi=10.1080/02783190509554310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.
**Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).
**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.
**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.

=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===
This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.

''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''

*Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J. S. | year = 1978 | title = What makes giftedness? Reexamining a definition | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 180–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.
*[[PASS theory of intelligence]]. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naglieri | first1 = J.

*Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, E. P. (1962). Guiding creative talent. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

In support of the TT, Barron&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron, F. (1969). Creative person and creative process. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample.

Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wai | first1 = J. | last2 = Lubinski | first2 = D. | last3 = Benbow | first3 = C. P. | year = 2005 | title = Creativity and occupational accomplishments among intellectually precocious youths: An age 13 to age 33 longitudinal study | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 3| pages = 484–492 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.484}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K. H. | year = 2005 | title = Can only intelligent people be creative? | url = | journal = Journal of Secondary Gifted Education | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 57–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preckel | first1 = F. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiese | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students: An investigation of threshold theory | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 159–170 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r'' = .3 to ''r'' = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.

=== Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets ===
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind’s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.

Weisberg &amp; Alba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Alba | first2 = J. W. | year = 1981 | title = An examination of the alleged role of "fixation" in the solution of several "insight" problems | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 110 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see [[Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle]]) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.

=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===
In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

Getzels and Jackson&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt; administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.

However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence? Why? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 871–882 | doi=10.1037/h0042008}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.

Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.

== Neuroscience ==
The [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed&lt;ref name="NeuroPsychiatry"&gt;[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the article "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms." The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147–53 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.&lt;ref name=PMID_26003860&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |laysummary = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232–9 |volume = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in "forward" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, in press-a&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2011, in press-b&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert &amp; Vandervert-Weathers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive "mental prototyping" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al.

=== REM sleep ===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02223 |author1=Wagner U. |author2=Gais S. |author3=Haider H. |author4=Verleger R. |author5=Born J. | year = 2004 | title = Sleep inspires insight | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972| pages = 352–5 | pmid = 14737168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] rather than [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0900271106 |author1=Cai D.

It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."&lt;ref name="Cai" /&gt;

== Affect ==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term "affect" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Winkielman2007&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive affect relations ===
According to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

== Creativity and artificial intelligence ==
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s formal [[theory]] of creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658| citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.6919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990–2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple [[Computational learning theory|computational]] principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects." This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.

According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Video of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

Youtube, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[physicist]]s are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished [[physical law]]s permitting better [[data compression]]. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.
Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for "inventing a novel joke with an unexpected [[punch line]], related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil AI: [http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-creative-machines-overtake-man Transcript] of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s TEDx talk (2012): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ35zNlyG-o&amp;list=PL194623EBA834DB77&amp;index=11 When creative machines overtake man]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health ==
{{Main|Creativity and mental illness}}
A study by psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]] found creativity to correlate with [[intelligence]] and [[psychoticism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rushton, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found creativity to be greater in [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 |pmid=16125369 |url=http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215212520/http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= |volume=80 |issue=2–3 |title=Verbal creativity and schizotypal personality in relation to prefrontal hemispheric laterality: A behavioral and near-infrared optical imaging study |year=2005 |journal=Schizophrenia Research |pages=271–282 | last1 = Folley | first1 = Bradley S. | last2 = Park | first2 = Sohee|pmc=2817946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, [[ambidexterity]] is also associated with [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] and [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and "creative bipolarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|last2=Koutsoukou-Argyraki|first2=Asimina|date=2017|title=Bipolar Disorder and/or Creative Bipolarity: Robert Schumann's Exemplary Psychopathology - Combining Symptomatological and Psychosocial Perspectives with Creativity Research|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/479883|journal=Psychopathology|language=english|volume=50|issue=6|pages=379–388|doi=10.1159/000479883|pmid=29017153|issn=0254-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kyaga | first1 = S. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = P. | last3 = Boman | first3 = M. | last4 = Hultman | first4 = C. | last5 = Långström | first5 = N. | last6 = Landén | first6 = M. | title = Creativity and mental disorder: Family study of 300 000 people with severe mental disorder | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085316 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 199 | issue = 5 | pages = 373–379 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21653945| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and "creative melancholy", pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer M.|last2=Roussel|first2=Martin|last3=Hofmann|first3=Frank-Hagen|date=2010-12|title=Depression and creativity — The case of the german poet, scientist and statesman J.

Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565"&gt;Roberts, Michelle. Creativity 'closely entwined with mental illness'. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19959565. 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565" /&gt;

According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx|title=The science of creativity|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creativity and personality ==
Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each

: (i) "Idea Generation" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)
: (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
: (iii) "Motivation" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)
: (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)

This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;(Batey &amp; Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C. K. | year = 2002 | title = Creativity and Group Innovation | url = | journal = Applied Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 400–406 | doi = 10.1111/1464-0597.00984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Guilford, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.

Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.&lt;ref&gt;(Christiaans &amp; Venselaar, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.

From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.&lt;ref&gt;(Campbell, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro &amp; Gardner, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.&lt;ref&gt;(Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malevolent creativity ==
Malevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the "darker side" of creativity.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R. B. | year = 1993 | title = The dark side of creativity | url = | journal = Creat. Res. J. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 137–144 | doi = 10.1080/10400419309534472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.&lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"/&gt; Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Reiter-Palmon | first2 = R. | year = 2015 | title = Fast and furious: The influence of implicit aggression, premeditation, and provoking situations on malevolent creativity | url = | journal = Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 54–64 | doi = 10.1037/a0038499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) &lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"/&gt;

===Malevolent creativity and crime===
Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.&lt;ref&gt;Aggression: A social psychological analysis.

== Creativity across cultures ==
Creativity is viewed differently in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg RJ 'Introduction' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (2006) (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 1-9. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-cultural research centred on [[Hong Kong]] found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society.&lt;ref&gt;Niu W (2006) 'Development of Creativity Research in Chinese Societies' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 386-387. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 465. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[linguistic relativity]], i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; [[Africa]] has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as [[music]], [[art]], and [[storytelling]]. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 458. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Preiss DD and Strasser K (2006) 'Creativity in Latin America' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 46. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Smith GJW and Carlsson I (2006) 'Creativity under the Northern Lights' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 202. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Preiser S (2006) 'Creativity Research in German-Speaking Countries' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 175. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In organizations ==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|right|Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in [[Brazil]]. The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]

It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Amabile&lt;ref name="Amabile98"&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] – [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name="Nonaka91"&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[Cause of action|actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1998). "How to kill creativity". Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siltala, R. 2010. Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching. University of Turku&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive intelligence|Creative competitive intelligence]] is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.

Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, S. y Urrea J.

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

The investigation by Loo (2017) &lt;ref&gt;Loo, S. (2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391&lt;/ref&gt; on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’, ‘Theories of creative processes’, ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’, ‘Creativity and personality’, and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O’Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).

Loo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.

The study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.

This investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.

There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ [advertising], and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ [advertising], and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ [advertising], and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ [IT software]).

The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.

This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.

'''[[Team Composition]]'''

Diversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822–832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

'''Team Processes'''

Team communication [[norm (social)|norm]]s, such as respecting others’ expertise, paying attention to others’ ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, [[negotiation|negotiating]], remaining open to others’ ideas, learning from others, and building on each other’s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with [[brainstorming]] and [[problem solving]]. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], which facilitates collective creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Organizational culture|'''Organizational Culture''']]

Supportive and motivational environments that create [[psychological safety]] by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Organizations in which [[help-seeking]], [[Helping behavior|help giving]], and [[collaboration]] are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargadon | first1 = A.

==Economic views of creativity==
Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a "[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]" model of creativity.&lt;ref name="RubRunc1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A. Runco |title=The psychoeconomic approach to creativity|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive [[utility]], and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.&lt;ref name="Diamond1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90023-S|last=Diamond|first=Arthur M.|title=Creativity and Interdisciplinarity: A Response to Rubenson and Runco|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with "3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|Creativity techniques}}

Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative_problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].

Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg|chapter=Enhancing creativity|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:
# Establishing purpose and intention
# Building basic skills
# Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge
# Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration
# Building motivation, especially internal motivation
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
# Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity
# Providing opportunities for choice and discovery
# Developing self-management (metacognitive skills)
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance
# Providing balance

==Creativity and education policies==

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as "stifling" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[preschool]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csik99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi|first=Mihály|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R. J. Sternberg|chapter=Implications of a systems perspective for the study of creativity|authorlink=Mihály Csíkszentmihályi|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RobAzzam2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=K.|author2=Azzam, A. M.|title=Why creativity now?|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2009|volume=67|issue=1|pages=22–26|authorlink=Ken Robinson (British author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise.&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt; In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paris, C., Edwards, N., Sheffield, E., Mutinsky, M., Olexa, T., Reilly, S., &amp; Baer, J.

New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.

Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ByrgeHanson2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrge|first=C.|author2=Hanson.

(1993). Evolution and flow. In M. Csikszentmihalyi (Ed.), The evolving self: A psychology for the third millennium (pp. 175–206). New York: Harper Perennial.&lt;/ref&gt; To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (1998). All our futures: Creativity, culture, and education. UK: NACCCE&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ByrgeHanson2009 /&gt; In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The manifesto : a guide to developing a creative career|last=Torrance|first=E.

===Scotland===
In the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]], creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual.  It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.” [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)] The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/Creative%20Learning%20Networks] and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open—mindedness, imagination and problem solving. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/What%20are%20creativity%20skills?] Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/documents/creativity/cre24_infographics/cre24-the-big-picture.pdf] Scotland’s national Creative Learning Plan [http://www.creativescotland.com/resources/our-publications/plans-and-strategy-documents/scotlands-creative-learning-plan-2013] supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators’ expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/Pages/Search.aspx?k=Creativity%20infographics] including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)]

===United States===
Creativity has also been identified as one of the key [[21st century skills]] and as one of the  [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]] by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.

The '''''Dashboard of Sustainability''''' is a free-of-charge, non-commercial software package configured to convey the complex relationships among economic, social, and environmental issues.
The software is designed to help developing countries achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and work towards [[sustainable development]]. The software package was developed by members of the Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators (CGSDI),&lt;ref&gt;Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators.  (2006)  ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/dashboard.asp Dashboard of Sustainability.]''; see also ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/history.asp CGSDI history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106123832/http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/history.asp |date=2007-01-06 }}'' and ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/members.asp CGSDI members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224102435/http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/members.asp |date=2007-02-24 }}'', all obtained Apr. 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been applied to quite a number of indicator sets, inter alia to the Millennium Development Goals indicators and the United Nations [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] indicators.

In 2002, Dashboard of Sustainability researchers Jochen Jesinghaus and Peter Hardi presented the Dashboard of Sustainability at the [[Earth Summit 2002|Johannesburg Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;IISD Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB) ''[http://www.iisd.ca/2002/wssd/enbots/aug30.html ENB on the side, Aug. 30, 2002]'' obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2002 [[World Social Forum]] in [[Porto Alegre]].&lt;ref&gt;Ranjit Devraj (TerraViva), ''[http://ipsnews.net/terraviva/05_dashboard.shtml Internet Dashboard Device for Navigating Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411090712/http://www.ipsnews.net/terraviva/05_dashboard.shtml |date=2007-04-11 }}'', obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was also included in the resources for the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] World Forum on Key Indicators.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2004), ''[http://www.oecd.org/document/2/0,2340,en_21571361_31834434_33637186_1_1_1_1,00.html European Union 2002, Dashboard of Sustainability]'', obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, the Millennium Project utilized the Dashboard of Sustainability to conclude in their [[State of the Future]] report that global prospects for improving the overall health, wealth, and sustainability of humanity are improving, but slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Jerome C.; Gordon, Theodore J.  (Jan. 1, 2006)  [[The Futurist (magazine)|The Futurist]].

The '''definition of religion''' is a controversial subject in [[religious studies]] with scholars failing to agree on any one definition. [[Oxford Dictionary]] defines [[religion]] as the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a [[personal God]] or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/religion|title=religion (English Oxford living Dictionaries)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]], have tried to correct a perceived Judeo-Christian and Western bias in the definition and study of religion. Thinkers such as Daniel Dubuisson{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007}} have doubted that the term religion has any meaning outside of western cultures, while others, such as Ernst Feil{{sfn|Feil|2000}} even doubt that it has any specific, universal meaning even there.

==Competing definitions==

Scholars have failed to agree on a definition of religion. There are however two general definition systems: the sociological/functional and the phenomenological/philosophical.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl.

* [[Emile Durkheim]] defined religion as "a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say things set apart and forbidden - beliefs and practises which unite into one single moral community called a church, all those who adhere to them."{{sfn|Taves|2009|page=176}}
* [[Max Lynn Stackhouse]], defined religion as "a comprehensive worldview or 'metaphysical moral vision' that is accepted as binding because it is held to be in itself basically true and just even if all dimensions of it cannot be either fully confirmed or refuted".{{sfn|Nelson|2010|page=xi}}

Some jurisdictions refuse to classify specific religions as religions, arguing that they are instead heresies, even if they are widely viewed as a religion in the academic world.{{sfn|Minahan|2002|page=234}}

===Modern western===
Religion is  a [[modern era|modern]] [[Western culture|Western]] concept.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Timothy|last=Fitzgerald|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures; there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages.&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths about Religions|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM.  2002).

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply it to non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;{{cite book|first1=Daniel|last1=Dubuisson|title=The Western Construction of Religion : Myths, Knowledge, and Ideology|date=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=0801887569}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt;

An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A. M. |date=2002 |title=Sociological definitions, language games, and the 'essence' of religion | journal=Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | volume=14 | issue=1 | issn=0943-3058 | doi=10.1163/157006802760198776 | pages=61–83 |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf |access-date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wilfred Cantwell |date=1978 |title=The Meaning and End of Religion |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:
{{quote|The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference USA]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=James |first1=Paul |last2=Mandaville |first2=Peter |year=2010 |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Globalization and Culture, Vol. 2: Globalizing Religions |url=https://www.academia.edu/4416072/Globalization_and_Culture_Vol._2_Globalizing_Religions_editor_with_Peter_Mandaville_Sage_Publications_London_2010 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Classical===
[[File:Будажап Цыреторов.JPG|thumb|Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in [[Buryatia]].]]
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;Hueston A. Finlay. "'Feeling of absolute dependence' or 'absolute feeling of dependence'? A question revisited". ''Religious Studies'' 41.1 (2005), pp. 81–94. {{doi|10.1017/S0034412504007462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"&gt;Tillich, P. (1957) ''Dynamics of faith''. Harper Perennial; (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion.

==Religion as modern western construct==
[[File:Huxisanxiaotu.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]] are one'', a painting in the ''litang style'' portraying three men laughing by a river stream, 12th century, [[Song dynasty]]]]

A number of scholars have pointed out that the terminology used in the study of religion in the west derives from [[Judeo-Christian tradition]], and that the basic assumptions of religion as an analytical category are all Western in origin. This idea was first raised by Wilfred Cantwell Smith in his 1962 book, ''The Meaning and End of Religion''.{{sfn|Smith|1991}} Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], and Jason Ānanda Josephson. These [[social constructionist]]s argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

While few would dispute that the concept of religion does have a historical genealogy, there is some disagreement about what the Western origin of the term has meant historically. Some such as [[Tomoko Masuzawa]] have felt that the equation of religion with Christianity had the effect of diminishing other traditions, especially in the study of comparative religions as it developed during the high point of Western imperialism.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}} Others{{who|date=November 2017}} have felt that this sort of criticism overestimates the influence that Western academic thought had on the rest of the world.

Daniel Dubuisson, a French anthropologist, argues that the idea of religion has changed a lot over time and that one cannot fully understand its development by relying on consistent use of the term, which "tends to minimize or cancel out the role of history".{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} "What the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history."{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} He notes that [[St. Augustine]]'s definition of ''religio'' differed from the way we used the modern word religion.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}}

Dubuisson prefers the term "cosmographic formation" to religion. Dubuisson says that, with the emergence of religion as a category separate from culture and society, there arose [[religious studies]]. The initial purpose of religious studies was to demonstrate the superiority of the living or universal European world view to the dead or ethnic religions scattered throughout the rest of the world, expanding the teleological project of [[Schleiermacher]] and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Tiele]] to a worldwide ideal religiousness.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007|p=792}} Due to shifting theological currents, this was eventually supplanted by a liberal-ecumenical interest in searching for Western-style universal truths in every cultural tradition.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}}

According to Fitzgerald, religion is not a universal feature of all cultures, but rather a particular idea that first developed in Europe under the influence of [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|p=45–46}} Fitzgerald argues that from about the 4th century CE Western Europe and the rest of the world diverged. As Christianity became commonplace, the [[charismatic authority]] identified by Augustine, a quality we might today call religiousness, exerted a commanding influence at the local level. As the Catholic Church lost its dominance during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and Christianity became closely tied to political structures, religion was recast as the basis of national [[sovereignty]], and religious identity gradually became a less universal sense of spirituality and more divisive, locally defined, and tied to nationality.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=194}} It was at this point that religion was dissociated from universal beliefs and moved closer to [[dogma]] in both meaning and practice. However, there was not yet the idea of dogma as a personal choice, only of [[established church]]es. With the Enlightenment religion lost its attachment to nationality, says Fitzgerald, but rather than becoming a universal social attitude, it now became a personal feeling or emotion.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=268}}

[[Talal Asad]] later refined this notion by showing that many assumptions about religion derive specifically from post-Enlightenment Christianity.{{sfn|Asad|2003}}
Asad argues that before the word religion came into common usage, Christianity was a ''disciplina'', a rule just like that of the Roman Empire. This idea can be found in the writings of [[St. Augustine]] (354–430). Christianity was then a power structure opposing and superseding human institutions, a literal Kingdom of Heaven. It was the discipline taught by one's family, school, church, and city authorities, rather than something calling one to self-discipline through symbols.{{sfn|Asad|1993|p=34-35}}

These ideas are developed by [[S. N. Balagangadhara]]. In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Balagangadhara argues that the idea of Christianity as the purest expression of spirituality was supplanted by the concept of religion as a worldwide practice.{{sfn|Balagangadhara|1994|p=159}} This caused such ideas as [[religious freedom]], a reexamination of classical [[philosophy]] as an alternative to Christian thought, and more radically [[Deism]] among intellectuals such as [[Voltaire]]. Much like Christianity, the idea of religious freedom was exported around the world as a civilizing technique, even to regions such as [[India]] that had never treated spirituality as a matter of political identity.{{sfn|Pennington|2005}}

More recently, in ''The Invention of Religion in Japan'', Josephson has argued that while the concept of religion was Christian in its early formulation, non-Europeans (such as the Japanese) did not just acquiesce and passively accept the term's meaning. Instead they worked to interpret religion (and its boundaries) strategically to meet their own agendas and staged these new meanings for a global audience.{{sfn|Josephson|2012}} In nineteenth century [[Japan]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] was radically transformed from a pre-modern philosophy of [[natural law]] into a religion, as Japanese leaders worked to address domestic and international political concerns. In summary, Josephson argues that the European encounter with other cultures has led to a partial de-Christianization of the category religion. Hence religion has come to refer to a confused collection of traditions with no possible coherent definition.{{sfn|Josephson|2012|p=257}}

[[George Lindbeck]], a [[Lutheran]] and a [[Postliberal theology|postliberal theologian]] (but not a social constructionist), says that religion does not refer to belief in [[God]] or a transcendent Absolute, but rather to "a kind of cultural and/or linguistic framework or medium that shapes the entirety of life and thought ... it is similar to an idiom that makes possible the description of realities, the formulation of beliefs, and the experiencing of inner attitudes, feelings, and sentiments."{{sfn|Lindbeck|1984|p=33}}

'''Drapery''' is a general word referring to [[cloth]]s or [[textile]]s ([[Old French]] ''[[wikt:draperie|draperie]]'', from [[Late Latin]] ''drappus''&lt;ref&gt;"Perhaps of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin" ''[[OED]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;).  It may refer to cloth used for decorative purposes &amp;ndash; such as around windows &amp;ndash; or to the trade of retailing cloth, originally mostly for clothing, formerly conducted by drapers. 

In [[art history]], drapery refers to any cloth or textile depicted, which is usually clothing. The schematic depiction of the folds and woven patterns of loose-hanging clothing on the human form, with ancient prototypes, was reimagined as an adjunct to the female form by Greek vase-painters and sculptors of the earliest fifth century and has remained a major source of stylistic formulas in sculpture and painting, even after the [[Renaissance]] adoption of tighter-fitting clothing styles.  After the Renaissance, large cloths with no very obvious purpose are often used decoratively, especially in portraits in the [[grand manner]]; these are also known as draperies.
[[Image:Fresque Mithraeum Marino.jpg|thumb|280px|Fresco of [[Mithras]] and the Bull from the [[mithraeum]] at Marino, (3rd century CE)]]
For the Greeks, as [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] noted,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Young Johneey: A Study in Ideal Form'' 1956:245ff.&lt;/ref&gt; clinging drapery followed the planes and contours of the bodily form, emphasizing its twist and stretch: "floating drapery makes visible the line of movement through which it has just passed.... Drapery, by suggesting lines of force, indicates for each action a past and a possible future." Clark contrasted the formalized draperies in the frieze at Olympia with the sculptural frieze figures of the [[Parthenon]], where "it has attained a freedom and an expressive power that have never been equalled except by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]". Undraped male figures, Clark observed, "were kept in motion by their flying cloaks."

'''Ecodesign''' is an approach to designing products with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its whole lifecycle.  In a [[life cycle assessment]], the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement, manufacture, use, and disposal.

Ecodesign is a growing responsibility and understanding of our [[ecological footprint]] on the planet. Green awareness, [[overpopulation]], [[industrialization]] and an increased environmental population have led to the questioning of consumer values. It is imperative to search for new building solutions that are [[environmentally friendly]] and lead to a reduction in the consumption of materials and [[energy consumption|energy]].

==Overview==
[[File:Stainless Steel Talbe with FSC Eucalyptus wood Ecodesign.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Stainless steel]] table with [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]] Teca wood - [[Brazil]] ecodesign]]
As the whole product's life cycle should be regarded in an integrated perspective, representatives from advance development, design, production, marketing, purchasing, and project management should work together on the Ecodesign of a further developed or new product.  Together, they have the best chance to predict the holistic effects of changes of the product and their environmental impact.

An eco-design product has a [[cradle-to-cradle]] life cycle ensuring zero waste is created in the whole process. By mimicking life cycles in nature, eco-design is a fundamental concept in achieving a truly [[circular economy]].

Environmental aspects which ought to be analysed for every stage of the life cycle are:

* Consumption of resources (energy, materials, water or land area)
* Emissions to air, water, and the ground (our Earth) as being relevant for the environment and human health
* Miscellaneous (e.g. noise and vibration)

Waste (hazardous waste and other waste defined in environmental legislation) is only an intermediate step and the final emissions to the environment (e.g. methane and leaching from landfills) are inventoried. All consumables, materials and parts used in the life cycle phases are accounted for, and all indirect environmental aspects linked to their production.

The environmental aspects of the phases of the life cycle are evaluated according to their environmental impact on the basis of a number of parameters, such as extent of environmental impact, potential for improvement, or potential of change.

According to this ranking the recommended changes are carried out and reviewed after a certain time.

==Environmental effect analysis==
[[File:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Interior design|decoration]] [[fair]]. The reuse of materials is a sustainable practice that is rapidly growing among [[designers]] in [[Brazil]].]]

One instrument to identify the factors that are important for the reduction of the environmental impact during all lifecycle stages is the environmental effect analysis (EEA).

For an EEA the following are taken into account:

* Customers' wishes
* Legal requirements, market requirements (competitors)
* Data concerning the product and the manufacturing process

==Applications in design==
Ecodesign concepts currently have a great influence on many aspects of design; the impact of [[global warming]] and an increase in CO₂ emissions have led companies to consider a more environmentally conscious approach to their design thinking and process.
In building design and construction, designers are taking on the concept of Ecodesign throughout the design process, from the choice of materials to the type of energy that is being consumed and the disposal of waste.

With respect to these concepts, [[online]] platforms dealing in only Ecodesign products are emerging, with the additional sustainable purpose of eliminating all unnecessary distribution steps between the designer and the final customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://nupe.co.uk/an-interview-with-sustainable-design-company-moorbi/ Kamran Assadi for Nupè April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoMaterials''', such as the use of local raw materials, are less costly and reduce the environmental costs of shipping, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions generated from transportation. Certified green building materials, such as wood from sustainably managed forest plantations, with accreditations from companies such as the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), or the Pan-European Forest Certification Council (PEFCC), can be used.

Several other types of components and materials can be used in sustainable buildings. Recyclable and recycled materials are commonly used in construction, but it is important that they don’t generate any waste during manufacture or after their life cycle ends. Reclaimed materials such as timber at a construction site or junkyard can be given a second life by reusing them as support beams in a new building or as furniture. Stones from an excavation can be used in a retaining wall. The reuse of these items means that less energy is consumed in making new products and a new natural aesthetic quality is achieved.

'''[[Water recycling]]''' systems such as rainwater tanks that harvest water for multiple purposes. Reusing [[grey water]] generated by households are a useful way of not wasting drinking water.

'''Off-grid homes''' only use clean electric power. They are completely separated and disconnected from the conventional electricity grid and receive their power supply by harnessing active or passive energy systems.

==Active system==
These systems use the principle of harnessing the power generated from renewable and inexhaustible sources of energy, for example; solar, wind, thermal, biomass, and geothermal energy.

'''[[Solar power]]''' is a widely known and used renewable energy source. An increase in technology has allowed solar power to be used in a wide variety of applications. Two types of solar panels generate heat into electricity. Thermal solar panels reduce or eliminate the consumption of gas and diesel, and reduce CO₂ emissions. Photovoltaic panels convert solar radiation into an electric current which can power any appliance. However, this is a more complex technology and is generally more expensive to manufacture than thermal panels.

'''[[Biomass]]''' is the energy source created from organic materials generated through a forced or spontaneous biological process.

'''[[Geothermal energy]]''' is obtained by harnessing heat from the ground. This type of energy can be used to heat and cool homes. It eliminates dependence on external energy and generates minimum waste. It is also hidden from view as it is placed underground, making it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to incorporate in a design.

'''Wind turbines''' are a useful application for areas without immediate conventional power sources, e.g., rural areas with schools and hospitals that need more power. Wind turbines can provide up to 30% of the energy consumed by a household but they are subject to regulations and technical specifications, such as the maximum distance at which the facility is located from the place of consumption and the power required and permitted for each property.

==Passive systems==
Buildings that integrate passive energy systems ([[bioclimatic buildings]]) are heated using non-mechanical methods, thereby optimizing natural resources. The use of optimal daylight plays an integral role in passive energy systems. This involves the positioning and location of a building to allow and make use of sunlight throughout the whole year. By using the sun's rays, thermal mass is stored into the building materials such as concrete and can generate enough heat for a room.

A '''[[green roof]]''' is a roof partially or completely covered with plants or other vegetation. This creates insulation that helps regulate the building's temperature. It also retains water, providing a water recycling system. It also provides soundproofing.

==In art and decorating==
Recycling has been used in art since the early part of the 20th century, when cubist artist [[Pablo Picasso]] (1881–1973) and [[Georges Braque]] (1882–1963) created collages from newsprints, packaging and other found materials. The "Outside Art" movement is recognized as a genuine expressive art form, and is celebrated because of the materials used and not in spite of them.  The same principle can be used inside the home, where found objects are now displayed with pride and collecting certain objects and materials to furnish a home is now admired rather than looked down upon.

There is a huge demand in Western countries to decorate homes in a "green" style. A lot of effort is placed into recycled product design and the creation of a natural look. This ideal is also a part of developing countries, although their use of recycled and natural products is often based in necessity and wanting to get maximum use out of materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5343">'''Editio Critica Maior (ECM)''' is a critical edition of the Greek New Testament being produced by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (Eng. "Institute for New Testament Textual Research") -which is famous for [[Kurt Aland|Kurt Aland's]] [[Novum Testamentum Graece|'''Nestle-Aland - Novum Testament Graece''']] e.g.- in collaboration with other international institutes. The 'ECM' documents the history of the Greek text through the first millennium on the basis of Greek manuscripts, old translations, and New Testament citations in ancient Christian literature that are of significance to the history of transmission. On the basis of genealogical investigations of the material, first prepared with this completeness, the original text of the [[Greek New Testament]] is reconstructed.
The Editio Critica Maior project is supported by the [[Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities]]. It is to be completed by the year 2030.

== The beginnings ==
Since the founding of the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (INTF) in 1959 by Kurt Aland, manuscripts – some of which had previously been unknown or lost, were traced and photographed, and all known manuscripts were photographed and cataloged. The INTF thus acquired over 90% of the known material on microfilm or photo.

== First evaluation ==
In the mid-1980s, a text program was developed. Uniform texts, which, as is well known, constituted the main part in the transmission of the high-middle age – have been dropped out. After the elimination of these texts, the material that is relevant to the textual history of the first millennium is now available: in addition to the manuscripts of this period, the numerous among later manuscripts, which reflect the older textual history. 
The (still) very high number of relevant manuscripts is gradually transcribed and subjected to a complete text comparison (Vollkollation). The results are recorded in databases. For the first time this allows a computer-assisted exploration of the entire material. Above all, the acquisition of genealogical data is important, which illuminates the textual history and especially its beginnings. 

== The digitization ==
The institute uses digital methods at all levels of its philological work: handwriting is captured in the highest possible quality as digital photos. These photos are the basis for the transcriptions to be made on the computer. Additionally digitized material from other institutes is taken into consideration. The software Collate is then used to prepare the critical edition. 

== The result ==
In 1997 the first installment of this edition was published by [[Barbara Aland]]. The ''Catholic Letters'' and also ''The Acts of the Apostels'' are available printed and digitally (by using the [[New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room]]). In cooperation with the [[International Greek New Testament Project]], the ''Johannesevangelium'' is in preparation. In addition an edition, that has been published in printed form, a digital platform - the [[New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room]] has been developed, which allows online access to all data collected during the work on the ECM. This includes above all the diplomatic transcripts of all the manuscripts used in the ECM and the databases on which the ECM is based on. 
The recent editions of ''Nestle-Aland'' in the 28th edition and the 5th edition of the ''Greek New Testament'' of the ''United Bible Societies'' are in the text after the ECM, as far as it has been published so far.

==Current editions==
The ''Novum Testamentum Graecum Editio Critica Maior'' is published by [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]] (the German Bible Society).

In [[printmaking]], an '''edition''' is a number of prints struck from one plate, usually at the same time. This may be a ''limited edition'', with a fixed number of impressions produced on the understanding that no further impressions (copies) will be produced later, or an ''open edition'' limited only by the number that can be sold or produced before the plate wears. Most modern artists produce only limited editions, normally signed by the artist in pencil, and numbered as say 67/100 to show the unique number of that impression and the total edition size.

== Original or reproduction? ==
An important and often confused distinction is that between editions of original prints, produced in the same medium as the artist worked (e.g., etching, or lithography), and reproduction prints (or paintings), which are photographic reproductions of the original work, essentially in the same category as a picture in a book or magazine, though better printed and on better paper.  These may be marketed as "limited editions" with investment potential (which is rarely realized), and even signed and numbered by the artist. Some knowledge is often required to tell the difference.

== Development of the concept ==
[[File:Rembrandt House Museum, printing studioDSCF7277.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rembrandt House Museum]], printing studio]]

One of the main reasons for the development of printmaking was the desire of artists to make more money from their work by selling multiple copies; printmaking satisfies this motive. The production of multiple copies also tends to reduce production costs and market price when compared to a single or unique image. Until the 19th century, in the period of the [[Old master print]] the concept of an edition did not really apply to prints, unlike books.  Prints were often run off as demand allowed, and often worn-out plates were reworked by the original artist or another, to produce a new [[State (printmaking)|state]]. The art market attempts to distinguish between "lifetime impressions" and "late impressions", which were produced after the death of the artist. This can be done to some extent by the study of the [[paper]] involved, and its [[watermark]], and the condition of the plate as revealed by the printed image.  But it remains a difficult area.   
[[File:Goya - Befreit uns niemand von unseren Fesseln ca 1799.jpeg|thumb|left|180px|[[Aquatint]] by [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]], from the Cycle "[[Los Caprichos]]": Can't Anyone Untie Us?]]
The [[aquatint]]s of [[Goya]], which are done in a technique that wears out quickly on the plate, were the first important prints to be published initially in limited editions, which however were not signed or numbered. In fact the plates survived, and since Goya's death several further editions have been published, showing a progressive and drastic decline in quality of the image, despite some rework. Because of this and other cases, "posthumous editions" produced after the death of an artist, and obviously not signed by him, are usually far less sought after. The plates of later prints are often "cancelled" by defacing the image, with a couple of impressions of the cancelled plate taken to document it. This is now expected by collectors and investors, who want the prints they buy to retain their value.

== Modern practice ==
Prints by artists today may potentially retain their financial value as art (i.e., as an appreciating investment) because they are created by an artistic process rather than by a strictly mechanical one, and may become scarce because the number of multiples is limited. In [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]]'s time, the limit on the size of an edition was practical: a plate degrades through use, putting an upper limit on the number of images to be struck. Plates can be reworked and restored to some degree, but it is generally not possible to create more than a thousand prints from any process except lithography or woodcut. A few hundred is a more practical upper limit, and even that allows for significant variation in the quality of the image. In drypoint, 10 or 20 may be the maximum number of top-quality impressions possible.

Today, artists will sometimes refer to a print as a "one-off," meaning that the artist has made a unique print and no reproductions of it from the original matrix, often not even a proof. In this category one sometimes finds monotypes, monoprints, collagraphs, altered prints with collage or chine colle additions, or even hand-colored prints. There remain artists who are strong advocates of "artist's prints" which are conceived, printed, signed, and given the edition number 1/1 by the artist. One contemporary printmaker says that she believes that "there is a natural sequence of actions and thoughts which cannot be approximated by the substitution of an artist/printer collaboration unless the artist is truly involved with the printer or assistant in every step of the decision-making and mark-making processes." &lt;ref&gt;Mitzi Humphrey, ''In Search of the Meandering Absolute: The Prints of Mitzi Humphrey''. Thesis (M.F.A.)Department of Painting and Printmaking,Virginia Commonwealth University, 1997. p.1, Abstract, 64 pp. https://www.worldcat.org/title/in-search-of-the-meandering-absolute-the-prints-of-mitzi-humphrey/oclc/41232924&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numbering ==
Because of the variation in quality, lower-numbered prints in an edition are sometimes favored as superior, especially with older works where the image was struck until the plate wore out. However the numbering of impressions in fact may well not equate at all to the sequence in which they were printed, and may often be the reverse of it.

In later times, printmakers recognized the value of limiting the size of an edition and including the volume of the edition in the print number (e.g., "15/30" for the 15th print in an edition of 30). Tight controls on the process to limit or eliminate variation in quality have become the norm. In [[monotyping]], a technique where only two impressions at most can be taken, prints may be numbered 1/1, or marked "unique". Artists usually print an edition much smaller than the plate allows, both for marketing reasons and to keep the edition comfortably within the lifespan of the plate. Specific steps may also be taken to strengthen the plate, such as electroplating [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] images, which uses an electric process to put a very thin coat of a stronger metal onto a plate of a weaker metal. 

The conventions for numbering prints are well-established, but other marks may indicate that a print has been made in addition to the numbered prints of an edition. [[Artist's proof]]s are marked "A. P." or "P/A", sometimes E. A. or E. d'A. (épreuve d'artiste); monoprints and uniquely hand-altered prints are marked "unique"; prints that are given to someone or are for some reason unsuitable for sale are marked "H. C." or "H/C", meaning "hors de commerce", not for sale. These are usually prints reserved for the publisher, like Artist's Proofs.  The printer is also often allowed to retain some proof impressions; these are marked "P. P." Finally, a master image may be printed against which the members of the edition are compared for quality: these are marked as "bon à tirer" or "BAT" ("good to print" in French). In all, the number of the main edition can represent 50% or less of the total number of good impressions taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Terms: Printmaking|url=http://www.artcellarexchange.com/glossary_printmaking.html|publisher=Art Cellar Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional artist printmakers will sometimes limit an edition to several [[artist's proof]] copies, including a "bon a tirer" print and then one unique copy designated as a "[[one-off]]" or "1/1" or "one/off".

==Consumer protection laws==
California became the first state to regulate the sale of limited edition art prints with the "California Print Law" of 1971. The state of Illinois later expanded on the California statute. However, it was not until 1986 that more comprehensive provisions, still in place today, were enacted with the passage of the "Georgia Print Law". That law became the template for statutes subsequently enacted by other states.

The '''Georgia Print Law''' written by (former) State Representative [[Chesley V. Morton]], became effective July 1, 1986. The law requires art dealers, artists, or auctioneers to supply information to prospective purchasers about the nature of the print, the number of prints and editions (including HC editions) produced, and the involvement (if any) of the artist in the creation of the print. The penalty for violation of the law ranges from simple reimbursement to treble damages, in the case of a willful violation. Those found to be in violation of the law are also liable for court costs, expenses, and attorney fees. The law applies to works of art valued at more than $100.00 (not including frame). Charitable organizations are specifically exempt from the provision of the law.  The statute of limitations is one year after discovery, and, if discovery of the violation is not made within three years of the sale, then the purchaser’s remedies are extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artsgeorgia.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ga-Limited-Edition-Reproduction-Act.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617081914/http://artsgeorgia.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ga-Limited-Edition-Reproduction-Act.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of flower arrangement''' dates back to [[ancient Egyptian]] times.

== The Ancient Egyptians ==
The earliest known flower arranging dates back to ancient Egypt.  Egyptians were decorating with flowers as early as 2,500 BCE.  They regularly placed cut flowers in [[vase]]s,&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/210629/floral-decoration, Encyclopædia Britannica,  "Floral decoration," retrieved 15 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  and highly stylized arrangements were used during burials, for processions, and simply as table decorations. Illustrations of arranged flowers have been found on Egyptian carved stone reliefs and painted wall decorations.

Flowers were selected according to symbolic meaning, with emphasis on religious significance.  The [[lotus flower]] or [[Nelumbo|water lily]], for example, was considered sacred to [[Isis]] and was often included in arrangements.  Many other flowers have been found in the tombs of the ancient Egyptians, and [[garlands]] of flowers were worn by loved ones and left at the tombs.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060629-egypt-flowers.html, John Roach, National Geographic News, "Ancient Flowers Found in Egypt Coffin", 29 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  These included blue [[scilla]], poppy-flowered [[anemone]], ''[[Iris sibirica]]'', [[delphinium]], [[narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], [[palm tree]], [[papyrus]] and [[rose]].&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; Egyptian wall paintings depicting roses have been found in tombs dating from the fifth century B.C. to Cleopatra’s time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.flowermonthclub.com/flower-history|title=History of Flowers - Fresh Flower Facts {{!}} Flower of the Month Club|work=The Fresh Cut Flower of the Month Club|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The Ancient Greeks and Romans ==
The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] also used flowers. The ancient Greeks used flowers and herbs for adornment and decorations included in artwork. They did not often use vases, focusing instead on [[garlands]] and [[wreaths]]. They would place plant material, such as olive branches, in terracotta. The leafy branches were probably used for weddings. They also tossed petals onto floors and beds. Like the Egyptians, the Greeks and Romans had preferences for the flowers and foliage they used.

The most popular foliage used by the Greeks and the Romans were [[acorn]]s, [[oak]] leaves, [[Bay Laurel|laurel]], [[ivy]], [[bay]]{{clarify|date=August 2018}} and [[parsley]]. [[Laurel wreath]]s were presented to winners of athletic competitions in the ancient [[Olympics]]; these wreaths were also awarded to individuals winning competition in poetic meets, while in Rome they symbolized a military victory and crowned the successful commander in honor of his triumph. The garland wreath was a symbol to the Greeks of power, honor, allegiance, dedication; it was awarded in honor of athletes, poets, civic leaders, soldier, and heroes.

The preferred flowers include roses, [[hyacinths]], [[honeysuckle]], [[Violet (plant)|violets]], and [[lilies]].  Other flowers such as [[tulips]], [[Consolida|larkspur]], and [[Tagetes|marigold]]s were also selected for their shape, color, and form.

Wealth and power led the Romans and Greeks to the greater luxury in the use of flowers which, like the Egyptian, were used in religious rites. At banquets, roses were strewn on the floor to a depth of one foot, and the flowers "rained" from the ceiling. The fragrance of so many roses was almost suffocating. The Romans used the roses at many meals and because of its overwhelming fragrance it{{vague|date=February 2014}} was known as the "Hour of Rose". 

== Ancient China ==
The Chinese were making flower arrangements as far back as 207 BCE to 220 CE, in the [[Han Dynasty|Han era of ancient China]].  Flowers were an integral component of religious teaching and medicine.

Practitioners of [[Buddhist|Buddhism]], [[Taoist|Taoism]], and [[Confucian]]ism placed cut flowers on their altars, a practice which dates back to 618-906 CE.  They created paintings, carvings, and embroidered items with depictions of flowers.  The paintings can be found on vases, plates, scrolls, and silk, while carvings were done on wood, bronze, jade and ivory.

Buddhist teachings forbade the taking of a life, so religious practitioners worked sparingly when taking cuttings from plants.  Flowers and leaves that were used to make basket arrangements were selected based on their symbolic meaning.  For example, the [[bamboo]], the [[peach]] tree, and the [[pear]] tree symbolized [[longevity]].  The [[wikt:tiger lily|tiger lily]], the [[pomegranate]], and the [[orchid]] symbolized [[fertility]].  The most honored of all flowers was the [[peony]].  Considered the “king of flowers”, it symbolized wealth, good fortune, and high status.

During the period 500CE to 1453CE, the [[Byzantine Empire]] made its contribution to floral arrangements, which typically included a cone shape design.  The foliage was placed in [[chalice]]s and [[urn]]s, which were further decorated with brightly colored flowers and fruit.  Flowers commonly included in these arrangements were [[Bellis perennis|daisies]], lilies, [[cypress]], [[carnations]], and [[pine]].  Ribbons were also commonly used, and leaves and tiny flowers were set in arching lines to give an twisted effect to garlands.

== Flower arranging reaches Europe ==
Flower arranging arrived in [[Europe]] around 1000 CE, and was particularly popular in churches and monasteries where flowers and plants were used for food as well as for decoration.  As [[crusade]]rs came back from the [[Middle East]], they brought with them new and interesting plants.  As a result, European countries began experimenting with plants that were previously unknown to them.

'''MIDDLE AGES (''AD 476–1400'')'''

During this era, monks were known for having gardens with herbs and wildflowers. In the later part of the Gothic period flowers reached a more dominant role, such as flowers beginning to blossom in altar pictures, manuscripts, and paintings.

An important aspect of the monastery plan was to include a medicinal herb garden, which would “furnish the physician with the pharmaceutical products needed for his cures. A dependence on the power of herbs without reference to their Creator [God] was, however, regarded as improper for a Christian” [12]. Because God “causes herbs to grow,” their medical utility is fundamentally spiritual [13]. In addition, many plants were used by monks and Christians in general in sacred rituals and ceremonies. They often had associations appealing to spiritual bases as well as to medicinal effects.

'''RENAISSANCE(''AD 1400–1600'')'''

The flower design started in Italy and grew through Europe. Paintings of impressive floral arrangements in vases were popular. In the paintings, fruit blossoms and leaves were woven into garlands to decorate walls and vaulted ceilings, and petals were piled into baskets or strewn on the floors, streets, or allowed to float down from balconies.

'''BAROQUE ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1775'')'''

At the beginning of this period floral designs were symmetrical and oval-shaped, with asymmetric crescents and S-shapes becoming popular later on.{{when|date=February 2014}}

'''DUTCH'''–'''FLEMISH ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1750'')'''

The baroque arrangements in the Dutch-Flemish style were more compact and proportioned. Their major characteristic was the variety of flowers within the bouquet.

'''FRENCH ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1814'')'''

During the French Baroque period, a soft, almost fragile appeal became a major characteristic of floral design. Arrangements were asymmetrical using the C-crescent or the S-shape. In the empire period they used simple lines in triangle shapes and strong color contrast. The typical empire design would be arranged in an urn containing an abundance of large richly colored flowers.

'''GEORGIAN ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1714–1760'')'''

The designs in this period were formal and symmetrical and often tightly arranged with a variety of flowers. Oriental design became influential due to active trading. At the end of the period the designs became more informal due to the fact that the fragrance of the flowers, which were believed to rid the air of diseases, became more important. Small, handheld arrangements called [[nosegays]] or tussie-mussies were used to carry sweet scents, and also helped mask the odors of society where bathing was often believed to be unhealthy.

'''VICTORIAN ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1820–1901'')'''

Flowers were considered fashionable in this period. Large mass flowers were placed tightly into containers to create compact arrangements that were asymmetrical and stacked tightly. There was no definite style, but many different flowers and colours  made the arrangement look almost unplanned. The tussie-mussie bouquets were still serving to eliminate odors. At the end of this period attempts were made to set up rules for a proper arranging of flowers, which is when it became an artful skill or profession in Europe.

The [[Italian Renaissance]] helped to give an extra spark to the art of flower arranging in Europe. It was during this time period that a wide variety of arrangement styles began to develop. By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, flower arrangements were commonplace and a wide variety of materials were used to make containers, including [[marble]], heavy [[Venetian glass]], and [[bronze]].

Flower arrangements made during this time introduced a whole new element&amp;nbsp;– the usage of tropical fruits. These arrangements also focused on creating colour contrast. Some of the popular flowers included the Lilium Candidum (or Madonna Lily, used as a symbol for fertility and chastity), narcissus, pinks, iris, [[jasmine]], [[pansies]], French marigolds, [[cornflowers]], and [[rosemary]].

The '''history of [[printing]]''' starts as early as 3500 BCE, when the Persian and Mesopotamian civilizations used [[cylinder seal]]s to certify documents written in clay. Other early forms include block seals, pottery imprints and cloth printing. [[Woodblock printing]] on paper originated in China around 200 CE. It led to the development of [[movable type]] in the eleventh century and the spread of book production in East Asia. Woodblock printing was also used in Europe, but it was in the fifteenth century that European printers combined movable type and [[alphabet]]ic scripts to create an economical book publishing industry. This industry enabled the communication of ideas and sharing of knowledge on an unprecedented scale. Alongside the development of text printing, new and lower-cost methods of image reproduction were developed, including [[lithography]], [[screen printing]] and [[photocopying]].

Stencils may have been used to colour cloth for a very long time; the technique probably reached its peak of sophistication in [[Katazome]] and other techniques used on silks for clothes during the [[Edo period]] in Japan.  In Europe, from about 1450 they were commonly used to colour [[old master print]]s printed in black and white, usually [[woodcut]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hyatt Mayor|Mayor, Hyatt A.]], ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 51, 65, 80, {{ISBN|0691003262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was especially the case with playing-cards, which continued to be coloured by stencil long after most other subjects for prints were left in black and white.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hyatt Mayor|Mayor, Hyatt A.]], ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 15, {{ISBN|0691003262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stencils were used for mass publications, as the type did not have to be hand-written.

== Seals == 
[[File:King of Na gold seal.jpg|thumb|The [[King of Na gold seal]], bestowed by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] to Wana (Yayoi Japan) in 57 AD.]]

In China seals were used since at least the [[Shang dynasty]]. In the [[Western Zhou]], sets of seal stamps were encased in blocks of type and used on clay moulds for casting bronzes. By the end of the 3rd century BC seals were also used for printing on pottery. In the Northern dynasties textual sources contain references to wooden seals with up to 120 characters.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

The seals had a religious element to them. [[Daoists]] used seals as healing devices by impressing therapeutic characters onto the flesh of sick people. They were also used to stamp food, creating a talismanic character to ward off disease. The first evidence of these practices appeared under a Buddhist context in the mid 5th century. Centuries later seals were used to create hundreds of Buddha images.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

== Stone and bronze blocks ==
Stone and bronze blocks have been used to print fabric. Archaeological evidence of them have been unearthed at [[Mawangdui]] and in the tomb of the King of [[Nanyue]], while block printed fabrics have been discovered at Mashan zhuanchang in [[Jiangling County|Jiangling]], [[Hubei]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

In the 4th century the practice of creating paper rubbings of stone carvings such as calligraphic models and texts took hold. Among the earliest evidence of this is a stone inscription cut in mirror image from the early 6th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

{{Main|Woodblock printing}}

Woodblock printing (''diaoban yinshua'' 雕版印刷), known as xylography today, was the first method of printing applied to a paper medium. It became widely used throughout [[East Asia]] both as a method for printing on [[textile]]s and later, under the influence of [[Buddhism]], on [[paper]]. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from [[China]] date to about 220. ''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' is the best known type of [[Japan]]ese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique on paper are covered by the term [[woodcut]] (see below), except for the [[woodblock printing#Block-books in fifteenth century Europe|block-books]] produced mainly in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Printing Timeline|url=https://printinghistory.org/timeline/|website=American Printing History Association: To Encourage the Study of Printing History|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legendary origins===
According to southern Chinese histories, during the 480s, a man named Gong Xuanxuan styled himself Gong the Sage and 'said that a supernatural being had given him a "jade seal jade block writing," which did not require a brush: one blew on the paper and characters formed.'{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=60}} He then used his powers to mystify a local governor. Eventually he was dealt with by the governor's successor, who presumably executed Gong.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=50}} Timothy Hugh Barrett postulates that Gong's magical jade block was actually a printing device, and Gong was one of the first, if not the first printer. The semi-mythical record of him therefore describes his usage of the printing process to deliberately bewilder onlookers and create an image of mysticism around himself.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=61}}

===In the Sinosphere===
{{Main|History of printing in East Asia}}

The rise of printing was greatly influenced by [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. According to Mahayana beliefs, religious texts hold intrinsic value for carrying the Buddha's word and act as talismanic objects containing sacred power capable of warding off evil spirits. By copying and preserving these texts, Buddhists could accrue personal merit. As a consequence the idea of printing and its advantages in replicating texts quickly became apparent to Buddhists, who by the 7th century, were using woodblocks to create apotropaic documents. These Buddhist texts were printed specifically as ritual items and were not widely circulated or meant for public consumption. Instead they were buried in consecrated ground. The earliest extant example of this type of printed matter is a fragment of a dhāraṇī (Buddhist spell) miniature scroll written in Sanskrit unearthed in a tomb in [[Xi'an]]. It is called the ''Great spell of unsullied pure light'' (''Wugou jingguang da tuoluoni jing'' 無垢淨光大陀羅尼經) and was printed using woodblock during the Tang dynasty, c. 650-670.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}} A similar piece, the ''Saddharma pundarika'' sutra, was also discovered and dated to 690 to 699.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pan |first=Jixing |title=On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |year=1997 |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=976–981 [pp. 979–980] |issn=1001-6538 |doi=10.1007/BF02882611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincides with the reign of [[Wu Zetian]], under which the [[Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra]], which advocates the practice of printing apotropaic and merit making texts and images, was translated by Chinese monks.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

Evidence of woodblock printing appeared in Korea and Japan soon afterward. [[The Great Dharani Sutra]] ({{lang-ko|무구정광대다라니경|translit=Muggujeonggwang Daedharanigyeong [[Hanja]]: 無垢淨光大陀羅尼經}}) was discovered at [[Bulguksa]], [[South Korea]] in 1966 and dated between 704 and 751 in the era of [[Later Silla]]. The document is printed on a {{convert|8|x|630|cm|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Paper Mulberry|mulberry]] paper scroll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/7.htm North Korea&amp;nbsp;— Silla Countrystudies.us] accessed 2009-12-03; [http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-yosz.htm ''A History of Writings in Japanese and Current Studies in the Field of Rare Books in Japan''] - 62nd IFLA General Conference, Ifla.org, accessed 009-12-03; [http://www.rightreading.com/printing/gutenberg.asia/gutenberg-asia-9-korea.htm ''Gutenberg and the Koreans: The Invention of Movable Metal Type Printing in Korea''], Rightreading.com, 2006-09-13, accessed 2009-12-03; [http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000594295&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002187369&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;Menu_code=0000008846&amp;sub_menu= Cho Woo-suk, ''JoongAng Daily''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081555/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000594295&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002187369&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;Menu_code=0000008846&amp;sub_menu= |date=2011-07-19 }}, November 22, 2004, Eng.buddhapia.com, accessed 2009-12-03; [http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/newinfo/Culresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=11,01260600,37&amp;queryText=V_KDCD=11 National Treasure No. 126-6], by the Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea (in Korean), jikimi.cha.go.kr, accessed 2009-12-28; [https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+world+history:+ancient,+medieval,+and+modern%22+by+Peter+N.+Stearns&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y5dGg9u9uJ&amp;sig=u9uP_DdhfHi8qza6fEK1KldlhQM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=upboTP3MK8Kblge0-6nWCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false National Treasure No. 126-6, by the Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea (in Korean)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/hightours/diamsutra/index.html The Xiantong era (咸通 Xián tōng) ran from 860-74, crossing the reigns of Yi Zong (懿宗 Yì zōng) and Xi Zong (僖宗 Xī zōng), see [[List of Tang Emperors]]. The book was thus prepared in the time of [[Yi Zong]].&lt;/ref&gt; A dhāraṇī sutra was printed in Japan around AD 770. One million copies of the sutra, along with other prayers, were ordered to be produced by [[Empress Shōtoku]]. As each copy was then stored in a tiny wooden pagoda, the copies are together known as the ''[[Hyakumantō Darani]]'' (百万塔陀羅尼, "1,000,000 towers/pagodas Darani").{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

The oldest extant evidence of woodblock prints created for the purpose of reading are portions of the [[Lotus Sutra]] discovered at [[Turpan]] in 1906. They have been dated to the reign of Wu Zetian using character form recognition.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

The oldest text containing a specific date of printing was discovered in the [[Mogao Caves]] of [[Dunhuang]] in 1907 by [[Aurel Stein]]. This copy of the [[Diamond Sutra]] is 14 feet long and contains a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] at the inner end, which reads: ''Reverently [caused to be] made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [i.e. 11 May, AD 868 ]''. It is considered the world's oldest securely-dated woodblock scroll.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

The Diamond sutra was closely followed by the earliest extant printed almanac, the ''Qianfu sinian lishu'' (乾符四年曆書), dated to 877.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

From 932 to 955 the [[Thirteen Classics|Twelve Classics]] and an assortment of other texts were printed. During the [[Song dynasty]], the Directorate of education and other agencies used these block prints to disseminate their standardized versions of the ''Classics''. Other disseminated works include the ''Histories'', philosophical works, encyclopedias, collections, and books on medicine and the art of war.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

In 971 work began on the complete [[Tripiṭaka]] Buddhist Canon (''Kaibao zangshu'' 開寶藏書) in [[Chengdu]]. It took 10 years to finish the 130,000 blocks needed to print the text. The finished product, the [[Sichuan]] edition of the ''Kaibao canon'', also known as the ''Kaibao Tripitaka'', was printed in 983.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}

In 989 [[Seongjong of Goryeo]] sent the monk Yeoga to request from the Song a copy of the complete Buddhist canon. The request was granted in 991 when Seongjong's official Han Eongong visited the Song court.&lt;ref&gt;https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/24231/Hyun_washington_0250E_12384.pdf?sequence=1 p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1011, [[Hyeonjong of Goryeo]] issued the carving of their own set of the Buddhist canon, which would come to be known as the ''[[Goryeo Daejanggyeong]]''. The project was suspended in 1031 after Heyongjong's death, but work resumed again in 1046 after [[Munjong of Goryeo|Munjong]]'s accession to the throne. The completed work, amounting to some 6,000 volumes, was finished in 1087. Unfortunately the original set of woodblocks was destroyed in a conflagration during the [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongol invasion]] of 1232. King [[Gojong of Goryeo|Gojong]] ordered another set to be created and work began in 1237, this time only taking 12 years to complete. In 1248 the complete ''[[Goryeo Daejanggyeong]]'' numbered 81,258 printing blocks, 52,330,152 characters, 1496 titles, and 6568 volumes. Due to the stringent editing process that went into the ''Goryeo Daejanggyeong'' and its surprisingly enduring nature, having survived completely intact over 760 years, it is considered the most accurate of Buddhist canons written in [[Classical Chinese]] as well as a standard edition for East Asian Buddhist scholarship.&lt;ref name="Memory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Printing woodblocks of the Tripitaka Koreana and miscellaneous Buddhist scriptures|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/printing-woodblocks-of-the-tripitaka-koreana-and-miscellaneous-buddhist-scriptures/|website=UNESCO Memory of the World|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact of woodblock printing====
Prior to the introduction of printing, the size of private collections in China had already seen an increase since the invention of paper. Fan Ping (215-84) had in his collection 7,000 rolls (''juan''), or a few hundred titles. Two centuries later, Zhang Mian owned 10,000 ''juan'', [[Shen Yue]] (441-513) 20,000 ''juan'', and [[Xiao Tong]] and his cousin Xiao Mai both had collections of 30,000 ''juan''. [[Emperor Yuan of Liang]] (508-555) was said to have had a collection of 80,000 ''juan''. The combined total of all known private book collectors prior to the Song dynasty number around 200, with the Tang alone accounting for 60 of them.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=930}}

Following the maturation of woodblock printing, official, commercial, and private publishing businesses emerged while the size and number of collections grew exponentially. The Song dynasty alone accounts for some 700 known private collections, more than triple the number of all the preceding centuries combined. Private libraries of 10-20,000 ''juan'' became commonplace while six individuals owned collections of over 30,000 ''juan''. The earliest extant private Song library catalogue lists 1,937 titles in 24,501 ''juan''. Zhou Mi's collection numbered 42,000 ''juan'', Chen Zhensun's collection lists 3,096 titles in 51,180 ''juan'', and [[Ye Mengde]] (1077-1148) as well as one other individual owned libraries of 6,000 titles in 100,000 ''juan''. The majority of which were secular in nature. Texts contained material such as medicinal instruction or came in the form of a ''[[leishu]]'' (類書), a type of encyclopedic reference book used to help [[imperial examinations|examination]] candidates.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910}}{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=930}}

Imperial establishments such as the Three Institutes: Zhaowen Institute, History Institute, and Jixian Institute also followed suit. At the start of the dynasty the Three Institutes' holdings numbered 13,000 ''juan'', by the year 1023 39,142 ''juan'', by 1068 47,588 ''juan'', and by 1127 73,877 ''juan''. The Three Institutes were one of several imperial libraries, with eight other major palace libraries, not including imperial academies.{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=43}} According to Weng Tongwen, by the 11th century, central government offices were saving tenfold by substituting earlier manuscripts with printed versions.{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=21}} The impact of woodblock printing on Song society is illustrated in the following exchange between [[Emperor Zhenzong]] and Xing Bing in the year 1005:

{{quotation|The emperor went to the Directorate of Education to inspect the Publications Office. He asked Xing Bing how many woodblocks were kept there. Bing replied, "At the start of our dynasty, there were fewer than four thousand. Today, there are more than one hundred thousand. The classics and histories, together with standard commentaries, are all fully represented. When I was young and devoted myself to learning, there were only one or two scholars in every hundred who possessed copies of all the classics and commentaries. There was no way to copy so many works. Today, printed editions of these works are abundant, and officials and commoners alike have them in their homes. Scholars are fortunate indeed to have been born in such an era as ours!{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=33}}}}

In 1076, the 39 year old [[Su Shi]] remarked upon the unforeseen effect an abundance of books had on examination candidates:

{{quotation|I can recall meeting older scholars, long ago, who said that when they were young they had a hard time getting their hands on a copy of ''Shiji'' or ''Han shu''. If they were lucky enough to get one, they thought nothing of copying the entire text out by hand, so they could recite it day and night. In recent years merchants engrave and print all manner of books belonging to the hundred schools, and produce ten thousand pages a day. With books so readily available, you would think that students' writing and scholarship would be many times better than what they were in earlier generations. Yet, to the contrary, young men and examination candidates leave their books tied shut and never look at them, preferring to amuse themselves with baseless chatter. Why is this?{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=38}}}}

Woodblock printing also changed the shape and structure of books. Scrolls were gradually replaced by concertina binding (經摺裝) from the Tang period onward. The advantage was that it was now possible to flip to a reference without unfolding the entire document. The next development known as whirlwind binding (''xuanfeng zhuang'' 旋風裝) was to secure the first and last leaves to a single large sheet, so that the book could be opened like an accordion.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=912}}

Around the year 1000, butterfly binding was developed. Woodblock prints allowed two mirror images to be easily replicated on a single sheet. Thus two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a [[codex]] with alternate openings of printed and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the sewn bindings were preferred rather than pasted bindings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |title=Dunhuang concertina binding findings |accessdate=2000-03-09 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000309034110/http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |archivedate=2000-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only relatively small volumes (''[[:wiktionary:菤|juan 卷]]'') were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a ''tao'', with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close up the book when not in use. For example, one complete Tripitaka had over 6,400 ''juan'' in 595 ''tao''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nb.no/baser/schoyen/5/5.18/#2540 ]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the productive effect of woodblock printing, historian Endymion Wilkinson notes that it never supplanted handwritten manuscripts. Indeed, manuscripts remained dominant until the very end of Imperial China:

{{quotation|As a result of block-printing technology, it became easier and cheaper to produce multiple copies of books quickly. By the eleventh century, the price of books had fallen by about one tenth what they had been before and as a result they were more widely disseminated. Nevertheless, even in the fifteenth century most books in major libraries were still in manuscript, not in print. Almost to the end of the empire it remained cheaper to pay a copyist than to buy a printed book. Seven hundred and fifty years after the first imperially sponsored printed works in the Northern Song, the greatest book project of the eighteenth century, the ''[[Siku quanshu]]'' 四庫全書, was produced as a manuscript, not as a printed collection. About 4 percent of it was printed in movable type in 1773, but it was hand-carved movable wooden type. Indeed, the entire collection was only printed for the first time in the 1980s. Access to books, especially large works, such as the ''Histories'', remained difficult right into the twentieth century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=910-911}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

Not only did manuscripts remain competitive with imprints, they were even ''preferred'' by elite scholars and collectors. The age of printing gave the act of copying by hand a new dimension of cultural reverence. Those who considered themselves real scholars and true connoisseurs of the book did not consider imprints to be real books. Under the elitist attitudes of the time, "printed books were for those who did not truly care about books."{{sfn|Chia|2011|p=41}}

However it should be noted that copyists and manuscript only continued to remain competitive with printed editions by dramatically reducing their price. According to the [[Ming dynasty]] author [[Hu Yinglin]], "if no printed edition were available on the market, the hand-copied manuscript of a book would cost ten times as much as the printed work,"{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} also "once a printed edition appeared, the transcribed copy could no longer be sold and would be discarded."{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} The result is that despite the mutual co-existence of hand-copied manuscripts and printed texts, the cost of the book had declined by about 90 percent by the end of the 16th century.{{sfn|Tsien|1985|p=373}} As a result, literacy increased. In 1488, the [[Koreans|Korean]] [[Choe Bu]] observed during his trip to China that "even village children, ferrymen, and sailors" could read, although this applied mainly to the south while northern China remained largely illiterate.{{sfn|Twitchett|1998b|p=636}}

===In India===
Nine inscribed copper plates thought to belong to the mature [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan]] phase (2600 - 1900 BCE), are thought to be used for printing.&lt;ref&gt;Shinde, V. &amp; Willis, R.J., (2014).

In Buddhism, great merit is thought to accrue from copying and preserving texts. The 4th-century{{Fix|text=which?}} master{{Fix|text=who?}} listed the copying of scripture as the first of ten essential religious practices. The importance of perpetuating texts is set out with special force in the [[Infinite Life Sutra|longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra]], which urges the devout not only to hear, learn, remember and study the text but to obtain a good copy and to preserve it. This "cult of the book" led to techniques for reproducing texts in great numbers, especially the short prayers or charms known as ''dhāraṇīs''. Stamps were carved for printing these prayers on clay tablets from at least the 7th century, the date of the oldest surviving examples.&lt;ref&gt;Zwalf, ''Buddhism: Art and Faith'' (London: British Museum, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe===
{{see also|History of Western typography}}
Printing with a press was practiced in Christian Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate, and when [[paper]] became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small [[woodcut]] religious images and [[playing cards]] printed on paper. These [[old master print|prints]] were produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onwards.&lt;ref name="Reference A"&gt;An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, p ?, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}

Around the mid-century, ''block-books'', woodcut books with both text and images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to manuscripts and books printed with [[movable type]]. These were all short heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the [[Ars moriendi]] and the [[Biblia pauperum]] were the most common. There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, the majority view, followed the introduction of movable type, with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440–1460.&lt;ref name="Reference B"&gt;Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movable type (1041)==

{{Main|Movable type}}
{{See also|History of typography in East Asia}}

'''Movable type''' is the system of [[printing]] and [[typography]] using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] struck by [[punchcutting|letterpunches]].

===Ceramic movable-type===
Movable-type was invented in the [[Northern Song dynasty]] around the year 1041 by the commoner [[Bi Sheng]]. Bi Sheng's movable-type was fired in [[porcelain]]. After his death, the ceramic movable-type passed onto his descendants. The next mention of movable-type occurred in 1193 when a Southern Song chief counselor, Zhou Bida (周必大), attributed the movable-type method of printing to [[Shen Kuo]]. However Shen Kuo did not invent the movable-type but credited it to Bi Sheng in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]''. The ceramic movable-type was also mentioned by [[Kublai Khan]]'s councilor [[Yao Shu]], who convinced his pupil [[Yang Gu]] to print language primers using this method.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

===Wooden movable type===
Bi Sheng also developed wooden movable type, but it was abandoned in favor of ceramic types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name="tsien"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsien|first=Tsuen-Hsuin|authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin|title=Paper and Printing|volume=vol. 5 part 1|series=Needham, Joseph ''Science and Civilization in China:''|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|ISBN= 0-521-08690-6|pages=201–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shen Kua: Dream Pool Essay&lt;/ref&gt; However wooden movable type had evidently reached the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] [[Western Xia]] to the west by the 12th century. There, the Tanguts printed the [[Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union]], a 449-page text considered to be the earliest extant example of a text printed using the wooden movable type.&lt;ref name="beijing-daily"&gt;{{Cite news |author1 = Hou Jianmei (侯健美) |author2 = Tong Shuquan (童曙泉) |title = 《大夏寻踪》今展国博 |trans-title='In the Footsteps of the Great Xia' now exhibiting at the National Museum |newspaper = [[Beijing Daily]] (《北京日报》) |date = 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wang Zhen (inventor)|Wang Zhen]], who lived in the [[Yuan dynasty]], also described the wooden movable type in his ''Book of Agriculture'' (''Nongshu'' 農書) of 1313.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

{{quotation|Now, however, there is another method [beyond earthenware type] that is both more exact and more convenient. A compositor's form is made of wood, strips of bamboo are used to mark the lines and a block is engraved with characters. The block is then cut into squares with a small fine saw till each character forms a separate piece. These separate characters are finished off with a knife on all four sides, and compared and tested till they are exactly the same height and size. Then the types are placed in the columns [of the form] and bamboo strips which have been prepared are pressed in between them. After the types have all been set in the form, the spaces are filled in with wooden plugs, so that the type is perfectly firm and will not move. When the type is absolutely firm, the ink is smeared on and printing begins.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 206 207"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 206-207.&lt;/ref&gt;|Wang Zhen}}

Wang Zhen used two rotating circular tables as trays for laying out his type. The first table was separated into 24 trays in which each movable type was categorized based on a number corresponding with a rhyming pattern. The second table contained miscellaneous characters.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

Using more than 30,000 wooden movable types, Wang Zhen printed a hundred copies of his county gazetteer, ''Records of Jingde County'' (''Jingde xianzhi'' 旌德縣志), a text containing more than 60,000 characters.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

Wooden movable type printing became relatively common during the [[Ming dynasty]] and became widespread during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing era]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}}

===Metal movable type===
[[File:SelectedTeachingsofBuddhistSagesandSonMasters1377.jpg|thumb|''Jikji'', ''Selected Teachings of Buddhist Sages and Seon Masters'', the earliest known book printed with movable metal type, 1377. [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]], Paris.]]

[[File:Beijing.Musee imprimerie.caracteres mobiles.Bisheng.jpg|thumb|Models of Bi Sheng's revolving typecase tables.]]

Metal movable type appeared in the late Song and Yuan. Bronze movable types were used to print [[banknotes]] and official documents by both the Song and [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]].&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, ''A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001'', pp. 41-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Jin dynasty, copper-block prints were slotted with two square holes for embedding bronze movable type characters, each selected from 1000 different characters, such that each printed paper money had a different combination of markers. A copper block printed paper banknote dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters: one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'', for the purpose of preventing counterfeit. Over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole; apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of [[Song dynasty]] money of the same period in the collection of [[Shanghai Museum]] has two empty square holes above ''Ziliao'' as well as ''Zihou'', due to the loss of two copper movable types.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Moveable Type Printing in China'', by Pan Jixing, Professor of the Institute for History of Science, Academy of Science, Beijing, China, English Abstract, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal movable type was received more positively in Korea where its methods were understood sometime before 1232 under [[Goryeo]]. The oldest known book to have been printed by using cast metal type is the ''Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun'', by [[Choe Yun-ui]], in 1234.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=Hye Ok | date=July 2014 |title=The History of Pre-Gutenberg Woodblock and Movable Type Printing in Korea |trans-title= |url=http://www.ijhssnet.com/journals/Vol_4_No_9_1_July_2014/2.pdf |language=English |journal=International Journal of Humanities and Social Science |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages= |doi= |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all 50 original volumes of the book seem to have been lost.

Tin movable type is mentioned in Wang Zhen's ''Zao Huozi Yinshufa'' (造活字印書法) of 1298, but it was considered unsatisfactory due to incompatibility with the inking process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of movable type in the Sinosphere===
Movable type printing was hardly used for the first 300 years after its invention by Bi Sheng. Even in Korea where metal movable type was most widespread, it still never replaced woodblock printing. Indeed, even the promulgation of [[Hangeul]] was done through woodblock prints. The general assumption is that movable type did not replace block printing in places that used Chinese characters due to the expense of producing more than 200,000 individual pieces of type. Even woodblock printing was not as cost productive as simply paying a copyist to write out a book by hand if there was no intention of producing more than a few copies. Although [[Sejong the Great]] introduced Hangeul, an alphabetic system, in the 15th century, Hangeul only replaced [[Hanja]] in the 20th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=911}} And unlike China, the movable type system was kept mainly within the confines of a highly stratified elite Korean society:

{{quotation|Korean printing with movable metallic type developed mainly within the royal foundry of the Yi dynasty. Royalty kept a monopoly of this new technique and by royal mandate suppressed all non-official printing activities and any budding attempts at commercialization of printing. Thus, printing in early Korea served only the small, noble groups of the highly stratified society.&lt;ref&gt;Sohn, Pow-Key, "Early Korean Printing," ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 79, No. 2 (April -June , 1959), pp.&amp;nbsp;96-103 (103).&lt;/ref&gt;|Sohn Pow-Key}}

Only during the Ming and Qing dynasties did wooden and metal movable types see any considerable use, but the preferred method remained woodblock. Usage of movable type in China never exceeded 10 percent of all printed materials while 90 percent of printed books used the older woodblock technology. In one case an entire set of wooden type numbering 250,000 pieces was used for firewood.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=912}} Woodblocks remained the dominant printing method in China until the introduction of [[lithography]] in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

In Japan the use of printing beyond its Buddhist origins was insignificant for centuries after its introduction. Printing of secular materials did not pick up until the late 16th century. The ''Setsuyō-shū'', a two-volume Chinese-Japanese dictionary printed in 1591, was the first secular book to be printed in Japan. Only after [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|invasions of Korea]], which brought back artisans and printing equipment in 1593, did Japan acquire its own wooden type font. Under [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]'s orders, the [[Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' were printed using metal movable type in 1598. It is generally considered to be the earliest extant Japanese text printed using metal movable type. The popularity of movable type in Japan was short lived. By the 1640s woodblock printing had reasserted itself as the dominant mode of printing in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, George (1961). "A History of Japan: 1334-1615." Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====
Traditionally it has been assumed that the prevalence of woodblock printing in East Asia as a result of Chinese characters led to the stagnation of printing culture and enterprise in that region. S. H. Steinberg describes woodblock printing in his ''Five Hundred Years of Printing'' as having "outlived their usefulness" and their printed material as "cheap tracts for the half-literate, ... which anyway had to be very brief because of the laborious process of cutting the letters."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=10}} John Man's ''The Gutenberg Revolution'' makes a similar case: "wood-blocks were even more demanding than manuscript pages to make, and they wore out and broke, and then you had to carve another one - a whole page at a time."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=10}}

Recent commentaries on printing in China using contemporary European observers with first hand knowledge complicate the traditional narrative. T. H. Barrett points out that only Europeans who had never seen Chinese woodblock printing in action tended to dismiss it, perhaps due to the almost instantaneous arrival of both xylography and movable type in Europe. The early Jesuit missionaries of late 16th century China, for instance, had a similar distaste for wood based printing for very different reasons. These Jesuits found that "the cheapness and omnipresence of printing in China made the prevailing wood-based technology extremely disturbing, even dangerous."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=11}} [[Matteo Ricci]] made note of "the exceedingly large numbers of books in circulation here and the ridiculously low prices at which they are sold."{{sfn|Twitchett|1998b|p=637}} Two hundred years later the Englishman John Barrow, by way of the [[Macartney Embassy|Macartney mission]] to Qing China, also remarked with some amazement that the printing industry was "as free as in England, and the profession of printing open to everyone."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=11}} The commercial success and profitability of woodblock printing was attested to by one British observer at the end of the nineteenth century, who noted that even before the arrival of western printing methods, the price of books and printed materials in [[History of China|China]] had already reached an astoundingly low price compared to what could be found in his home country. Of this, he said:

{{quotation|We have an extensive penny literature at home, but the [[English people|English]] cottager cannot buy anything like the amount of printed matter for his penny that the [[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]] can for even less. A penny Prayer-book, admittedly sold at a loss, cannot compete in mass of matter with many of the books to be bought for a few [[Cash (Chinese coin)|cash]] in China. When it is considered, too, that a block has been laboriously cut for each leaf, the cheapness of the result is only accounted for by the wideness of sale.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=14}}}}

Other modern scholars such as Endymion Wilkinson hold a more conservative and skeptical view. While Wilkinson does not deny "China's dominance in book production from the fourth to the fifteenth century," he also insists that arguments for the Chinese advantage "should not be extended either forwards or backwards in time."{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}

{{quotation|European book production began to catch up with China after the introduction of the mechanical printing press in the mid fifteenth century. Reliable figures of the number of imprints of each edition are as hard to find in Europe as they are in China, but one result of the spread of printing in Europe was that public and private libraries were able to build up their collections and for the first time in over a thousand years they began to match and then overtake the largest libraries in China.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

It is traditionally surmised that [[Johannes Gutenberg]], of the German city of [[Mainz]], developed European movable type printing technology with the [[printing press]] around 1439&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; and in just over a decade, the European age of printing began. However, the evidence shows a more complex evolutionary process, [[Spread of the printing press|spread over multiple locations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open2.net/historyandthearts/discover_science/gberg_synopsis.html Review of research by Paul Needham and Blaise Aguera y Arcas at the BBC / Open University]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter Schöffer]] experimented with Gutenberg in Mainz.

Compared to [[woodblock printing]], movable type page-setting was quicker and more durable. The metal type pieces were more durable and the lettering was more uniform, leading to typography and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type, and [[printing press]]es rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the [[Renaissance]], and later [[spread of the printing press|all around the world]]. Today, practically all movable type printing ultimately derives from Gutenberg's movable type printing, which is often regarded as the most important invention of the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, [[Time Life]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention to be the most important of the second millennium. In 1999, the A&amp;E Network voted Johannes Gutenberg "Man of the Millennium". See also [http://pirate.shu.edu/~gottlitr/mil_site/lista.html 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012221307/http://pirate.shu.edu/~gottlitr/mil_site/lista.html |date=2007-10-12 }} which was composed by four prominent US journalists in 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink which was more durable than previously used water-based inks. Having worked as a professional [[goldsmith]], Gutenberg made skillful use of his knowledge of metals. He also the first to make his type from an [[alloy]] of lead, tin, and [[antimony]], known as [[type metal]], printer's lead, or printer's metal, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books, and proved to be more suitable for printing than the clay, wooden or bronze types used in East Asia. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what some considered his most ingenious invention: a special matrix which enabled the moulding of new movable types with an unprecedented precision at short notice. Within a year of printing the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg also published the first coloured prints.

The invention of the printing press revolutionized communication and book production, leading to the spread of knowledge. Printing was rapidly spread from Germany by emigrating German printers, but also by foreign apprentices returning home. A printing press was built in [[Venice]] in 1469, and by 1500 the city had 417 printers. In 1470 [[Johann Heynlin]] set up a printing press in [[Paris]]. In 1473 [[Kasper Straube]] published the ''[[Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474]]'' in [[Kraków]]. [[Dirk Martens]] set up a printing press in [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] ([[Flanders]]) in 1473. He printed a book about the two lovers of [[Enea Piccolomini]] who became [[Pope Pius II]]. In 1476 a printing press was set up in England by [[William Caxton]]. The Italian Juan Pablos set up an imported press in [[Mexico City]] in 1539. The first [[printing press]] in [[Southeast Asia]] was set up in the [[Philippines]] by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in 1593. The Rev. Jose Glover intended to bring the first printing press to England's American colonies in 1638, but died on the voyage, so his widow, Elizabeth Harris Glover, established the printing house, which was run by Stephen Day and became The Cambridge Press.&lt;ref&gt;Stowell, Marion B.

The Gutenberg press was much more efficient than manual copying. It remained largely unchanged in the eras of [[John Baskerville]] and [[Giambattista Bodoni]], over 300 years later.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 130–133) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1800, Lord Stanhope had constructed a press completely from cast iron, reducing the force required by 90% while doubling the size of the printed area.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; While Stanhope's "mechanical theory" had improved the efficiency of the press, it was only capable of 250 sheets per hour.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; German printer [[Friedrich Koenig]] was the first to design a non-manpowered machine—using steam.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; He moved to London in 1804, and met [[Thomas Bensley]]; he secured financial support for his project in 1807.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; With a patent in 1810, Koenig designed a steam press "much like a hand press connected to a steam engine."&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811.

===Flat-bed printing press===
{{Main|Printing press|Spread of the printing press}}
[[File:Handtiegelpresse von 1811.jpg|thumb|Printing press from 1811, photographed in Munich, Germany.]]
A printing press is a mechanical device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring an image. The systems involved were first assembled in [[Germany]] by the [[goldsmith]] [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the mid-15th century.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. ''A History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58–69) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing methods based on Gutenberg's printing press spread rapidly throughout first [[Spread of the printing press|Europe and then the rest of the world]], replacing most block printing and making it the sole progenitor of modern movable type printing. As a method of creating reproductions for mass consumption, The printing press has been superseded by the advent of [[offset printing]].

Johannes Gutenberg's work in the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehen—a man he had previously instructed in gem-cutting—and Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; It was not until a 1439 [[lawsuit]] against Gutenberg that official record exists; witnesses testimony discussed type, an inventory of metals (including lead) and his type mold.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt;

Others in Europe were developing movable type at this time, including goldsmith Procopius Waldfoghel of France and [[Laurens Janszoon Coster]] of the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; They are not known to have contributed specific advances to the printing press.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; While the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] had attributed the invention of the printing press to Coster, the company now states that is incorrect.&lt;ref name="britannica_web_coster"&gt;''[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-36788/typography Typography - Gutenberg and printing in Germany].''

===Printing houses in Europe===
Early printing houses (near the time of Gutenberg) were run by "master printers." These printers owned shops, selected and edited manuscripts, determined the sizes of print runs, sold the works they produced, raised capital and organized distribution. Some master printing houses, like that of [[Aldus Manutius]], became the cultural center for [[Intellectual|literati]] such as [[Erasmus]].

*Print shop apprentices: Apprentices, usually between the ages of 15 and 20, worked for master printers. Apprentices were not required to be literate, and literacy rates at the time were very low, in comparison to today. Apprentices prepared ink, dampened sheets of paper, and assisted at the press. An apprentice who wished to learn to become a compositor had to learn Latin and spend time under the supervision of a journeyman.
*Journeyman printers: After completing their apprenticeships, ''journeyman''  printers were free to move employers. This facilitated the spread of printing to areas that were less print-centred.
*Compositors: Those who set the type for printing.
*Pressmen: the person who worked the press. This was physically labour-intensive.

The earliest-known image of a European, Gutenberg-style print shop is the ''Dance of Death'' by Matthias Huss, at Lyon, 1499. This image depicts a compositor standing at a compositor's case being grabbed by a skeleton. The case is raised to facilitate his work.  At the right of the printing house a bookshop is shown.

====Financial aspects====
According to court records from the city of Mainz, Johannes Fust was for some time Gutenberg's financial backer. By the 16th century jobs in printing were becoming increasingly specialized. Structures{{clarify|date=June 2017}} supporting publishers were more and more complex, leading to division of labour. In Europe between 1500 and 1700 the role of the Master Printer was dying out and giving way to the bookseller—publisher. During this period, printing had a stronger commercial imperative than previously. Risks associated with the industry however were substantial, although dependent on the nature of the publication.

Bookseller publishers negotiated at trade fairs and at print shops. Jobbing work appeared: some printers performed menial tasks at the beginning of their careers to support themselves.

From 1500–1700 publishers developed several new methods of funding projects:

# Cooperative associations/publication syndicates—a number of individuals shared the risks associated with printing and shared in the profit. This was pioneered by the French.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
# Subscription publishing: pioneered by the English in the early 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A prospectus for a publication was drawn up by a publisher to raise funding. The prospectus was given to potential buyers who signed up for a copy. If there were not enough subscriptions the publication did not go ahead. Lists of subscribers were included in the books as endorsements. If enough people subscribed, there might be a reprint. Some authors used subscription publication to bypass the publisher entirely.
# Installment publishing: books were issued in parts until a complete book had been issued. This was not necessarily done within a fixed time period. It was an effective method of spreading the cost over a period of time. It also allowed earlier returns on investment to help cover the production costs of subsequent installments.

The ''Mechanick Exercises'', by Joseph Moxon, in London, 1683, was said to be the first publication in installments.&lt;ref name="serial"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wiles |first1=R.

Publishing trade organizations allowed publishers to organize business concerns collectively. These arrangements included systems of self-regulation. For example, if one publisher did something to irritate other publishers he would be controlled by peer pressure. Such systems are known as [[cartel]]s, and are in most countries now considered to be in restraint of trade. These arrangements helped deal with labour unrest among journeymen, who faced difficult working conditions. Brotherhoods predated unions, without the formal regulations now associated with unions.

In most cases, publishers bought the [[copyright]] in a work from the author, and made some arrangement about the possible profits. This required a substantial amount of capital in addition to that needed for the physical equipment and staff. Alternatively, an author with some capital available would sometimes keep the copyright himself, and simply pay the printer to print the book.

====Rotary printing press====
{{Main|Rotary printing press}}
In a rotary printing press, the impressions are carved around a cylinder so that the printing can be done on long continuous rolls of paper, [[Paperboard|cardboard]], [[plastic]], or a large number of other substrates. Rotary drum printing was invented by [[Richard March Hoe]] in 1843 and patented in 1847, and then significantly improved by [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]] in 1863.

==Intaglio==
[[File:Intaglio-printing.svg|thumb|right|Intaglio printing. The top line is the paper, to which a slightly raised layer of ink adheres; the matrix is beneath]]
{{Main|Intaglio (printmaking)}}
Intaglio ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|n|ˈ|t|æ|l|i|oʊ}}) is a family of [[printmaking]] techniques in which the image is incised into a surface, known as the matrix or plate. Normally, [[copper]] or [[zinc]] plates are used as a surface, and the incisions are created by [[etching]], [[engraving]], [[drypoint]], [[aquatint]] or [[mezzotint]]. [[Collography|Collographs]] may also be printed as intaglio plates.  To print an intaglio plate the surface is covered in thick ink and then rubbed with [[tarlatan]] cloth to remove most of the excess. The final smooth wipe is usually done by hand, sometimes with the aid of newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from the recesses of the plate to the paper.

==Lithography (1796)==
[[File:Litography press with map of Moosburg 02.jpg|thumb|left|Lithography press for printing maps in Munich.]][[File:Lithography stone Princeton motif.jpg|thumb|stone used for a lithograph with a view of [[Princeton University]]
(Collection: Princeton University Library, NJ)]]
{{Main|Lithography}}
Invented by Bavarian author [[Aloys Senefelder]] in 1796,&lt;ref name="meggspage146"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. ©1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 146 {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''lithography''' is a method for printing on a smooth surface. Lithography is a printing process that uses chemical processes to create an image. For instance, the positive part of an image would be a [[hydrophobic]] chemical, while the negative image would be water. Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image.  This allows for a relatively flat print plate which allows for much longer runs than the older physical methods of imaging (e.g., embossing or engraving).
High-volume lithography is used today to produce posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging — just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it. Most books, indeed all types of high-volume text, are now printed using [[offset lithography]].

In offset lithography, which depends on photographic processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates are used in place of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive [[emulsion]]. A photographic negative of the desired image is placed in contact with the emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created through direct laser imaging in a CTP ([[Computer to plate|Computer-To-Plate]]) device called a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. For many years, chemicals have been used to remove the non-image emulsion, but now plates are available that do not require chemical processing.

==Color printing==
{{Main|Colour printing|Woodcut}}
[[File:Uncle Sam Supplying the World with Berry Brothers Hard Oil Finish.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert Lithographic Company, Detroit, MI. ''Uncle Sam Supplying the World with Berry Brothers Hard Oil Finish,'' c. 1880. Noel Wisdom Chromolithograph Collection, Special Collections Department, The University of South Florida Tampa Library.]]
According to Michael Sullivan, the earliest known example of color printing "is a two-color frontispiece to a Buddhist sutra scroll, dated 1346". Color printing continued to be used in China throughout the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Sullivan|title=The Arts of China|edition=Third|date=18 June 1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04918-5|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chromolithography]] became the most successful of several methods of [[colour printing]] developed by the 19th century; other methods were developed by printers such as [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]], [[George Baxter (printer)|George Baxter]] and [[Edmund Evans]], and mostly relied on using several [[woodcut|woodblocks]] with the colors. Hand-coloring also remained important; elements of the official British [[Ordnance Survey]] maps were colored by hand by boys until 1875.  Chromolithography developed from lithography and the term covers various types of lithography that are printed in color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seeing.nypl.org/planographic.html|title=Planographic Printing|date=1999-10-23|accessdate=2014-11-21|publisher=The New York Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial technique involved the use of multiple lithographic stones, one for each color, and was still extremely expensive when done for the best quality results. Depending on the number of colors present, a chromolithograph could take months to produce, by very skilled workers.  However much cheaper prints could be produced by simplifying both the number of colors used, and the refinement of the detail in the image.  Cheaper images, like the advertisement illustrated, relied heavily on an initial black print (not always a lithograph), on which colors were then overprinted. To make an expensive reproduction print as what was once referred to as a "’chromo’", a lithographer, with a finished painting in front of him, gradually created and corrected the many stones using proofs to look as much as possible like the painting in front of him, sometimes using dozens of layers.&lt;ref&gt;Clapper, Michael. "'I Was Once a Barefoot Boy!': Cultural Tensions in a Popular Chromo." American Art 16(2002): 16-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aloys Senefelder, the inventor of lithography, introduced the subject of colored lithography in his 1818 ''Vollstaendiges Lehrbuch der Steindruckerey (A Complete Course of Lithography)'', where he told of his plans to print using color and explained the colors he wished to be able to print someday.&lt;ref name="ferry_chromo"&gt;Ferry, Kathryn. "Printing the Alhambra: Owen Jones and Chromolithography." ''Architectural History'' 46(2003): 175–188.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Senefelder recorded plans for chromolithography, printers in other countries, such as [[France]] and [[England]], were also trying to find a new way to print in color. [[Godefroy Engelmann]] of [[Mulhouse]] in France was awarded a patent on chromolithography in July 1837,&lt;ref name="ferry_chromo"/&gt; but there are disputes over whether chromolithography was already in use before this date, as some sources say, pointing to areas of printing such as the production of [[playing card]]s.&lt;ref name="ferry_chromo"/&gt;

==Offset press (1870s)==
{{Main|Offset press}}
Offset printing is a widely used [[printing]] technique where the inked image is transferred (or "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. When used in combination with the [[Lithography|lithographic]] process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains [[ink]] from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the non-printing areas ink-free.

==Screenprinting (1907)==
{{Main|Screenprinting}}
Screenprinting has its origins in simple [[stencil]]ling, most notably of the [[Japanese art|Japanese]] form ([[katazome]]), used who cut banana leaves and inserted ink through the design holes on textiles, mostly for clothing. This was taken up in France. The modern screenprinting process originated from patents taken out by Samuel Simon in 1907 in [[England]]. This idea was then adopted in [[San Francisco, California]], by John Pilsworth in 1914 who used screenprinting to form multicolor [[Printmaking|prints]] in a subtractive mode, differing from screenprinting as it is done today.

==Flexography==
{{Main|Flexography}}
[[File:Flexography-Platecloseup.JPG|thumb|right|A flexographic printing plate.]]
Flexography (also called "surface printing"), often abbreviated to "flexo", is a method of [[printing]] most commonly used for packaging (labels, tape, bags, boxes, banners, and so on).

A flexo print is achieved by creating a mirrored master of the required image as a [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[relief]] in a [[rubber]] or [[polymer]] material.  A measured amount of [[ink]] is deposited upon the surface of the printing plate (or printing cylinder) using an [[anilox]] roll. The print surface then rotates, contacting the print material which transfers the ink.

Originally flexo printing was basic in quality. Labels requiring high quality have generally been printed Offset until recently. In the last few years great advances have been made to the quality of flexo printing presses.

The greatest advances though have been in the area of PhotoPolymer Printing Plates, including improvements to the plate material and the method of plate creation. —usually [[photography|photographic]] exposure followed by chemical etch, though also by direct [[laser engraving]].

==Photocopier (1960s)==
{{Main|Photocopier}}
Xerographic office photocopying was introduced by [[Xerox]] in the  1960s, and over the following 20 years it gradually replaced copies made by Verifax, [[Photostat]], [[carbon paper]], [[mimeograph machine]]s, and other [[duplicating machines]]. Its availability is one of the factors that rendered undesirable the development of the [[paperless office]] heralded early in the [[digital revolution]].

==Dot matrix printer (1968)==
{{Main|Dot matrix printing}}
A dot matrix printer or impact matrix printer refers to a type of [[computer printer]] with a print head that runs back and forth on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a [[typewriter]]. Unlike a typewriter or [[daisy wheel printer]], letters are drawn out of a [[dot matrix]], and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.  Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create [[Carbon copy|carbon copies]] and [[Carbonless copy paper|carbonless copies]].

Each dot is produced by a tiny metal rod, also called a "wire" or "pin", which is driven forward by  the power of a tiny [[electromagnet]] or [[solenoid]], either directly or through small levers (pawls). Facing the ribbon and the paper is a small guide plate (often made of an artificial jewel such as [[sapphire]] or [[ruby]] [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4194846.html]) pierced with holes to serve as guides for the pins. The moving portion of the printer is called the print head, and when running the printer as a generic text device generally prints one line of text at a time. Most dot matrix printers have a single vertical line of dot-making equipment on their print heads; others have a few interleaved rows in order to improve dot density.

The first dot-matrix [[Printer (computing)|printers]] were invented in Japan.&lt;ref name="kent"&gt;Allen Kent, James G. Williams (1990), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ajpoqYqFrkQC&amp;pg=PA298 ''Encyclopedia of Microcomputers: Volume 6'', page 298], [[CRC Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Japanese manufacturer [[Epson]] released the [[EP-101]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.dphotographer.co.uk/news/40-years-since-epsons-first-electronic-printer%E2%80%A6/ 40 years since Epson’s first Electronic Printer], Digital Photographer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.epson-europe.com/eu/epson_eu/about_us.html About Epson], [[Epson]]&lt;/ref&gt; the world's first dot-matrix printer.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; The same year, Japanese manufacturer [[OKI (company)|OKI]] introduced the first serial impact dot matrix printer (SIDM), the [[OKI Wiredot]].&lt;ref name="IPSJ_2012"&gt;{{cite web |title=Information Processing Technology Heritage - Wiredot printer |date=2012 |publisher=[[Information Processing Society of Japan]] (IPSJ) |url=http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/heritage/Wiredot_printer.html |access-date=2016-10-31 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031182147/http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/heritage/Wiredot_printer.html |archive-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKI_2013_1"&gt;{{cite web |title=OKI's Wiredot Printer Receives Information Processing Technology Heritage Certification in Japan |location=Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA |date=2013-03-14 |url=http://www.okidata.com/oki-datas-wiredot-printer-receives-heritage-certification |access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKI_2013_2"&gt;{{cite web |title=OKI Printer aus 1968 als technologisch wertvolles Erbe ausgezeichnet |language=German |date=2013-03-26 |url=http://www.oki.at/press-centre/press-releases/detail.aspx?id=tcm:93-153208-16 |access-date=2016-10-31 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031183409/http://www.oki.at/press-centre/press-releases/detail.aspx?id=tcm%3A93-153208-16 |archive-date=2016-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermal printer==
{{Main|Thermal printer}}
A thermal printer (or direct thermal printer) produces a printed image by selectively heating coated [[thermochromic paper]], or [[thermal paper]] as it is commonly known, when the paper passes over the thermal [[Computer printer|print head]]. The coating turns [[black]] in the areas where it is heated, producing an image.

==Laser printer (1969)==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pa 1977 9700-medium.jpg|right|thumb|left|Xerox 9700 laser printer (ca. 1977)]] --&gt;
The laser printer, based on a modified xerographic copier, was invented at [[Xerox]] in 1969 by researcher [[Gary Starkweather]], who had a fully functional networked printer system working by 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology | author = Edwin D.

The first commercial implementation of a laser printer was the [[IBM]] [[IBM model 3800 laser printer|model 3800]] in 1976, used for high-volume printing of documents such as invoices and mailing labels. It is often cited as "taking up a whole room," implying that it was a primitive version of the later familiar device used with a [[personal computer]]. While large, it was designed for an entirely different purpose. Many 3800s are still in use.

The first laser printer designed for use with an individual computer was released with the [[Xerox Star]] 8010 in 1981. Although it was innovative, the Star was an expensive ($17,000) system that was only purchased by a small number of laboratories and institutions. After [[personal computer]]s became more widespread, the first laser printer intended for a mass market was the [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[LaserJet]] 8ppm, released in 1984, using a [[Canon (company)|Canon]] engine controlled by HP software. The HP LaserJet printer was quickly followed by other laser printers from [[Brother Industries]], IBM, and others.

Most noteworthy was the role the laser printer played in popularizing [[desktop publishing]] with the introduction of the [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[LaserWriter]] for the Apple [[Macintosh]], along with [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] software, in 1985. With these products, users could create documents that would previously have required professional [[typesetting]].

==Inkjet printer==
{{Main|Inkjet printer}}
Inkjet printers are a type of [[computer printer]] that operates by propelling tiny droplets of liquid [[ink]] onto paper.

==Dye-sublimation printer==
{{Main|Dye-sublimation printer}}
A dye-sublimation printer (or dye-sub printer) is a [[computer printer]] which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, printer paper or poster paper.  The process is usually to lay one color at a time using a ribbon that has color panels. Most dye-sublimation printers use CMYO colors which differs from the more recognised [[CMYK]] colors in that the black dye is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating. This overcoating (which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer) is effectively a thin laminate which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air while also rendering the print water-resistant. Many [[consumer]] and [[professional]] dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing [[photograph]]ic prints.

==Digital press (1993)==
{{Main|Digital printing}}

Digital printing is the reproduction of [[digital images]] on a physical surface, such as [[paper|common]] or [[photographic paper]] or paperboard-cover stock, [[photographic film|film]], [[cloth]], [[plastic]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[magnets]], [[labels]] etc.

It can be differentiated from [[Lithograph|litho]], [[flexography]], [[gravure]] or [[letterpress]] printing in many ways, some of which are;
* Every impression made onto the paper can be different, as opposed to making several hundred or thousand impressions of the same image from one set of printing plates, as in traditional methods.
* The [[Ink]] or [[Toner]] does not absorb into the substrate, as does conventional ink, but forms a layer on the surface and may be fused to the substrate by using an inline fuser fluid with heat process (toner) or UV curing process (ink).
* It generally requires less waste in terms of chemicals used and paper wasted in set up or makeready (bringing the image "up to color" and checking position).
* It is excellent for rapid prototyping, or small print runs which means that it is more accessible to a wider range of designers and more cost effective in short runs.

==Frescography (1998)==
[[File:Comersee Spalier rgb.jpg|thumb|300px|With CAM-program created Frescography]]   
[[File:Frescography.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot of a CAM program for designing frescographies.]]{{Main|Frescography}}   
'''Frescography''' is a method for reproduction/creation of [[mural]]s using [[digital printing]] methods, invented in 1998 by [[Rainer Maria Latzke]], and patented in 2000. The frescography is based on digitally cut-out motifs which are stored in a [[database]]. [[Computer aided mural|CAM]] software programs then allow to enter the measurements of a wall or ceiling to create a mural design with [[low resolution]] motifs. Since architectural elements such as beams, windows or doors can be integrated, the design will result in an accurately and tailor-fit wall [[mural]]. Once a design is finished, the [[low resolution]] motifs are converted into the original [[high resolution]] images and are printed on canvas by [[Wide-format printer]]s. The canvas then can be applied to the wall in a [[wall-paper]]hanging like procedure and will then look like on-site created mural.

==3D printing==
{{Main|3D printing}}
Three-dimensional printing is a method of converting a virtual [[3D model]] into a physical object. 3D printing is a category of [[rapid prototyping]] technology. 3D printers typically work by 'printing' successive layers on top of the previous to build up a three dimensional object. 3D printers are generally faster, more affordable and easier to use than other additive fabrication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ptonline.com/articles/200408cu3.html |title=Close-Up On Technology - 3D Printers Lead Growth of Rapid Prototyping - 08/04&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123144538/http://www.ptonline.com/articles/200408cu3.html |archive-date=2010-01-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological developments==

===Woodcut===
{{main|Woodcut}}
Woodcut is a [[relief printing]] artistic technique in printmaking in which an image is carved into the surface of a block of wood, with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with gouges. The areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block is cut along the grain of the wood (unlike [[wood engraving]] where the block is cut in the end-grain). In Europe [[beech]]wood was most commonly used; in Japan, a special type of [[cherry]] wood was popular.

Woodcut first appeared in ancient China. From 6th century onward, woodcut icons became popular and especially flourished in [[Chinese Buddhism]]. Since the 10th century, woodcut pictures appeared as illustrations in Chinese books, on [[banknote]]s such as [[Jiaozi (currency)]], and as single sheet images. Woodcut [[New Year picture]]s are also very popular with the Chinese.

In China and Tibet printed images mostly remained tied as illustrations to accompanying text until the modern period. The earliest woodblock printed book, the [[Diamond Sutra]] contains a large image as frontispiece, and many Buddhist texts contain some images. Later some notable Chinese artists designed woodcuts for books, the individual print develop in China in the form of [[New Year picture]] as an art-form in the way it did in Europe and Japan.

In Europe, woodcut is the oldest technique used for [[old master print]]s, developing about 1400, by using on paper existing techniques for printing on cloth. The explosion of sales of cheap woodcuts in the middle of the century led to a fall in standards, and many [[popular prints]] were very crude. The development of [[hatching]] followed on rather later than in [[engraving]]. [[Michael Wolgemut]] was significant in making German woodcut more sophisticated from about 1475, and [[Erhard Reuwich]] was the first to use cross-hatching (far harder to do than in engraving or [[etching]]). Both of these produced mainly book-illustrations, as did various Italian artists who were also raising standards there at the same period. At the end of the century [[Albrecht Dürer]] brought the Western woodcut to a level that has never been surpassed, and greatly increased the status of the ''single-leaf'' (i.e. an image sold separately) woodcut.

===Engraving===
{{Main|Engraving}}
Engraving is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, flat surface, by cutting grooves into it. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when [[silver]], [[gold]] or [[steel]] are engraved, or may provide an [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing plate, of [[copper]] or another metal, for printing images on paper, which are called engravings. Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper, both in artistic [[printmaking]], and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by [[photography]] in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by [[etching]] and other techniques. Other terms often used for engravings are ''copper-plate engraving'' and ''[[Line engraving]]''. These should all mean exactly the same, but especially in the past were often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching.

In [[Ancient history|antiquity]], the only engraving that could be carried out is evident in the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C. The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by [[chasing (metalworking)|chasing]] or sometimes a combination of [[lost-wax casting]] and chasing.

In the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as [[old master print]]s in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as [[Martin Schongauer]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], and [[Lucas van Leiden]].

===Etching===
{{Main|Etching}}
Etching is the process of using strong acid or mordant to cut into the unprotected parts of a metal surface to create a design in intaglio in the metal (the original process—in modern manufacturing other chemicals may be used on other types of material). As an intaglio method of printmaking it is, along with engraving, the most important technique for [[old master print]]s, and remains widely used today.

===Halftoning===
{{Main|Halftone}}
Halftone is the [[reprographic]] technique that simulates ones it is [[continuous tone]] imagery through the use of equally spaced dots of varying size.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, Alastair. The Designer's Lexicon. ©2000 Chronicle, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Halftone' can also be used to refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process.&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt;

The idea of halftone printing originates from [[William Fox Talbot]]. In the early 1850s he suggested using "photographic screens or veils" in connection with a photographic [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] process.&lt;ref name=twyman1970&gt;Twyman, Michael. Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, London 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different kinds of screens were proposed during the following decades, but the first half-tone photo-engraving process was invented by Canadians George-Édouard Desbarats and William Leggo Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |last=Galarneau |first=Claude |title=Desbarats, George-Édouard-Amable |volume=12 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/desbarats_george_edouard_12E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, 1869, Desbarats published the ''Canadian Illustrated News'' which became the world's first periodical to successfully employ this photo-mechanical technique; featuring a full page half-tone image of His Royal Highness Prince Arthur, from a photograph by Notman.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080523101009/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/cin/026019-119.01-e.php] Ambitious to exploit a much larger circulation, Debarats and Leggo went to New York and launched the ''New York Daily Graphic'' in March 1873, which became the world's first illustrated daily.

The first truly successful commercial method was patented by [[Frederic Eugene Ives|Frederic Ives]] of [[Philadelphia]] in 1881.&lt;ref name="twyman1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meggs (1998), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; But although he found a way of breaking up the image into dots of varying sizes he did not make use of a screen. In 1882 the German [[George Meisenbach]] patented a halftone process in England. His invention was based on the previous ideas of Berchtold and Swan. He used single lined screens which were turned during exposure to produce cross-lined effects. He was the first to achieve  any commercial success with [[relief print|relief]] halftones.&lt;ref name=twyman1970/&gt;

===Xerography===
{{Main|Xerography}}
Xerography (or electrophotography) is a [[photocopying]] technique developed by [[Chester Carlson]] in 1938 and [[patent]]ed on October 6, 1942. He received {{US patent|2297691}} for his [[invention]]. The name xerography came from the Greek radicals ''xeros'' (dry) and ''graphos'' (writing), because there are no liquid chemicals involved in the process, unlike earlier reproduction techniques like [[cyanotype]].

In 1938 [[Bulgaria]]n [[physicist]] [[Georgi Nadjakov]] found that when placed into electric field and exposed to light, some dielectrics acquire permanent electric polarization in the exposed areas.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071101024139/http://www.issp.bas.bg/lab/ephi/Museum/acad_GNadjakov/GN11-page5.html] That polarization persists in the dark and is destroyed in light.
[[Chester Carlson]], the inventor of photocopying, was originally a [[patent attorney]] and part-time researcher and inventor. His job at the patent office in [[New York City]] required him to make a large number of copies of important papers. Carlson, who was [[arthritis|arthritic]], found this a painful and tedious process. This prompted him to conduct experiments with [[photoconductivity]]. Carlson experimented with "[[electrophotography]]" in his kitchen and in 1938, applied for a patent for the process. He made the first "photocopy" using a [[zinc]] plate covered with [[sulfur]]. The words "10-22-38 Astoria" were written on a [[microscope]] slide, which was placed on top of more sulfur and under a bright light. After the slide was removed, a mirror image of the words remained. Carlson tried to sell his invention to some companies, but because the process was still underdeveloped he failed. At the time multiple copies were made using carbon paper or duplicating machines and people did not feel the need for an electronic machine. Between 1939 and 1944, Carlson was turned down by over 20 companies, including [[IBM]] and [[General Electric|GE]], neither of which believed there was a significant market for copiers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

'''Hospitality management''' is the study of the [[hospitality industry]]. A degree in the subject may be awarded either by a university college dedicated to the studies of  hospitality management or a [[business school]] with a relevant department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=What is Hospitality management?|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-hospitality-management.htm|journal=http://www.wisegeek.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://srihm.edu.in/ Degrees in hospitality management] may also be referred to as [[Hotel manager|hotel management]], hotel and tourism management, or hotel administration. Degrees conferred in this academic field include [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], [[Bachelor of Business Administration]], [[Bachelor of Science|BS]], [[Bachelor of Applied Science|BASc]], [[Master of Science|MS]], [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]. Hospitality management covers [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[cruise ship]]s, [[amusement parks]], [[destination marketing organization]]s, [[convention center]]s, and [[country club]]s.

==Curriculum==
In the USA, hospitality and tourism management curricula follow similar core subject applications to that of a [[business degree]], but with a focus on tourism development and hospitality management. Core subject areas include [[accounting]], [[administration (business)|administration]], [[finance]], [[information systems]], [[marketing]], [[human resource management]], [[public relations]], [[business strategy|strategy]], [[quantitative methods]], and sectoral studies in the various areas of hospitality business.

===Vegetarian option===
In 2016, Ministry of Tourism, [[Government of India]] started giving hospitality management students the option to choose only vegetarian cooking. This was introduced at three of the institutes (IHMCTAN Ahmedabad, IHMCTAN Bhopal and IHMCTAN Jaipur) affiliated with the Ministry. This decision to offer a vegetarian option by IHMCTANs may be the first amongst any of the hospitality training institutes of the world. It is expected that all IHMCTANs in India will start offering a vegetarian cooking option from academic year 2018 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31808&amp;articlexml=IHMs-to-offer-3-yr-course-in-vegetarian-11072016013026|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofjaipur.com/news/2016/07/13/vegetarian-cooking-courses-to-be-introduced-in-hotel-management-institutes/|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nchmcounselling.nic.in/nchminfo/Public/View.aspx?page=79 |title=NCHM Counselling 2018 |publisher=Nchmcounselling.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human services''' is an interdisciplinary field with the objective of meeting human needs through an applied knowledge base, focusing on prevention as well as remediation of problems, and maintaining a commitment to improving the overall quality of life of service populations. The process involves the study of social technologies (practice methods, models, and theories), service technologies (programs, organizations, and systems), and scientific innovations that are designed to ameliorate problems and enhance the quality of life of individuals, families and communities to improve the delivery of service with better coordination, accessibility and accountability.&lt;ref name=Herzberg2015&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herzberg |first1=Judith T. |date=2015 |title=Foundations in human services practice: A generalist perspective on individual, agency, and community |edition=1st |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson |oclc=881181908 |isbn=9780205858255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of human services is to promote a practice that involves simultaneously working at all levels of society (whole-person approach) in the process of promoting the autonomy of individuals or groups, making informal or formal human services systems more efficient and effective, and advocating for positive social change within society.

Human services practitioners strive to advance the autonomy of service users through civic engagement, education, health promotion and social change at all levels of society. Practitioners also engage in advocating so human systems remain accessible, integrated, efficient and effective.

Human services academic programs can be readily found in colleges and universities, which award degrees at the associate, baccalaureate, and graduate levels. Human services programs exist in countries all around the world.

==History==

===United States===
Human services has its roots in [[Charitable organizations (Canada)|charitable]] activities of religious and civic organizations that date back to the Colonial period.  However, the academic discipline of human services did not start until the 1960s. At that time, a group of college academics started the new human services movement and began to promote the adoption of a new ideology about human service delivery and [[Professional|professionalism]] among traditional helping disciplines.&lt;ref name="Chenault Burnford 1978"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chenault|first1=Joann|last2=Burnford|first2=Fran|date=1978|title=Human services professional education: Future directions|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|oclc=3650238|isbn=9780070107328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's major goal was to make service delivery more efficient, effective, and humane. The other goals dealt with the reeducation of traditional helping professionals ([[interprofessional education]]), to have a greater appreciation of the individual as a whole person ([[humanistic psychology]]) and to be accountable to the communities they serve ([[postmodernism]]). Furthermore, professionals would learn to take responsibility at all levels of [[government]], use systems approaches to consider human problems, and be involved in progressive social change.

Traditional academic programs such as [[education]], [[nursing]], [[social work]], [[law]] and [[medicine]] were resistant to the new human services movement's ideology because it appeared to challenge their professional status. Changing the traditional concept of professionalism involved rethinking consumer control and the distribution of power. The new movement also called on human service professionals to work for [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dumont|first=M|year=1970|title=The changing face of professionalism|journal=Social Policy|volume=1|pages=26–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed that the reduction of the monopolistic control of professionals could result in [[democratization of knowledge]] and would lead to professionals advocating on behalf of clients and communities against professional establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reiff |first1=R. |date=1970 |chapter=Community psychology, community mental health and social needs: The need for a body of knowledge in community psychology |editor1-first=Ira |editor1-last=Iscoe |editor2-first=Charles D. |editor2-last=Spielberger |title=Community psychology: Perspectives in training and research |pages=1- |location=New York |publisher=Appleton |oclc=92432 |isbn=9780390477712}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also hoped that human service delivery systems would become integrated, comprehensive, and more accessible, which would make them more humane for service users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Agranoff| first1=R. |chapter=Human services administration: Service delivery, service integration, and training |pages=42–51 |editor-last=Mikulecky |editor-first=Thomas J. |date=1974 |title=Human services integration: a report of a special project conducted by the American Society for Public Administration |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Society for Public Administration |oclc=918115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker1974&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=F |date=June 1974 |title=From community mental health to human service ideology |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=576–581 |pmid=4829069 |pmc=1775477 |doi=10.2105/ajph.64.6.576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the resistance from traditional helping professions served as the impetus for a group of educators in [[higher education]] to start the new academic discipline of human services.

Some maintain that the human services discipline has a concrete identity as a profession that supplements and complements other traditional professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mehr |first1=Joseph J. |last2=Kanwischer |first2=Ronald |date=2004 |title=Human services: concepts and intervention strategies |edition=9th |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson/Allyn and Bacon |oclc=51477841 |isbn=9780205381210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet other professionals and scholars have not agreed upon an authoritative definition for human services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kincaid |first1=Susan O. |date=2009 |title=Defining human services: A discourse analysis |journal=Human service education |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=14–23 |issn=0890-5428 |url=http://www.nationalhumanservices.org/assets/Journal/2009.pdf |format=PDF |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6c80rxEKc?url=http://www.nationalhumanservices.org/assets/Journal/2009.pdf |archive-date=8 October 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic programs==

===United States===

====Development====
Chenault and Burnford argued that human services programs must educate and train students at the graduate or postgraduate level if human services hoped to be considered a professional discipline.&lt;ref name="Chenault Burnford 1978" /&gt; A progressive graduate human services program was established by Audrey Cohen (1932–1996), who was considered an innovative educator for her time. The Audrey Cohen College of Human Services, now called the [[Metropolitan College of New York]], offered one of the first graduate programs in 1974.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=Gerald |last2=Riesman |first2=David |date=1978 |title=The perpetual dream: reform and experiment in the American college |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |oclc=3203327 |isbn=9780226306056}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same time period, [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College]] in [[Massachusetts]] became a major force in preserving human services as an academic discipline. Currently, Springfield College is one of the oldest and largest human services program in the United States.

Manpower studies in the 1960s and 70s had shown that there would be a shortage of helping professionals in an array of service delivery areas.&lt;ref name=Cohen1969&gt;Cohen, 1969.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kadish1969&gt;Kadish, 1969.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McPheeters&gt;{{citation |last1=McPheeters |first1=Harold L. |last2=King |first2=James B. |author3=Southern Regional Education Board |author3-link=Southern Regional Education Board |date=February 1971 |title=Plans for teaching mental health workers: Community college curriculum objectives |location=Bethesda, MD |publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED065726.pdf |format=PDF |oclc=425565522 |id=[[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]] [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED065726 ED065726]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, some educators proposed that the training of nonprofessionals (e.g., mental health technicians)could bridge this looming personnel shortage.&lt;ref name=McPheeters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweitzer |first1=H.

Professionals of the SREB Undergraduate Social Welfare Manpower Project helped colleges develop new social welfare programs, which later became known as human services.&lt;ref name=McPheetersRyan1971&gt;{{citation |last1=McPheeters |first1=Harold L. |last2=Ryan |first2=Robert M. |author3=Southern Regional Education Board |author3-link=Southern Regional Education Board |date=December 1971 |title=A Core of Competence for Baccalaureate Social Welfare and Curricular Implications |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED079210.pdf |format=PDF |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Social and Rehabilitation Service ([[United States Department of Health and Human Services#Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]]) |id=[[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]] [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED079210 ED079210] |oclc=425729945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believed that [[community college]] human services programs were the most expedient way to train [[paraprofessional]]s for direct service jobs in areas such as mental health.&lt;ref name=True/&gt; Currently, a large percentage of human services programs are run at the community college level.

The development of community college human services programs was supported with government funding that was earmarked for the federal new careers initiatives. In turn, the federally funded [[New Careers|New Careers Program]] was created to produce a nonprofessional career track for economically disadvantaged, underemployed, and unemployed adults as a strategy to eradicate poverty within society&lt;ref name=GrosserEtAl1969&gt;Grosser, Henry, &amp; Kelly, 1969.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haskell1969&gt;Haskell, 1969.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PearlRiessman1965&gt;Pearl &amp; Riessman, 1965.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RiessmanPopper1968&gt;Riessman &amp; Popper, 1968.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to end a critical shortage of health-care personnel.&lt;ref name=SteinbergEtAl1969&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steinberg |first1=Sheldon S. |last2=Shatz |first2=Eunice O. |last3=Fishman |first3=Jacob R. |date=July 1969 |title=New careers: a major solution to the environmental health problem |url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.59.7.1118 |format=PDF |journal=American journal of Public Health and the Nation's Health |volume=59 |issue=7 |pmid=5815750 |pmc=1226583 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.59.7.1118 |pages=1118–1123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates from these programs successfully acquired employment as paraprofessionals,&lt;ref name=True/&gt; but there were limitations to their [[upward mobility]] within social service agencies because they lacked a graduate or professional degree.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;

====Current programs====
Currently, there are academic programs in human services at the associate, baccalaureate, and graduate levels. There are approximately 600 human services programs throughout the United States. An online directory of human services programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Directory of human services programs |url=http://www.drcdata.com/(S(lmu34f45d5bgwr3j0remqo55))/hsReview.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929004524/http://www.drcdata.com/%28S%28coyi11mtscb0hr45dw1rggu5%29%29/hsReview.aspx |archive-date=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists many (but not all) of the programs state by state in conjunction with their [[accreditation]] status from the Council of Standards for Human Services Education (CSHSE).

The CSHSE offers accreditation for human services programs in higher education. The accreditation process is voluntary and labor-intensive; it is designed to assure the quality, consistency, and relevance of human service education through research-based standards and a peer-review process. According to the CSHSE's webpage there are only 43 accredited human services programs in the United States. The Standards for each level of degree accredited by CSHSE can be obtained by clicking on the following links:

Human services curricula are based on an interdisciplinary knowledge foundation that allows students to consider practical solutions from multiple disciplinary perspectives. Across the curriculum human services students are often taught to view human problems from a socioecological perspective (developed by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]]) that involves viewing human strengths and problems as interconnected to a family unit, community, and society. This perspective is considered a “whole-person perspective”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woodside |first1=Marianne |last2=McClam |first2=Tricia |date=2009 |title=An introduction to human services |edition=6th |location=Bemont, CA |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |oclc=224438780 |isbn=9780495503361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, undergraduate programs prepare students to be human services generalists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burger |first1=William R. |last2=Youkeles |first2=Merrill |date=2004 |title=Human services in contemporary America |edition=6th |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Brooks/Cole--Thomson Learning |oclc=52578972 |isbn=9780534547479}}&lt;/ref&gt; while master’s programs prepare students to be human services administrators,&lt;ref name="Chenault Burnford 1978" /&gt; and doctoral programs prepare students to be researcher-analysts and college-level educators.

The Center for Credentialing &amp; Education (CCE) conceptualized the Human Services-Board Certified Practitioner (HS-BCP) credential with the assistance of the National Organization for Human Services (NOHS) and the Council for Standards in Human Service Education (CSHSE). The credential was created for human services practitioners seeking to advance their careers by acquiring independent verification of their practical knowledge and educational background.&lt;ref name=ExamHSBCP&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Services-Board Certified Practitioner |website=Center for Credentialing and Education |url=http://www.cce-global.org/HSBCP/Exam |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232940/http://www.cce-global.org/HSBCP/Exam |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates from human services programs can obtain a Human Services Board Certified Practitioner (HS-BCP) credential offered by the Center for Credentialing &amp; Education (CCE). The HS-BCP certification ensures that human services practitioners offer quality services, are competent service providers, are committed to high standards, and adhere to the NOHS ''Ethical Standards of Human Service Professionals,'' as well as to help solidify the professional identity of human services practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Council for Standards in Human Services Education |url=http://www.cshse.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; HS-BCPE Experience Requirements for the certification:  HS-BCP applicants must meet post-graduation experience requirements to be eligible to take the examination. However, graduates of a CSHSE accredited degree program may sit for the HS-BCP exam without verifying their human services work experience. Otherwise experience requirements for candidates not from a CSHSE accredited program are as follows:  Associate degree with post degree experience requires three years, including a minimum of 4,500 hours; Bachelor’s Degree with post degree experience requires two years, including a minimum of 3,000 hours; Master’s or Doctorate with post degree experience requires one year, including a minimum of 1,500 hours.&lt;ref name=ExamHSBCP/&gt;

The HS-BCP exam is designed to verify a candidate’s human services knowledge. The exam was created as a collaborative effort of human services subject-matter experts and normed on a population of professionals in the field. The HS-BCP exam covers the following areas:

# Assessment, treatment planning, and outcome evaluation
# Theoretical orientation/interventions
# Case management, professional practice, and ethics
# Administration, program development/evaluation, and supervision

==Employment outlook==

===United States===
Currently, the three major employment roles played by human services graduates include providing direct service, performing administrative work, and working in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mandell |first1=Betty Reid |last2=Schram |first2=Barbara |date=2006 |title=An introduction to human services: Policy and practice |edition=6th |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson/Allyn and Bacon |oclc=58546150 |isbn=9780205442140}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Occupational Outlook Handbook]], published by the [[US Department of Labor]], the employment of human service assistants is anticipated to grow by 34% through 2016, which is faster than average for all occupations. There will also be excellent job opportunities for individuals with post-secondary degrees. But salaries remain low, which might reflect employers’ lack of understanding of the human services profession.

==Professional organizations==

===North America===
There are several different professional human services organizations for professionals, educators, and students to join across North America.

====United States====
The National Organization for Human Services (NOHS) is a professional organization open to educators, professionals, and students interested in current issues in the field of human services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Organization for Human Services|url=http://www.nationalhumanservices.org/|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NOHS sponsors an annual [[Business conference|conference]] in different parts of the United States. In addition, there are four independent human services regional organizations: (a) Mid-Atlantic Consortium for Human Services, (b) Midwest Organization for Human Services, (c) New England Organization for Human Service, and the (d) Northwest Human Services Association. All of the regional organizations are also open to educators, professionals, students and each regional organization has an annual conference in different locations throughout their region such as universities or institutions. 

Human services special interest groups also exist within the [[American Society for Public Administration]] (ASPA) and the [[American Educational Research Association]] (AERA). The ASPA subsection is named the Section on Health and Human Services Administration and its purpose is to foster the development of knowledge, understanding and practice in the fields of health and human services administration and to foster professional growth and communication among academics and practitioners in these fields. Fields of health and human services administration share a common and unique focus on improving the quality of life through client-centered policies and service transactions.

The AERA special interest group is named the Education, Health and Human Service Linkages. Its purpose is to create a community of researchers and practitioners interested in developing knowledge about comprehensive school health, school linked services, and initiatives that support children and their families. This subgroup also focuses on interpersonal collaboration, integration of services, and interdisciplinary approaches. The group’s interests encompass interrelated policy, practice, and research that challenge efforts to create viable linkages among these three distinct areas.

The American Public Human Services Association (APHSA) is a nonprofit organization that pursues distinction in health and human services by working with policymakers, supporting state and local agencies, and working with partners to promote innovative, integrative and efficient solutions in health and human services policy and practice. APHSA has individual and student memberships.

====Canada====
The [[Canadian Institute for Human Services]] is an [[Advocacy group|advocacy]], [[education]] and [[action-research]] organization for the advancement of health equity, progressive education and social innovation. The institute collaborates with researchers, field practitioners, community organizations, socially conscious companies—along with various levels of government and educational institutions—to ensure that the Canadian health and human services sector remains accountable to the greater good of Canadian civil society rather than short-term professional, business or economic gains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Canadian Institute for Human Services |url=http://www.humanservices.ca/ |accessdate=16 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416215833/http://www.humanservices.ca/ |archivedate=16 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique''''' is a famous popular scientific treatise and self-help book published in London in 1926 by Dutch [[gynecology|gynecologist]] [[Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde]], retired director of the Gynecological Clinic in [[Haarlem]], and "one of the major writers on human sexuality during the early twentieth century" (Frayser &amp; Whitby, p.&amp;nbsp;300).  It was the best-known work on its subject for several decades, and was reprinted 46 times in the original edition.  After World-War Two, it sold over a half-million copies. A revised edition was published in 1965. and a subsequent one in 2000 (Melody &amp; Pearson, p.&amp;nbsp;96).

It proclaimed the "critical goal of marriage consists of sexual pleasure shared by husband and wife" (Melody and Person, p.&amp;nbsp;93). A 2000 edition of the book described itself as concentrating "on the cultivation of the technique of eroticism as an art in marriage."

Frederica Mathewes-Green, in the ''National Review'', described it as

{{quote |the best-selling sex manual of all time. Over half a million copies were sold in the United States alone, and it enjoyed equal success in Europe.  ...This is not a prude's book.  Young couples who grab a used copy off the Internet may have even as much fun with it as their great-grandparents did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = National Review | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/mathewes-green/mathewesgreen200411220815.asp | date = 2004-11-22 | first = Frederica | last = Mathewes-Green}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first printing had an insert: "The sale of this book is strictly limited to members of the medical profession, Psychoanalysts, Scholars, and to such adults as may have a definite position in the field of Physiological, Psychological, or Social Research."  It was placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] in 1931.

On Wednesday 5 September 2007, the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Environment and Heritage Committee presented, to the [[Speaker_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives | Speaker]], its report on the inquiry into a sustainability charter entitled ''Sustainability for survival: creating a climate for change''.

A key recommendation within this report was to restate the need for a [[Australian sustainability commission | national Sustainability Commission]] headed by a Sustainability Commissioner that was previously recommended in the [[Sustainable Cities Report]] published in 2005.

The '''Institute for New Testament Textual Research''' ({{lang-de|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung}} — INTF) at the [[University of Münster]], [[Westphalia]], [[Germany]], is to research the textual history of the New Testament and to reconstruct its Greek initial text on the basis of the entire manuscript tradition, the early translations and patristic citations; furthermore the preparation of an ''[[Editio Critica Maior]]'' based on the entire tradition of the [[New Testament]] in Greek manuscripts, early versions and [[List of New Testament Church Fathers|New Testament quotations]] in ancient Christian literature. Under [[Kurt Aland]]'s supervision, the INTF collected almost the entire material that was needed - Manuscript count 1950: 4250; 1983: 5460; 2017: approx. 5800. 

Moreover, INTF produces several more editions and a variety of tools for [[New Testament]] scholarship, including the concise editions known as the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|"Nestle-Aland" - Novum Testamentum Graece]] 
and the UBS [[Greek New Testament]]. Many of the results are also available to the wider public at the adjoining [[Bible Museum Münster|Bible Museum]], which is affiliated with the institute.

First supplements of the [[Editio Critica Maior]] with the [[Catholic Letters]] and [[The Acts of the Apostels]] have been published since 1997. 

== History ==
The INTF was founded in [[Münster]], Germany, in 1959 by Kurt Aland (1915-1994). Since the 1950s Aland had been working on Eberhard and [[Erwin Nestle]]'s [[Novum Testamentum Graece]]. At the INTF the concise scholarly edition saw further revisions and publications, until it became the trade-mark of the institute under the name of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|"Nestle-Aland" - Novum Testamentum Graece]]. In 1966, a second concise edition intended for translators, the [[Greek New Testament]], was published. The great [[papyri]] discoveries of the 20th century were of special relevance for a new reconstruction of the text published in both the 26th edition of Nestle-Aland and the third edition of the Greek New Testament. Both editions contain the identical text while differing in their apparatus.

However, the main objective of the Institute was the so-called [[Editio Critica Maior]] based on the entire tradition of the New Testament in [[Biblical manuscript|Greek manuscripts]], old translations and New Testament quotations in ancient Christian literature. The pre-requisite for the realisation of this task was the sifting and examination of the entire manuscript tradition of the Greek New Testament. Under the supervision of Kurt Aland the INTF first of all collected almost the entire material (partly on extensive manuscript travels), followed by analyses in single editions and specific studies in preparation of the Editio critia Maior.

Kurt Aland found a friend and patron in Bishop Hermann Kunst. In 1964 the latter established the foundation “Hermann Kunst Foundation for the Promotion of New Testament Textual Research” that has granted crucial financial support to the Institute ever since.

In 1979, Kurt Aland founded the [[Bible Museum Münster]] that presents the work of the institute to the general public.

In 1983, [[Barbara Aland]] succeeded her husband as director of the Institute. Under her supervision, the analysis of the material that had been started under Kurt Aland continued and was made accessible for research in numerous publications. The first supplement of the [[Editio Critica Maior]] with the Epistle of James was finally published in 1997. Barbara Aland led the Institute until 2004.

Since October 2004 [http://www.wwu.de/EvTheol/personen/strutwolf.html Holger Strutwolf] has been in office as director of the Institute and the Bible Museum.

In 2007 the "Northrhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences and Arts" accepted the [[Editio Critica Maior]] as one of their projects. In the following year the project was established at Münster University as “Novum Testamentum Graecum - Editio Critica Maior”.

== Profile ==

'''History of the textual tradition of the New Testament''' - It is the task of the Institute for New Testament Textual Research (INTF) to comprehensively document and analyse the history of the textual tradition of the New Testament in its Greek original language.

'''List of Greek NT manuscripts''' - The Institute for New Testament Textual Research operates the international recording list of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. All newly discovered manuscripts anywhere in the world are being recorded, examined and provided with a short description at the Institute.

'''Reconstruction of the initial text''' - The core objective is to gain an impression, for the first time based on the entire material available today, of the textual history, and to reconstruct from this the initial text of the New Testament tradition. The result of this work is being published in the Editio Critica Maior.

'''Scholarly concise editions and tools''' - It has always been a distinguished task of the INTF to answer the need for scholarly concise editions based on the current state of research (Nestle-Aland, Greek New Testament, Synopsis) and scholarly reference works (concordances, Bauer-Aland). The concise editions have been continued, but they have also been supplemented by a digital edition and transcripts of important manuscripts on the Internet and a virtual manuscript room to make use of the advantages of that medium. All editions will increasingly benefit from the insights gained in the work on the [[Editio Critica Maior]].

''' New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room ''' - The INTF provides an electronic text critical resource, the ''[[New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room]] (NT.VMR)'' - a virtual manuscript reading room, where New Testament manuscripts can be viewed online. Digitized manuscripts can be viewed in the VMR individually in facsimile and as transcript, if available.

'''«Arbeiten zur neutestamentlichen Textforschung»''' - Under this title, INTF publishes its own series. It mainly contains research results and studies from various projects of INTF.

'''Bible Museum''' - It is also highly relevant for the INTF not only to connect with the academic world but also to reach out to the broader public through the affiliated Bible Museum and through exhibitions outside the institute.

== Manuscripts ==
The INTF also holds some manuscripts of the New Testament, and took responsibility for registering the New Testament manuscripts (named the "[[Gregory-Aland]] numbers"), and for editing the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]]. 

Minuscules: 
[[Minuscule 676|676]], [[Minuscule 798|798]], [[Minuscule 1432|1432]], [[Minuscule 2444|2444]], [[Minuscule 2445|2445]], [[Minuscule 2446|2446]], [[Minuscule 2460|2460]], [[Minuscule 2754|2754]], [[Minuscule 2755|2755]], [[Minuscule 2756|2756]], [[Minuscule 2793|2793]]; 

Lectionaries: 
[[Lectionary 1681|'''ℓ'''''1681'']], [[Lectionary 1682|'''ℓ'''''1682'']], [[Lectionary 1683|'''ℓ'''''1683'']], [[Lectionary 1684|'''ℓ'''''1684'']] (lower script [[Uncial 0233]]), [[Lectionary 1685|'''ℓ'''''1685'']], [[Lectionary 1686|'''ℓ'''''1686'']], [[Lectionary 2005|'''ℓ'''''2005'']], [[Lectionary 2137|'''ℓ'''''2137'']], [[Lectionary 2208|'''ℓ'''''2208'']], and [[Lectionary 2276|'''ℓ'''''2276'']].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3675">The '''Institute on Religion in an Age of Science''' (IRAS) is a [[non-denominational]] society that promotes and facilitates the ongoing dialectic between religion and science. The Institute has held annual week-long conferences at [[Star Island (New Hampshire)|Star Island]] in [[New Hampshire]] since 1954. The conference attracts about 250 members and non-members each year.

==Mission==
In its Constitution, the IRAS purpose is stated as follows: "The Institute on Religion in an Age of Science is established
* to promote creative efforts leading to the formulation, in the light of contemporary knowledge, of effective doctrines and practice for human welfare;
* to formulate dynamic and positive relationships between the concepts developed by science and the goals and hopes of humanity expressed through religion; and
* to state human values in such universal and valid terms that they be understood by all peoples, whatever their cultural background or experience, in such a way as to provide a basis for world-wide cooperation.

The IRAS Council adopted the following statement in 2003:
“We at IRAS take the natural world seriously as a primary source of meaning. Our quest is informed and guided by the deepening and evolving understandings fostered by scientific inquiry.

“From here, our quests for meaning take us in divergent directions. For some, the natural world and its emergent manifestations in human experience and creativity are the focus of exploration. Some go on to encounter and celebrate the sacred in such explorations. For some, understandings of the natural world are interwoven with understandings inherent in various religious traditions, generating additional paths of exploration and encounter. As a result, we articulate our emerging orientations with many voices that are harmonious in that we share a common sense of place and gratitude.

“We acknowledge as well a shared set of values and concerns pertaining to peace, justice, dignity, cultural and ecological diversity and planetary sustainability. Although we may differ and hence debate as to how these concerns are here addressed, we are committed to participating in their resolution.”

==History==
IRAS evolved from the ideas of two pioneer groups. The first was a group of scientists from the Committee on Science and Values of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. The second group was an interfaith, religious coalition which hoped to revitalize religion for today's needs. Members of both groups saw what some perceived as a battlefield of conflicting ideologies to be a place of opportunity for a constructive relationship to emerge.

In 1954 the scientists accepted an invitation to present their views to the religious group at a seven-day conference on Religion in an Age of Science on Star Island. On November 9, 1954, members of the two groups established the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science to work toward these goals.

Presidents of the Institute have included [[Harlow Shapley]], [[Philip Hefner]], [[Ursula Goodenough]], and [[Varadaraja V. Raman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="87488">'''Italian Renaissance painting''' is the painting of the period beginning in the late 13th century and flourishing from the early 15th to late 16th centuries, occurring in the Italian peninsula, which was at that time divided into many political states, some independent but others controlled by external powers. The painters of Renaissance Italy, although often attached to particular courts and with loyalties to particular towns, nonetheless wandered the length and breadth of Italy, often occupying a diplomatic status and disseminating artistic and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Antonello da Messina who travelled from Sicily to Venice via Naples.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Florence]] in [[Tuscany]] is renowned as the birthplace of the [[Renaissance]], and in particular of Renaissance painting, although later in the era Rome and Venice assumed increasing importance in painting. A detailed background is given in the companion articles Renaissance and [[Renaissance architecture]].

Italian Renaissance painting is most often be divided into four periods: the Proto-Renaissance (1300–1425), the Early Renaissance (1425–1495), the [[High Renaissance]] (1495–1520), and [[Mannerism]] (1520–1600). The dates for these periods represent the overall trend in Italian painting and do not cover all painters as the lives of individual artists and their personal styles overlapped these periods.  

The Proto-Renaissance begins with the professional life of the painter [[Giotto]] and includes [[Taddeo Gaddi]], [[Orcagna]] and [[Altichiero]].
The Early Renaissance style was started by [[Masaccio]] and then further developed by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Verrocchio]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]].  The High Renaissance period was that of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Coreggio]], [[Giorgione]], the latter works of [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]].  The Mannerist period, dealt with in a separate article, included the latter works of [[Michelangelo]], as well as [[Pontormo]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Bronzino]] and [[Tintoretto]].

The influences upon the development of Renaissance painting in Italy are those that also affected Philosophy, Literature, Architecture, Theology, Science, Government and other aspects of society. The following is a summary of points dealt with more fully in the main articles that are cited above.

===Philosophy===
A number of Classical texts, that had been lost to Western European scholars for centuries, became available. These included Philosophy, Poetry, Drama, Science, a thesis on the Arts and Early Christian Theology.  The resulting interest in [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosophy meant that man's relationship with humanity, the universe and with God was no longer the exclusive province of the Church. A revived interest in the [[Classical literature|Classics]] brought about the first archaeological study of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and sculptor [[Donatello]]. The revival of a style of architecture based on classical precedents inspired a corresponding classicism in painting, which manifested itself as early as the 1420s in the paintings of [[Masaccio]] and [[Paolo Uccello]].

===Science and technology===
Simultaneous with gaining access to the Classical texts, Europe gained access to advanced mathematics which had its provenance in the works of [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine]] and Islamic scholars.
The advent of movable type [[printing]] in the 15th century meant that ideas could be disseminated easily, and an increasing number of books were written for a broad public. The development of [[oil paint]] and its introduction to Italy had lasting effects on the art of painting.

===Society===
The establishment of the [[Medici]] Bank and the subsequent trade it generated brought unprecedented wealth to a single Italian city, [[Florence]]. [[Cosimo de' Medici the Elder|Cosimo de' Medici]] set a new standard for patronage of the arts, not associated with the church or monarchy. The [[serendipity|serendipitous]] presence within the region of [[Florence]] of certain individuals of artistic genius, most notably [[Giotto]], [[Masaccio]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], formed an ethos that supported and encouraged many lesser artists to achieve work of extraordinary quality.&lt;ref name=Hartt&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar heritage of artistic achievement occurred in [[Venice]] through the talented [[Jacopo Bellini|Bellini]] family, their influential inlaw [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]] and [[Tintoretto]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB&gt;Michael Baxandall, ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Aston, ''The Fifteenth Century, the Prospect of Europe'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

Much painting of the Renaissance period was commissioned by or for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. These works were often of large scale and were frequently cycles painted in [[fresco]] of ''the Life of Christ'', the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' or the life of a saint, particularly [[St. Francis of Assisi]]. There were also many [[allegory|allegorical]] paintings on the theme of [[Salvation]] and the role of the Church in attaining it. Churches also commissioned [[altarpiece]]s, which were painted in [[tempera]] on [[panel painting|panel]] and later in [[oil paint|oil]] on [[canvas]]. Apart from large altarpieces, small devotional pictures were produced in very large numbers, both for churches and for private individuals, the most common theme being the ''Madonna and Child''.

Throughout the period, civic commissions were also important. Local government buildings were decorated with frescoes and other works both secular, such as [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''[[The Allegory of Good and Bad Government]]'', and religious, such as [[Simone Martini]]'s fresco of the ''[[Maestà (Simone Martini)|Maestà]]'', in the [[Palazzo Pubblico]], [[Siena]].

Portraiture was uncommon in the 14th and early 15th centuries, mostly limited to civic commemorative pictures such as the equestrian portraits of Guidoriccio da Fogliano by [[Simone Martini]], 1327, in Siena and, of the early 15th century, [[John Hawkwood]] by [[Uccello]] in [[Florence Cathedral]] and its companion portraying [[Niccolò da Tolentino]] by [[Andrea del Castagno]].

During the 15th century portraiture became common, initially often formalised profile portraits but increasingly three-quarter face, bust-length portraits. Patrons of art works such as altarpieces and fresco cycles often were included in the scenes, a notable example being the inclusion of the Sassetti and [[Medici]] families in [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s cycle in the [[Sassetti Chapel]]. Portraiture was to become a major subject for High Renaissance painters such as [[Raphael]] and [[Titian]] and continue into the Mannerist period in works of artists such as [[Bronzino]].

With the growth of [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanism]], artists turned to Classical themes, particularly to fulfill commissions for the decoration of the homes of wealthy patrons, the best known being [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]] ''for the Medici. Increasingly, Classical themes were also seen as providing suitable allegorical material for civic commissions. Humanism also influenced the manner in which religious themes were depicted, notably on [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Sistine Chapel ceiling|Ceiling of the Sistine Chapel]]''.

Other motifs were drawn from contemporary life, sometimes with allegorical meaning, some sometimes purely decorative. Incidents important to a particular family might be recorded like those in the ''[[Camera degli Sposi]]'' that [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] painted for the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] family at [[Mantua]]. Increasingly, still lifes and decorative scenes from life were painted, such as ''the Concert'' by [[Lorenzo Costa]] of about 1490.

Important events were often recorded or commemorated in paintings such as Uccello's ''[[Battle of San Romano]]'', as were important local religious festivals. History and historic characters were often depicted in a way that reflected on current events or on the lives of current people. Portraits were often painted of contemporaries in the guise of characters from history or literature.  The writings of [[Dante]], Voragine's ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and [[Boccaccio]]'s Decameron were important sources of themes.

In all these subjects, increasingly, and in the works of almost all painters, certain underlying painterly practices were being developed: the observation of nature, the study of anatomy, of light, and perspective.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Christiansen, ''Italian Painting'', (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions of 13th-century Tuscan painting===
The art of the region of Tuscany in the late 13th century was dominated by two masters of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] style, [[Cimabue]] of [[Florence]] and [[Duccio]] of [[Siena]]. Their commissions were mostly religious paintings, several of them being very large altarpieces showing the Madonna and Child. These two painters, with their contemporaries, [[Guido of Siena]], [[Coppo di Marcovaldo]] and the mysterious painter upon whose style the school may have been based, the so-called Master of St Bernardino, all worked in a manner that was highly formalised and dependent upon the ancient tradition of icon painting.&lt;ref&gt;John White, ''Duccio'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; In these [[tempera]] paintings many of the details were rigidly fixed by the subject matter, the precise position of the hands of the Madonna and Christ Child, for example, being dictated by the nature of the blessing that the painting invoked upon the viewer. The angle of the Virgin's head and shoulders, the folds in her veil, and the lines with which her features were defined had all been repeated in countless such paintings. Cimabue and Duccio took steps in the direction of greater naturalism, as did their contemporary, [[Pietro Cavallini]] of Rome.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

===Giotto===
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -36- - Lamentation (The Mourning of Christ) adj.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|[[Giotto]]: ''The Lamentation'', c. 1305, [[Scrovegni Chapel]], foreshadows the Renaissance.|alt= Square fresco.

Joseph of Arimethea holds the shroud. In Heaven, small angels are shrieking and tearing their hair.]]
[[Giotto]], (1266–1337), by tradition a shepherd boy from the hills north of Florence, became Cimabue's apprentice and emerged as the most outstanding painter of his time.&lt;ref name=Vasari&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'', (1568)&lt;/ref&gt; Giotto, possibly influenced by [[Pietro Cavallini]] and other Roman painters, did not base the figures he painted upon any painterly tradition, but upon the observation of life. Unlike those of his Byzantine contemporaries, Giotto's figures are solidly three-dimensional; they stand squarely on the ground, have discernible anatomy and are clothed in garments with weight and structure. But more than anything, what set Giotto's figures apart from those of his contemporaries are their emotions. In the faces of Giotto's figures are joy, rage, despair, shame, spite and love. The cycle of [[fresco]]es of ''the Life of Christ'' and ''the Life of the Virgin'' that he painted in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] set a new standard for narrative pictures. His ''Ognissanti Madonna'' hangs in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence, in the same room as Cimabue's ''Santa Trinita Madonna'' and Duccio's ''Ruccellai Madonna'' where the stylistic comparisons between the three can easily be made.&lt;ref&gt;All three are reproduced and compared at [[Italian Renaissance painting, development of themes]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the features apparent in Giotto's work is his observation of naturalistic perspective. He is regarded as the herald of the Renaissance.&lt;ref name=Eimerl&gt;Sarel Eimerl, The World of Giotto, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

A blaze of yellow light comes from the upper right from an angel not visible in this detail. A startled shepherd lying on the ground is twisting around to see the angel. The light from the angel touches the mountainside, figures and sheep.]]

===Giotto's contemporaries===
Giotto had a number of contemporaries who were either trained and influenced by him,  or whose observation of nature had led them in a similar direction. Although several of Giotto's pupils assimilated the direction that his work had taken, none was to become as successful as he. [[Taddeo Gaddi]] achieved the first large painting of a night scene in an ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' in the [[Baroncelli Chapel]] of the Church of Santa Croce, Florence.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

The paintings in the ''Upper Church'' of the [[Basilica of St. Francis, Assisi]], are examples of naturalistic painting of the period, often ascribed to Giotto himself, but more probably the work of artists surrounding [[Pietro Cavallini]].&lt;ref name=Eimerl/&gt; A late painting by [[Cimabue]] in the ''Lower Church'' at Assisi, of the ''Madonna and St. Francis'', also clearly shows greater naturalism than his panel paintings and the remains of his earlier frescoes in the upper church.

===Mortality and redemption===
[[File:Orcagna Triumph of Death detail 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|[[Orcagna]]: ''The Triumph of Death'' (detail), c.&amp;nbsp;1350, Museum of Santa Croce|alt= A small section of a badly damaged fresco showing people who are doomed to Hell. While horrible demons are clutching at them, the humans are intent on pursuing their evil ways of murder and seduction, seeming ignorant of their precarious state on the edge of a pit.]]
A common theme in the decoration of Medieval churches was the ''[[Last Judgement]]'', which in northern European churches frequently occupies a sculptural space above the west door, but in Italian churches such as Giotto's [[Scrovegni Chapel]], is painted on the inner west wall. The [[Black Death]] of 1348 caused its survivors to focus on the need to approach death in a state of penitence and absolution. The inevitability of death, the rewards for the penitent and the penalties of sin were emphasised in a number of frescoes, remarkable for their grim depictions of suffering and their surreal images of the torments of [[Hell]].

These include the ''Triumph of Death'' by Giotto's pupil [[Orcagna]], now in a fragmentary state at the Museum of Santa Croce, and the ''Triumph of Death'' in the [[Camposanto Monumentale]] at [[Pisa]] by an unknown painter, perhaps [[Francesco Traini]] or [[Buonamico Buffalmacco]] who worked on the other three of a series of frescoes on the subject of Salvation. It is unknown exactly when these frescoes were begun but it is generally presumed they post-date 1348.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

Two important fresco painters were active in [[Padua]] in the late 14th century, [[Altichiero]] and [[Giusto de' Menabuoi]]. Giusto's masterpiece, the decoration of the [[Padua Cathedral|Cathedral]]'s Baptistery, follows the theme of humanity's Creation, Downfall and Salvation, also having a rare [[Apocalypse]] cycle in the small chancel. While the whole work is exceptional for its breadth, quality and intact state, the treatment of human emotion is conservative by comparison with that of [[Altichiero]]'s ''Crucifixion'' at the [[Basilica of Sant'Antonio]], also in [[Padua]]. Giusto's work relies on formalised gestures, where Altichiero relates the incidents surrounding Christ's death with great human drama and intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Mgr. Giovanni Foffani, ''Frescoes by Giusto de' Menabuoi'', (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Simone Martini 077.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.50|[[Simone Martini]]: ''The Annunciation'', 1333, Uffizi, is International Gothic in style.|alt= An altarpiece with a golden background and a frame surmounted by five richly carved Gothic pediments.

The figures are elongated, stylised and marked by elegance. There are saints in the side panels.]]

In Florence, at the ''Spanish Chapel'' of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Novella|Santa Maria Novella]], Andrea Bonaiuti&lt;!---don't link because it goes to the wrong page.---&gt; was commissioned to emphasise the role of the Church in the redemptive process, and that of the [[Dominican Order]] in particular. His fresco ''Allegory of the Active and Triumphant Church'' is remarkable for its depiction of [[Florence Cathedral]], complete with the dome which was not built until the following century.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

===International Gothic===
During the later 14th century, [[International Gothic]] was the style that dominated Tuscan painting.  It can be seen to an extent in the work of Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which is marked by a formalized sweetness and grace in the figures, and Late Gothic gracefulness in the draperies. The style is fully developed in the works of [[Simone Martini]] and [[Gentile da Fabriano]], which have an elegance and a richness of detail, and an idealised quality not compatible with the starker realities of Giotto's paintings.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

In the early 15th century, bridging the gap between International Gothic and the Renaissance are the paintings of [[Fra Angelico]], many of which, being altarpieces in tempera, show the Gothic love of elaboration, gold leaf and brilliant colour. It is in his frescoes at his [[convent]] of Sant' Marco that Fra Angelico shows himself the artistic disciple of [[Giotto]]. These devotional paintings, which adorn the cells and corridors inhabited by the friars, represent episodes from the life of [[Jesus]], many of them being scenes of ''[[the Crucifixion]]''. They are starkly simple, restrained in colour and intense in mood as the artist sought to make spiritual revelations a visual reality.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, ''Art through the Ages'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florence===
The earliest truly Renaissance images in Florence date from 1401, although they are not paintings. That year a competition was held amongst seven young artists to select the artist to create a pair of bronze doors for the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistry of St. John]], the oldest remaining church in the city.  The competitors were each to design a bronze panel of similar shape and size, representing ''the Sacrifice of Isaac''.

Two of the panels from the competition have survived, those by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. Each panel shows some strongly classicising motifs indicating the direction that art and philosophy were moving, at that time. Ghiberti used the naked figure of Isaac to create a small sculpture in the Classical style. The figure kneels on a tomb decorated with acanthus scrolls that are also a reference to the art of Ancient Rome. In Brunelleschi's panel, one of the additional figures included in the scene is reminiscent of a well-known Roman bronze figure of a boy pulling a thorn from his foot. Brunelleschi's creation is challenging in its dynamic intensity. Less elegant than Ghiberti's, it is more about human drama and impending tragedy.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M&gt;R.E. Wolf and R. Millen, ''Renaissance and Mannerist Art'', (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghiberti won the competition. His first set of [[Baptistry doors]] took 27 years to complete, after which he was commissioned to make another. In the total of 50 years that Ghiberti worked on them, the doors provided a training ground for many of the artists of Florence. Being narrative in subject and employing not only skill in arranging figurative compositions but also the burgeoning skill of [[linear perspective]], the doors were to have an enormous influence on the development of Florentine pictorial art.

===Masaccio - Brancacci Chapel===
{{main|Brancacci Chapel}}

The first Early Rennaissance frescos or paintings were in started in 1425 when two artists commenced painting a fresco cycle of ''the Life of St. Peter'' in the chapel of the Brancacci family, at the Carmelite Church in Florence. They both were called by the name of Tommaso and were nicknamed [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]], Slovenly Tom and Little Tom.

More than any other artist, Masaccio recognized the implications in the work of Giotto. He carried forward the practice of painting from nature. His frescos demonstrate an understanding of anatomy, of foreshortening, of linear perspective, of light, and the study of drapery. In the [[Brancacci Chapel]], his ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|Tribute Money]]'' fresco has a single vanishing point and uses a strong contrast between light and dark to convey a three-dimensional quality to the work.  As well, the figures of ''[[Adam and Eve]] being expelled from Eden'', painted on the side of the arch into the chapel, are renowned for their realistic depiction of the human form and of human emotion. They contrast with the gentle and pretty figures painted by Masolino on the opposite side of ''Adam and Eve receiving the forbidden fruit''. The painting of the Brancacci Chapel was left incomplete when Masaccio died at 26 in 1428. The ''Tribute Money'' was completed by Masolino while the remainder of the work in the Chapel was finished by [[Filippino Lippi]] in the 1480s. Masaccio's work became a source of inspiration to many later painters, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name=OC&gt;Ornella Casazza, ''Masaccio and the Brancacci Chapel'', (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of linear perspective===

The Virgin Mary, as a small child and encouraged by her parents, is walking up the steps towards the High Priest.]]
During the first half of the 15th century, the achieving of the effect of realistic space in a painting by the employment of [[linear perspective]] was a major preoccupation of many painters, as well as the architects [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] who both theorised about the subject. Brunelleschi is known to have done a number of careful studies of the piazza and octagonal baptistery outside [[Florence Cathedral]] and it is thought he aided Masaccio in the creation of his famous [[trompe l'oeil]] niche around the ''Holy Trinity'' he painted at [[Santa Maria Novella]].&lt;ref name=OC/&gt;

According to Vasari, [[Paolo Uccello]] was so obsessed with perspective that he thought of little else and experimented with it in many paintings, the best known being the three [[Battle of San Romano]] paintings (completed by 1450s) which use broken weapons on the ground, and fields on the distant hills to give an impression of perspective.

In the 1450s [[Piero della Francesca]], in paintings such as ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation of Christ]]'', demonstrated his mastery over linear perspective and also over the science of light. Another painting exists, a cityscape, by an unknown artist, perhaps Piero della Francesca, that demonstrates the sort of experiment that Brunelleschi had been making. From this time linear perspective was understood and regularly employed, such as  by [[Perugino]] in his ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter]]'' (1481-82) in the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;

===Understanding of light===
[[Giotto]] used tonality to create form. [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in his nocturnal scene in the Baroncelli Chapel demonstrated how light could be used to create drama. [[Paolo Uccello]], a hundred years later, experimented with the dramatic effect of light in some of his almost monochrome frescoes. He did a number of these in ''terra verde'' or "green earth", enlivening his compositions with touches of vermilion. The best known is his equestrian portrait of [[John Hawkwood]] on the wall of [[Florence Cathedral]]. Both here and on the four heads of prophets that he painted around the inner clockface in the cathedral, he used strongly contrasting tones, suggesting that each figure was being lit by a natural light source, as if the source was an actual window in the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Annarita Paolieri, ''Paolo Uccello, Domenico Veneziano, Andrea del Castagno'', (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piero della Francesca]] carried his study of light further. In the ''Flagellation'' he demonstrates a knowledge of how light is proportionally disseminated from its point of origin. There are two sources of light in this painting, one internal to a building and the other external. Of the internal source, though the light itself is invisible, its position can be calculated with mathematical certainty. Leonardo da Vinci was to carry forward Piero's work on light.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Murray and Pier Luigi Vecchi, Piero della Francesca, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], revered by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] worldwide, was particularly evoked in Florence, where there was a miraculous image of her on a column in the corn market and where both the Cathedral of "Our Lady of the Flowers" and the large Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] were named in her honour.

The miraculous image in the corn market was destroyed by fire, but replaced with a new image in the 1330s by [[Bernardo Daddi]], set in an elaborately designed and lavishly wrought canopy by [[Orcagna]]. The open lower storey of the building was enclosed and dedicated as [[Orsanmichele]].

Depictions of the [[Madonna and Child]] were a very popular art form in Florence. They took every shape from small mass-produced terracotta plaques to magnificent altarpieces such as those by [[Cimabue]], [[Giotto]] and [[Masaccio]].

In the 15th and first half of the 16th centuries, one workshop more than any other dominated the production of Madonnas. They were the della Robbia family, and they were not painters but modellers in clay. [[Luca della Robbia]], famous for his ''cantoria gallery'' at the cathedral, was the first sculptor to use glazed terracotta for large sculptures. Many of the durable works of this family have survived. The skill of the della Robbias, particularly [[Andrea della Robbia]], was to give great naturalism to the babies that they modelled as [[Jesus]], and expressions of great piety and sweetness to the Madonna. They were to set a standard to be emulated by other artists of Florence.

Among those who painted devotional Madonnas during the Early Renaissance are [[Fra Angelico]], [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], [[Verrocchio]] and [[Davide Ghirlandaio]]. The custom was continued by Botticelli who produced a series of Madonnas over a period of twenty years for the [[Medici]]; [[Perugino]], whose Madonnas and saints are known for their sweetness and  [[Leonardo da Vinci]], for whom a number of small attributed Madonnas such as the ''[[Benois Madonna]]'' have survived. Even [[Michelangelo]] who was primarily a sculptor, was persuaded to paint the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'', while for [[Raphael]], they are among his most popular and numerous works.

===Andrea Mantegna in Padua and Mantua===
One of the most influential painters of northern Italy was [[Andrea Mantegna]] of [[Padua]], who had the good fortune to be in his teen years at the time in which the great Florentine sculptor [[Donatello]] was working there. Donatello created the enormous equestrian bronze, the first since the Roman Empire, of the condotiero [[Erasmo da Narni|Gattemelata]], still visible on its plinth in the square outside the [[Basilica of Sant'Antonio]]. He also worked on the high altar and created a series of bronze panels in which he achieved a remarkable illusion of depth, with perspective in the architectural settings and apparent roundness of the human form all in very shallow relief.

At only 17 years old, Mantegna accepted his first commission, fresco cycles of the ''Lives of Saints James and Christopher'' for the [[Ovetari Chapel]] in the transept of the[[church of the Eremitani]], near the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in Padua. Unfortunately the building was mostly destroyed during World War II, and they are only known from photographs which reveal an already highly developed sense of perspective and a knowledge of antiquity, for which the ancient University of Padua had become well known, early in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;Diana Davies, Harrap's Illustrated Dictionary of Art and Artists, (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
Mantegna's last work in Padua was a monumental  [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno altarpiece]], created for the abbot of the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], [[Verona]] from 1457 to 1459.&lt;ref name=EL/&gt; This polyptych of which the predella panels are particularly notable for the handling of landscape elements, was to influence the further development of Renaissance art in Northern Italy&lt;ref name=EL&gt;Elena Lanzanova, trans. Giorgina Arcuri, ''[http://www.arcadja.com/artmagazine/en/2008/06/23/restoration-of-mantegna’s-san-zeno-altarpiece-in-florence/ Restoration Of Mantegna’S San Zeno Altarpiece In Florence]'', Arcadja, (2008-06-23), (accessed: 2012-07-13)&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110000960 metmuseum Madonna and Child with Saints Girolamo dai Libri  (Italian, Verona 1474–1555 Verona), edit: 2000–2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantegna's most famous work is the interior decoration of the [[Camera degli Sposi]] for the [[Gonzaga family]] in [[Mantua]], dated about 1470. The walls are frescoed with scenes of the life of the Gonzaga family, talking, greeting a younger son and his tutor on their return from Rome, preparing for a hunt and other such scenes that make no obvious reference to matters historic, literary, philosophic or religious. They are remarkable for simply being about family life. The one concession is the scattering of jolly winged cherubs who hold up plaques and garlands and clamber on the illusionistic pierced balustrade that surrounds a [[trompe l'oeil]] view of the sky that decks the ceiling of the chamber.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;  Mantegna's main legacy in considered the introduction of spatial illusionism, carried out by a mastery of perspective, both in frescoes and in ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' paintings: his tradition of ceiling decoration was followed for almost three centuries.

===Antonello da Messina===
In 1442 [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] became [[Kingdom of Naples|ruler of Naples]], bringing with him a collection of [[Flemish painting]]s and setting up a [[Humanism|Humanist Academy]]. [[Antonello da Messina]] seems to have had access to the King's collection, which may have included the works of [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Rachum, ''The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence indicates that Antonello was likely in contact with Van Eyck's most accomplished follower, [[Petrus Christus]], in Milan in early 1456 and likely learned the techniques of oil painting, including painting almost microscopic detail and minute gradations of light, directly from Christus.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt;  As well, his works' calmer expressions on peoples' faces and calmness in the works' overall composition also appears to be a Netherlandish influence.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361)&lt;/ref&gt; Antonello went to [[Venice]] in 1475 and remained there until the fall of 1476 so it is likely that Antonello passed on the techniques of using oil paints,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361; Hartt pg. 563&lt;/ref&gt; painting the gradation of light, and the principles of calmness to Venetian Painters, including Giovanni Bellini, one of the most significant painters of the High Renaissance in Northern Italy, during that visit.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 563; Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Antonello painted mostly small meticulous portraits in glowing colours. But one of his most famous works, ''[[St. Jerome in His Study (Antonello da Messina)|St. Jerome in His Study]]'', demonstrates his superior ability at handling linear perspective and light. The composition of the small painting is framed by a late Gothic arch, through which is viewed an interior, domestic on one side and ecclesiastic on the other, in the centre of which the saint sits in a wooden corral surrounded by his possessions while his lion prowls in the shadows on the floor. The way the light streams in through every door and window casting both natural and reflected light across the architecture and all the objects would have excited [[Piero della Francesca]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; 

==Progression Towards the High Renaissance==

===Patronage and Humanism===

In Florence, in the later 15th century, most works of art, even those that were done as decoration for churches, were generally commissioned and paid for by private patrons. Much of the patronage came from the Medici family, or those who were closely associated with or related to them, such as the Sassetti, the Ruccellai and the Tornabuoni.

In the 1460s Cosimo de' Medici the Elder had established [[Marsilio Ficino]] as his resident [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosopher, and facilitated his translation of [[Plato]] and his teaching of [[Platonic philosophy]], which focused on humanity as the centre of the natural universe, on each person's personal relationship with God, and on fraternal or "platonic" love as being the closest that a person could get to emulating or understanding the love of God.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;Hugh Ross Williamson, ''Lorenzo the Magnificent'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Medieval]] period, everything related to the Classical period was perceived as associated with paganism. In the Renaissance it came increasingly to be associated with enlightenment. The figures of [[Classical mythology]] began to take on a new symbolic role in Christian art and in particular, the Goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] took on a new discretion. Born fully formed, by a sort of miracle, she was the new [[Eve]], symbol of innocent love, or even, by extension, a symbol of the [[Virgin Mary]] herself. We see Venus in both these roles in the two famous tempera paintings that Botticelli did in the 1480s for Cosimo's nephew, Pierfrancesco Medici, the ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' and the ''[[Birth of Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Baldini, ''Primavera'', (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], a meticulous and accurate draughtsman and one of the finest portrait painters of his age, executed two cycles of frescoes for Medici associates in two of Florence's larger churches, the [[Sassetti Chapel]] at Santa Trinita and the [[Tornabuoni Chapel]] at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. In these cycles of the ''Life of St Francis'' and the ''Life of the Virgin Mary'' and ''Life of John the Baptist'' there was room for portraits of patrons and of the patrons' patrons. Thanks to Sassetti's patronage, there is a portrait of the man himself, with his employer, [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]], and Lorenzo's three sons with their tutor, the Humanist poet and philosopher, [[Agnolo Poliziano]]. In the Tornabuoni Chapel is another portrait of Poliziano, accompanied by the other influential members of the Platonic Academy including Marsilio Ficino.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

===Flemish influence===
From about 1450, with the arrival in Italy of the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Flemish painter]] [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and possibly earlier, artists were introduced to the medium of [[oil paint]]. Whereas both tempera and fresco lent themselves to the depiction of pattern, neither presented a successful way to represent natural textures realistically. The highly flexibly medium of oils, which could be made opaque or transparent, and allowed alteration and additions for days after it had been laid down, opened a new world of possibility to Italian artists.

In 1483 the huge altarpiece of ''[[Portinari Altarpiece|the Adoration of the Shepherds]]'' painted by [[Hugo van der Goes]] arrived in Florence. Painted as early as 1475 at the behest of the Portinari family, it was shipped out from Bruges and installed in the Chapel of Sant' Egidio at the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. The altarpiece glows with intense reds and greens, contrasting with the glossy black velvet robes of the Portinari donors. In the foreground is a [[still life]] of flowers in contrasting containers, one of glazed pottery and the other of glass. The glass vase alone was enough to excite attention. But the most influential aspect of the triptych was the extremely natural and lifelike quality of the three shepherds with stubbly beards, workworn hands and expressions ranging from adoration to wonder to incomprehension. [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] promptly painted his own version, with a beautiful Italian Madonna in place of the long-faced Flemish one, and himself, gesturing theatrically, as one of the shepherds.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;

===Papal commission===
[[File:Entrega de las llaves a San Pedro (Perugino).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Perugino: ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to Peter (Sistine Chapel)|Christ Giving the Keys to Peter]]''|alt=Rectangular fresco. The scene is like Raphael's Marriage of the Virgin, above, which is based on it. There is a similar townscape and circular building in perspective, with an ancient Roman triumphal arch to either side. In the foreground, Jesus gives the keys of Heaven to St Peter, who is kneeling. To the right and left stand the other disciples and some onlookers, who are distinguished by Renaissance clothing. There are many more small figures in the square behind them.]]In 1477 [[Pope Sixtus IV]] replaced the derelict old chapel at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] in which many of the papal services were held. The interior of the new chapel, named the [[Sistine Chapel]] in his honour, appears to have been planned from the start to have a series of 16 large frescoes between its pilasters on the middle level, with a series of painted portraits of popes above them.

In 1480, a group of artists from Florence was commissioned with the work: Botticelli, [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]]. This fresco cycle was to depict ''Stories of the Life of Moses'' on one side of the chapel, and ''Stories of the Life of Christ'' on the other with the frescoes complementing each other in theme. ''The Nativity of Jesus'' and the ''Finding of Moses'' were adjacent on the wall behind the altar, with an [[altarpiece]] of the ''Assumption of the Virgin''  between them. These  paintings, all by Perugino, were later  destroyed to paint Michelangelo's ''Last Judgement''.[[File:Ghirlandaio,_Domenico_-_Calling_of_the_Apostles_-_1481.jpg|thumb|380px|Domenico Ghirlandaio and workshop:''[[Vocation of the Apostles]]'', [[Sistine Chapel]]|alt=Rectangular fresco]]
The remaining 12 pictures indicate the virtuosity that these artists had attained, and the obvious cooperation between individuals who normally employed very different styles and skills. 
The paintings gave full range to their capabilities as they included a great number of figures of men, women and children and characters ranging from guiding angels to enraged [[Pharaoh]]s and the devil himself. Each painting required a [[landscape]]. Because of the scale of the figures that the artists agreed upon, in each picture, the landscape and sky take up the whole upper half of the scene. Sometimes, as in [[Botticelli]]'s scene of ''The Purification of the Leper'', there are additional small narratives taking place in the landscape, in this case ''[[The Temptation of Christ (Sistine Chapel)|The Temptations of Christ]]''.

[[Perugino]]'s scene of ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to Peter (Perugino)|Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter]]''  is remarkable for the clarity and simplicity of its composition, the beauty of the figurative painting, which includes a self-portrait among the onlookers, and especially the perspective cityscape which includes reference to Peter's ministry to Rome by the presence of two [[triumphal arch]]es, and centrally placed an octagonal building that might be a Christian [[baptistry]] or a Roman [[Mausoleum]].&lt;ref name=Giaco&gt;{{cite book|first=Massimo|last= Giacometti|title=The Sistine Chapel|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Renaissance painting==

The High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundrum "Early Renaissance" and "Renaissance and Mannerism" in ''Masterpieces of Western Art'', Tashen, 2007. Page 147&lt;/ref&gt; and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Raunch "Painting of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy" in ''The Italian Renaissance: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Drawing'', Konemann, Cologne, 1995. Pg. 308; Wundrum Pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; the realistic depiction of both physical&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  and psychological features,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, [[sfumato]] (softening the transition between colours) and [[chiaroscuro]] (contrast between light and dark),&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 148; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; in a single unifying style&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture''; Harry N. Abrams Incorporated, New York, 1985, pg. 601; Wundrum pg. 147; Marilyn Stokstad ''Art History'', Third Edition, Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey, 2008. pg 659&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to a dynamic whole.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, pg. 659 and 662&lt;/ref&gt; Painting of the High Renaissance is considered to be the absolute zenith of western painting&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 145 &lt;/ref&gt; and achieved the balancing and reconciliation, in harmony, of contradictory and seemingly mutually exclusive artistic positions, such as real versus ideal, movement versus rest, freedom versus law, space versus plane, and line versus colour.&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most art historians state that the High Renaissance started around 1495 or 1500&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; David Piper, ''The Illustrated History of Art'', Crescent Books, New York, 1991, pg. 129; Jacob Burchhardt, '' Cinerone'' 1841; Franz Kugler ''Handbook of Art History'' 1841.&lt;/ref&gt; and ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael,&lt;ref&gt;Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; Piper pg. 129; Wurdram pg. 147; Johann Joachim Winklemann, ''Lives of Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects'' 1672.&lt;/ref&gt; although some say the High Renaissance ended about 1525&lt;ref&gt;Kugler; Honour and Flemming, pg. 466&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1527 with the Sack of Rome by the army of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]],&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Lanzi.&lt;/ref&gt; or about 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 310&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cite Leonardo da Vinci's the [[Last Supper|''Last Supper'']], started in 1495 and completed in 1498, as being the first work of the High Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; Piper pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture and Architecture'', 1985, Frederick Hartt states that 1520 to 1530 was a transition period between the High Renaissance and Mannerism.  The High Renaissance was dominated by three painters - Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael; while Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and Titian were the leaders of Venetian High Renaissance painting, with Correggio and Andrea de Sarto being other significant painters of the High Renaissance style.

===Leonardo da Vinci===
[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]] (1452-1519) spent his formative years training in the [[Florence]] workshop of [[Verrocchio]] before moving Milan where he worked from 1482-1499 before spending 1500-1506 back in Florence.  Because of the scope of his interests and the extraordinary degree of talent that he demonstrated in so many diverse areas, he is regarded as the archetypal "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]". But it was first and foremost as a painter that he was admired in his own time, and as a painter, he drew on the knowledge he gained from his other interests.
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci 002.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Leonardo da Vinci: ''[[The Last Supper (da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]''|alt= Rectangular fresco, in very damaged condition, of the Last Supper. The scene shows a table across a room which has three windows at the rear. At the centre, Jesus sits, stretching out his hands, the left palm up and the right down. Around the table, are the disciples, twelve men of different ages. They are all reacting in surprise or dismay at what Jesus has just said. The different emotional reactions and gestures are portrayed with great naturalism.]]
Leonardo was a scientific observer. He learned by looking at things. He studied and drew the flowers of the fields, the eddies of the river, the form of the rocks and mountains, the way light reflected from foliage and sparkled in a jewel. In particular, he studied the human form, dissecting thirty or more unclaimed [[cadaver]]s from a hospital in order to understand muscles and sinews.

Leonardo achieved a degree of realism in the expression of human emotion, prefigured by Giotto but unknown since Masaccio's ''Adam and Eve''. Leonardo's ''Last Supper'', painted from 1495-1498 in the refectory of a monastery in Milan, became the benchmark for religious narrative painting for the next half millennium.  Many other Renaissance artists painted versions of ''the Last Supper'', but only Leonardo's was destined to be reproduced countless times in wood, alabaster, plaster, lithograph, tapestry, crochet and table-carpets.

More than any other artist, he advanced the study and painting of "atmosphere". In his paintings such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' (c.1503-1517) and ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' (1483-1486) (the earliest complete work fully of his hand), he used light and shade with such subtlety that, for want of a better word, it became known as Leonardo's "sfumato" or "smoke".  He exhibited a revolutionary use of colour by defining the transition between figures by colour modulation instead of by actual lines.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; His work invited the viewer into a mysterious world of shifting shadows, chaotic mountains and whirling torrents.  Another significant work of Leonardo's was ''[[The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]]'' (c.1503-1519); the monumental three-dimensional quality of the group and the calculated effects of dynamism and tension in the composition made it a model that inspired Classicists and the Mannerists in equal measure.&lt;ref&gt;"Leonardo da Vinci" in ''Encyclopedia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the direct impact of the works themselves, Leonardo's studies of light, anatomy, landscape, and human expression were disseminated in part through his generosity to a retinue of students.&lt;ref&gt; name=Vasari/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michelangelo===
[[File:Creación de Adám.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Michelangelo: ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''|alt= Rectangular fresco. God is in the act of creating the first man, who lies languidly on the ground, propped on one elbow, and reaching towards God. God, shown as a dynamic elderly man, is reaching his hand from Heaven to touch Adam and fill him with life.]]
In 1508 [[Pope Julius II]] succeeded in getting the Florentine sculptor [[Michelangelo]] (1475-1564) to agree to continue the decorative scheme of the Sistine Chapel. The [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] was constructed in such a way that there were twelve sloping pendentives supporting the vault that formed ideal surfaces on which to paint the [[Twelve Apostles]]. Michelangelo soon devised an entirely different scheme, far more complex both in design and in iconography. The scale of the work, which he executed single handed except for manual assistance, was titanic and took nearly five years to complete.

The Pope's plan for the Apostles would thematically have formed a pictorial link between the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] narratives on the walls, and the popes in the gallery of portraits.&lt;ref name=Giaco/&gt; It is the [[twelve apostles]], and their leader Peter as first Bishop of Rome, that make that bridge. But Michelangelo's scheme  went the opposite direction. The theme of Michelangelo's ceiling is not God's grand plan for humanity's salvation. The theme is about humanity's disgrace. It is about why humanity and the faith needed Jesus.&lt;ref name=TLT&gt;T.L.Taylor, ''The Vision of Michelangelo'', Sydney University, (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Superficially, the ceiling is a [[Humanism|Humanist]] construction. The figures are of superhuman dimension and, in the case of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], of such beauty that according to the biographer [[Vasari]], it really looks as if God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, and he certainly has not presented the Humanist ideal of [[platonic love]]. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in as many different forms as there are families.&lt;ref name=TLT/&gt;

Vasari praised Michelangelo's seemingly infinite powers of invention in creating postures for the figures. [[Raphael]], who was given a preview by [[Bramante]] after Michelangelo had downed his brush and stormed off to Bologna in a temper, painted at least two figures in imitation of Michelangelo's prophets, one at the church of Sant' Agostino and the other in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], his portrait of Michelangelo himself in ''[[The School of Athens]]''.&lt;ref name=Giaco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Bartz and Eberhard König, ''Michelangelo'', (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Goldschieder, ''Michelangelo'', (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo's later work, ''The Last Judgement'', painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel between 1534 and 1541, shows a Mannerist style, with generally elongated bodies, which took over from the High Renaissance style between 1520 and 1530.

===Raphael===
With [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]]'s (1483-1520) name is synonymous with the High Renaissance, although he was younger than Michelangelo by 18 years and Leonardo by almost 30 and died at the age of 37 just one year after Leonardo. It cannot be said that he greatly advanced the state of painting as his two famous contemporaries did. Rather, his work was the culmination of all the developments of the High Renaissance.

Raphael was born the son of a painter, so his career path, unlike that of Michelangelo who was the son of minor nobility, was decided without a quarrel. Some years after his father's death he worked in the [[Umbria]]n workshop of [[Perugino]], an excellent painter and a superb technician. His first signed and dated painting, executed at the age of 21, is the ''Betrothal of the Virgin'', which immediately reveals its origins in Perugino's ''Christ giving the Keys to Peter''.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; 

Raphael, who moved to Florence in 1504 and to Rome in 1508, unashamedly drew on the skills of the renowned painters whose lifespans encompassed his. In his works the individual qualities of numerous different painters are drawn together. The rounded forms and luminous colours of Perugino, the lifelike portraiture of Ghirlandaio, the realism and lighting of Leonardo, and the powerful draughtsmanship of Michelangelo became unified in the paintings of Raphael. In his short life he executed a number of large altarpieces, an impressive Classical fresco of the sea nymph, Galatea, outstanding portraits with two popes and a famous writer among them, and, while Michelangelo was painting the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], a series of wall frescoes in the Vatican chambers nearby, of which ''the [[School of Athens]]'' (1509-11) in the Stanza della Segnaturais is uniquely significant.

This fresco depicts a meeting of all the most learned ancient Athenians, gathered in a grand classical setting around the central figure of [[Plato]], whom Raphael has famously modelled upon [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The brooding figure of [[Heraclitus]] who sits by a large block of stone, is a portrait of [[Michelangelo]], and is a reference to the latter's painting of the Prophet [[Jeremiah]] in the Sistine Chapel. His own portrait is to the right, beside his teacher, Perugino.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources identify this figure as [[Il Sodoma]], but it is an older, grey-haired man, while Sodoma was in his 30s. Moreover, it strongly resembles several self-portraits of Perugino, who would have been about 60 at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the main source of Raphael's popularity was not his major works, but his small Florentine pictures of the Madonna and Christ Child. Over and over he painted, in slightly different poses, a similar plump, calm-faced blonde woman and her chubby babies the most famous probably being ''La Belle Jardinière'' ("The Madonna of the Beautiful Garden"), now in the [[Louvre]]. His larger work, the ''[[Sistine Madonna]]'', used as a design for countless [[stained glass]] windows, has come, in the 21st century, to provide the iconic image of two small cherubs which has been reproduced on everything from paper table napkins to umbrellas.&lt;ref&gt;David Thompson, ''Raphael, the Life and Legacy'', (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Cuzin, ''Raphael, his Life and Works'', (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giovanni Bellini=== 
[[File:Giovanni bellini, madonna di brera, 1510, 01 adjusted.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Giovanni Bellini: ''[[Madonna and Child (Bellini, Milan, 1510)|The Brera Madonna]]'']]
[[File:Pala di San Zaccaria (Venezia).jpg|thumb|upright=1.40|[[Giovanni Bellini]], ''The [[San Zaccaria Altarpiece]]''|alt= Oil painting. A large altarpiece in which the Madonna sits on a raised throne, with four saints and an angel as described in the article.]] A leader of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian School]] of painting, [[Giovanni Bellini]] (1430-1516) was born within a year of his brother [[Gentile Bellini|Gentile]], his brother-in-law [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Antonello da Messina]], but lived a decade longer than the first two and almost three decades longer than the latter.  He was painting right up until his death and his works illustrate several influences. His early works show the influence of Mantegna with incisive lines and clearly delineated colours&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 120; Ruanch pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; while after Messina's stay in Venice in 1475-1476 his works adopted a Flemish-like realism and luminous colours, which shows he was highly successful at adopting the techniques of oil painting brought by Messina.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 655; Wundram pg. 120; Hartt pg. 563&lt;/ref&gt; He was first the teacher of [[Giorgione]]&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Titian]]&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; but was later influenced by Giorgione, most notably in adopting tonalism wherein paint is applied in superimposed layers creating a soft diffused effect so figures and landscapes become more unified in atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Mariolina"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|chapter=Giovanni Bellini|title=Pittori del Rinascimento|publisher=Scala|location=Florence|year=2007|isbn=888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi ''One Thousand Years of Painting'', Electa, Milan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bellini became the only great 15th-century painter to cross the threshold from the Early Renaissance to the High Renaissance style with works such as ''[[Portrait of Doge Leonardo Loredan]]'' (1501),&lt;ref&gt; Wundrum Pag. 147 and Pg.121; Hartt, Pg. 645&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the Doge shows a calmness Bellini likely learned from Messina,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Baptism of Christ (Bellini)|Baptism of Christ]]'' (1500–1502). Bellini, like [[Raphael]], also produced numerous small Madonnas in rich glowing colour, usually of more intense tonality than his Florentine counterpart. 

Traditionally, in the painting of altarpieces of the ''Madonna and Child'', the enthroned figure of the Virgin is accompanied by saints, who stand in defined spaces, separated physically in the form of a polytych or defined by painted architectural boundaries. [[Piero della Francesca]] used the Classical niche as a setting for his enthroned Madonnas (with saints grouped around the throne), as [[Masaccio]] had used it as the setting for his ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. 

Bellini used this same form, known as ''Sacred Conversations'', in several of his later altarpieces [[San Zaccaria Altarpiece|such as that]] for the Venetian church of [[San Zaccaria]] (1505). It is a masterful composition which uses tonalism and extends the real architecture of the building into the illusionistic architecture of the painting, making the niche a sort of [[loggia]] opened up to the landscape and to daylight which streams across the figures of the Virgin and Child, the two female saints and the little angel who plays a [[viola]] making them brighter than [[Saint Peter|Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Jerome|Saint Jerome]] in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|title=Giovanni Bellini|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giorgione===

Despite the brevity of his career (he died in 1510 at about 35)&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 682; Hartt pg. 646&lt;/ref&gt; and the low number of works universally agreed to be totally by his hand (as low as 4 or 5),&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; Giorgione is often credited as being the founder of the Venetian High Renaissance style,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 645; Raunch pg. 388; Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; although different scholars cite different reasons for asserting this. 

One is his increasing use of gradations of colour and light (colour modulation), including sfumato, often achieved by tonalism,&lt;ref name="Mariolina"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|chapter=Giovanni Bellini|title=Pittori del Rinascimento|publisher=Scala|location=Florence|year=2007|isbn=888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt; to define the shapes of figures and landscapes and to create an atmosphere wherein all components of the painting are unified.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Wundram pg. 165; Raunch pg.646; Hartt pg. 646&lt;/ref&gt;  Some believe he may have been taught this by Leonardo da Vinci who is said to have visited Venice in 1501.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Wundram pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Castelfranco Madonna]]'', 1505, the use of line and colour modulation are equally balanced but in ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The Tempest]]'', c.1510, colour modulation almost entirely replaces line creating an artistic vision in which humankind and nature are combined.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 145 and pg. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the ''Tempest'' one of the most important paintings produced in Italy as the components are held together by colour and there is a dreamy atmosphere of perfect harmony.&lt;ref&gt; Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; Giorgione was the first painter to assign a leading role to nature&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 103; Stokstad pg. 682; Raunch pg. 388)&lt;/ref&gt; and whenever his paintings feature a landscape it becomes an integral part of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388; Hartt pg. 647; Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Castelfranco Madonna]]'', when compared to Giovanni Bellini's similar The ''[[San Zaccaria Altarpiece]]'', illustrates another innovation of Giorgione - adjusting the directions and positions of the figures, such as the lance held by St. Liberale to the left and the folds in the Madonna's robe being placed in parallel, to more unify the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 648; Luffi pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, Giorgione's paintings are always ambiguous in their meaning and open to different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The Tempest]]'', the naked woman feeding a baby and the clothed man, and a flash of lightning, perhaps represents [[Adam and Eve]] in their post-Eden days, or perhaps it does not.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Another painting attributed to him, ''[[The Three Philosophers]]'', may represent the [[Magi]] planning their journey in search of the infant Christ, or it may not.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Raunch pg. 388)&lt;/ref&gt;  None of Giorgione's paintings has ever had a certain interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until recent years, it had appeared certain that Giorgione painted the very first female nude that stands, or rather, lies, as a subject to be portrayed and admired for beauty alone with the ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'', 1510. While it had been long accepted that Titian finished the landscape of the painting after Giorgione's death, many art scholars are increasingly questioning if Giorgione painted the entire female body.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titian===
[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Titian: ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]]''|alt= whose dynamic three-tier composition and colour scheme established him as the preeminent painter north of Rome.]]

[[Titian]] (c. 1490-1576) trained in the workshop of Giovanni Bellini alongside Giorgione and then assisted Giorgione.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392; Stokstad pg. 684; Hartt pg. 647; Zuffi pg.128&lt;/ref&gt; Following Giorgione’s death, he was the monarch of the Venetian School for over 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; His early work shows strong influences of Bellini and Giorgione,&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 684; Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; but he soon he took the principles of form and colour announced by those two&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647&lt;/ref&gt; and established colour, not line, as the major determinant in painting&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Wundram pg. 176&lt;/ref&gt; thereby consummating the Venetian High Renaissance style.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; He did this by applying colours of paint paste-like in patches alongside each other with loose and sweeping brush strokes.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 393; Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; This brought out the light and colour in equal measure at the same time;&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 396&lt;/ref&gt; he was famous in his own day as the master of light and colour.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 684&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strength of Titian was the composition of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;(Wundram  pg. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pesaro Madonna]], 1519-1526, he moves the Madonna from the centre instead placing her at the upper vertex of a powerful diagonal line (as opposed to the usual vertical or horizontal) which still focuses the attention on the Madonna.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 393; Stokstad 684&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first works to group figures in an circular, ascending  structure.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]], 1516-1518, also features diagonal lines (shaped by the cherubs located around the Virgin) which carries the triumphant message of the painting upward into the upper levels of the Church of Frari in Venice on whose altar it stands.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg.649&lt;/ref&gt; This work was the first to have visual suggestion of movement;&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt; all of Titian’s works have a new dynamism in the movements of people compared to the static elements of other High Renaissance painters.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 176; Raunch pg. 393&lt;/ref&gt; The Assumption of the Virgin also features, like all of his paintings, glowing, deep, rich colours due to Titian’s applying layer after layer of paint, sometimes of different colours.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 649; Stokstad pg. 685&lt;/ref&gt;  

Titian was also the most sought after portraitist of his time and brought portraiture to the same level of esteem as narrative painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Highly notable are the ''[[Equestrian Portrait of Charles V]]'',1548, an equestrian picture in a symphony of purples, and the portrait of Doge [[Andrea Gritti]], ruler of Venice, perhaps Titian's most powerful portrait.  

As Titian aged, he maintained a generally High Renaissance style until his last years, when figure was almost completed dissolved in the movement of colour,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 650&lt;/ref&gt; so he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of Italian painting which had moved almost completely towards Mannerism by 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, Titian can be considered the founder of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correggio===

[[File:Cathedral (Parma) - Assumption by Correggio.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Correggio:  ''[[Assumption of the Virgin]]]]

[[Correggio]] (1489-1534), who never visited Rome, but must have seen the works of the Raphael, Michelangelo and Titian, worked in a personal High Renaissance style in Parma in Northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 638; Raunch pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; He invented the open heaven filled with floating figures church dome which became a hallmark of the 17th Century Baroque period with his [[Vision of St. John on Patmos|''Vision of St. John the Evangelist'']], 1520-1524, in Parma’s San Giovanni Evangelista, and the [[Assumption of the Virgin (Correggio)|''Assumption of the Virgin'']], 1526-1530, in Parma Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 639; Raunch pg. 383; Stokstad pg. 681&lt;/ref&gt;  One art scholar states that in the latter, Correggio creates a “dazzling illusion:  the architecture of the dome seems to dissolve and the form seems to explode through the building drawing the viewer up into the swirling vortex of saints and angels who rush upwards to accompany the Virgin in to heaven.”&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 681&lt;/ref&gt;  

In those domes and other works, his bold use of perspective, usually by setting a dark colour against light colours to enhance the illusion of depth, is described as astonishing.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 638; Zuffi pg. 132; Raunch pg.383; Janson pg. 516&lt;/ref&gt; His chief interest was painting light and he anticipates the effects to be achieved by Caravaggio at the start of the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; His mastery of foreshortening (causing objects to look shorter because they are angled to the viewer) to create perspective is described as perhaps the most skillful ever.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Hartt pg. 638&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[Jupiter and Io]]'', 1531-1532, Correggio painted a strong contrast between the luminous figure of Io and the soft but dark clouds filling the sky,&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 174&lt;/ref&gt; which seem to envelop Io’s gleaming body.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Correggio was able to execute the diffuse effect of clouds, haze or mist perfectly&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; and together with colour modulation infuses his characters with a distinct sense of weightlessness.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 174; Janson pg. 516&lt;/ref&gt;  He painted flesh in a delicate, voluptuous manner that has never been surpassed&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 639&lt;/ref&gt; and presents a new concept of feminine beauty only rediscovered during the Rococo period.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Zuffi pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Correggio had many pupils but none carried on his style but he prefigured many components of Baroque painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Janson pg. 518&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Significant High Renaissance Painters===

[[Andrea del Sarto]] (1486-1530), a Florentine, drew upon both Michelangelo and Raphael in his work, but went far beyond them in the portrayal of facial expressions and gestures, as evidenced in ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'',1517.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 341&lt;/ref&gt; His figures show a greater individuality than earlier High Renaissance works while losing none of the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 341&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s, he remained faithful to the ideals of the High Renaissance, such as in paintings’ compositions&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 166&lt;/ref&gt; and with the faces of his figures usually being calm and often beautiful, showing none of the torment of his Mannerist contemporaries,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 635&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom were his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lorenzo Lotto]] (1480-1556), one of the most important High Renaissance painters in Venice,&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 724&lt;/ref&gt; also spent time in other areas of Northern Italy as, perhaps due to his greater focus on realist detail and on line than rather than colour compared to the Venetian school, he was not much appreciated in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 126; Raunch 398&lt;/ref&gt; While he painted a variety of subjects, he was an excellent portrait painter who had a superior ability to see into the soul of his subjects and to portray a depth of feeling in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch 398; Zuffi pg. 127&lt;/ref&gt; He usually included other objects in the background or foreground of the portrait to portray the subject's character.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 127; Raunch pg. 399&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Influence of Italian Renaissance painting==
The lives of both [[Michelangelo]] and [[Titian]] extended well into the second half of the 16th century. Both saw their styles and those of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Antonello da Messina]] and [[Raphael]]  adapted by later painters to form a disparate style known as [[Mannerism]], and move steadily towards the great outpouring of imagination and painterly virtuosity of the [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] period.

The artists who most extended the trends in Titian's large figurative compositions were [[Tintoretto]] and [[Veronese]], although Tintoretto is considered by many to be a Mannerist. [[Rembrandt]]'s knowledge of the works of both Titian and Raphael is apparent in his portraits. The direct influences of Leonardo and Raphael upon their own pupils was to effect generations of artists including [[Poussin]] and schools of Classical painters of the 18th and 19th centuries. Antonello da Messina's work had a direct influence on [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Martin Schongauer]] and through the latter's engravings, countless artists including the German, Dutch and English schools of [[stained glass]] makers extending into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] and later ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' had direct influence on the figurative compositions firstly of Raphael and his pupils and then almost every subsequent 16th-century painter who looked for new and interesting ways to depict the human form. It is possible to trace his style of figurative composition through [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Pontormo]], [[Bronzino]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], to [[el Greco]], [[Carracci family|Carracci]], [[Caravaggio]],  [[Rubens]], [[Poussin]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] to both the [[Classical Revival|Classical]] and the [[Romantic art|Romantic]] painters of the 19th century such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]].

Under the influence of the Italian Renaissance painting, many modern academies of art, such as the [[Royal Academy]], were founded, and it was specifically to collect the works of the Italian Renaissance that some of the world's best known art collections, such as the [[National Gallery, London]], were formed.

'''Joseph Bédier''' (28 January 1864 – 29 August 1938) was a French writer and scholar and historian of medieval France.

==Biography==
Bédier was born in [[Paris]], France to Adolphe Bédier, a lawyer of [[Brittany|Breton]] origin, and spent his childhood in [[Réunion]]. He was a professor of medieval French literature at the [[Université de Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]] (1889–1891) and the [[Collège de France]], Paris (c. 1893).

Modern theories of the ''[[fabliaux]]'' and the ''[[chansons de geste]]'' are based on two of Bédier's studies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Bédier revived interest in several important old French texts, including ''[[Le roman de Tristan et Iseut]]'' (1900), ''[[La chanson de Roland]]'' (1921), and ''[[Les fabliaux]]'' (1893). He was a member of the [[Académie française]] from 1920 until his death.

His ''Tristan et Iseut'' was translated into [[Cornish language|Cornish]] by [[A. S. D. Smith]], into [[English language|English]] by [[Hilaire Belloc]] and [[Paul Rosenfeld]], and into [[German language|German]] by [[Rudolf G. Binding]]. In 2013, a new English translation by Edward J. Gallagher was published by Hackett Publishing Company.

Bédier was also joint editor of the two-volume ''[[Littérature française]]'', one of the most valuable modern general histories of French literature. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1929.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bédier died in [[Le Grand-Serre]], France. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Military diaries===
Bédier used the [[diary|diaries]] (''Kriegstagebücher'') of [[German people|German]] soldiers of different [[military rank]]s in [[World War I]] as a source for various articles dealing with what he describes as [[war crime|atrocities]] inflicted upon [[Belgian people|Belgian]] civilians and French soldiers. Some of these diaries had been kept for military reasons: in order to provide daily accounts of troop movements, orders, engagements, losses etc. Others were private diaries. From them Bédier connected together accounts of thirty-six incidents of what he saw as [[sexual crime|sexual]] and [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] crimes by the German soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Horne, John, and Alan Kramer. German "Atrocities" and Franco-German Opinion, 1914: The New Evidence of German Soldiers' Diaries. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The community was founded by Dr. Victor Baranco (son of the Oakland jazz pianist [[Wilbert Baranco]]), a self-made millionaire who had achieved “the American dream” but was still looking for more in life.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One night in 1966 he deliberately examined his life and concluded that he and everything in the world were perfect and that he was responsible for everything that had happened to him.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Based on this realization, in 1968 he conceived of the Morehouse lifestyle as one in which people could live together pleasurably without doing anything they didn’t want to do,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.maxim.com/maxim-man/how-to-free-love-commune-neil-strauss-2018-6|title=INSIDE THE WORLD'S LONGEST-RUNNING, MOST SUCCESSFUL FREE LOVE COMMUNE|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=17 June 2018|work=Maxim|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://livingexperiment.com/resistance/|title=Resistance to Pleasure|last=Gerasimo|first=Pilar|date=|website=The Living Experiment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while serving the world unselfishly and profiting by it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Since its inception, Lafayette Morehouse has conducted extensive research in how a group can live together pleasurably,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; including groups as small as two, focusing on topics such as lifestyles, communication, coupled relationships, and sensuality.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=We’re Just People’ At More University|last=Dewolk|first=Roland|date=|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While sensuality was only one among many areas of investigation, this was the topic for which the group became best known.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Their investigations of female equality and the importance of the clitoris in female orgasm were pioneering in the late 1960s and 1970s, and these findings were sometimes sensationalized in the press.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The group gained notoriety for the 1976 public demonstrations of a woman in continuous orgasm for three hours, which it claims were the first known demonstrations of that kind. The group has since trained many people to this standard.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The findings of their social experiments were initially presented as courses under the auspices of the Institute of Human Abilities.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In 1977 the State of California adopted laws to encourage and regulate new educational institutions, and More University was created as a DBA of Lafayette Morehouse Inc., a for-profit corporation that had been formed in 1972.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/more-university.html|title=More University|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More University was authorized to grant bachelor of humanities degrees, master’s degrees in communication, as well as doctoral degrees in lifestyles and sensuality, with the faculty drawn from senior members of the group.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/purple-haze/Content?oid=2132347|title=Purple Haze A speedy tour of the Morehouse commune|last=Boulware|first=Jack|date=23 August 1995|work=SF Weekly|access-date=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49248350|title=Planet medicine|last=1944-|first=Grossinger, Richard,|date=2000|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=1556433913|edition= Rev., 7th|location=Berkeley, Calif.|oclc=49248350}}&lt;/ref&gt; It completely complied with the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 1977 as a “State Authorized” university.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031203150354/http://www.bppve.ca.gov/reform_act/index.html Private Postsecondary and Vocational Reform Act of 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; Although criticized as a “diploma mill,” over a 20-year period it granted degrees to fewer than 90 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=No More Degrees, state orders School.|last=Edwards|first=Katherine|date=5 November 1996|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, responding to a change in the law, Lafayette Morehouse declined to pursue recertification of the University under the new rules, and More University was dissolved.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; No further degrees were granted and the group resumed doing business as Lafayette Morehouse, with much of the same curriculum.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beneteau: A brief history &amp; resource guide"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.trellishouse.org/lafayette-morehouse/|title=A brief history &amp; resource guide|website=Lafayette Morehouse and Victor Baranco|last=Beneteau|first=Marc|series=Adventures in Relationship and Community|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Victor Baranco’s death in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2002/09/12/news/obits.html|accessdate=June 7, 2008|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|date=September 12, 2002|quote='''Victor Baranco Jr.''', 68, of Haleiwa, educator and founder of the More Phylosophy, died Saturday.

Over the years a substantial number of communal living experiments using Morehouse principles have been conducted.{{refn|group=note|name="quantity"|Sources have estimated between 30 and 100 such communities existed at the peak in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beneteau: A brief history &amp; resource guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/sgt-bilko-meets-the-new-culture-19711209|title=Sgt Bilko Meets the New Culture|last=Green|first=Robin|date=9 Dec 1971|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Most of these have been in northern California,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; but related communities have also been located in New York,&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/what-this-66-year-old-model-learned-on-a-commune-women-bring-the-joy-to-the-table-172820996.html|title=66-Year-Old Model on Her Unconventional Beauty, Hedonistic Commune Life|last=Greenfield|first=Beth|date=8 March 2017|website=Yahoo!

== Life in the Community ==
The everyday goal is to live pleasurably with one’s friends.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The group has found that people who live deliberately and with awareness enjoy more fun relationships, which have tended to endure and deepen in intimacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Residents pursue their individual goals with the support of the group.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Residents also share group goals and participate in group activities, such as maintenance of the property, entertaining family and friends, putting on courses and holiday celebrations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

People have their own money and make contributions to communal expenses, goals, and projects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some residents have jobs outside of Morehouse.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

One group goal is taking care of the less fortunate.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Residents are encouraged to include this as an ongoing part of their lives, according to the viewpoint that the best life includes serving the world unselfishly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

According to their website, “There is no label regarding sexual choices that applies across the board for our group. Sexual preference is a personal choice. Some people here are celibate, many are monogamous and some have more than one partner.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/faq.html#poly|title=Are you polyamorous?|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents adhere to a strict sexual health screening program, begun in the late 1970s, to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/faq.html#std|title=How do you maintain the sexual health of your community in this age of STDs that are incurable or potentially fatal?|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political expression of the More philosophy is called the one no-vote, a decision-making system in which any participant, regardless of age, gender, time with the community, or any other factor can cast an irrevocable “no-vote” which stops any proposed new action.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/one_no-vote.html|title=One no-vote|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is meant to encourage open communication and ensure that all voices are heard and considered before moving forward.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ic.org/directory/oakland-morehouse/|title=Oakland Morehouse|last=|first=|date=|website=Fellowship for Intentional Community|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
The business of Lafayette Morehouse Inc. relies on word of mouth, without advertising.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The courses, in which research findings are presented, are held at various locations and produce income for communally-held goals, communal financial obligations and the ongoing research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Course topics include pleasurable interpersonal relationships, effective communication, alternative lifestyles, jealousy, money, philosophical viewpoints on perfection, and a gratifying sensual life.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; “It is not our goal to have others live as we do, but rather to offer our findings so that our students can use whatever elements they find beneficial. Those situations that all people encounter and must resolve in order to have happy, fulfilling lives are addressed in these courses.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One source estimates that, as of 1997, over 100,000 people had taken at least one Lafayette Morehouse course, and over 1,000 people had lived in a Morehouse and participated in the social research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Criticisms and Controversies ==
More University was criticized for not having the faculty and facilities of a conventional university.&lt;ref name="Billingsley-1994-p-13"&gt;{{Citation

One widely cited criticism of Victor Baranco and the Morehouse community was in David Felton's book ''Mindfuckers''.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/516433|title=Mindfuckers; a source book on the rise of acid fascism in America, including material on Charles Manson, Mel Lyman, Victor Baranco, and their followers,|last=Felton.|first=David,|date=1972|publisher=Straight Arrow Books|others=Green, Robin., Dalton, David, 1945-|isbn=0879320389|location=[San Francisco]|oclc=516433}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section on Baranco was repackaged from two Rolling Stone articles, and the principle allegation was that he profited excessively by having group members pay to live in houses while renovating them.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.trussel.com/lyman/guru.html|title=Beyond Shazam at Guru Gulch|last=Green|first=Robin|date=3 August 1972|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=3 June 2018|issue=114|pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that Jann Wenner, the editor of Rolling Stone, said the material on Baranco was written to personally attack Baranco.{{refn|group=note|name="hagan"|''[Jann Wenner,] in an Oedipal rage...attacked Baranco in the only way he knew how: He assigned writer Robin Green, his resident assassin, to profile him [Baranco] in Rolling Stone and "really expose him for the hustler he was."'' - in ''Sticky Fingers: The Life and Times of Jann Wenner'' by Joe Hagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987992115|title=Sticky fingers : the life and times of Jann Wenner and Rolling stone magazine|last=1971-|first=Hagan, Joe,|pages=253–254|isbn=9781101874370|edition= First |location=New York|oclc=987992115}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} These allegations against Baranco have not been repeated since 1972.

Many journalists have described Morehouse as a “sex commune”&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; or “sex cult,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Nicole-Daedone-s-mission-of-orgasmic-meditation-2368554.php|title=Nicole Daedone's mission of orgasmic meditation|last=Bowles|first=Nellie|date=12 June 2011|work=SF Gate|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the group’s sexual research and courses taught on sexual topics.

The group has been criticized for having poor relationships with its neighbors.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Billingsley-1994-p-13" /&gt;  Most of these criticisms date to the period of time (1991 – 2000) in which the group opened its doors and provided food and shelter to a large number of homeless people as their guests, using military surplus tents.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Lawyers Open Morehouse Court Fight|last=Wasiczko|first=Donna|date=25 May 1994|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors were angered by the influx of unattractive people,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; and the county sought to enforce zoning codes to end the activity. The group argued it was their right to use their own home to take care of people that were homeless.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; In an effort to mute extensive criticism in the press, the group undertook a lawsuit against the San Francisco Chronicle, which they lost. After a long court battle with Contra Costa County, Lafayette Morehouse was ordered to take down the tents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3764">This is a '''list of musicology topics'''. [[Musicology]] is the scholarly study of [[music]]. A person who studies music is a musicologist. The word is used in narrow, intermediate and broad senses. In the narrow sense, musicology is confined to the music history of [[Western culture]]. In the intermediate sense, it includes all relevant cultures and a range of musical forms, styles, genres and traditions, but tends to be confined to the [[humanities]] - a combination of historical musicology, [[ethnomusicology]], and the humanities of systematic musicology ([[philosophy]], [[Sociological theory|theoretical sociology]], [[aesthetics]]). In the broad sense, it includes all musically relevant [[Discipline (specialism)|disciplines]] (both humanities and [[science]]s) and all manifestations of music in all [[culture]]s, so it also includes all of systematic musicology (including [[psychology]], [[biology]], and [[computing]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6955">'''Modern studies''' is a subject unique to the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish secondary school curriculum|secondary school curriculum]]. The focus of Modern Studies is to develop learners' knowledge and understanding of contemporary political and social issues in local, Scottish, United Kingdom and international contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/45629.html|title=SQA|last=resources@sqa.org.uk|first=Scottish Qualifications Authority, Resource Management,|website=www.sqa.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Studies is offered both at National Qualification level and also in the Broad General Education stage of Scottish education. Pupils in primary school and up to S3 in secondary school have the opportunity to study Modern Studies concepts through the 'People in Society, Economy and Business' area of the broader Social Studies Curriculum for Excellence experiences and outcomes. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.gov.scot/Documents/social-studies-eo.pdf|title=Social Studies Experiences and Outcomes|last=|first=|date=|website=Education Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Senior Phase, Modern Studies is offered as a discrete subject. Ray Gunnion, history teacher in Brannock High School until 2004, was largely involved in introducing Modern Studies into the Scottish Education system as he felt it was a valuable subject for kids in Scotland.

== The Value of a Modern Studies Course ==
Modern Studies helps you develop knowledge and understanding of the processes that determine political, social and economic life. These processes are studied locally, nationally and internationally.

Modern Studies helps you develop important skills. For example you will become better at critically evaluating information, analysing complex sources and report writing. In some instances, the skills involved in using information technology will also be developed.

Together, the knowledge you acquire and the skills you develop will allow you to become a more informed individual, able to participate more effectively in society in a more tolerant and responsible manner.

== Study Themes ==
Common study themes exist across Modern Studies qualifications, from Broad General Education to Senior Phase.

=== Democracy in the UK ===
Pupils are given the opportunity to learn about the democratic processes of the United Kingdom with a focus on either UK democracy or Scottish democracy.  This includes examining rights and responsibilities, the political process, participation and representation at various levels.

=== Social Issues ===
Pupils examine social issues in society using sociological processes.  The focus of this unit is either Social Inequality or Crime and the Law.

A focus on social inequalities would examine issues of health, education, income and wealth inequalities in the UK by studying selected groups such as the unemployed, working poor, women, children, the elderly, [[LGBT|LBGT]]* people, [[Black and Minority Ethnic|BME]] people and others.

A focus on Crime and the Law would explore the types of crime committed in the UK, the sociological and individualistic theories of the causes of crime, the impact of crime and attempts to tackle crime.  The unit would examine the role of the criminal justice system, the police and the government.

=== International Issues ===
The International Issues unit is intended to broaden the scope of pupils' experiences to international contexts.  The focus of this unit will examine either a World Power or a World Issue.

A focus on a World Power will consist of a socioeconomic and political study of a [[G20]] country (excluding the United Kingdom).  This focus will be on the country's constitutional arrangements and opportunities for participation, the nature of recent socioeconomic issues and attempts to revolve them and the international influence of the world power.

A focus on a World Issue would put in the spotlight a contemporary significant conflict or issue which extends beyond the borders of a single country and has had impacts regionally or globally.  Examples of areas of study in this area would be [[terrorism]] or the [[Syrian Civil War]].  A study of a world issue would focus on the causes of, the impacts of and attempts to resolve the issue.

==The Primary Curriculum==

All schools in Scotland follow the 3-18 Curriculum for Excellence. Modern Studies is not offered as a discrete subject at primary school level, rather, it is delivered within the integrated Social Studies curricular area (which also encompasses history and geography themes).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the early, first and second stages (P1-P7); pupils are introduced to social studies key themes and are encouraged to develop analytical and evaluative skills.

==In S1, S2 &amp; S3==
Each school has the freedom to develop a course to suit the needs and interests of both pupils and teachers within the parameters of the Social Studies Experiences and Outcomes.

==National Qualifications==
Modern Studies is offered at National 3, 4 &amp; 5 levels and at Higher and Advanced Higher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is scope for a great deal of personalisation and choice across the NQ levels within the Course Assessment Specification. There are three areas of study and within these areas, teachers have the opportunity to teach a number of combinations of topic; these are:
* Democracy in Scotland and the UK:
** Democracy in Scotland OR
** Democracy in the United Kingdom
* Social Issues
** Social Inequality OR
** Crime and the Law
* International Issues
** World Power OR
** World Issue
At Advanced Higher level, there is a greater emphasis on depth of knowledge and so, one area of study is chosen from: Political Issues OR Law and Order OR Social Inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Studies Advanced Higher Course Assessment Specification|last=|first=|publisher=SQA|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each level above National 3, there also exists the requirement for pupils to complete an independent research project under the supervision of their teacher.  This project makes up some of the final overall award.

==University==

Modern Studies does not exist as a separate subject at [[University]] level though it is a sound basis for further study of a range of subjects from which Modern Studies is composed, such as Crime and the Law, [[Politics]], [[International Relations]], [[Sociology]], [[Criminology]], [[Economics]], [[Social Policy]] and [[Public Policy]].

A '''natural building''' involves a range of [[building]] systems and materials that place major emphasis on [[sustainability]].  Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or [[renewable resource]]s, as well as those that, while [[Recycling|recycled]] or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality. Natural building tends to rely on human labor, more than technology. As Michael G. Smith observes, it depends on "local ecology, geology and climate; on the character of the particular building site, and on the needs and personalities of the builders and users."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. "The Case for Natural Building," in Kennedy, Smith and Wanek (2002), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the [[natural environment|environmental]] impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort or health. To be more sustainable, natural building uses primarily abundantly available, renewable, reused or recycled materials.  The use of rapidly renewable materials is increasingly a focus. In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the [[ecological footprint]] is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment and water reuse.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
[[Image:timber frame detail.jpg|thumb|right|400px|&lt;center&gt;Porch of a modern timber framed home&lt;/center&gt;]]

==Materials==
The materials common to many types of natural building are clay and sand.  When mixed with water and, usually, straw or another fiber, the mixture may form ''[[cob (material)|cob]]'' or ''[[adobe]]'' (clay blocks).  Other materials commonly used in natural building are: earth (as [[rammed earth]] or [[Earthbag construction|earth bag]]), wood ([[cordwood construction|cordwood]] or [[timber frame]]/post-and-beam), [[straw-bale construction|straw]], rice-hulls, [[bamboo]] and [[rock (geology)|stone]]. A wide variety of reused or [[recycled]] non-toxic materials are common in natural building, including urbanite (salvaged chunks of used concrete), vehicle windscreens and other recycled glass.

Other materials are avoided by practitioners of this building approach, due to their major negative environmental or health impacts.  These include unsustainably harvested wood, toxic wood-preservatives, [[portland cement]]-based mixes and derived products such as [[Autoclaved aerated concrete]], paints and other coatings that off-gas [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs), steel, waste materials such as rubber tires in regions where they are recycled, and some plastics; particularly [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC or "vinyl") and those containing harmful plasticizers or hormone-mimicking formulations.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Techniques==
Many traditional techniques and materials are now experiencing a resurgence of popularity. This differs around the world based on climate appropriate building design and the availability of local materials.

===Adobe===
{{Main|Adobe|Mudbrick}}

One of the oldest building methods, adobe is simply clay and sand mixed with water. Often, chopped straw or other fibers are added for strength. The mixture is then allowed to dry in the desired shape. Usually adobe is shaped into bricks that can be stacked to form walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiras|first=Daniel D.|title=The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy-efficient, Environmental Homes|year=2000|publisher=Chelsea Green Pub.|location=White River Junction, Vt.|isbn=978-1-890132-57-6|pages=127–128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_Y2AObA-joC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=adobe%20bricks%20walls&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various claims are made about the optimal proportions of clay and sand (or larger aggregate). Some say that the best adobe soil contains 15% - 30% clay to bind the material together. Others say equal proportions of clay and sand are best to prevent cracking or fragmenting of the bricks. The blocks can either be poured into molds and dried, or pressed into blocks. Adobe colored with clay and polished with natural oil makes an attractive and resilient floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Scott|title=The Workshop: Celebrating the Place Where Craftsmanship Begins|year=2003|publisher=Taunton Press|location=Newton, CT|isbn=978-1-56158-575-5|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJJYdkQw_uYC&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=adobe%20floor%20oil&amp;pg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Anthony, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect the walls and reduce maintenance, adobe buildings usually have large overhanging eaves and sizeable foundations. Adobe can be plastered over with cob or lime-based mixes for both appearance and protection.  Adobe has good thermal mass, meaning that it is slow to transmit heat or cold. It is not a good insulator, however, so insulation can be added (preferably on the outside), or a double wall built with airspace or insulation in between.  The traditional thick, un-insulated adobe has proven to perform best in regions without harsh winters or where daily sun is predictably available during those cold periods.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Cob===
{{Main|Cob (building)}}
[[File:Cob with living roof.jpg|thumb|A small cob building with a [[living roof]]]]
The term ''cob'' is used to describe a monolithic building system based on a mixture of clay, sand, straw and earth. The construction uses no forms, bricks or wooden framework; it is built from the ground up. Various forms of "mud" building have been used in many parts of the world for centuries, under a variety of names, and date from at least 10,000 years ago. Cob building began use in England prior to the 13th century, and fell out of favor after World War I, although it is seeing a resurgence today. Cob is one of the simplest and least expensive building techniques available, though it is typically very labor-intensive. Cob's other great advantage is versatility; It can easily be shaped into any form.  While cob building was falling out of favor in England by the late 19th century, thousands of cob structures have endured to the present (20,000 in [[Devon]], England alone).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. "Cob Building, Ancient and Modern," in Kennedy, Smith and Wanek, (2002), 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that from one third to one half of the world's population lives in earthen dwellings today.  Although typically associated with "low-rise" structures, in [[Yemen]] and other Middle-Eastern countries it has, for centuries, been used in "apartment" buildings of eight stories and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Ianto|title=The Hand-sculpted House|year=2002|publisher=Chelsea Green Pub. Co.|location=White River Junction, Vt.|isbn=978-1-890132-34-7|page=xv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGEmmolyeSUC&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;dq=yemen%20cob%20apartment&amp;pg=PR15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cob-like mixes are also used as plaster or filler in several methods of natural building, such as adobe, earth bags, timber frames, cordwood, and straw bales. Earth is thus a primary ingredient of natural building.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Cordwood===
{{Main|Cordwood construction}}
[[Image:Cordwoodhouse.jpg|150px|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A section of a cordwood home.]]
'''Cordwood construction''' is a term used for a natural building method in which "cordwood" or short lengths of pieces of debarked tree are laid up crosswise with [[masonry]] or [[Cob (building)|cob]] mixtures to build a wall. The cordwood, thus, becomes infill for the walls, usually between posts in a [[timber frame]] structure. Cordwood masonry can be combined with other methods  (e.g., [[rammed earth]], cob or [[light clay]]) to produce attractive combinations. Cordwood masonry construction provides a relatively high [[thermal mass]], which helps to minimise fluctuations in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiras|first=Daniel D.|title=The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy-efficient, Environmental Homes|year=2000|publisher=Chelsea Green Pub.|location=White River Junction, Vt.|isbn=978-1-890132-57-6|pages=178–179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_Y2AObA-joC&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=cordwood%20thermal%20mass&amp;pg=PA178#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthbag===
{{Main|Earthbag construction|Super Adobe}}

Earth is the most typical fill material used in bag-wall construction techniques.  This building method utilizes stacked polypropylene or natural-fiber (burlap) bags filled with earth or other mixes without a stabilizer, other than clay, to form footings, foundations, walls and even vaulted or domed roofs. In recent years, building with earth bags has become one of the increasingly practiced techniques in natural building. It facilitates self-contained, often free-form rammed-earth structures. Its growing popularity relates to its use of an abundant and readily available often site-available material (earth) in a potentially inexpensive building technique that is flexible, and easy to learn and use.  However, because earth is a poor insulator, in more extreme climates other filler variations are now being explored, substituting pumice, rice-hulls or another material with better insulating value for all or part of the earth (''see also'' [[Rice-hull bagwall construction]]).{{refimprove|date=June 2012}}

=== Hempcrete ===
[[Hempcrete]] or Hemplime is bio-composite material, a mixture of [[hemp hurds]] (shives) and [[Lime (material)|lime]] (possibly including [[hydraulic lime|natural hydraulic lime]],&lt;ref&gt;Allin, Steve. ''Building with Hemp'', Seed Press, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-9551109-0-0}}. (p. 146, 1st Edition).&lt;/ref&gt; [[sand]], [[pozzolan]]s) used as a material for construction and [[Building insulation|insulation]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is marketed under names like Hempcrete, Canobiote, Canosmose, and Isochanvre.&lt;ref name="Priesnitz"&gt;{{cite journal
|url=http://www.naturallifemagazine.com/0604/hemphouse.htm |title=Hemp For Houses |first=Rolf B. |last=Priesnitz |work=Natural Life Magazine |date=March–April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hempcrete is easier to work with than traditional lime mixes and acts as an insulator and moisture regulator. It lacks the [[brittleness]] of concrete and consequently does not need [[expansion joint]]s.&lt;ref name="Priesnitz"/&gt; The result is a lightweight insulating material ideal for most climates as it combines insulation and thermal mass.

Like other plant products, [[hemp]] absorbs [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] from the atmosphere as it grows, retaining the [[carbon]] and releasing the [[oxygen]].  Theoretically 165&amp;nbsp;kg of carbon can be absorbed and locked up by 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of hempcrete wall during manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanlimetec.com/tradical-hemcrete/|title=Tradical Hemcrete 2008 Information Pack|publisher=American Lime Technology|accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the carbonation of the lime during curing adds to this effect as lime turns to [[limestone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minoeco.com/en/constructions/hempcrete|title=Minoeco - Natural Plasters &amp; Bioclimatic Design, Hempcrete|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical [[compressive strength]] is around 1&amp;nbsp;MPa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 1/20 that of residential grade [[concrete]]. It is a low density material and resistant to crack under movement thus making it highly suitable for use in earthquake-prone areas. Hempcrete walls must be used together with a frame of another material that supports the vertical load in building construction, as hempcrete's [[density]] is 15% that of traditional concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Rammed earth===
{{Main|Rammed earth}}
Rammed earth is a wall system made of compacted earth, or another material that is compacted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pise Pisé terminology]&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely strong and durable. Quality rammed earth walls are dense, solid, and stone-like with great environmental benefits and superior low maintenance characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} As an option depending on climate rigid insulation can be placed inside the wall. Similarly, depending on seismic concerns bamboo or other tensile natural materials can be used to reinforce the wall.

Rammed earth has been used for around 10,000 years in all types of buildings from low rise to high-rise and from small huts to palaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Rammed earth walls are formed in place by pounding damp sub-soil (containing sand, clay and sometimes gravel) into movable, reusable forms with manual or machine-powered tampers. In traditional rammed earth, a mixture of around 70% aggregate (gravel,sand) and 30% clay is optimal. Pigmentation may be added in the mix to achieve the desired color. Around 5-10&amp;nbsp;inches of mixed damp sub-soil are placed inside the forms and pounded to total compaction and the process is repeated until the desired height is achieved. What is left after the forms are removed is a wall that is structural and can last over 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Stone===


Stone has been used as a building material for thousands of years. It has long been recognized as a material of great durability. The pyramids in Giza, burial chambers in the UK and temples in Malta were all built from stone over 4000 years ago and are still standing. The earliest form of stone construction is known as dry stone, or dry stacking. These are freestanding structures such as field walls, bridges and buildings that use irregularly shaped stones carefully selected and placed so that they fit closely together without slipping. Structures are typically wider at the base and taper in as height increases. They do not require any special tools, only the skill of the craftsman in choosing and placing the stones.

Traditional stone masonry evolved from dry stone stacking. Stone blocks are laid in rows of even (courses) or uneven (un-coursed) height, and fixed in place with lime mortar pasted between the stones. Traditional stone masonry is rarely used today because stone is expensive to quarry, cut and transport, and the building process is labor and skill-intensive. 

Stone is a highly durable, low maintenance building material with high thermal mass. It is versatile, available in many shapes, sizes, colors and textures, and can be used for floors, walls, arches and roofs. Stone blends well with the [[natural landscape]], and can easily be recycled for other building purposes.

===Straw bale===
{{Main|Straw bale construction}}
[[Image:strawbaleconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&lt;center&gt;Straw bale construction in Santa Cruz, CA&lt;/center&gt;]]

Although [[grasses]] and [[straw]] have been in use in a range of ways in building since pre-history around the world, their incorporation in machine-manufactured modular [[Baler|bales]] seems to date back to the early 20th century in the midwestern United States, particularly the sand-hills of [[Nebraska]], where grass was plentiful and other building materials (even quality [[sod]]s) were not. Straw bale building typically consists of stacking a series of rows of bales (often in running-bond) on a raised footing or [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], with a moisture barrier between. Bale walls are often tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then [[stucco]]ed or [[plaster]]ed using either lime-based formulations or earth/clay renders.  Bale buildings can either have a structural frame of other materials, with bales between (simply serving as insulation and stucco substrate), referred to as "infill", or the bales may actually provide the support for openings and roof, referred to as "[[load-bearing]]" or "Nebraska-style", or a combination of [[framing (construction)|framing]] and load-bearing may be employed, referred to a "hybrid" straw bale.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Typically, bales created on farms with mobile machinery have been used ("field-bales"), but recently higher-density "recompressed" bales (or "straw-blocks") are increasing the loads that may be supported; where field bales might support around 600 pounds per linear foot of wall, the high density bales bear up to 4,000&amp;nbsp;lb./lin.ft.

===Timber frame===
{{Main|Timber frame}}
[[Image:timber frame.jpg|thumb|right|The completed frame of a modern timber frame home]]

The basic elements of timber frame building&amp;mdash;joined timbers, clay walls and [[Thatched roof|thatch roofs]] were in place in Europe and Asia by the 9th century. It remained the common mode of house construction in northern cultures until the 19th century.  Craftsmanship was, and is, an important value in timber frame building.  The oldest timber frame structures (for example, the timber framed stave churches of [[Scandinavia]]) show both craftsmanship and a strong grasp of the technical aspects of structural design, as do such structures in [[Japan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Timber framing typically uses a "[[Bent (structural)|bent]]."  A bent is a structural support, like a [[truss]], consisting of two posts, a tie beam and two rafters. These are connected into a framework through joinery. To practice the craft, one must understand the basic structural aspects of the bent.  This, along with a knowledge of [[joiner]]y, are the basis of timber frame building.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Timber framing is now a modern method of construction, Ideally suited to mass house building as well as public buildings. In conjunction with a number of natural insulations and timber cladding or modern [[lime render]]s, it is possible to quickly construct a high performance, sustainable building, using completely natural products. The benefits are many&amp;mdash;the building performs better over its lifespan, waste is reduced (much can be re-cycled, composted or used as fuel). Timber frame structures are frequently used in combination with other natural building techniques, such as cob, straw bale, or cordwood/masonry.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

'''''Oragenitalism''''' is a book by the American folklorist [[Gershon Legman]], published by the Julian Press in 1969. The book describes various types of [[oral sex]]. 
The book is intended as "instruction manual, conduct guide, and household advice book".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7OeNRe9V1K8C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq= Kick 2006, p. 66a]&lt;/ref&gt;  The author claimed that it was the earliest book of its kind on the subject, and for a long time the only one.&lt;ref name=brottman31&gt;Brottman (2004) p.31&lt;/ref&gt; 
Its contents are divided into four sections: "[[Cunnilingus|Cunnilinctus]]" written under the pen-name Roger-Maxe de la Glannege (an [[anagram]] of his real name) and published by Jacob Brussel of New York in 1940;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Martha Cornog |author2=Timothy Perper | title=Make love, not war: The legacy of Gershon Legman, 1917-1999 | doi=10.1080/00224499909552002 | journal=Journal of Sex Research | volume=36 | issue=3 |date=August 1999 | pages=316–317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slade (2001) p.802&lt;/ref&gt; the three remaining sections "[[Fellatio]]", "[[Irrumatio]]n", and "[[69 (sex position)|Sixty-Nine]]" were not published until 1969.&lt;ref name=brottman31/&gt;

The '''Philip Morris v. Uruguay case'''  ({{lang-es|'''Caso Philip Morris contra Uruguay'''}}) started on 19 February 2010, when the multinational [[tobacco company]] [[Philip Morris International]] filed a complaint against [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |title = Philip Morris versus Uruguay |author = El Espectador |date = 9 March 2010 |accessdate = 15 November 2010 |language = Spanish |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100314160056/http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |archivedate = 14 March 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The company complains that Uruguay's [[smoking ban|anti-smoking legislation]] devalues its cigarette trademarks and investments in the country and is suing Uruguay for compensation under the [[bilateral investment treaty]] between Switzerland and Uruguay.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; (Philip Morris is headquartered in [[Lausanne]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pmi.com/marketpages/pages/market_en_ch.aspx | title =Philip Morris International Management SA - Switzerland Operations Centre | author = [[Philip Morris International|PMI]] | accessdate = 15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty provides that disputes are settled by binding [[arbitration]] before the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uruguay-wins-dispute-tobacco-giant-philip-morris-40448855 | title=Uruguay Wins Dispute With Tobacco Giant Philip Morris | work=ABC News | date=8 July 2016 | author=AP | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709143704/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uruguay-wins-dispute-tobacco-giant-philip-morris-40448855 | archive-date=2016-07-09 | access-date=23 October 2016 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay had received accolades from the [[World Health Organization]] and from anti-smoking activists for its [[Tobacco control|anti-smoking campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/208683/cigarrillos-mentolados-aumentan-la-adiccion/|title = Cigarrillos mentolados aumentan la adicción|author = El Observador |date = 6 September 2011|accessdate =13 September 2011 |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2016, after 6 years, the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]] ruled in favor of Uruguay, forcing the demandant to pay the expenses of the defendants and the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/fallo-favorable-uruguay-juicio-philip-morris.html |title =Philip Morris deberá pagar a Uruguay US$ 7 millones por gastos judiciales|author = [[El País (Uruguay)|El País]]|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-36752509|title =Histórico fallo a favor de Uruguay en el juicio contra la tabacalera Philip Morris|author =BCC |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/esta-es-la-historia-de-uruguay-david-contra-philip-morris-goliath.html |title =Esta es la historia de Uruguay (David) contra Philip Morris (Goliath) |author =elfinanciero|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of Uruguay.svg|150px|right]]

On 19 June 2003, when the Uruguayan President was [[Jorge Batlle]], the [[General Assembly of Uruguay]] approved the [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], an agreement whereby Policies recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] were implemented.

In 2006, Uruguay under President [[Tabaré Vázquez]], an [[oncologist]] by profession, began to enact comprehensive [[smoking ban|anti-smoking legislation]].
On 1 March 2006, Uruguay became the first country in [[Latin America]] to prohibit smoking in enclosed public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/461696-uruguay-cree-que-philip-morris-incumplio-pasos-previos-a-la-demanda| title = Uruguay cree que Philip Morris incumplió pasos previos a la demanda |author =LR21| date =9 July 2011|accessdate =4 August 2011|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 the legislature approved Law 18.256 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|title = Ley Nº 18.256 Control del Tabaquismo|author = Uruguay Legislature|date = 6 March 2008|accessdate = 10 March 2009|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140416104642/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|archivedate = 16 April 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes six strategies of anti-smoking policy.

Some of the measures by the government were the ban on selling different types of presentations of the same brand of cigarettes, the dissemination of images warning about the risks of smoking and covering at least 80% of the cigarette pack, raising of taxes, banning cigarette advertising in the media, and banning sponsorship of sports events. In addition, smoking was banned in public places such as offices, student centers, bars, restaurants, dances and public places, among others.

The smokefree campaign "Libre de Humo de Tabaco" was gradually implemented by the "Ministerio de Salud Pública del Uruguay" ([[List of Ministers for Public Health (Uruguay)|Ministry of Public Health of Uruguay]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|title = Campaña "Libre de Humo de Tabaco"|author = MSP|accessdate = 15 November 2010|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615005816/http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|archivedate = 15 June 2010|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complaint ==

[[Philip Morris International]] is a multinational company, a leading producer of cigarettes, of which it owns seven out of twenty global brands.

The tobacco company initiated a claim in the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID), a part of the [[World Bank]] seeking $25 million in compensation from Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Alfred-Maurice de Zayas]]|title=How can Philip Morris sue Uruguay over its tobacco laws?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/16/philip-morris-uruguay-tobacco-isds-human-rights|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that forum, an arbitration tribunal was formed with one arbitrator appointed by each party and a third arbitrator elected by the arbitrators appointed by the parties. The plaintiffs are FTR Holding SA (Switzerland), Philip Morris Products SA (Switzerland) and Abal Hermanos SA (PMI representative in Uruguay) against Uruguay (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet|title = ICSID - Case Details|author = [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]]|date = 26 March 2010|accessdate =17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Morris has filed similar cases against [[Norway]] and [[Australia]].

== Decision == 
On 2 July 2013, the tribunal decided it had jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw1531.pdf |title =Decision on Jurisdiction |date=4 July 2013|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution of the case, which affected international&amp;nbsp;[[jurisprudence]], took 6 years; the case ended on 8 July 2016. The [[World Bank]] [ICSID] ruled in favor of Uruguay, forcing the demandant to pay the costs of the defendants and the court.
The final report established that [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] had to pay 7 million [[dollars]] to the country for judicial expenses, in addition to paying different amounts for the fees and administrative expenses of the three arbitrators and the CADI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/fallo-favorable-uruguay-juicio-philip-morris.html|title = Philip Morris deberá pagar a Uruguay US$ 7 millones por gastos judiciales|author = [[El País (Uruguay)|El País]]|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Born]] emitted a discordant decision in two of the points of the judicial failure.

After its victory in the case, the government declared that from 2017 cigarettes in Uruguay will be sold in [[Plain tobacco packaging|generic packaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elobservador.com.uy/a-partir-2017-los-cigarrillos-se-venderan-empaquetado-generico-n940912 |title =A partir de 2017 los cigarrillos se venderán en empaquetado genérico  |author= El Observador|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.teledoce.com/telemundo/nacionales/vazquez-anuncio-en-cadena-nacional-que-uruguay-gano-juicio-a-philips-morris/|title= Vázquez anunció en cadena nacional que Uruguay ganó juicio a Philips Morris|author = Canal 12|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.lr21.com.uy/politica/1302400-tabare-vazquez-aclaro-prohibicion-fumar-areas-publica-cerradas-incluye-marihuana |title = Drogas|author  = LR21|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAHO made a statement praising the decision:
{{Quote |"''This decision is an acknowledgment of Uruguay's continued efforts to protect its population from tobacco use and tobacco smoke from others.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12273%3Apaho-congratulates-uruguay-for-defending-tobacco-control-policies-against-tobacco-industry&amp;Itemid=1926&amp;lang=es | title = OMS y OPS felicitan a Uruguay por su victoria ante Philip Morris |author= [[Organización Mundial de la Salud|OPS]]|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; |Carissa Etienne, Director of the [[Pan American Health Organization]], August 2016.}}

== Effects ==

According to Enrico Bonadio, Senior Lecturer in Law at [[City University London]], the ruling in the case "may make it more difficult for tobacco companies to use lawsuits to produce a “[[chilling effect]]” and so discourage countries from introducing tobacco control policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/uruguays-victory-against-big-tobacco-is-more-than-just-a-local-triumph-62319|title=Uruguay's victory against Big Tobacco is more than just a local triumph|author= theconversation|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7348">'''Placebo studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] academic discipline concerning the study of the [[placebo effect]]. The [[placebo effect]] is commonly characterized when patients are given a [[placebo]] or "fake" treatment and then exhibit  perceived improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JJ, Ritenbaugh C, Nichter M | title = Reconsidering the placebo response from a broad anthropological perspectives | journal = Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 112–52 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19107582 | pmc = 2730465 | doi = 10.1007/s11013-008-9122-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discipline was pioneered by [[Ted Kaptchuk]] and colleagues at the [[Program in Placebo Studies]] at [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]] and the [[Harvard Medical School]].

Until 1955, a [[placebo]] treatment was considered a fraudulent substance administered to appease difficult patients.&lt;ref name=kaptchuk&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaptchuk TJ, Kelley JM, Deykin A, Wayne PM, Lasagna LC, Epstein IO, Kirsch I, Wechsler ME | title = Do "placebo responders" exist? | journal = Contemporary Clinical Trials | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 587–95 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18378192 | doi = 10.1016/j.cct.2008.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the defintion for Placeo has changed its connotation over the years, idealy it has come to mean the false effects are belived to be true by one's expectations. Although, it is a false substance used to satisfy one's ilness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=47b60c2f-3a13-45e2-82eb-fb70092f29f2@sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=89408012&amp;db=ers|title=Login - Sam Houston State University|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, the rise of the placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT), it became widely known throughout the academic community that [[placebo]] effects could in fact result in clinical changes and results.&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt; However, the ability to distinguish the efficacious ability of placebos over a period of time as well as those who are coined responders has proven difficult for scientists.&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt;

== Double-blind ==
A [[Double-blind placebo-controlled trial|double-blind placebo]] is called so when neither the researcher nor the patients know who was given which form of treatment.  This is the most used form of the placebo methods. It differs from a single [[placebo]] in that the researchers actually know what patients are given which form of therapy.&lt;ref name="Moher-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gøtzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG | title = CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials | journal = [[Br Med J]] | volume = 340 | pages = c869 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c869 | pmid = 20332511 | pmc = 2844943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Controlled studies ==
Although the double-blind placebo method is the most common, controlled [[placebo]] expierements require a different understanding. A placebo is given to one group of patients, while the treatment being tested is given to another group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm#hormone_therapy_facts|title=Hormone Therapy for Women: Side Effects, Cancer Risks|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the control is in the hands of people conducting the expierements. 

== Initial clinical experiments ==
In 1954, at [[Harvard Medical School]] a team led by [[Louis Lasagna]] lead the first known experiment to detect [[placebo]] responders.&lt;ref name=lasagna&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lasagna L, Mosteller F, Von Felsinger JM, Beecher HK | title = A study of the placebo response | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 770–9 | date = June 1954 | pmid = 13158365 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(54)90441-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment approximately 162 postoperative patients were observed for significant pain relief from subcutaneous injections of [[placebo]] and morphine.&lt;ref name="lasagna"/&gt; Differences in response and attitude were exhibited between [[placebo]] respondents and non-placebo respondents.&lt;ref name="lasagna" /&gt; "Using Rorschach tests and qualitative interviews, respondents, compared to non-respondents, were more anxious, self-centered, viewed the hospital care as 'wonderful', had more somatic symptoms, used more cathartics, were 'talkers and were  regular church goers.".&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt; Overall, this initial study on placebo responders versus non-responders outlined the initial yet undiscovered effects of the placebo within the placebo study.

In 1957, a team led by Wolf at [[Cornell University Medical School]] conducted an experiment to determine the reliability of the placebo response within the placebo study.&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf S, Doering CR, Clark ML, Hagans JA | title = Chance distribution and placebo reactor | journal = The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 837–41 | date = June 1957 | pmid = 13429202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on double blind [[placebo]] effects from omega 3 fatty acids and their persistant climb was done in 2006. This study concluded that although the results were "too premature to evaluate," they  showed there was a relationship between the efficacy of the antidepressant placebos and the intake of omega threes PUFAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Pao-Yen|last2=Su|first2=Kuan-Pin|date=2007-07-15|title=A Meta-Analytic Review of Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressant Efficacy of Omega-3 Fatty Acids|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v68n0712|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=68|issue=07|pages=1056–1061|doi=10.4088/jcp.v68n0712|issn=0160-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even your daily diet can trigger aspired results.

The '''privileged positions of business and science''' refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge and the ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

== Privileged position of business ==

Businesses have considerable power in decision-making processes in business-oriented societies. High level executives make discrete decisions about technological innovation without regard to consequences. Political scientist Edward Woodhouse states that businesses make key economic decisions that include creating jobs, choosing industrial plant and equipment, and deciding which new products to develop and market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, businesses hold a privileged position related to politics in the sense that they are capable of considerable influence over key public choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership role that business has in the economy gives executives of large corporations an unusual kind of degree of influence over governmental policy making.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government officials have incentives to carry out businesses' demands. They know that failure of businesses to maintain high employment will upset voters more quickly than anything else.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Our economy functions as a chain effect. Businesses that get what they want provide plentiful jobs and stimulate cash flow in the economy. As a result, citizens are happy, and this happiness translates to more trust and faith in the government party. Government officials thus have a higher chance of reelection.

It is clear that the businesses have the most influence in this chain effect. If a business fails, jobs are lost, citizens are unhappy, and the government party loses trust and their chance of reelection. One example of this was President Bush’s plummeting popularity and resulting defeat by Bill Clinton.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Therefore, it would make sense for government officials to reach out to these executives and provide valuable resources to benefit both parties. Power is shifted from government officials to business executives, because these executives have the ability to influence government officials to meet their demands. As a result, a large category of decisions is turned over to businessmen, and taken off the agenda of government. In a way, business managers become the public officials they represent.

This privilege of power is unique to corporations only. If workers want reform on unfair working conditions or pay, they must form a worker’s union. However, a worker’s union has considerably less influence than a corporation. As opposed to workers’ unions, businesses exercise more control on governmental policy making because workers are expendable – workers need money more urgently than society needs their services, so a business can operate for a lot longer than workers can afford to stay off the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privileged position of science ==

Without the knowledge of scientists and technologists, there would be no possibility of producing new technology and progress in a positive manner. Those who have these types of  knowledge and abilities are essentially the "seed" of technological innovation. They have the following three privileges:

*Knowledge
*Learning and teaching of new knowledge 
*Political implications of innovation

Based on previous scientific knowledge, one or several are able to use it and/or build on it to innovate. Kleinman and Vallas, point out that scientists control the modification, mediation and contest of emerging knowledge.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with this knowledge can also teach future generations the same to keep this process moving forward. Woodhouse that states that engineers are among the top professionals that promote the new innovations without consequences.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|1997|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the foundation of the privileged position of science, that only a select have scientific and/or technological knowledge and capable of substantial feats, good or bad. Engineers and scientists have the powerful position of being able to choose the path of innovation for emerging technology. Technologists and scientists hold a privileged position additionally in that their innovations often have political implications. Woodhouse makes the comparison of innovation to legislative acts, stating that they both establish a framework that will follow for many generations.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"/&gt;

== Relationships between privileged positions of business and science ==

Business and science are part of an important societal circle specifically relating to the production and implementation of technology. In simple terms, scientists and technologists design and create, while businesses provide the means to create, produce and implement. As Woodhouse claims, it would be a mistake to overlook business executives' and elected officials' dependence on the technologists because innovation is so highly regarded.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"/&gt;

Businesses that rely on scientists and technologists cannot function without them, but have authority over them. Woodhouse claims that the one reason green technology has not emerged faster and stronger is because the brown chemistry formula fulfilled many of the needs of scientists and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, since brown chemistry was innovated over less toxic and recyclable green technologies, it is shown that business has more authority over that of technologists and scientists. Woodhouse points out that there has been considerable delay on a promising area of green chemistry: supercritical fluids. The opinions range from targeting the culprit as the complexity of the equipment, to maintenance difficulties, to the equipment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the interconnection of business and science, and how technology can be slowed by technology and/or business (and vice versa). Woodhouse also states that twentieth-century chemists, chemical engineers, and chemical industry executives made central decisions which considerably modeled society's experiences with chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical industry, which includes scientists, technologists, and businessmen, uniquely controls what happens or what can happen to large number of people who are exposed to chemicals.

Business and science are considered of utmost importance in current developed countries. However, one working without the other has the potential to cause major issues. Woodhouse points out what the vice president of Shaw Carpets explained at a congressional hearing: that the V.P. is the person whose job it is to tell the chemists and chemical engineers that it is possible to produce carpets using "green" processes, because the students had not learned this from their respective university curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be many positive outcomes of the unison operation of business and science, and it is vital that this does occur in order to prevent major problems and unintended consequences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7260">The '''purple economy''' is that part of the [[economy]] which contributes to [[sustainable development]] by promoting the cultural potential of goods and services.

“The purple economy refers to taking account of cultural aspects in economics. It designates an economy that adapts to the human diversity in globalization and that relies on the cultural dimension to give value to goods and services.”&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/jda/archives/docs_article/89661/lactualite-vue-par-jerome-gouadain-promoteur-du-concept-d---economie-mauve---.php Le Journal des Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; These two trends, one vertical and one horizontal, feed one another. In fact the growth in the cultural component attached to products is linked to each territory’s cultural vitality.

== Surge in culture ==
The context of the purple economy is that of the growing importance of culture in contemporary society. The factors involved in this include in particular:&lt;ref name=diversum20170630&gt;Diversum, Gilles Andrier, Loïc Armand, Francesco Bandarin, Jérôme Bédier, Françoise Benhamou, Fouad Benseddik, Gilles Boëtsch, [[Dominique Bourg]], Jérôme Gouadain, Maria Gravari-Barbas, Marc-Antoine Jamet, [[François Jullien]], [[Pascal Lamy]], [[Jacques Lévy]], [[Gilles Lipovetsky]], Françoise Montenay, Jean Musitelli, Patrick O’Quin, Philippe d’Ornano, [[Dominique Perrault]], Marie-Hélène Plainfossé, Nicole Rouvet, [http://diversum.net/fr/association/a.php?t=document-de-reference&amp;id=74presse| “The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”] (accessed 22 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; a global economic and political readjustment in favour of emerging countries, a return to local environments (once again perceived as centres for stability), new forms of claims (following on from the collapse of the great ideologies), growing social demand for quality based on cultural consumption patterns (which go hand in hand with the logic of popularization, individualization and longer life expectancies), innovative approaches (that presuppose a cultural state of mind and interdisciplinarity conducive to [[serendipity]]), and so on.

== Scope ==
The purple economy is multidisciplinary, in that it enriches all goods and services by capitalizing on the cultural dimension inherent to every sector. The sensory, experiential economy is one application of this.&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt;

It differs from the [[Economics of the arts and literature|cultural economy]], which is sector-based.

In June 2013, the conclusions of a first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy, formed of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[OECD]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]], French ministries, various companies and civil society. That document underscored the impact of the phenomenon of culturalization, which now affects the entire economy, with follow-on effects on employment and training. The report differentiates between ''purple jobs'' and ''purplifying professions'': the former are directly linked to the cultural environment by their very purpose (like town planners and developers), while the latter are merely caused to transform under the effect of culturalization (such as positions in human resources or in marketing and communications).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/The%20purple%20economy,%20an%20objective,%20an%20opportunity.pdf Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference document published in June 2017&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt; mentioned various aspects of the human environment in which economics are likely to produce cultural benefits: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.

== Origin ==

== Connection to sustainable development ==
[[File:Sustainable economy.gif|thumb|The three components of a sustainable economy]]

The purple economy emphasizes the presence of [[externalities]]: the cultural environment from which agents draw and on which, in return, they leave their own footprints is a [[common good]]. As a result, the purple economy sees culture as an axis for [[sustainable development]].

In fact, culture has been a whole sub-section of sustainability since the beginning. [[Corporate social responsibility]] can even be said to have originated in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] adopted by the United Nations in 1966.

This issue is just one of the different components of [[sustainable development]], alongside concerns relating to the [[natural environment]] ([[green economy]]) and to the [[social environment]] ([[social economy]]). The complementary nature of these aspects of the sustainable economy was reaffirmed in a call&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2015/06/30/la-reponse-au-rechauffement-est-aussi-culturelle_4664807_3232.html Le Monde Économie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By: [[Pierre Bellon]], Véronique Cayla, [[Bertrand P.

[[File:Dan Savage Provided.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dan Savage]] (2005)]]
'''Savage Love''' is a syndicated sex-[[advice column]] by [[Dan Savage]]. The column appears weekly in several dozen newspapers, mainly free newspapers in the US and Canada, but also newspapers in Europe and Asia. It started in 1991 with the first issue of the [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] weekly newspaper ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''.

Since October 2006, Savage has also recorded the ''Savage Lovecast'', a weekly [[podcast]] version of the column, featuring telephone advice sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://podcasts.thestranger.com/savagelove/archives.php#a029910 |title=Dan Savage |publisher=Podcasts.thestranger.com |accessdate=March 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206090407/http://podcasts.thestranger.com/savagelove/archives.php#a029910 |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Podcasts are released every Tuesday.

Since 2002, he has written the column at [[Eppie Lederer]]'s desk, which he, a "lifelong fan" of her [[Ann Landers]] column, bought at auction after the noted advice columnist died.&lt;ref name="savage desk"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=12738 |title=Ann Advises On |date=December 5, 2002 |first=Dan |last=Savage |newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |accessdate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1991, Savage was living in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and working as a manager at a local video store that specialized in independent film titles.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/savage_d.html |title=GLBTQ Literature: Dan Savage |publisher=GLBTQ.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604104320/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/savage_d.html |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of ''[[The Onion]]'', who announced that he was moving to [[Seattle]] to help start an alternative weekly newspaper titled ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Bio" /&gt; Savage "made the offhand comment that forever altered [his] life: 'Make sure your paper has an advice column – everybody claims to hate 'em, but everybody seems to read 'em'."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, Introduction, ''Savage Love: Straight Answers from America's Most Popular Sex Columnist'' (New York: Plume, 1998), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He typed up a sample column, and to his surprise Keck offered him the job.&lt;ref name=AV-club&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/45150 Dan Savage interviewed by Tasha Robinson], ''The A.V. Club'', February 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, Introduction, ''Savage Love: Straight Answers from America's Most Popular Sex Columnist'', op. cit., pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage stated in a February 2006 interview in ''The Onion''{{'}}s ''[[The A.V. Club|A.V. Club]]'' (which publishes his column) that he began the column with the express purpose of providing mocking advice to heterosexuals, since most straight advice columnists were "clueless" when responding to letters from gay people.&lt;ref name=AV-club /&gt;

== Language ==
=== Recapture of offensive words ===
For the first six years of the column, Savage had his readers address him with "Hey, [[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]", as a comment on previous efforts to [[Reclaimed word|recapture offensive words]]. He was criticized for this by some gay activists.

=== Neologisms ===
During the run of Savage Love, Savage has popularized several [[neologism]]s. He has also debunked several sexual neologisms for violent sex acts, including the "[[donkey punch]]", the "[[Pirate (sexual slang)|pirate]]" and the "[[Hot Karl (slang)|hot Karl]]", concluding "They're all fictions."&lt;ref name="savage2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=No Shit? |author=Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=20179&amp;mode=print |newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |date=December 23–29, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Campsite rule ====
In any relationship, but particularly those with a large difference of age or experience between the partners, the older or more experienced partner has the responsibility to leave the younger or less experienced partner in at least as good a state (emotionally and physically) as before the relationship. The "campsite rule" includes things like leaving the younger or less experienced partner with no [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], no unwanted pregnancies, and not overburdening them with emotional and sexual baggage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Q |first=Dan |title=Savage Love Readers Talk About the Campsite Rule |pages= |newspaper=Scatmania |location= |date=May 14, 2008 |url=http://www.scatmania.org/2008/05/14/campsite/ |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tea and Sympathy rule ====
Shortly after a 2009 scandal in [[Portland, Oregon]], involving openly gay mayor [[Sam Adams (Oregon politician)|Sam Adams]] and Beau Breedlove, who had allegedly turned 18 almost immediately before the two began a sexual relationship, Savage created a companion rule to the "campsite rule", now known as the "Tea and Sympathy rule". The rule is a reference to a line in the [[Tea and Sympathy (play)|play of the same name]], in which a much older woman asks of a high-school-age boy, right before having sex with him: "Years from now, when you talk about this – and you will – be kind."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/movies/19kerr.html?pagewanted=print Deborah Kerr, Actress Known for Genteel Grace and a Sexy Beach Kiss, Dies at 86] – ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Savage claimed in an article in ''[[The Portland Mercury]]'' that, while Adams followed the "campsite rule" – Breedlove did not claim that Adams had given him any diseases or caused him emotional trauma, and in fact still refers to Adams as a friend – Breedlove violated the "Tea and Sympathy" rule by making public statements that he knew could ruin Adams's career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/the-tea-and-sympathy-rule/Content?oid=1089470 The Tea and Sympathy Rule] ''Portland Mercury''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monogamish ====
In a July 20, 2011 column, Savage coined the term "monogamish". The term describes couples who are perceived to be [[monogamy|monogamous]], who are "mostly" monogamous, but who are not 100% monogamous. Such couples have an understanding that allows for some amount of sexual contact outside the relationship.&lt;ref name=monogamish&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=9125045 |title=Savage Love: Monogamish |last=Savage |first=Dan |date= July 20, 2011 |work=The Stranger |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage believes that of all the couples people think are 100% monogamous, a lot of them are more "monogamish" than people realize. The term has since seen mainstream use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/2998792/satisfaction-monogamish-infidelity-married/ |title=Are You 'Monogamish'?

==== Pegging ====
{{Main|Pegging (sexual practice)}}
In 2001, Savage challenged readers of his column to coin a name for the sex act in which a woman uses a strap-on [[dildo]] to perform [[anal sex]] on her male partner. After multiple nominations and a reader vote, the verb "[[pegging (sexual practice)|peg]]" was chosen, with a 43% [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] over runners-up "bob" and "punt".&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=7730 We Have a Winner!]. ''The Stranger'', June 21, 2001. Accessed April 7, 2013.&lt;!--See talk page for any thoughts.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Santorum ====
{{Main|Campaign for the neologism "santorum"|Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality}}
Savage reacted strongly to statements made about homosexuality by former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Rick Santorum]] in an April 2003 interview with the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref name=USATodayApril232003&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm |title=Excerpt from Santorum interview |newspaper=USA Today |issn=0734-7456 |date=April 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum included gay sex as a form of deviant sexual behavior, along with incest, [[polygamy]], and bestiality, that he said threatens society and the family; he said he believed consenting adults do not have a [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] [[right to privacy]] with respect to sexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm Excerpt from Santorum in an interview]: "...if the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, ... [y]ou have the right to anything. Does that undermine the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does.", ''[[USA Today]]'', April 23, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Savage invited his readers to create a sex-related definition for "santorum" to "memorialize the Santorum scandal [...] by attaching his name to a sex act that would make his big, white teeth fall out of his big, empty head."&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Dan. [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14267 "Bill, Ashton, Rick"], ''The Stranger'', May 15, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The winning definition was "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex."&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Dan. [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14566 "Gas Huffer"], ''The Stranger'', June 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Savage set up a website to spread the term, inviting bloggers and others to link to it, which caused it to rise to the top of a Google search for Santorum's name.&lt;ref&gt;Mencimer, Stephanie. [http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/08/rick-santorum-google-problem-dan-savage "Rick Santorum's Anal Sex Problem"], ''Mother Jones'', September/October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lifting luggage ====
{{anchor|Lifing Luggage|reason=Old, over-capitalized heading name, may be linked to.}}
Following the [[George Rekers#"Rent boy" allegations|"rent boy" allegations]] regarding [[George Rekers]], who has widely promoted [[aversion therapy]], Dan Savage, along with others including [[Stephen Colbert]],&lt;ref&gt;"Colbert Rips Anti-Gay Activist, Throws 'Rentboy' Dance Party" {{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/06/colbert-rips-anti-gay-act_n_565763.html| title =
Colbert Rips Anti-Gay Activist, Throws 'Rentboy' Dance Party |publisher=The Huffington Post | first=Dan| last=Abramson| date=May 6, 2010 |accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoted the use of the idiom "to lift [some]one's luggage", meaning to supply sexual pleasure to, or derive it from, one's partner. This originated from Rekers who, when outed, insisted he had hired the escort only to assist him with lifting his luggage.&lt;ref name="timesonline"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7117037.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first1=Giles | last1=Whittell |title=Baptist minister 'took ten-day holiday with male prostitute' |date=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rekers also claimed he "spent a great deal of time sharing scientific information on the desirability of abandoning homosexual intercourse" and "shared the gospel of Jesus Christ with him in great detail".&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt;

Originally Savage suggested that "lifting my luggage" refer to listening to the speaker expound on the "desirability" of converting oneself from homosexual to heterosexual. Later, after several political humorists started employing "lifting your luggage" as an implicit or explicit reference to various sexual acts,&lt;ref&gt;"'Lift My Luggage' Is the New 'Hiking the Appalachian Trail'" by Daniel Kurtzman {{cite web|url=http://politicalhumor.about.com/b/2010/05/06/lift-my-luggage-is-the-new-hiking-the-appalachian-trail.htm| title=About.com --Daniel Kurtzman's Political Humor Blog|accessdate=October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage suggested that "whatever lifts your luggage" supplant "whatever floats your boat" in common parlance.

==== Saddlebacking ====
In 2009, after a controversy involving the [[Saddleback Church]], the column defined "saddlebacking" as "the phenomenon of Christian teens engaging in unprotected anal sex in order to preserve their virginities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=1031968|title=Savage Love|work=The Stranger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Leotarded ====
After receiving criticism for use of the word "retarded"—considered by many to be an offensive slur against those with intellectual disabilities—Savage suggested "leotarded" as an alternative, because "leotard" rhymes with "retard".

=== Initialisations ===
==== GGG ====
Dan Savage coined the abbreviation "GGG".&lt;ref name="walczak"&gt;Ken Walczak, [http://www.good.is/posts/the-ggg-cocktail-a-non-vanilla-drink-inspired-by-dan-savage "The GGG Cocktail"], www.good.is, May 9, 2012 (accessed December 26, 2012) ("Dan is best known for two things: his advice that partners in any relationship strive to be Good, Giving, and Game (GGG) and ...").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/09/12/science_proves_it_dan_savage_is_right/|title=Science proves it: Dan Savage is right|author=DebHerbenick|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands for "good, giving, and game", and it means one should strive to be ''good'' in bed, ''giving'' "equal time and equal pleasure" to one's partner, and ''game'' "for anything – within reason".&lt;ref name="Salon1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=167448 Wrong &amp; Right], ''The Stranger'' March 1, 2007 (accessed December 26, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The term has inspired the "How GGG Are You? Test" on the popular Internet dating site [[OkCupid]], and the invention of a [[cocktail]].&lt;ref name="walczak" /&gt;

==== DTMFA ====
"Dump the mother-fucker already", used at a closing of a response to indicate that acting immediately to end the writer's abusive or worthless relationship is advised.

==== ITMFA ====
A reader of Savage Love suggested the initialisation ITMFA, a take on DTMFA, meaning "Impeach the Motherfucker Already!" The initialisation was coined in reference to the [[presidency of George W. Bush]] in 2006, but was reintroduced in 2017 in reaction to the [[presidency of Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/01/25/24822658/impeach-the-motherfucker-already|title=Impeach the Motherfucker Already!|work=The Stranger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CPOS ====
"Cheating piece of shit", said of a cheater, but usually reserved for one who is chronic or abusive/passive-aggressive about it.

==== HTH ====
"How'd that happen?", a mock-incredulous reply to those to who write in and say they had certain (often sexual) things "happen to" them, as if they had no part or say in the incident, when they clearly did.

=== Usage ===
Savage objected to use of the term "pussy" as an insult, saying that vaginas were wonderful, popping out babies, and proposed "[[scrotum]]", plural "scrota", as an insult.

'''Scribal abbreviations''' or '''''sigla''''' ([[grammatical number|singular]]: '''''siglum''''') are the [[abbreviation]]s used by ancient and medieval scribes writing in [[Latin]], and later in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Old Norse]]. In modern manuscript editing (substantive and mechanical) "sigla" are the symbols used to indicate the source manuscript (e.g. variations in text between different such manuscripts) and to identify the [[copyist]](s) of a work. See [[Critical apparatus]].

==History==
Abbreviated writing, using ''sigla'', arose partly from the limitations of the workable nature of the materials ([[rock (geology)|stone]], [[metal]], [[parchment]], etc.) employed in record-making and partly from their availability. Thus, [[lapidary|lapidaries]], [[engraver]]s, and [[copyist]]s made the most of the available writing space. Scribal abbreviations were infrequent when writing materials were plentiful, but by the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, writing materials were scarce and costly.

During the [[Roman Republic]], several abbreviations, known as ''sigla'' (plural of ''siglum'' = symbol or abbreviation), were in common use in inscriptions, and they increased in number during the [[Roman Empire]]. Additionally, in this period [[shorthand]] entered general usage. The earliest known Western shorthand system was that employed by the Greek historian [[Xenophon]] in the [[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|memoir of Socrates]], and it was called ''notae socratae''. In the late Roman Republic, the [[Tironian notes]] were developed possibly by [[Marcus Tullius Tiro]], Cicero's [[amanuensis]], in 63&amp;nbsp;BC to record information with fewer symbols; Tironian notes include a shorthand/syllabic alphabet notation different from the [[lower case|Latin minuscule hand]] and [[Roman square capitals|square]] and [[rustic capital]] letters. The notation was akin to modern [[stenographic]] writing systems. It used symbols for whole words or word roots and grammatical modifier marks, and it could be used to write either whole passages in shorthand or only certain words. In medieval times, the symbols to represent words were widely used; and the initial symbols, as few as 140 according to some sources, were increased to 14,000 by the [[Carolingians]], who used them in conjunction with other abbreviations. However, the alphabet notation had a "murky existence" (C. Burnett), as it was often associated with witchcraft and magic, and it was eventually forgotten. Interest in it was rekindled by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Becket]] in the 12th century and later in the 15th century, when it was rediscovered by [[Johannes Trithemius]], abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim, in a psalm written entirely in Tironian shorthand and a Ciceronian lexicon, which was discovered in a Benedictine monastery (''notae benenses'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=King |first1=David |year=2000 |title=[[The Ciphers of the Monks|The ciphers of the Monks: a Forgotten Number-Notation of the Middle Ages]] |publisher=[[Franz Steiner Verlag]] |publication-place=[[Stuttgart]] |ISBN=978-3-5150-7640-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To learn the Tironian note system, scribes required formal schooling in some 4,000 symbols; this later increased to some 5,000 symbols and then to some 13,000 in the medieval period (4th to 15th centuries AD);&lt;ref name=Guenin1908 &gt;{{citation |last=Guénin |first=Louis-Prosper |year=1908 |title=Histoire de la sténographie dans l'antiquité et au moyen-âge; les notes tironiennes |last2=Guénin |first2=Eugène |publisher=Paris, Hachette et cie |language=French |oclc=301255530}}&lt;/ref&gt; the meanings of some characters remain uncertain. ''Sigla'' were mostly used in [[lapidary]] inscriptions; in some places and historical periods (such as medieval Spain) scribal abbreviations were overused to the extent that some are indecipherable.

==Forms==
The abbreviations were not constant but changed from region to region. Scribal abbreviations increased in usage and reached their height in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] (8th to 10th centuries). The most common abbreviations, called ''notae communes'', were used across most of Europe, but others appeared in certain regions. In legal documents, legal abbreviations, called ''notae juris'', appear but also capricious abbreviations, which scribes manufactured ''ad hoc'' to avoid repeating names and places in a given document.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Wallace Martin, ''Notae Latinae: An Account of Abbreviation in Latin Mss. Of the Early Minuscule Period (C. 700–850)'', 1915, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Scribal abbreviations can be found in epigraphy, sacred and legal manuscripts, written in Latin or in a vernacular tongue (but less frequently and with fewer abbreviations), either calligraphically or not.
[[File:Latin-breve.svg|frame|left|Latin abbreviations of {{lang|la|praedicatorum}}, {{lang|la|quoque}}, {{lang|la|conversis}}, and {{lang|la|quorum}}.]]{{Clear}}
In [[epigraphy]], common abbreviations were comprehended in two observed classes:
*The abbreviation of a word to its initial letter;
*The abbreviation of a word to its first consecutive letters or to several letters, from throughout the word.

Both forms of abbreviation are called "suspensions" (as the scribe suspends the writing of the word). A separate form of abbreviation is by "contraction" and was mostly a Christian usage for sacred words, [[Nomina Sacra]]; non-Christian sigla usage usually limited the number of letters the abbreviation comprised and omitted no intermediate letter. One practice was rendering an overused, formulaic phrase only as a siglum: DM for ''[[Manes|Dis Manibus]]'' ("Dedicated to the Manes"); [[Christogram|IHS]] from the first three letters of "[[Jesus|ΙΗΣΟΥΣ]]"; and RIP for ''[[requiescat in pace]]'' ("Rest in Peace") because the long-form written usage of the abbreviated phrase, by itself, was rare. According to Trabe, these abbreviations are not really meant to lighten the burden of the scribe but rather to shroud in reverent obscurity the holiest words of the Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;Traube, Ludwig, Nomina sacra: Versuch einer Geschichte der Christlichen Kürzung, Munich,1907&lt;/ref&gt;

Another practice was repeating the abbreviation's final consonant a given number of times to indicate a group of as many persons: AVG denoted "Augustus", thus, AVGG denoted "Augusti duo"; however, lapidaries took typographic liberties with that rule, and instead of using COSS to denote "Consulibus duobus", they invented the CCSS form. Still, when occasion required referring to three or four persons, the complex doubling of the final consonant yielded to the simple plural siglum. To that effect, a ''[[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]]'' (overbar) above a letter or a letter-set also was so used, becoming a universal medieval typographic usage. Likewise the ''[[tilde]]'' (~), an undulated, curved-end line, came into standard late-medieval usage.

Besides the ''tilde'' and [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] marks, above and below letters, modifying cross-bars and extended strokes were employed as scribal abbreviation marks, mostly for prefixes and verb, noun and adjective suffixes. The ''typographic'' abbreviations should not be confused with the ''phrasal'' abbreviations: '''''i.e.''''' (''id est'' — "that is"); '''''loc. cit.''''' (''loco citato'' — "in the passage already cited"); '''''viz.''''' (''vide licet'' — "namely", "that is to say", "in other words" — formed with "vi" and the ''[[yogh]]''-like glyph [Ꝫ], [ꝫ], the siglum for the suffix '''''-et''''' and the conjunction '''''et''''') and '''''et cetera'''''.

Moreover, besides scribal abbreviations, ancient texts also contained variant typographic characters, including [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] (e.g. '''Æ''', '''Œ''', etc.), the [[long s]] ('''ſ'''), and the [[half r]], resembling an Arabic numeral two ("2"). The "u" and "v" characters originated as scribal variants for their respective letters, likewise the "i" and "j" pair. Modern publishers printing Latin-language works replace variant typography and sigla with full-form Latin spellings; the convention of using "u" and "i" for vowels and "v" and "j" for consonants is a late typographic development.

===Scribal sigla in modern use===
====Latin script====
Some ancient and medieval sigla are still used in English and other European languages; the Latin [[ampersand]] (&amp;) replaces the conjunction ''and'' in English, ''et'' in Latin and French, and ''y'' in Spanish (but its use in Spanish is frowned upon, since the ''y'' is already smaller and easier to write). The Tironian sign '''⁊''', resembling the digit seven ("7"), represents the conjunction ''et'' and is written only to the [[x-height]]; in current [[Irish language]] usage, the siglum denotes the conjunction ''agus'' ("and"). Other scribal abbreviations in modern typographic use are the [[percentage]] sign ('''%'''), from the Italian ''per cento'' ("per hundred"); the [[permille]] sign ('''‰'''), from the Italian ''per mille'' ("per thousand"); the [[pound sign]] ('''₤''', '''£''' and '''#''', all descending from '''℔''' or '''lb''', ''librum'') and the [[dollar sign]] ('''$'''), which possibly derives from the Spanish word ''Peso''. The [[commercial at]] symbol ('''@'''), originally denoting "at the rate/price of", is a ligature derived from the English preposition ''at''; from the 1990s, its use outside commerce became widespread, as part of [[e-mail address]]es.

Typographically, the ampersand ("&amp;"), representing the word ''et'', is a space-saving [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of the letters "e" and "t", its component [[graphemes]]. Since the establishment of movable-type printing in the 15th century, founders have created many such ligatures for each set of record type (font) to communicate much information with fewer symbols. Moreover, during the [[Renaissance]] (14th to 17th centuries), when [[Ancient Greek]] language [[Ancient Greek literature|manuscripts]] introduced that tongue to [[Western Europe]], its scribal abbreviations were converted to ligatures in imitation of the Latin scribal writing to which readers were accustomed. Later, in the 16th century, when the culture of publishing included Europe's vernacular languages, Graeco-Roman scribal abbreviations disappeared, an ideologic deletion ascribed to the anti-[[Latinist]] [[Protestant Reformation]] (1517–1648).

The common abbreviation "Xmas," for [[Christmas]], is a remnant of an old scribal abbreviation that substituted the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[chi (letter)|chi]] (Χ, resembling Latin X and representing the first letter in the Greek word for Christ, Χριστος) for the word Christ.

====Church Slavonic====
[[File:ChurchSlavonicSigla.tiff|thumb|350px|right|Sigla frequently used in contemporary Church Slavonic]]
After the invention of printing, manuscript copying abbreviations continued to be employed in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] and are still in use in printed books as well as on icons and inscriptions. Many common long roots and nouns describing sacred persons are abbreviated and written under the special [[diacritic]] symbol [[titlo]], as shown in the figure at the right. That corresponds to the Nomina sacra (Latin: "Sacred names") tradition of using contractions for certain frequently-occurring names in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ecclesiastical texts. However, sigla for personal nouns are restricted to "good" beings and the same words, when referring to "bad" beings, are spelled out; for example, while "God" in the sense of the one true God is abbreviated as "{{script/Slavonic|бг҃ъ}}", "god" referring to "false" gods is spelled out. Likewise, the word for "angel" is generally abbreviated as "{{script/Slavonic|агг҃лъ}}", but the word for "angels" is spelled out for "performed by evil angels" in Psalm 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamanovich |first=Alipi |title=Grammatika Tserkovno-Slavyanskago Yazyka |publisher=Holy Trinity Monastery |origyear=1964|year=1984 |location=Jordanville, NY |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbreviation types==
Adriano Cappelli's ''Lexicon Abbreviaturarum'',&lt;ref&gt;Cappelli 2011 (first published 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the various medieval brachigraphic signs found in Latin and Italian vulgar texts, which originate from the Roman sigla, a symbol to express a word, and Tironian notes. Quite rarely, abbreviations did not carry marks to indicate that an abbreviation has occurred: if they did, they were often [[scribal error|copying errors]]. For example, "e.g." is written with periods, but modern terms, such as "PC", may be written in uppercase.

It should be noted that the original manuscripts were not written in a modern sans-serif or serif font but in Roman capitals, rustic, uncial, insular, Carolingian or blackletter styles. For more, refer to [[Western calligraphy]] or a beginner's guide.&lt;ref&gt;The Calligrapher's Bible: 100 Complete Alphabets and How to Draw Them, David Harris, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the abbreviations employed varied across Europe. In Nordic texts, for instance, two [[runes]] were used in text written in the Latin alphabet, which are ᚠ for ''fé'' "cattle, goods" and ᛘ for ''maðr'' "man".

Cappelli divides abbreviations into six overlapping categories:
*by suspension (''troncamento'')
*by contraction (''contrazione'')
*with independent meaning (''con significato proprio'')
*with relative meaning (''con significato relativo'')
*by superscript letters (''per lettere sovrapposte'')
*by convention (''segni convenzionali'')

===Suspension===
[[File:Truncation spec example.svg|thumb|Examples for suspension type]]
Suspended terms are those of which only the first part is written, and the last part is substituted by a mark, which can be of two types:
; General: indicating there has been an abbreviation but not how. The marks are placed above or across the [[ascender (typography)|ascender]] of the letters.
:[[File:Truncation gen.svg|frameless|none|300px]]
: The final three of the series are knot-like and are used in papal or regal documents.
; Specific: indicating that a truncation has occurred.
:[[File:Truncation spec.svg|frameless|none|300px]]
:The third case is a stylistic alternative found in several fonts, here Andron ([http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf Unicode chart extended D]).

The largest class of suspensions consists of single letters standing in for words that begin with that letter.

A dot at the baseline after a capital letter may stand for a title if it is used such as in front of names or a person's name in medieval legal documents. However, not all sigla use the beginning of the word.
[[File:Truncation example exceptions.svg|thumb|Exceptions: sigla not using the first letter of the abbreviated word|150px]]

For plural words, the siglum is often doubled: "F." = ''frater'' and "FF." = ''fratres''. Tripled sigla often stand for three: "DDD" = ''domini tres''.

Letters lying on their sides, or mirrored (backwards), often indicate female titles, but a mirrored C, Ↄ, stands generally for ''con'' or ''contra'' (the latter sometimes with a macron above, "Ↄ̄").

To avoid confusion with abbreviations and numerals, the latter are often written with a bar above. In some contexts, however, numbers with a line above indicate that number is to be multiplied by a thousand, and several other abbreviations also have a line above them, such as "ΧΡ" (Greek letters chi+rho) = ''Christus'' or "IHS" = ''Jesus''.

Starting in the 8th or the 9th century, single letter sigla grew less common and were replaced by longer, less-ambiguous sigla, with bars above them.

===Contraction===
Abbreviations by contraction have one or more middle letters omitted. They were often represented with a general mark of abbreviation (above), such as a line above. They can be divided into two subtypes:
; pure: a pure contraction keeps only the first (one or more) and last (one or more) letters but not intermediate letters. Special cases arise when a contraction keeps only the first and last letter of a word, resulting in a two-letter sigla.
; mixed (impure): a mixed contraction keeps one or more intermediate letters of the word that is abridged.

===Marks with independent meaning===
[[File:Indip abbr.svg|thumb|Examples of independent marks]]
Such marks inform the reader of the identity of the missing part of the word without affecting (''independent'' of) the meaning. Some of them may be interpreted as alternative contextual glyphs of their respective letters.
*The straight or curved macron above a letter means that an ''n'' or ''m'' is missing. A remnant can be seen in Spanish where an ''n'' with a tilde ([[ñ]]) is used for {{IPAblink|ɲ}}. In Visigoth texts before the 9th century, however, a dot is placed above the macron to indicate ''m'', and the same mark without a dot meant ''n''. The line with a dot became the general mark after the 9th century in Visigoth texts.
*A mark, resembling the [[Arabic numeral]] ''9'' or a mirrored ''C'' in Gothic texts, is one of the oldest signs and can be found in the texts of [[Marcus Valerius Probus]] and Tironian notes with the same meaning as ''con''.
*Another mark, similar to a bold comma or a superscript ''9'', placed after the letter on the median line, represented ''us'' or ''os'', generally at the end of the word, being the [[nominative case]] [[affix]] of the [[Latin declension#Second declension (0)|second declension]], sometimes ''is'' or simply ''s''. The [[apostrophe]] used today originated from various marks in sigla, which caused its current use in elision, such as in the [[Saxon genitive]].
*A wave-like or omicron-like mark stands for a missing ''r'' (rhotic consonant) or ''ra''. Sometimes, a similar wave-like mark at the end of a word indicated a missing ''-a'' or syllable ending in ''-a''. This is, however, a coincidence, as one of the marks stems from a small ''r''-like mark and the other from an ''a''-like one. In later texts, it became a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (two dots), or a broken line.
*A mark, resembling the Arabic numeral 2 and placed on the median line after the letter, indicates ''tur'' or ''ur'', which occurs generally at the end of the word. Alternatively it could stand for ''ter'' or ''er'' but not at the end of the word. (Nordic languages, such as Old English, have a lightning-bolt-like mark for words ending in ''er''.)
*The [[r rotunda]] with a cut generally stood for ''-rum'', but it could also stand for a truncation after the letter ''r''.
*A last mark, which could either be the Tironian note ⁊ or the [[ampersand]] &amp;, was used with equal frequency as the conjunction ''et'' (and) or as ''et'' in any part of the word. The symbol ⁊ at the end of a word indicates the enclitic ''-que'' (and). A corruption occurs in some manuscripts between it and the ''us''/''os'' mark.

===Marks with relative meaning===
[[File:Rel abbr.svg|thumb|Examples for relative marks]]
The meaning of the marks depends on the letter on which they appear.
*A macron not fully above the character but crossing the descender or ascender:
*: ''b̵'', ''b̄'' – ''bre-'', ''ber-'', ''-ub''
*: ''c̄'' (with a link on the right) – ''cum'', ''con'', ''cen-''
*: ꝯ̄ (above) –''quondam''
*: ''d̵'', ''d̄'' – ''de-'', ''der'', ''-ud'' (a crossed ''d'', not ''ð'' = [[eth]])
*: ''h̵'', ''h̄'' – ''haec'', ''hoc'', ''her''
*: ꝉ – ''vel'', ''ul-'', ''-el''
*: ''m̄'' (above) – ''mem-'', ''mun-''
*: ''n̄'' (above) – ''non'', ''nun-''
*: ''ꝋ'' (crossed horizontally, not [[Danish language|Danish]] ''ø'') – ''oblit''
*: ''p̱'' – ''per'', ''par-'', ''por-''
*: ''p̄'' (above) – ''prae'', ''pre-'' (alternatively, a mark similar to ''-us'' comma above but with a small spiral glyph could be used for this meaning, and it is also valid above the letter ''q'')
*: ''p̄p̄'' (above) or ''p̱p̱'' (below) – ''propter'', ''papa''
*: ''q̱'' – ''qui'' and, in Italy, ''que'', but in England ''quam'', ''quia''
*: ''q̄'' above – ''quae''
*: ''q̄q̄'' (above) or ''q̱q̱'' (below) – ''quoque''
*: ''q̱̃'' (tilde above and line below) – ''quam''
*: ''t̵'' – ''ter-'', ''tem-'', ''ten-''
*: ''ū'', ''v̄'' (above) – ''ven-'', ''ver'', ''-vit''
*A dot, two dots, comma and dot (different from a semicolon), and the Arabic numeral 3-like mark ꝫ were generally at the end of a word on the baseline. After ''b'', they mean ''-us'' (semicolon-like and ꝫ also could mean ''-et''). After ''q'', they form the conjunction ''-que'' (meaning "and" but attached to the end of the last word) with semicolon-like and ꝫ the ''q'' could be omitted. Semicolon-like, in Lombard documents, above ''s'' meant ''-sis''. The dot above median line on an ''h'' – ''hoc''. Dot above ''u'' – ''ut'' or ''uti''. The ꝫ could mean ''-est'', or after ''a'', ''e'', ''u'' vowels meant ''-m'' not ''us'' or ''ei'', if after an ''o'' it meant ''-nem''. In certain papers the ꝫ mark can be confused with a cut ''r'' rotunda (handwritten 4-like).
**A dot to the left and right of a letter gave the following meanings: ''e'' – ''.e.'' ''est'', ''i'' – ''.i.'' ''id est'', ''n'' – ''.n.'' ''enim'', ''q'' – ''.q.'' ''quasi'', ''s'' – ''.s.'' ''scilicet'', ''t'' – ''.t.'' ''tune'', .ꝯ. – ''quondam'', .⁊. ''etiam''.
*A diagonal line, often hooked, mark crossing nearly all the letters gives a different meaning. Commonly a missing ''er'', ''ar'', ''re''. Variants of which were placed above and were ¿-like&lt;!--rotated question mark--&gt;, tilde (crossing ascender) and similar to the ''us'' mark. These, used in various combinations, allow for various uses giving additional meanings.
*2-like mark, after a ''q'' – ''qꝛ'' ''quia''. After 15th century alone ꝛ ''et'' (being similar to ⁊) and alone with line above ꝛ̄ ''etiam''. After ''u'' and ''a'' at the end of a word (''uꝛ'', ''aꝛ'') ''m'', after ''s'' – ''sꝛ'', ''ſꝛ'' ''et'' or ''ed''.

===Stacked or superscript letters===
A superscript letter generally referred to the letter omitted, but, in some instances, as in the case of vowel letters, it could refer to a missing vowel combined with the letter ''r'', before or after it. It is only in some English dialects that the letter ''r'' before another consonant largely silent and the preceding vowel is "[[r-coloured]]".

However, ''a'', ''i'', and ''o'' above ''g'' meant ''gͣ'' ''gna'', ''gͥ'' ''gni'' and ''gͦ'' ''gno'' respectively. Although in English, the ''g'' is silent in ''[[gn (digraph)|gn]]'', but in other languages, it is pronounced. Vowel letters above ''q'' meant ''qu'' + vowel: ''qͣ'', ''qͤ'', ''qͥ'', ''qͦ'', ''qͧ''.

*''a'' on ''r'': ''rͣ'' – ''regula''
*''o'' on ''m'': ''mͦ'' – ''modo''

Vowels were the most common superscripts, but consonants could be placed above letters without ascenders; the most common were ''c'', e.g. ''nͨ''. A cut ''l'' above an ''n'', ''nᷝ'', meant ''nihil'' for instance.

===Convention marks===
These marks are nonalphabetic letters carrying a particular meaning. Several of them continue in modern usage, as in the case of monetary symbols. In Unicode, they are referred to as ''letter-like glyphs''. Additionally, several authors are of the view that the Roman numerals themselves were, for example, nothing less than abbreviations of the words for those numbers. Other examples of symbols still in some use are [[alchemical symbol|alchemical]] and [[zodiac]] symbols, which were, in any case, employed only in alchemy and astrology texts, which made their appearance beyond that special context rare.

==Other==
{{See also|Palaeography|Illuminated manuscript |Typographic ligature|Breviograph}}
In addition to the signs used to signify abbreviations, medieval manuscripts feature some glyphs that are now uncommon but were not sigla.
Many more [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] were used to reduce the space occupied, a characteristic that is particularly prominent in blackletter scripts.
Some [[:Category:Palaeographic letter variants|letter variants]] such as [[r rotunda]], [[long s]] and uncial or insular variants ([[Insular G]]), [[Claudian letters]] were in common use, as well as letters derived from other scripts such as Nordic runes: [[thorn (letter)|thorn (þ=th)]] and [[eth (letter)|eth (ð=dh)]].
An [[illuminated manuscript]] would feature [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], [[initial|decorated initials]] or ''littera notabilior'', which later resulted in the [[letter case#Bicameral script|bicamerality]] of the script (case distinction).

==Typographic replication==
[[File:Domesday Croydon Cheam.jpg|thumb|right|Entries for [[Croydon]] and [[Cheam]], [[Surrey]], in [[Domesday Book]] (1086), as published using [[record type]] in 1783.]]
Various [[typeface]]s have been designed to allow scribal abbreviations and other archaic glyphs to be replicated in print. They include "[[record type]]", which was first developed in the 1770s to [[publication of Domesday Book|publish Domesday Book]] and was fairly widely used for the publication of medieval records in Britain until the end of the 19th century.

===Unicode encoding===
{{Main|Medieval Unicode Font Initiative}}
In the [[Unicode]] Standard [https://web.archive.org/web/20090127061209/http://unicode.org/press/pr-5.1.html v. 5.1] (4 April 2008), 152 medieval and classical glyphs were given specific locations outside of the Private Use Area. Specifically, they are located in the charts [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1DC0.pdf "Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement"] (26 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1E00.pdf "Latin Extended Additional"] (10 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2E00.pdf "Supplemental Punctuation"] (15 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10190.pdf "Ancient Symbols"] (12 characters) and especially [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf "Latin Extended-D"] (89 characters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hit.uib.no/mufi/ |title= MUFI: Medieval Unicode Font Initiative |date= 15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These consist in both precomposed characters and modifiers for other characters, called combining diacritical marks (such as writing in [[LaTeX]] or using [https://support.microsoft.com/kb/211642 overstrike] in MS Word).

Characters are "the smallest components of written language that have semantic value" but glyphs are "the shapes that characters can have when they are rendered or displayed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/ |title= The Unicode Consortium |publisher= Unicode, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67280">{{sociology}}
The '''sociology of law''' (or '''legal sociology''') is often described as a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] or an interdisciplinary approach within [[jurisprudence|legal studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For various definitions of the sociology of law,see Ehrlich 1936 (orig 1912); Timasheff 1939; Pound 1943; Selznick 1965, Aubert 1969 and 1980, Black 1972, Stjernquist 1983, Hydén 1986, Tomasic 1987, Ferrari 1989, Podgorecki 1991, Cotterrell 1992, Banakar 2003 and 2011; Mathiesen 2005, Deflem 2008, Travers 2009, Nelken 2009, Scuro 2010, Banakar and Travers 2013, Banakar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some see sociology of law as belonging "necessarily" to the field of sociology,&lt;ref&gt;See Deflem 2008:3.&lt;/ref&gt; but others tend to consider it a field of research caught up between the disciplines of [[law]] and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003 and 2009, Banakar and Travers 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others regard it neither a subdiscipline of sociology nor a branch of legal studies but as a field of research on its own right within the broader social science tradition. Accordingly, it may be described without reference to mainstream sociology as "the systematic, theoretically grounded, empirical study of law as a set of social practices or as an aspect or field of social experience".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen as treating law and justice as fundamental institutions of the basic structure of society mediating "between political and economic interests, between culture and the normative order of society, establishing and maintaining interdependence, and constituting themselves as sources of consensus, coercion and social control".&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irrespective of whether sociology of law is defined as a sub-discipline of sociology, an approach within legal studies or a field of research in its own right, it remains intellectually dependent mainly on the traditions, methods and theories of mainstream [[sociology]] and, to a lesser extent, on other [[social sciences]] such as [[social anthropology]], [[political science]], [[social policy]], [[criminology]] and [[psychology]]. As such, it reflects social theories and employs social scientific methods to study [[law]], [[legal institutions]] and legal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Travers 2005, pp. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, sociology of law consists of various approaches to the study of law in society, which empirically examine and theorise the interaction between law, legal, non-legal institutions and social factors.&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976; Cotterrell 1992; Hunt 1993; Santos 2002; Banakar 2003; Banakar and Travers 2002; Ferrari 1989; Luhmann 1985; Trevino 2008; Travers 2009, Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of socio-legal inquiry include the social development of legal institutions, forms of [[social control]], legal [[regulation]], the interaction between [[legal culture]]s, the social construction of legal issues, [[legal profession]] and the relation between law and [[social change]].

Sociology of law also benefits from and occasionally draws on research conducted within other fields such as [[comparative law]], [[critical legal studies]], [[jurisprudence]], [[legal theory]], [[law and economics]] and [[law and literature]]. Its object encompasses the historical movement of law and justice and their relentless contemporary construction such as in the field of jurisprudence focused on institutional questions conditioned by social and political situations, in interdisciplinary dominions such as criminology and through analysis of the economic efficiency and the social impact of legal norms.&lt;ref&gt;Scuro 2010: 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual origins==
[[File:Veber.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Max Weber]]]]
The roots of the sociology of law can be traced back to the works of sociologists and jurists of the turn of the previous century. The relationship between law and society was sociologically explored in the seminal works of both [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]]. The writings on law by these classical sociologists are foundational to the entire sociology of law today.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other scholars, mainly jurists, also employed social scientific theories and methods in an attempt to develop sociological theories of law. Notably among these were [[Leon Petrazycki]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]].

For [[Max Weber]], a so-called "legal rational form" as a type of domination within society, is not attributable to people but to abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; He understood the body of coherent and calculable law in terms of a [[rational-legal authority]]. Such coherent and calculable law formed a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state and developed in parallel with the growth of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the development of modern law is the formal rationalisation of law on the basis of general procedures that are applied equally and fairly to all. Modern rationalised law is also codified and impersonal in its application to specific cases. In general, Weber's standpoint can be described as an external approach to law that studies the empirical characteristics of law, as opposed to the internal perspective of the legal sciences and the moral approach of the philosophy of law.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on Weber's typology see Kronman 1983: 8-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
[[Émile Durkheim]] wrote in ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with [[restitution]] and [[damages|compensation]] grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, law has undergone a transformation from repressive law to restitutive law. Restitutive law operates in societies in which there is a high degree of individual variation and emphasis on personal rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; For Durkheim, law is an indicator of the mode of integration of a society, which can be mechanical, among identical parts, or organic, among differentiated parts such as in industrialized societies. Durkheim also argued that a sociology of law should be developed alongside, and in close connection with, a sociology of morals, studying the development of value systems reflected in law.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of [[Durkheim|Durkheim's]] sociology of law see Cotterrell 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law'', [[Eugen Ehrlich]] developed a sociological approach to the study of law by focusing on how social networks and groups organized social life.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich 1936 (orig. 1912).&lt;/ref&gt; He explored the relationship between law and general social norms and distinguished between "positive law," consisting of the compulsive norms of state requiring official enforcement, and "living law," consisting of the rules of conduct that people in fact obeyed and which dominated social life. The latter emerged spontaneously as people interacted with each other to form social associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegert 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The centre of gravity of legal development therefore from time immemorial has not lain in the activity of the state, but in society itself, and must be sought there at the present time".|Eugen Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, 1936: 390.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was subjected to criticism by the advocates of legal positivism such as the jurist [[Hans Kelsen]] for its distinction between "law created by the state and law produced by the organisational imperatives of non-state social associations".&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kelsen, Ehrlich had confused ''Sein'' ("is") and ''Sollen'' ("ought").&lt;ref&gt;For a presentation of this debate and references to the original sources of the debate see van Klink 2006. For an analysis of the debate between Kelsen and Ehrlich see Banakar 2008. Banakar argues that Kelsen could not help but miss the point that Ehrlich was making by his distinction.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argued that Ehrlich was distinguishing between positive (or state) law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law', what Ehrlich called "living law", that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109&lt;br&gt;* Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leon Petrazycki ii.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Leon Petrazycki]]]]
[[Leon Petrazycki]] distinguished between forms of "official law," supported by the state, and "intuitive law," consisting of legal experiences that, in turn, consist of a complex of psychic processes in the mind of the individual with no reference to outside authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Petrazycki1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrazycki's work addressed sociological problems and his method was empirical, since he maintained that one could gain knowledge of objects or relationships only by observation. However, he couched his theory in the language of cognitive psychology and moral philosophy rather than sociology. Consequently, his contribution to the development of sociology of law remains largely unrecognized.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2006; also see Podgórecki 1980; Kurczewski 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Petrazycki's "intuitive law" influenced not only the development of Georges Gurvitch's concept of "social law" (see below), which in turn has left its mark on socio-legal theorising, but also the work of later socio-legal scholars. Among those who were directly inspired by Petrazycki's work is the Polish legal sociologist [[Adam Podgórecki]].&lt;ref&gt;See Podgórecki 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Geiger]] developed a close-knit analysis of the Marxist theory of law. He highlighted how law becomes a "factor in social transformation in democratic societies of the kind that are governed by the consent expressed by universal suffrage of the population practised at regular intervals".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Geiger went on to develop the salient characteristics of his antimetaphysical thinking, until he exceeded it with practical [[nihilism]]. Geiger's nihilism of values paved the way for a form of [[legal nihilism]], which encourages the construction of a sober democracy "that is capable of raising conflict to the intellectual level and of anaesthetising feelings, as it is aware of its own inability to make any proclamation of value, ethics or policy about the nature of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Gurvitch]] was interested in the fusion of simultaneous manifestation of law in various forms and at various levels of social interaction. His aim was to devise the concept of "social law" as a law of integration and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;see Gurvitch, Georges, ''L'idée du droit social'' (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; Gurvitch's social law was an integral part of his general sociology. "It is also one of the early sociological contributions to the theory of legal pluralism, since it challenged all conceptions of law based on a single source of legal, political, or moral authority".&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the sociology of law had an early reception in Argentina. As a local movement of legal scholars steeming from the work of Carlos Cossio, South American researchers have focused on comparative law and sociological insights, constitutional law and society, human rights, and psycho-social approaches to the legal practices.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Lista, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological approaches to the study of law==

===Modern sociology of law===
The sociology of law became clearly established as an academic field of learning and empirical research after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the emergence of the "sociological movement" in law after World War II see Deflem 2009: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the study of law was not central in sociology, although some well-known sociologists did write about the role of law in society. In the work of [[Talcott Parsons]], for instance, law is conceived as an essential mechanism of social control.&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticisms that were developed against functionalism, other sociological perspectives of law emerged. Critical sociologists,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Cotterrell 1992: 122-3&lt;/ref&gt;  developed a perspective of law as an instrument of power. However, other theorists in the sociology of law, such as [[Philip Selznick]], argued that modern law became increasingly responsive to a society's needs and had to be approached morally as well.&lt;ref&gt;Selznik, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Still other scholars, most notably the American sociologist [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]], developed a resolutely scientific theory of law on the basis of a paradigm of [[pure sociology]]. Equally broad in orientation, but again different, is the [[autopoietic system]]s theory of the German sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]], who presents law or "the legal system" as one of the ten ''function systems'' (see [[Differentiation (sociology)|functional differentiation]]) of society.&lt;ref&gt;See Luhmann 2004 and 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roth and Schutz 2015"&gt;[[Steffen Roth]] and Anton Schutz: ''Ten systems. Toward a canon of function systems.'' In: ''Cybernetics and Human Knowing'', Vol. 22, No. 4., 2015. Vorversion verfügbar (englisch; [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2508950 online] auf ssrn.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|All collective human life is directly or indirectly shaped by law. Law is like knowledge, an essential and all-pervasive fact of the social condition.|Niklas Luhmann, ''A Sociological Theory of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann, 1985: 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] disagrees with Luhmann and argues that the law can do a better job as a 'system' institution' by representing more faithfully the interests of everyday people in the 'lifeworld'. Yet another sociological theory of law and lawyers is that of [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and his followers, who see law as a social field in which actors struggle for cultural, symbolic and economic capital and in so doing develop the reproductive professional ''habitus'' of the lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of [[Adam Podgórecki]] and his associates (often influenced by [[Petrazycki]]'s ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by [[Per Stjernquist]], and in Norway by [[Vilhelm Aubert]].

In more recent years, a very wide range of theories has emerged in the sociology of law as a result of the proliferation of theories in sociology at large. Among the recent influences can be mentioned the work of the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], the German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstruction]], [[neo-Marxism]], and [[behaviorism]]. The variety of theoretical influences in the sociology of law has also marked the broader law and society field. The multi-disciplinary law and society field remains very popular, while the disciplinary speciality field of the sociology of law is also "better organized than ever in institutional and professional respects".&lt;ref&gt;Deflem 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and Society===
Law and Society is an American movement, which was established after the Second World War through the initiative mainly of sociologists who had a vested interest in the study of law.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale of the Law and Society movement is subtly summed up in two short sentences by [[Lawrence Friedman]]: "Law is a massive vital presence in the United States. It is too important to be left to lawyers".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1986:780.&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders believed that the "study of law and legal institutions in their social context could be constituted as a scholarly field distinguished by its commitment to interdisciplinary dialogue and multidisciplinary research methods".&lt;ref&gt;Austin et al, 1998:2.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the [[Law and Society Association]] in 1964 and of the ''Law and Society Review'' in 1966 guaranteed continuity in the scholarly activities of the Law and Society movement and allowed its members to influence legal education and policy-making in the US.&lt;ref&gt;See Munger 1998 and Simon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

On one view, the main difference between the sociology of law and Law and Society is that the latter does not limit itself theoretically or methodologically to sociology and tries instead to accommodate insights from all social science disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;For an example see Friedman 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; "Not only does it provides a home for sociologists and social anthropologists and political scientists with an interest in law, it also tries to incorporate psychologists and economists who study law."&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; From another point of view, both sociology of law and Law and Society should be seen as multi-disciplinary or trans-disciplinary enterprises although sociology of law has special ties to the methods, theories and traditions of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s a number of original empirical studies were conducted by Law and Society scholars on conflict and dispute resolution. In his early work, [[Bill Felstiner|William Felstiner]], for example, focused on alternative ways to solve conflicts (avoidance, mediation, litigation etc.). Together with [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]] and [[Austin Sarat]], Felstiner developed the idea of a disputes pyramid and the formula "naming, blaming, claiming", which refers to different stages of conflict resolution and levels of the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;"See, Felstiner, Abel and Sarat 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological jurisprudence===
The sociology of law is often distinguished from sociological jurisprudence. The latter is not primarily concerned with debates within mainstream sociology and instead engages with some of the debates within jurisprudence and legal theory. Sociological jurisprudence seeks to base legal arguments on sociological insights and, unlike legal theory, is concerned with the mundane practices that create legal institutions and social operations which reproduce legal systems over time. It was developed in the United States by [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faigman|first=David L.|title=Laboratory of Justice: The Supreme Court's 200-Year Struggle to Integrate Science and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UsMjpPS5AXoC&amp;pg=PA97|year=2005|publisher=Henry Holt |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Roscoe. "Scope and Purpose of Sociological Jurisprudence." ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 24 (1910): 591. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1324392]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfrid E. Rumble, Jr., "Legal Realism, Sociological Jurisprudence and Mr. Justice Holmes," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1965) 26#4 pp. 547-566 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708499 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It was influenced by the work of pioneer legal sociologists, such as the Austrian jurist [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and the Russian-French sociologist [[Georges Gurvitch]].&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Although distinguishing between different branches of the social scientific studies of law allows us to explain and analyse the development of the sociology of law in relation to mainstream sociology and legal studies, such potentially artificial distinctions are not necessarily fruitful for the development of the field as whole. For the social scientific studies of law to transcend the theoretical and empirical limits, which currently define their scope, they need to go beyond such artificial distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-legal studies==
'Socio-legal studies' in the UK has grown mainly out of the interest of law schools in promoting interdisciplinary studies of law.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whether regarded as an emerging discipline, sub-discipline or a methodological approach, it is often viewed in light of its relationship to, and oppositional role within, law.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It should not, therefore, be confused with the legal sociology of many West European countries or the Law and Society scholarship in the US, which foster much stronger disciplinary ties with social sciences. In the past, it has been presented as the applied branch of the sociology of law and criticised for being empiricist and atheoretical.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Max Travers, for example, regards socio-legal studies as a subfield of social policy, 'mainly concerned with influencing or serving government policy in the provision of legal services'&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and adds that it "has given up any aspirations it once had to develop general theories about the policy process".&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001: 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable practitioners of socio-legal studies include [[Carol Smart|Professor Carol Smart]], co-director of the [[Arthur Lewis Building#External links|Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life]], (named after the sociologist, [[David Morgan (sociologist)|David Morgan]]), as well as [[Mavis Maclean|Professor Mavis Maclean]] and [[John Eekelaar]] who are joint directors of the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy (OXFLAP).

'''Socio-legal methods of investigation'''

The sociology of law has no methods of investigation which have been developed specifically for conducting socio-legal research. Instead, it employs a wide variety of social scientific methods, including qualitative and quantitative research techniques, to explore law and legal phenomena. Positivistic&lt;ref&gt;See Black 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as interpretive (such as discourse analysis) and ethnographic&lt;ref&gt;See Travers 1997, Flood 2005 and 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; approaches to data collection and analysis is used within the socio-legal field.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of various methods see Banakar and Travers 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of law in Britain==
Sociology of law was a small, but developing, sub-field of British sociology and legal scholarship at the time when Campbell and Wiles wrote their review of law and society research in 1976. Unfortunately, despite its initial promise, it has remained a small field. Very few empirical sociological studies are published each year. Nevertheless, there have been some excellent studies, representing a variety of sociological traditions as well as some major theoretical contributions. The two most popular approaches during the 1960s and 1970s were interactionism and Marxism.

'''Symbolic interactionism and Marxism'''

[[Symbolic interactionism|Interactionism]] had become popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a politically radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing society as a system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address what people were doing in particular situations, and how they understood their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Becker 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as a problem to be managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused on the process of law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas in writing about law and crime.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Paterson 1982; Flood 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential sociological approach during this period was, however, Marxism—which claimed to offer a scientific and comprehensive understanding of society as a whole in the same way as structural-functionalism, although with the emphasis on the struggle between different groups for material advantage, rather than value-consensus. This approach caught the imagination of many people with left-wing political views in law schools, but it also generated some interesting empirical studies. These included historical studies about how particular
statutes were used to advance the interests of dominant economic groups, and also Pat Carlen's memorable ethnography,&lt;ref&gt;Pat Carlen 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; which combined analytic resources from Marxism and interactionism, especially the sociology of Erving Goffman, in writing about magistrates' courts.

'''The Oxford Centre for Socio-Legal Studies'''

The 1980s were also a fruitful time for empirical sociology of law in Britain, mainly
because Donald Harris deliberately set out to create the conditions for a fruitful
exchange between lawyers and sociologists at the [[University of Oxford]] Centre for Socio-Legal Studies. He was fortunate enough to recruit a number of young and
talented social scientists, including J. Maxwell Atkinson and Robert Dingwall who were interested in ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and the sociology
of the professions, and Doreen McBarnet who became something of a cult figure on the left after publishing her doctoral thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Doreen McBarnet 1981&lt;/ref&gt; which advanced a particularly clear and vigorous Marxist analysis of the criminal justice system. Ethnomethodology has not previously been mentioned in this review, and tends to be overlooked by many reviewers in this field since it cannot easily be assimilated to their theoretical interests. One can note, however, that it has always offered a more radical and thorough-going way of theorizing action than interactionism (although the two approaches have a lot in common when compared to traditions that view society as a structural whole, like Marxism or structural-functionalism). During his time at the center, J. Maxwell Atkinson collaborated with Paul Drew, a sociologist at the University of York, in what became the first conversation analytic study of courtroom interaction, using transcripts of coroner's hearings in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson and Drew, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of interest developed at Oxford during this period was the sociology of the professions. Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dingwall and Philip Lewis 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; edited what remains an interesting and theoretically diverse collection, bringing together specialists from the sociology of law and medicine. The best known study to date has, however, been published by the American scholar [[Richard Abel (lawyer)|Richard Abel]]&lt;ref&gt;Abel 1988&lt;/ref&gt; who employed ideas and concepts from functionalist, Marxist, and Weberian
sociology to explain the high incomes and status that British lawyers enjoyed for most of the twentieth century.

'''Recent developments'''

Since the 1980s, relatively few empirical studies of law and legal institutions have been conducted by British sociologists, i.e. studies which are empirical and at the same time engage with the theoretical concerns of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, some exceptions. To begin with, sociology of law, along with so many areas of academic work, has been enlivened and renewed through engagement with feminism. There has been a great deal of
interest in the implications of Foucault's ideas on governmentality for understanding
law,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt and Wickham 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and also in continental thinkers such as Niklas Luhmann and Pierre Bourdieu. Again, one can argue that rather fewer empirical studies have been produced than one might have hoped, but a great deal of interesting work has been published.

A second exception is to be found in the works of researchers who have employed resources from ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism in studying legal settings.&lt;ref&gt;Travers 1997; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research is clearly sociological rather than socio-legal research because it continually engages in debate with other theoretical traditions in sociology. Max Travers' doctoral thesis about the work of a firm of criminal lawyers took other sociologists, and especially Marxists, to task for not addressing or respecting how lawyers and clients understand their own actions (a standard argument used by ethnomethodologists in debates with structural traditions in the discipline). It also, however, explored issues raised by legal thinkers in their critique of structural traditions in sociology of law: the extent to which social science can address the content of legal practice.

Despite the relatively limited developments in recent empirical research, theoretical debates in sociology of law have been important in British literature during recent decades, with contributions from [[David Nelken]] exploring the problems of a comparative sociology of law and the potential of the idea of legal cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2004; 2007; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Cotterrell]] seeking to develop a new view of the relations of law and community to replace what he sees as outdated 'law and society' paradigms,&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and other scholars, such as [[David Schiff]] and Richard Nobles, examining the potential of Luhmannian systems theory and the extent to which law can be seen as an autonomous social field rather than as intimately interrelated with other aspects of the social.&lt;ref&gt;Nobles and Schiff 2006; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Also significant has been the burgeoning field of socio-legal research on regulation and government,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} to which British scholars have been prominent contributors.

==Devising a sociological concept of law==
In contrast to the traditional understanding of law (see the separate entry on [[law]]), the sociology of law does not normally view and define the law only as a system of rules, doctrine and decisions, which exist independently of the society out of which it has emerged. The rule-based aspect of law is, admittedly, important, but provides an inadequate basis for describing, analysing and understanding law in its societal context.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2009; Nelken 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, legal sociology regards law as a set of institutional practices which have evolved over time and developed in relation to, and through interaction with, cultural, economic and socio-political structures and institutions. As a modern social system, law does strive to gain and retain its autonomy to function independently of other social institutions and systems such as religion, polity and economy. Yet, it remains historically and functionally linked to these other institutions. Thus, one of the objectives of the sociology of law remains to devise empirical methodologies capable of describing and explaining modern law's interdependence with other social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion see Banakar and Travers 2005 and Banakar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some influential approaches within the sociology of law have challenged definitions of law in terms of official (state) law (see for example [[Eugen Ehrlich]]'s concept of "living law" and [[Georges Gurvitch]]'s "social law"). From this standpoint, law is understood broadly to include not only the legal system and formal (or official) legal institutions and processes, but also various informal (or unofficial) forms of nomativity and regulation which are generated within groups, associations and communities. The sociological studies of law are, thus, not limited to analysing how the rules or institutions of the legal system interact with social class, gender, race, religion, sexuality and other social categories. They also focus on how the internal normative orderings of various groups and "communities", such as the community of lawyers, businessmen, scientists, members of political parties, or members of the Mafia, interact with each other. In short, law is studied as an integral and constitutive part of social institutions, groupings and communities. This approach is developed further under the section on legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;For studies of legal pluralism see Dalberg-Larsen 2000; Merry 1988; Chiba 1989; John Griffiths 1986; Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western sociology of law==

The interest in the sociology of law continues to be more widespread in Western countries. Some important research has been produced by Indian scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Deva, 2005; Baxi, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; but we find only a limited amount of socio-legal work by researchers from, for example, the Middle East or central and northern parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;For an earlier overview of the field, see Ferrari, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the global spread of sociological studies of law appears uneven and concentrated, above all, in industrialised nations with democratic political systems. In this sense, the global expansion of legal sociology “is not taking place uniformly across national boundaries and appears to correlate with a combination of factors such as national wealth/poverty and form of political organisation, as well as historical factors such as the growth of the welfare state... However, none of these factors alone can explain this disparity”.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the disparity between Western and non-Western sociology of law see Banakar 2011 at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary perspectives==

===Legal pluralism===
[[Legal pluralism]] is a concept developed by legal sociologists and social anthropologists "to describe multiple layers of law, usually with different sources of legitimacy, that exist within a single state or society".&lt;ref&gt;Olgiati 2007; also see Olgiati 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also defined "as a situation in which two or more legal systems coexist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Sally Engle Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralists define law broadly to include not only the system of courts and judges backed by the coercive power of the state, but also the "non-legal forms of normative ordering".&lt;ref&gt;Merry 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal pluralism consists of many different methodological approaches and as a concept, it embraces "diverse and often contested perspectives on law, ranging from the recognition of different legal orders within the nation-state, to a more far reaching and open-ended concept of law that does not necessarily depend on state recognition for validity. This latter concept of law may come into being whenever two or more legal systems exist in the same social field".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The ideology of legal positivism has had such a powerful hold on the imagination of lawyers and social scientists that its picture of the legal world has been able successfully to masquerade as fact and has formed the foundation stone of social and legal theory.|John Griffiths, "What is Legal Pluralism"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths, 1986:5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Legal pluralism has occupied a central position in socio-legal theorising from the very beginning of the sociology of law. The sociological theories of [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Georges Gurvitch]] were early sociological contributions to legal pluralism. It has, moreover, provided the most enduring topic of socio-legal debate over many decades within both the sociology of law and legal anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and has received more than its share of criticism from the proponents of the various schools of [[legal positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example Tamanaha 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The critics often ask: "How is law distinguished in a pluralist view from other normative systems? What makes a social rule system legal?".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy arises mainly "from the claim that the only true law is the law made and enforced by the modern state".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This standpoint is also known as "legal centralism". From a legal centralist standpoint, John Griffiths writes, "law is and should be the law of the state, uniform for all persons, exclusive of all other law, and administrated by a single set of state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to legal centralism, "customary laws and religious laws are not properly called 'law' except in so far as state has chosen to adopt and treat any such normative order as part of its own law".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman 2008: 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is often made between the "weak" and the "strong" versions of legal pluralism. The "weak" version does not necessarily question the main assumptions of "legal centralism", but only recognises that within the domain of the Western state law other legal systems, such as customary or Islamic law, may also have an autonomous (co-)existence.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Griffiths, 2002: 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "weak" version does not consider other forms of normative ordering as law. As Tamanaha, one of the critics of legal pluralism, puts it: "Normative ordering is, well, normative ordering. Law is something else, something that we isolate out and call law…".&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha 1993: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The "strong" version, on the other hand, rejects all legal centralist and formalist models of law, as "a myth, an ideal, a claim, an illusion,"&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths 1986: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding state law as one among many forms of law or forms of social ordering. It insists that modern law is plural, that it is private as well as public, but most importantly "the national (public official) legal system is often a secondary rather than the primary locus of regulation".&lt;ref&gt;Galanter 1981: 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism directed at legal pluralism often uses the basic assumptions of legal positivism to question the validity of theories of legal pluralism which aim at criticising those very (positivistic) assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;See Banakar 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roger Cotterrell]] explains, the pluralist conception should be understood as part of "the legal sociologist's effort to broaden perspectives on law. A legal sociologist's specification of law might be different from that presupposed by a lawyer in practice, but it will relate (indeed, in some way incorporate) the latter because it must (if it is to reflect legal experience) take account of lawyers' perspectives on law. Thus a pluralist approach in legal theory is likely to recognise what lawyers typically recognize as law, but may see this law as one species of a larger genus, or treat lawyers' conception of law as reflecting particular perspectives determined by particular objectives".&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopoiesis===
[[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] originally coined the concept of autopoiesis within theoretical biology to describe the self-reproduction of living cells through self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana and Varela 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later borrowed, reconstructed in sociological terms, and introduced into the sociology of law by [[Niklas Luhmann]].&lt;ref&gt;See Ziegert 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann's systems theory transcends the classical understanding of object/subject by regarding communication (and not 'action') as the basic element of any social system. He breaks with traditional systems theory of Talcott Parsons and descriptions based on cybernetic feedback loops and structural understandings of self-organisation of the 1960s. This allows him to work towards devising a solution to the problem of the humanised 'subject'.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Perhaps the most challenging idea incorporated in the theory of autopoiesis is that social systems should not be defined in terms of human agency or norms, but of communications. Communication is in turn the unity of utterance, information and understanding and constitutes social systems by recursively reproducing communication. This sociologically radical thesis, which raises the fear of a dehumanised theory of law and society, attempts to highlight the fact that social systems are constituted by communicative."&lt;ref&gt;Banakar and Max Travers 2005: 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Roger Cotterrell]], "Luhmann... treats the theory as the basis for all general sociological analysis of social systems and their mutual relations.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; But its theoretical claims about law's autonomy are very powerful postulates, presented in advance of (and even, perhaps, in place of) the kind of detailed empirical study of social and legal change that comparatists and most legal sociologists are likely to favour. The postulates of autopoiesis theory do not so much guide empirical research as explain conclusively how to interpret whatever this research may discover."&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell 2006: 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cultures===
[[Legal culture]] is one of the central concepts of the sociology of law. The study of legal cultures may, at the same time, be regarded as one of the general approaches within the sociology of law.

As a concept, it refers to "relatively stable patterns of legally-oriented social behaviour and attitudes," and as such is regarded as a subcategory of the concept of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Nelken, 2004: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively new concept which, according to [[David Nelken]], can be traced to "terms like legal tradition or legal style, which have a much longer history in comparative law or in early political science. It presupposes and invites us to explore the existence of systematic variations in patterns in 'law in the books' and 'law in action,' and, above all, in the relation between them".&lt;ref&gt;Nelken 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an approach, it focuses on the cultural aspects of law, legal behaviour and legal institutions and, thus, has affinity with [[cultural anthropology]], legal pluralism, and [[comparative law]].

[[Lawrence M. Friedman]] is among socio-legal scholars who introduced the idea of legal culture into the sociology of law. For Friedman, legal culture "refers to public knowledge of and attitudes and behaviour patterns toward the legal system".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 193. But for criticism of the vagueness of this and other formulations of the concept of legal culture in sociology of law, see Cotterrell, 2006, ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It can also consist of "bodies of custom organically related to the culture as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1975, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman stresses the plurality of legal cultures and points out that one can explore legal cultures at different levels of abstraction, e.g. at the level of the legal system, the state, the country, or the community. Friedman is also known for introducing the distinction between the "internal" and "external" legal cultures. Somewhat oversimplified, the former refers to the general attitudes and perceptions of law among the functionaries of the legal system, such as the judiciary, while the latter can refer to the attitude of the citizenry to the legal system or to law and order generally.

===Feminism===
Law has always been regarded as one of the important sites of engagement for feminism. As pointed out by Ruth Fletcher feminist engagement with the law has taken many forms through the years, which also indicates their successful merging of theory and practice: "Through litigation, campaigns for reform and legal education, feminists have engaged explicitly with law and the legal profession. In taking on the provisions of specialist advice services, women's groups have played a role in making law accessible to those in need. By subjecting legal concepts and methods to critical analysis, feminists have questioned the terms of legal debate."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization===
[[Globalization]] is often defined in terms of economic processes which bring about radical cultural developments at the level of world society. Although law is an essential ingredient of the process of globalization - and important studies of law and globalization were already conducted in the 1990s by, for example, Yves Dezalay and Bryant Garth&lt;ref&gt;Dezalay and Garth 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Volkmar Gessner&lt;ref&gt;Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; - law's importance for creating and maintaining the globalization processes are often neglected within the sociology of globalization and remain, arguably, somewhat underdeveloped within the sociology of law.&lt;ref&gt;For one of the relatively early empirical studies see Dezalay and Garth 1996. For a collection of empirical studies of law and globalization see Gessner and Budak 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

As pointed out by Halliday and Osinsky, "[[Economic globalization]] cannot be understood apart from global business regulation and the legal construction of the markets on which it increasingly depends. Cultural globalization cannot be explained without attention to intellectual property rights institutionalized in law and global governance regimes. The globalization of protections for vulnerable populations cannot be comprehended without tracing the impact of international criminal and humanitarian law or international tribunals. Global contestation over the institutions of democracy and state building cannot be meaningful unless considered in relation to constitutionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday and Osinsk 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socio-legal approaches to the study of globalization and global society often overlap with, or make use of, studies of legal cultures and legal pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;See Teubner 1996; Feest and Nelken 2007, Friedman and Perez-Perdomo 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10743">The term '''standard social science model''' ('''SSSM''') was first introduced by [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]] in the 1992 edited volume ''[[The Adapted Mind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, Jerome; Cosmides, Leda &amp; Tooby, John (1992). ''The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture''. Oxford University Press. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  They used SSSM as a reference to [[social science]] philosophies related to the [[blank slate]], [[relativism]], [[social constructionism]], and [[cultural determinism]]. They argue that those philosophies, capsulized within SSSM, formed the dominant theoretical [[paradigm]] in the development of the [[social science]]s during the 20th century. According to their proposed SSSM paradigm, the mind is a general-purpose cognitive device shaped almost entirely by culture.&lt;ref&gt;"instinct." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 08 Feb. 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289249/instinct].&lt;/ref&gt; After establishing SSSM, Tooby and Cosmides make a case for replacing SSSM with the integrated model (IM), also known as the integrated causal model (ICM), which melds cultural and biological theories for the development of the mind. Supporters of SSSM include those who feel the term was conceived as a point of argument in support of ICM specifically and [[evolutionary psychology]] (EP) in general.

== Alleged proponents ==
[[Steven Pinker]] names several prominent scientists as proponents of the standard social science model, including [[Franz Boas]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Richard Lewontin]], [[John Money]], and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [[The Blank Slate]]. New York: Penguin. 2002{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative theoretical paradigm: the integrated model ==
The authors of ''The Adapted Mind'' have argued&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., &amp; Cosmides, L. (1992). The adapted mind.{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the SSSM is now out of date and that a progressive model for the social sciences requires evolutionarily-informed models of nature-nurture interactionism, grounded in the [[computational theory of mind]].  Tooby and Cosmides refer to this new model as the integrated model (IM).

Tooby and Cosmides&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., &amp; Cosmides, L. (1992){{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide several comparisons between the SSSM and the IM, including the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Standard Social Science Model !! Integrated Model
|-
| Humans born a blank slate || Humans are born with a bundle of emotional, motivational and cognitive adaptations
|-
| Brain is a "general-purpose" computer  || Brain is a collection of modular, domain-specific processors
|-
| Culture/socialization programs behavior || Behavior is the result of interactions between evolved psychological mechanisms and cultural and environmental influences
|-
| Cultures free to vary any direction on any trait || Culture itself is based on a universal human nature and is constrained by it
|-
| Biology is relatively unimportant in understanding behavior || An analysis of interactions between nature and nurture is important in understanding behavior
|}

== Criticisms ==

{{POV|date=June 2014}}

Richardson (2007) argues that, as proponents of evolutionary psychology (EP), evolutionary psychologists developed the SSSM as a [[Rhetoric device|rhetorical technique]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The basic move is evident in Cosmides and Tooby's most aggressive brief for evolutionary psychology. They want us to accept a dichotomy between what they call the "Standard Social Science Model" (SSSM) and the "Integrated Causal Model" (ICM) they favor ... it offers a false dichotomy between a manifestly untenable view and their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Richardson |first1= Robert C. |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Evolutionary Psychology As Maladapted Psychology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KeqiKNFa3YgC&amp;pg=PA176 |edition= |year= 2007 |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |location= Cambridge, Mass. |isbn= 978-0-262-18260-7 |page= 176 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Wallace (2010) has also suggested the SSSM to be a false dichotomy and claims that "scientists in the EP tradition wildly overstate the influence and longevity of what they call the Standard Social Science Model (essentially, [[behaviorism]]) of human cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wallace |first= Brendan |authorlink= |title= Getting Darwin Wrong: Why Evolutionary Psychology Won't Work |url= |accessdate= |year= 2010 |publisher= Imprint Academic |location= Exeter |isbn= 978-1-84540-207-5 |page= 136 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Sampson]] argues that the SSSM is based on a [[straw man]]. He views Pinker's claim that the SSSM has been the dominant theoretical paradigm in the social sciences since the 1920s as "completely untenable". In his argument, Sampson cites British education policies in the 20th century that were guided by social scientists and which were based on the belief that children had in-built talents and needs. Thus, he challenges Pinker's assertion that the view of the mind among all social scientists is a [[tabula rasa]]. Moreover, Sampson only conditionally agrees that the scientists Pinker associates with the SSSM, such as Skinner, Watson,{{who|reason=who is this particular watson?|date=November 2018}} and Mead, were influential, stating, "to identify them as responsible for the general tone of intellectual life for eighty years seems comical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Sampson |first1= Geoffrey |authorlink1= Geoffrey Sampson |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= The "Language Instinct" Debate: Revised Edition |url= |edition= |year= 2009 |publisher= Continuum |location= London |isbn= 978-0-8264-7384-4 |page= |pages= 134–5 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Neil Levy appears to concur with Sampson's straw man thesis regarding the conception of the SSSM, against which evolutionary psychologists direct much of their criticism. Levy writes: "No-one—not even Skinner and his followers—has ever believed in the blank slate of Pinker's title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Levy |first1= Neil |last2= |first2= |year= 2004 |title= Evolutionary Psychology, Human Universals, and the Standard Social Science Model |journal= [[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume= 19 |issue= 3 |pages= 459–72|publisher= [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |doi= 10.1023/B:BIPH.0000036111.64561.63 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.90.9290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]] has criticized Tooby and Cosmides' arbitrary exclusion of [[economics]] and [[political science]] from their SSSM model, which Rose argues is "rather like excluding physiology and biochemistry from an account of the life sciences". She also states that Tooby and Cosmides have publicly indicted [[Sociology|sociologists]] and [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]] of inappropriate separatist behavior towards other academic disciplines while ignoring their newer efforts that demonstrate the complete opposite. Rose notes how sociologists and anthropologists have many new developments that involve study of the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] and technology. Furthermore, Rose suggests that Tooby and Cosmides' characterization of scientists like Gould, Lewontin, [[Steven Rose]] and [[Leon Kamin]] as SSSM adherents is based on an inaccurate reading of works like ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' and ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'', two books that have explored the interplay between biology and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Rose |first= Hilary |authorlink= Hilary Rose (sociologist) |title= Alas Poor Darwin: Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology |editor1-last= Rose |editor1-first= Steven |editor2-last= Rose |editor2-first= Hilary |chapter= Colonising the Social Sciences? |chapterurl= https://books.google.fr/books?id=HQthCC191y8C&amp;pg=PT203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= London |publisher= [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] |isbn= 978-0-09-928319-5 |year= 2001 |pages= 203–212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Hampton (2004) contends that evolutionary psychologists' account of the SSSM misses the debate on the existence of psychological [[instinct]]s in the early part of the 20th century. He argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;psychological and behavioural thinkers have for long periods been immersed in the implications of Darwinism. It is plainly and factually incorrect for evolutionary psychology to deny this. And it is disingenuous to down-play it. Evolutionary psychologists who use the term "Standard Social Science Model" and rhetorical equivalents such as "the neo-behaviourist tradition" ... and "the tabula rasa view" ... undermine their own much-vaunted rigor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Hampton |first= Simon Jonathan | date = 2004 |title= The instinct debate and the standard social science model |journal= Sexualities, Evolution &amp; Gender |volume= 6 |issue= 1|pages= 15–44 | publisher= Routledge |doi= 10.1080/14616660412331279657}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10943">'''Systemic development''' is a process of thinking about development which uses a [[systems thinking]] approach to create a solution to a social, environmental, and economic stress which the world is suffering from.

== Overview ==
[[File:Sustainable development.svg|thumb|Development can be a combination of multiple disciplines. Sustainable development focuses on a balance of environmental, economic, and social.]]
The core approach of systemic development is a process for thinking holistically while addressing complex issues and progressing towards a mutual goal with high participation rates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The process encompasses comprehension of current activities and future needs from a holistic perspective. For success, it is essential that the process moves from an integrated assessment to a sustainable assessment. The perspective must consider the many facets of the current and proposed development including the economic, social, environmental, political and ecological aspects. The idea behind a systemic development approach can be applied to many disciplines, similar to [[sustainable development]]. Systemic development is practice rather than [[sustainability]], which is an end state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Systems theory|General Systems Theory]] (GST) laid the foundation to systemic thinking. [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Ludwig Von Bertalanffy]] was known as the founder of the original principles of GST.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Cruz, Ivonne, Andri Stahel, and Manfred Max-Neef. "Towards a Systemic Development Approach: Building on the Human-Scale Development Paradigm." ''Ecological Economics'' 68.7 (2009): 2021-030. ''Elsevier''. Web. 20 Apr. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.02.004&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1968, when GST was introduced in Bertalanffy’s book, ''General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications'', the traditional approach to development used linear thinking or cause-and-effect thinking. GST was influenced by many different types of theories such as “Chaos theory, complexity theory, catastrophe theory, cybernetics, fuzzy set theory, and learning matrices” &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spruill|first=Nina|last2=Kenney|first2=Con|last3=Kaplan|first3=Laura|date=2001-03-01|title=Community Development and Systems Thinking: Theory and Practice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ncr.90110/abstract|journal=National Civic Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=1|pages=105–116|doi=10.1002/ncr.90110|issn=1542-7811}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, [[Peter Senge]], author of ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'', wove systemic thinking approach into development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Concepts ==
The integration of ontology, methodology, epistemology, and axiology has formed an outline for GST. Together, these concepts and philosophies contribute to the theory of systemic development.&lt;ref&gt;Sedlacko, Michal, Andre Martinuzzi, Inge RÃ¸pke, Nuno Videira, and Paula Antunes. "Participatory Systems Mapping for Sustainable Consumption: Discussion of a Method Promoting Systemic Insights." ''Ecological Economics'' 106 (2014): 33-43. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800914002043/1-s2.0-S0921800914002043-main.pdf?_tid=9d75173e-4500-11e7-b416-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1496125640_f44c0f82766115a9b6be398ef056d52f&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontological ===
[[Ontology]] is the most basic fundamental tool. In a systemic development approach, the first step is to define the boundaries, thresholds, and stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sala, Serenella, Biagio Ciuffo, and Peter Nijkamp. "A Systemic Framework for Sustainability Assessment." ''Ecological Economics'' 119 (2015): 314-25. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800915003821/1-s2.0-S0921800915003821-main.pdf?_tid=24da3502-4500-11e7-951c-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1496125438_401becd0b4afcc87524ef4bc3b8de9af&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Understanding what is, is crucial to understand the layers of complexity of the development needs.

=== Methodological ===
[[Methodology]] in systemic development must consider all variables, values, and sustainability principles, and aim to ensure that no elements have been neglected. It is important to ensure completeness, comprehensiveness, and transparency of the assessment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Mutual feedback and interactions between stakeholders should be modeled and assessed using carefully designed specific methodologies.

=== Epistemological ===
[[Epistemology]] stresses how dialogue and communication by the stakeholders are the key tools to systemic development. This is when the verification and confirmation of the facets of the development process are discovered. Insight from each stakeholder is important to enhance and broaden the perspective of all involved. It is essential to take these viewpoints into consideration because they influence the process, the trends, the drivers of change, and the interactions between the parts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is during this phase that learning is accomplished.

=== Axiological ===
Axiologology emphasizes the ethical and aesthetic responsibility during the development process. It is important because the solution manifested by the systemic development process needs to represent the values of the represented stakeholders.

==Framework ==
=== Holistic Thinking ===
To successfully achieve development through a [[systems approach]], holistic thinking is necessary. A holistic approach to a system thinks about each variable, the space between the variables and what defines the variable. “It’s the sum of the interaction of its parts”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this process each individual must learn from each other to understand the whole system in a [[multidimensional]] way to find a solution. To think about development with a systemic lens, one needs to be able to see the whole instead of parts and understand the relationship between the parts, the way the parts move, what drives the behavior of the parts, what influences the flow or direction, and to understand why there are no more or no fewer parts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Flander, Katleen De, and Jeb Brugmann. "Pressure-Point Strategy: Leverages for Urban Systemic Transformation." ''Sustainability'' 9.1 (2017): 99. ''Sustainability''. Web. 15 May 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/1/99&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The many factors that make up the whole can be a complex system.

=== Stakeholders ===
Including many diverse stakeholders helps each individual to grow their own perspective, gain an understanding of others and to increase their creativity. Systemic involvement must strive for a [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] approach instead of a [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] or [[interdisciplinary]] approach to achieve successful development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Transdisciplinary allows for the integration of methodologies and epistemologies through collaboration of the different stakeholders. Including more perspectives in the loop will increase the chance of a successful solution.

=== Communication and Learning ===
The foundation of systemic development, systems thinking, when applied, creates knowledge which leads to expanded knowledge, which leads to success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dialog is an essential tool for sharing knowledge and translating it into action. Communication can provide feedback and insight about “system, culture, practices, and artifacts and about the objectives and values of the project sponsor, client, and other stakeholders.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Learning happens during the dialog process as each stakeholder comes to observe other stakeholder’s values and ideas about what successful development would encompass.

''The Fifth Element'', by Peter Senge, emphasizes the importance of learning to improve lives using systems thinking. Individuals who acquire information, knowledge, and skills from other stakeholders and the environment tend to experience a change in their own lives and livelihood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They themselves then become the agents of change by sharing their knowledge with others.&lt;ref&gt;Work Bank. Knowledge for Development. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex loop ===
A feedback loop, closed loop, or systems complex model is a tool to help cope with complexity&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and understand the system as a whole. The tool will help to visualize the direction, velocity, delay time, long term and short term effects, and to help see the dynamic process. Feedback is necessary to learn about each other, including objectives and values of stakeholders and officials. A systemic approach to development is change oriented. The approach must encourage humans to communicate through interpersonal interactions, address the values of each stakeholder, and take part in developing and understanding the complex loop.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Goals ==
[[File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|thumb|Parts, society, needs, means, individuals, and bigger picture are pieces of the puzzle that must be accounted for to make systemic development successful.]]
Systemic development is based on the principle that one must understand the complexity of the whole system to develop a solution. This can be accomplished by learning different elements in the system and applying them to their existing knowledge. We must learn about the past suggested solutions, the balance of the system, influx of the system, the challenges within the system, the best timing for each element, learning about uncertainty of cause-and-effect, the best leverage points in the system, the system does not work unless every piece is functioning at its prime, and there is no one individual at fault if everyone is working together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/314017669|title=Systemic development : local solutions in a global environment|last=1944-|first=Sheffield, Jim,|last2=Emergence.|first2=Institute for the Study of Coherence and|last3=N.Z.)|first3=ANZSYS Conference (13th : 2007 : Auckland,|date=2009|publisher=Isce Publishing|isbn=9780981703275|oclc=314017669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of systemic development is to have community participants shift from being reactors to viewing themselves “as active participants in shaping their reality [to move] from reacting to the present to creating the future”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The non-linear processes must coincide, be fluid and strive to benefit all parties involved.

The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external [[primary sex characteristic|primary]] and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, such as the size of the [[breast]]s, [[genitals]], testicular volume and development of [[Pubic hair|pubic]] hair. This scale was first identified by [[James Mourilyan Tanner|James Tanner]], a British pediatrician, and thus bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3082|Tanner's stages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5440182"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall WA, Tanner JM |title=Variations in the pattern of pubertal changes in boys|journal=Arch.

Due to [[Human variability|natural variation]], individuals pass through the Tanner stages at different rates, depending in particular on the timing of [[puberty]]. In [[HIV]] treatment, the Tanner scale is used to determine which treatment regimen to follow (adult, adolescent or pediatric).

===Genitals (male)===
[[File:Tanner scale-male.svg|166px|thumb|Illustration of the Tanner scale for males.]]
; Tanner I
: [[Testicle|testicular]] volume less than 1.5 [[liter|ml]]; small penis (prepubertal; typically age nine and younger)
; Tanner II
: testicular volume between 1.6 and 6 ml; skin on scrotum thins, reddens and enlarges; penis length unchanged (9–11)
; Tanner III
: testicular volume between 6 and 12 ml; scrotum enlarges further; penis begins to lengthen (11–12.5)
; Tanner IV
: testicular volume between 12 and 20 ml; scrotum enlarges further and darkens; penis increases in length (12.5–14)
; Tanner V
: testicular volume greater than 20 ml; adult scrotum and penis (14+)

===Breasts (female)===
[[File:Tanner scale-female.svg|240px|thumb|Illustration of the Tanner scale for females.]]
; Tanner  I
: no glandular tissue: [[areola]] follows the skin contours of the chest (prepubertal) (typically age 10 and younger)
; Tanner II
: [[Thelarche|breast bud]] forms, with small area of surrounding glandular tissue; areola begins to widen (10–11.5)
; Tanner III
: breast begins to become more elevated, and extends beyond the borders of the areola, which continues to widen but remains in contour with surrounding breast (11.5–13)
; Tanner IV
: increased breast sizing and elevation; areola and [[nipple|papilla]] form a secondary mound projecting from the contour of the surrounding breast (13–15)
; Tanner V
: breast reaches final adult size; areola returns to contour of the surrounding breast, with a projecting central papilla. (15+)

===Pubic hair (both male and female)===

; Tanner I
: no pubic hair at all ([[Puberty|prepubertal]]) (typically age 10 and younger)
; Tanner II
: small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation at the base of the [[human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]] (males) or on the [[labia majora]] (females) (10–11.5)
; Tanner III
: hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally (11.5–13)
; Tanner IV
: adult–like hair quality, extending across [[mons pubis|pubis]] but sparing medial thighs (13–15)
; Tanner V
: hair extends to medial surface of the thighs (15+)

==Criticism==
The scale has been criticized by the [[pornography]] industry for its potential to lead to false [[child pornography]] convictions, such as in the case when United States federal authorities used it to assert that pornographic actress [[Lupe Fuentes]] was underage. Fuentes personally appeared at the trial and provided documentation that showed that the DVDs in question were legally produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/Lupe-Fuentes-Saves-Man-From-Bogus-Child-Porn-Charge-394003.html |title=Lupe Fuentes Saves Man From Bogus ‘Child Porn’ Charge|date=April 16, 2010|work=AVN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Film Star Verifies Her Age, Saves Fan From 20 Years In Prison|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/04/adult-film-star-verifies-her-age-saves-fan-20-years-prison |work=Radar Online|date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanner, the author of the classification system, has argued that age classification using the stages of the scale represents invalid use. Tanner stages do not match with chronological age, but rather maturity stages and thus are not diagnostic for age estimation.&lt;ref name="pmid9882230"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=AL|author2=Tanner, JM |title=Misuse of Tanner puberty stages to estimate chronologic age.|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 1998|volume=102|issue=6|page=1494|doi=10.1542/peds.102.6.1494|pmid=9882230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tecnology Life Cycle.png|right|frame|The typical life-cycle of a manufacturing process or production system from the stages of its initial conception to its culmination as either a technique or procedure of common practice or to its demise. The Y-axis of the diagram shows the business gain to the proprietor of the technology while the X-axis traces its lifetime.]]

The '''technology life-cycle''' ('''TLC''') describes the commercial gain of a product through the expense of research and development phase, and the financial return during its "vital life". Some technologies, such as steel, paper or cement manufacturing, have a long lifespan (with minor variations in technology incorporated with time) while in other cases, such as electronic or pharmaceutical products, the lifespan may be quite short.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nInjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=The+technology+underlying+the+product+(for+example,+that+of+a+uniquely+flavoured+tea)+may+be+quite+marginal+but+the+process+of+creating+and+managing+its+life+as+a#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20technology%20underlying%20the%20product%20(for%20example%2C%20that%20of%20a%20uniquely%20flavoured%20tea)%20may%20be%20quite%20marginal%20but%20the%20process%20of%20creating%20and%20managing%20its%20life%20as%20a&amp;f=false|title=Proceedings of IAC-MEM 2015 in Vienna|last=group of authors|publisher=Czech Institute of Academic Education z.s., 2015|year=2015|isbn=9788090579156|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TLC associated with a product or technological service is different from product life-cycle (PLC) dealt with in [[product life-cycle management]]. The latter is concerned with the life of a product in the marketplace with respect to timing of introduction, marketing measures, and business costs. The ''technology'' underlying the product (for example, that of a uniquely flavoured tea) may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different. 

The technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology, the timeline of recovering cost, and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved. The TLC may, further, be protected during its cycle with [[patents]] and [[trademark]]s seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it.

The ''product'' of the technology may be a commodity such as [[polyethylene]] plastic or a sophisticated product like the [[integrated circuit]]s used in a [[smartphone]].

The development of a ''competitive product'' or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology, making it shorter. Equally, the loss of intellectual property rights through litigation or loss of its secret elements (if any) through leakages also work to reduce a technology's lifespan. Thus, it is apparent that the ''management'' of the TLC is an important aspect of technology development.

Most new technologies follow a similar technology maturity lifecycle describing the [[technological maturity]] of a product. This is not similar to a [[product life cycle management|product life cycle]], but applies to an entire technology, or a generation of a technology.

Technology adoption is the most common phenomenon driving the evolution of industries along the industry lifecycle. After expanding new uses of resources they end with exhausting the efficiency of those processes, producing gains that are first easier and larger over time then exhaustingly more difficult, as the [[mature technology|technology matures]].

==The four phases of the technology life-cycle==
The TLC may be seen as composed of four phases:
#The '''research and development  (R&amp;D)''' phase (sometimes called the "bleeding edge") when incomes from inputs are negative and where the prospects of failure are high 
#The '''ascent''' phase when out-of-pocket costs have been recovered and the technology begins to gather strength by going beyond some Point A on the TLC (sometimes called the "leading edge") 
#The '''maturity''' phase when gain is high and stable, the region, going into saturation, marked by M, and 
#The '''decline''' (or decay phase), after a Point D, of reducing fortunes and utility of the technology.

===S-curve===
The shape of the technology lifecycle is often referred to as S-curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.improvementandinnovation.com/features/article/understanding-s-curve-innovation/|accessdate=15 October 2012|title=Understanding S-curve Innovation|journal=Improvementandinnovation.com|author=Dr. Chandana Jayalath|date=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology perception dynamics==
There is usually [[technology hype]] at the introduction of any new technology, but only after some time has passed can it be judged as mere hype or justified true acclaim.
Because of the [[logistic curve]] nature of technology adoption, it is difficult to see in the early stages whether the hype is excessive.

The two errors commonly committed in the early stages of a technology's development are:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* fitting an exponential curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming eternal [[exponential growth]]
* fitting a linear curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming that take-up of the new technology is disappointing

[[Image:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|Rogers' bell curve|300px]]
Similarly, in the later stages, the opposite mistakes can be made relating to the possibilities of [[mature technology|technology maturity]] and [[market saturation]].

The [[technology adoption life cycle]] typically occurs in an S curve, as modelled in [[diffusion of innovations]] theory. This is because customers respond to new products in different ways. Diffusion of innovations theory, pioneered by [[Everett Rogers]], posits that people have different levels of readiness for adopting new [[innovation]]s and that the characteristics of a product affect overall adoption. Rogers classified individuals into five groups: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. In terms of the S curve, innovators occupy 2.5%, early adopters 13.5%, early majority 34%, late majority 34%, and laggards 16%.

The four stages of technology life cycle are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.scribd.com/doc/20309856/Technology-Management-Growth-Lifecycle Technology Management - Growth &amp; Lifecycle], Shahid kv, Sep 28, 2009, Attribution Non-commercial&lt;/ref&gt;
*Innovation stage: This stage represents the birth of a new product, material of process resulting from R&amp;D activities. In R&amp;D laboratories, new ideas are generated depending on gaining needs and knowledge factors. Depending on the resource allocation and also the change element, the time taken in the innovation stage as well as in the subsequent stages varies widely.
*Syndication stage: This stage represents the demonstration and commercialisation of a new technology, such as, product, material or process with potential for immediate utilisation. Many innovations are put on hold in R&amp;D laboratories. Only a very small percentage of these are commercialised. Commercialisation of research outcomes depends on technical as well non-technical, mostly economic factors.
*[[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]] stage: This represents the market penetration of a new technology through acceptance of the innovation, by potential users of the technology. But supply and demand side factors jointly influence the rate of diffusion.
*Substitution stage: This last stage represents the decline in the use and eventual extension of a technology, due to replacement by another technology. Many technical and non-technical factors influence the rate of substitution. The time taken in the substitution stage depends on the market dynamics.

==Licensing options==
Large corporations develop technology for their own benefit and not with the objective of licensing. The tendency to license out technology only appears when there is a threat to the life of the TLC (business gain) as discussed later.&lt;ref&gt;Bayus, B. (1998). An Analysis of Product Lifetimes in a Technologically Dynamic Industry. Management Science, 44(6), pp.763-775.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Licensing in the R&amp;D phase===
There are always smaller firms ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]) who are inadequately situated to finance the development of innovative R&amp;D in the post-research and early technology phases. By sharing incipient technology under certain conditions,  substantial risk financing can come from third parties. This is a form of quasi-licensing which takes different formats. Even large corporates may not wish to bear all costs of development in  areas of significant and high risk (e.g. aircraft development) and may seek means of spreading  it to the stage that proof-of-concept is obtained.

In the case of small and medium firms, entities such as [[venture capitalists]] or business angels, can enter the scene and help to materialize technologies. Venture capitalists accept both the costs and uncertainties of R&amp;D, and that of market acceptance, in reward for high returns when the technology proves itself. Apart from finance, they may provide networking, management and marketing support. Venture capital connotes financial as well as human capital.

Larger firms may opt for Joint R&amp;D or work in a consortium for the early phase of development. Such vehicles are called [[strategic alliance]]s – strategic partnerships.
 
With both venture capital funding and strategic (research) alliances, when business gains begin to neutralize development costs (the TLC crosses the X-axis), the ownership of the technology starts to undergo change.

In the case  of smaller firms, venture capitalists help clients enter the stock market for obtaining substantially larger funds for development, maturation of  technology, product promotion and to meet marketing costs. A major route is through [[Initial Public Offering|initial public offering]] (IPO) which invites risk funding by the public for potential high gain. At the same time, the IPOs enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre-allotted to them (subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange). When the IPO is fully subscribed, the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans, etc. if needed.

Strategic alliance partners, allied on research, pursue separate paths of development with the incipient technology of common origin but pool their accomplishments through instruments such as 'cross-licensing'. Generally, contractual provisions among the members of the consortium allow a member to exercise the option of independent pursuit after joint consultation; in which case the optee owns all subsequent development.

===Licensing in the ascent phase ===
The ascent stage of the technology usually refers to some point above Point A in the TLC diagram but actually it  commences when the R&amp;D portion of the TLC curve inflects (only that the cashflow is negative and unremunerative to Point A). The ascent is the strongest phase of the TLC because it is here that the technology is superior to alternatives and can command premium profit or gain. The slope and duration of the ascent depends on competing technologies entering the domain, although they may not be ''as successful'' in that period. Strongly patented technology extends  the duration period.

The TLC begins to flatten out (the region shown as M) when equivalent or challenging technologies come into the competitive space and begin to eat away marketshare.

Till this stage is reached, the technology-owning firm would tend to exclusively enjoy its profitability, preferring ''not'' to license it. If an overseas opportunity does present itself, the firm would prefer to set up a  controlled subsidiary rather than license a third party.

===Licensing in the maturity phase===
The maturity phase of the technology is a period of stable and remunerative income but its competitive viability can persist over the larger timeframe marked by its 'vital life'. However, there may be a tendency to license out the technology to third parties during this stage to lower risk of  decline in profitability (or competitivity) and to expand financial opportunity.

The exercise of this option is, generally, inferior to seeking participatory exploitation; in other words, engagement in [[joint venture]], typically in regions where the technology would be in the ''ascent phase'',as say, a developing country. In addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the   technology-owner a degree of control over its use. Gain flows from the two streams of investment-based and royalty incomes. Further, the vital life of the technology is enhanced  in such strategy.

===Licensing in the decline phase===
After reaching a point such as D in the above diagram, the earnings from the technology begin to decline rather rapidly. To prolong the life cycle, owners of technology might try to license it out at  some point L when it can still be attractive to firms in other markets. This, then, traces the lengthening path, LL'. Further, since the decline is the result of competing rising technologies in this space, licenses may be attracted to the general lower cost of the older technology (than what prevailed during its vital life).

Licenses obtained in this phase are 'straight licenses'. They are free of direct control from the owner of the technology (as would otherwise apply, say, in the case of a joint-venture). Further, there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology.

The utility, viability, and thus the cost of straight-licenses depends on the estimated 'balance life' of the technology. For instance, should the key patent on the technology have expired, or would expire in a short while, the residual viability of the technology may be limited, although balance life may be governed by other criteria such as [[knowhow]] which could have a longer life if properly protected.

''It is important to note that the license has no way of knowing the stage at which the prime, and competing technologies, are on their TLCs''. It would, of course, be evident to competing licensor firms, and to the originator, from the growth, saturation or decline of the profitability of their operations.

The license may, however, be able to approximate the stage by vigorously negotiating with the licensor and competitors to determine costs and licensing terms. A lower cost, or easier terms, ''may'' imply a declining technology.

In any case, access to technology in the decline phase is a large risk that the licensee accepts. (In a joint-venture this risk is substantially reduced by licensor  sharing it). Sometimes, financial guarantees from the licensor may work  to reduce such risk and can be negotiated.

There are instances when, even though the  technology declines to becoming a technique, it may still contain important knowledge or experience which the licensee firm cannot learn of without help from the originator. This  is often the  form that ''technical service'' and ''technical assistance'' contracts take (encountered often in developing country contracts). Alternatively, consulting agencies may fill this role.

== Technology development cycle ==
According to the [[Encyclopedia of Earth]], "In the simplest formulation, innovation can be thought of as being composed of research, development, demonstration, and deployment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/156452/|title=Technological Innovation|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Earth]] |accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Adding [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]]: "specialist term for a work that collates all known variants of a text" ([[User:Galobtter/Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4568">{{short description|specialist term for a work that collates all known variants of a text}}
A '''variorum''', short for ''(editio) cum notis variorum'', is a work that collates all known variants of a text.  It is a work of [[textual criticism]], whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication. The [[Bible]] and the works of [[William Shakespeare]] have often been the subjects of variorum editions, although the same techniques have been applied with less frequency to many other works.

==Etymology==
The word ''variorum'' is Latin for 'of various [persons]' and derives from the phrase ''cum notis variorum'' ('with notes by various people') which was often used in the title-pages of Dutch books of the 17th century.

==Original meaning==
An older meaning of the word refers not to the text itself but to the assortment of illustrative notes printed with it: 'an edition of a text (usually [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]]) which includes annotations by a variety of critics and commentators'.  Variorum editions of this kind were a speciality of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] publishers of the 17th century, including the house of [[Elsevier]].  In these editions the text is usually taken, with little or no attempt at constructive modification, from a single widely accepted critical edition of the period;  the interest lies in the notes, which often fill three-quarters of each page, and which typically embody the complete commentaries of two or three recognised specialists in the work of the author in question, together with selected passages from several other commentators.  The notes will usually include textual variants, both documented and conjectural, together with examples of parallel usages and (for non-fiction texts) historical information.  Usually some middle-ranking literary man was appointed as general editor; occasionally, however, a first-rate scholar would preside over the edition and include original work of his own within it, [[Nicolas Heinsius]]'s edition of [[Claudius Claudianus|Claudian]] (Elsevier, 1661) being a good example.

==Notable variorum editions==
A variorum of the [[Bible]] has been produced at various times in history and of various scopes. Documenting each line of text with {{em|all}} variants in wording, from {{em|all}} known source documents, presented chronologically, helps translators of the Bible establish primacy and prevalence of various line readings.

There have also been noteworthy variorums of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], including the readings of all [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|quartos and folios]]; the textual decisions, or choices, of past editors; and a compilation of all critical notes. The first was that of [[Isaac Reed]] in 1803. Variorum editions help editors and scholars understand the historical evolution of the Shakespeare texts, as well as to decode dubious lines and decide upon most likely authorial intent.

[[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' is typically presented in variorum format, with both the 1781 and 1787 editions printed side-by-side in nearly all modern editions.

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' went through six editions with extensive changes. The text became a third larger, with numerous parts rewritten five times.  A variorum&lt;ref&gt;Peckham, Morse, ed. (1959), ''The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Variorum Text'', [[Philadelphia]]: [[University of Pennsylvania Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1959.

There is also a variorum of ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''. [[Walt Whitman]] produced either six or nine editions during his lifetime. The [[New York University Press]] produced a variorum in 1980 of these various editions.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Sculley, Harold W. Blodgett and William White, eds. (1980), ''Leaves of Grass: A Textual Variorum of the Printed Poems, 1855-1891''; 3 vol., (Series: ''The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman''); New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[James Strachey]] translation of [[Freud]]'s ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' in volumes four and five of ''[[The Standard Edition of The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud]]'' collates eight editions.

[[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s works have been collated to produce a voluminous digital variorum. It can be viewed on the [http://bichitra.jdvu.ac.in Bichitra] website.

Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. &lt;[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679 http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679]&gt;; accessed 14 January 2012. First published in A Supplement to the OED IV, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may refer to such a version of a text itself, a particular [[manuscript]] of the text, or a more complex manifestation of the text (e.g., a group of copies, or a group of excerpts).&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Jonathan D. H., ''Contours in the Text'' (T&amp;T Clark International, 2011), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the original-language version of a text which a translator then works into a [[translation]] is called the ''Vorlage'' of that translation.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman &amp; Kuhlken, ''What are the Dead Sea scrolls and why do they matter?'' (Eerdmans, 2007), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Luther Bible]] is a translation of the [[Textus Receptus]]. So in this case the Textus Receptus is the ''Vorlage'' of the Luther Bible.  

Sometimes the ''Vorlage'' of a translation may be lost to history.  In some of these cases the ''Vorlage'' may be reconstructed from the translation.  Such a reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may be called a ''retroversion'', and it invariably is made with some amount of uncertainty.  Nevertheless, the ''Vorlage'' may still be reconstructed in some parts at such a level of confidence that the translation and its retroversion can be used as a witness for the purposes of [[textual criticism]].  This reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may stand on its own as the sole witness of the original-language text, or it may be compared and used along with other witnesses.  Thus, for example, scholars use the reconstructed ''Vorlage'' of the Greek [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] at parts to correct the Hebrew [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] version when trying to determine oldest version of the Hebrew Bible that they can infer.&lt;ref&gt;Albrektson, B., "Masoretic or Mixed" in ''Text, Translation, Theology'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2010), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, as another example, the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] fragments of Plato's [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] included among the [[Nag Hammadi library]] are used to help attest to the original Greek text which Plato himself wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Slings, S. R., ''Platonis Rempublicam'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the bulk of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the ''Vorlage'' exists only as a retroversion of the Coptic translation, as no other witness to the original Greek text for most of the sayings recorded therein is known.&lt;ref&gt;Plisch, Uwe-Karsten ''Das Thomasevangelium, Originaltext mit Kommentar''. (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2184">'''William Zeitlin''' (c. 1850 – 1921, in [[Leipzig]]) was a Russian scholar and bibliographer born at [[Homel]], government (''[[guberniya]]'') of [[Moghilef]], about the middle of the 19th century. He is known especially as the author of ''Kiryat Sefer,'' or ''Bibliotheca Hebraica Post-Mendelssohniana'' (Leipzig, 1891–95), a bibliographical dictionary of modern [[Hebrew literature]] from the beginning of [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s epoch until 1890. The compilation of this work occupied Zeitlin for twenty years. He made extensive use of [[Benjacob]]'s ''Otzar ha-Sefarim'' and of [[Julius Fürst|Fürst]]'s ''Bibliotheca Judaica'', and visited [[Vilna]] and [[Warsaw]], the centers of the Hebrew book market, as well as many university cities—as [[Königsberg]], [[Berlin]], [[Geneva]], and [[Paris]]—from the libraries of which he gathered additional material for his work.

The ''Qiryat Sefer'' indexes not only works in book form, but also important periodical articles, biographical sketches, and scientific essays, in addition to giving biographical notes on several authors. Zeitlin had previously prepared an index of works written on the [[Hebrew calendar]], in which he enumerates seventy-seven Hebrew works; this index was published by [[Chayyim Jonah Gurland]] in ''Yevreiski Kalendar'' (St. Petersburg, 1882). In the ''Zeit. für Hebr. Bibl.'' (ix.3-4) Zeitlin has published an alphabetical list of anagrams and pseudonyms of modern Hebrew writers; he was also a contributor to several Hebrew periodicals, writing mostly biographical articles.

The '''Xanadu Houses''' were a series of [[experimental home]]s built to showcase examples of [[computer]]s and [[automation]] in the home in the [[United States]]. The architectural project began in 1979, and during the early 1980s three houses were built in different parts of the US: one each in [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]], [[Florida]]; [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin|Wisconsin Dells]], [[Wisconsin]]; and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], [[Tennessee]]. The houses included novel construction and design techniques, and became popular [[tourist attraction]]s during the 1980s.

The Xanadu Houses were notable for being built with [[polyurethane]] insulation foam rather than [[concrete]], for easy, fast, and cost-effective construction. They were [[ergonomics|ergonomically]] designed, and contained some of the earliest [[home automation]] systems. The Kissimmee Xanadu, designed by [[Roy Mason (architect)|Roy Mason]], was the most popular, and at its peak was attracting 1000&amp;nbsp;visitors every day. The Wisconsin Dells and Gatlinburg houses were closed and demolished in the early 1990s; the Kissimmee Xanadu House was closed in 1996 and demolished in October 2005.

==History==

=== Early development ===
Bob Masters was an early pioneer of houses built of rigid insulation. Before conceiving the Xanadu House concept, Masters designed and created inflatable balloons to be used in the construction of houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|title=Xanadu: The Computerized Home of Tomorrow and How It Can Be Yours Today!
|year=1983
|last = Mason
|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inspired by architect Stan Nord Connolly's Kesinger House in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], one of the earliest homes built from insulation. Masters built his first balloon-constructed house exterior in 1969 in less than three days during a turbulent snowstorm, using the same methods later used to build the Xanadu houses.&lt;ref name="bob earlydev"&gt;{{Citation
|title=Xanadu: The Computerized Home of Tomorrow and How It Can Be Yours Today!
|year=1983
|last = Mason
|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masters was convinced that these dome-shaped homes built of foam could work for others, so he decided to create a series of show homes in the United States. Masters's business partner Tom Gussel chose the name "Xanadu" for the homes, a reference to [[Shangdu|Xanadu]], the summer capital of [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], which is prominently featured in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s famous poem ''[[Kubla Khan]]''.&lt;ref name="firstxanadu"&gt;{{Citation
|title=Xanadu: The Computerized Home of Tomorrow and How It Can Be Yours Today!
|year=1983
|last = Mason
|pages=126–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Xanadu House opened in [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin|Wisconsin Dells]], [[Wisconsin]]. It was designed by architect Stewart Gordon and constructed by Masters in 1979.&lt;ref name="firstxanadu"/&gt; It was {{convert|4000|sqft|m2}} in area, and featured a geodesic greenhouse. 100,000 people visited the new attraction in its first summer.&lt;ref name="firstxanadu"/&gt;

Mason had worked on a similar project prior to his involvement in the creation of the Kissimmee Xanadu House &amp;mdash; an "experimental school" on a hill in [[Virginia]] which was also a foam structure. Both Mason and Masters were influenced by other experimental houses and building concepts which emphasized ergonomics, usability, and energy efficiency. These included apartments designed by architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]] featuring detachable building modules and more significant designs including a floating habitat made of fiberglass designed by Jacques Beufs for living on water surfaces, concepts for living underwater by architect Jacques Rougerie and the [[Don Metz house]] built in the 1970s which took advantage of the earth as insulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Mason believed Xanadu House would alter people's views of houses as little more than inanimate, passive shelters against the elements.&lt;ref name="commodore"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; "No one's really looked at the house as a total organic system", said Mason, who was also the architecture editor of ''The Futurist'' magazine. "The house can have intelligence and each room can have intelligence." The estimated cost of construction for one home was $300,000.&lt;ref name="commodore"/&gt; Roy Mason also planned a low cost version which would cost $80,000, to show that homes using computers do not have to be expensive. The low cost Xanadu was never built.  Approximately 1,000 homes were built using this type of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Time Passes Xanadu By: What Now? |publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |last1=Tin |first1=Annie |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-06-10/news/9406100679_1_xanadu-osceola-county-water-scooters |date=June 10, 1994 |accessdate=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It eventually opened in 1983, after several years of research into the concepts Xanadu would use. It was over {{convert|6000|sqft|m2}} in size, considerably larger than the average house because it was built as a showcase. At its peak in the 1980s, under the management of Wolter, more than 1,000 people visited the new Kissimmee attraction every day. A third Xanadu House was built in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Schlocky Gatlinburg antithesis of Smokies | publication-date=June 1, 1986 | periodical=[[Houston Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the Xanadu Houses were built and opened as visitor attractions, tourism companies began to advertise them as the "home of the future" in brochures encouraging people to visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Demise===
[[File:Xanadu_House_Exterior__(2004).jpg|thumb|right|Exterior of Xanadu House in Kissimmee, Florida, 2004]][[File:Xanadu-Home-of-the-Future-sign-in-Florida.jpg|thumb|right|Abandoned sign in Hunter's Creek, Florida, 2014|217x217px]]By the early 1990s, the Xanadu houses began to lose popularity because the technology they used was quickly becoming obsolete, and as a result the houses in Wisconsin and Tennessee were demolished, while the Xanadu House in Kissimmee continued to operate as a public visitor attraction until it was closed in 1996. It was consequently put up for sale in 1997 and was sold for office and storage use. By 2001, the Kissimmee house had suffered greatly from mold and mildew throughout the interior due to a lack of maintenance since being used as a visitor attraction, it was put up for sale again for an asking price of US$2 million. By October 2005, the last of the Xanadu houses had been demolished, following years of abandonment and use by the homeless. The Kissimmee house was also featured in the 2007 movie "[[Urban Explorers (film)|Urban Explorers: Into the Darkness]]". It showed the house in disrepair with doors wide open, mold growing everywhere and a homeless man living inside.  The "explorers" walked through the house filming the decay firsthand as the homeless man slept in a chair on the main floor.  At the end of the segment, the man wakes up and threatens the "explorers" telling them to leave his home.

==Design==

=== Construction ===
Construction of the Xanadu house in [[Kissimmee, Florida]], began with the pouring of a concrete slab base and the erection of a tension ring {{convert|40|ft|m}} in diameter to anchor the domed roof of what would become the "Great Room" of the house. A pre-shaped vinyl balloon was formed and attached to the ring, and then inflated by air pressure from large fans. Once the form was fully inflated, its surface was sprayed with quick-hardening polyurethane plastic foam.  The foam, produced by the sudden mixture of two chemicals that expand on contact to 30 times their original volume, hardened almost instantly. Repeated spraying produced a five-to-six-inch-thick structurally sound shell within a few hours. Once the foam cured, the plastic balloon form was removed to be used again. Once the second dome was completed and the balloon form removed, the two rooms were joined together by wire mesh which was also sprayed with foam to form a connecting gallery or hall. This process was repeated until the house was complete. Window, skylight, and door openings were cut and the frames foamed into place. Finally, the interior of the entire structure was sprayed with a 3/4&amp;nbsp;inch (1.9&amp;nbsp;cm) coating of fireproof material that also provided a smooth, easy-to-clean finish for walls and ceilings. The exterior was given a coat of white elastomeric paint as the final touch.&lt;ref name="centerpages"&gt;{{Citation

|year=1983
|last = Mason
|pages=Plate A–L (Center insert)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interior ===
A Xanadu House was ergonomically designed, with future occupants in mind. It used curved walls, painted concrete floors rather than carpets, a light color scheme featuring cool colors throughout, and an open-floor plan linking rooms together without the use of doors. It had at least two entrances, and large porthole-type windows. The interior of the house was cave-like, featuring cramped rooms and low ceilings, although it is not clear whether these accounts describe the same Xanadu House with a thirty-foot dome. The interiors used a cream color for the walls, and a pale green for the floor.

The Xanadu house in Kissimmee, Florida used an [[automation|automated]] system controlled by [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[microcomputer]]s.&lt;ref name="commodore"/&gt; The house had fifteen rooms; of these the kitchen, party room, health spa, and bedrooms all used computers and other electronic equipment heavily in their design.&lt;ref name="dayatxanadu"&gt;{{Citation

The Xanadu Houses aimed to bring the original concepts into a finished and working implementation. Inside the house, there was an electronic [[tour guide]] for the benefit of visitors, and the family room featured video screens that displayed computer-graphics art. These art displays were constantly changing, being displayed on video screens as opposed to static mediums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

At the center of the house was the "great room", the largest in the house. It featured a large false tree supporting the roof, and also acted as part of the built-in heating system. The great room also included a [[fountain]], small television set, and a [[video projector]]. Nearby was the dining room, featuring a glass table with a curved seat surrounding it; behind the seats was a large [[window covering]] the entire wall. The family room featured walls covered with television monitors and other [[Electronics|electronic]] equipment.&lt;ref name="computers_amazing_machines_pg92-93"/&gt; The [[entertainment center]] in the family room was described as an "electronic hearth" by the home's builders.&lt;ref name="computers_amazing_machines_pg92-93"/&gt; It was planned as a gathering place for family members and relatives along the same lines as a traditional hearth with a [[fireplace]].&lt;ref name="centerpages"/&gt;&lt;ref name="computers_amazing_machines_pg92-93"/&gt;

If new food was required, it could either be obtained via tele-shopping through the computer system or from Xanadu's own greenhouse. The kitchen's computer terminal could also be used for the household calendar, records, and home bookkeeping.&lt;ref name="centerpages"/&gt;

The Xanadu homes also suggested a way to do [[business]] at home with the [[office]] room and the use of computers for electronic mail, access to stock and commodities trading, and news services.

Computers in the master bedroom allowed for other parts of the house to be controlled. This eliminated chores such as having to go downstairs to turn off the coffee pot after one had gone to bed. The children's bedroom featured the latest in teaching microcomputers and "videotexture" windows, whose realistic computer-generated landscapes could shift in a flash from scenes of real places anywhere in the world to imaginary scenes. The beds at the right of the room retreated into the wall to save space and cut down on clutter; the study niches were just the right size for curling up all alone with a pocket computer game or a book.&lt;ref name="centerpages" /&gt;

In the spa, people could relax in a whirlpool, sun sauna, and environmentally-controlled habitat, and exercise with the assistance of spa monitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Concerns over energy consumption ===
An initial concern was that electricity costs would be excessive, since several computers would be operating continuously.&lt;ref name="commodore"/&gt; Mason figured that a central computer could control the energy consumption of all the other computers in the house.&lt;ref name="commodore"/&gt;
