Though most of the mass in the universe seems to be in the form of dark matter, Big Bang theory and various observations seem to indicate that it is not made out of conventional [[baryonic matter]] (protons, neutrons, and electrons) but it is unclear exactly what it ''is'' made out of.

Since [[Georges Lemaître]] first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion.

American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their [[redshift]]s. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction.&lt;ref name="hubble"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Copernican principle]] (that the Earth is not the center of the universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.

Large [[particle accelerator]]s can replicate the conditions that prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement of the details of the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into [[high-energy physics|high energy regimes]]. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.

The first [[subatomic particle]]s to be formed included [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s. Though simple [[big bang nucleosynthesis|atomic nuclei formed]] within the first three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first [[Recombination (cosmology)|electrically neutral atoms formed]]. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were [[hydrogen]], along with [[helium]] and traces of [[lithium]]. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through [[gravity]] to form [[star]]s and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|within stars]] or [[supernova nucleosynthesis|during supernovae]].

The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the [[cosmic microwave background|CMB]], [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structure]], and [[Hubble's Law]].&lt;ref name=Wright2009&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework for the Big Bang model relies on [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] and on simplifying assumptions such as [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space. The governing equations were formulated by [[Alexander Friedmann]], and similar solutions were worked on by [[Willem de Sitter]]. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its [[parametrization]] as the [[Lambda-CDM model]] serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology. The Lambda-CDM model is the current "standard model" of Big Bang cosmology, [[Scientific consensus|consensus]] is that it is the simplest model that can account for the various measurements and [[Observational cosmology|observations relevant to cosmology]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] indicates that [[general relativity]] is not an adequate description of the [[laws of physics]] in this regime. Models based on general relativity alone can not extrapolate toward the singularity beyond the end of the [[Planck epoch]].

This primordial singularity is itself sometimes called "the Big Bang",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roos |first=M. |editor1-first=O. |editor1-last=Engvold |editor2-first=R. |editor2-last=Stabell |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Czerny |editor4-first=J. |editor4-last=Lattanzio |title=Astronomy and Astrophysics |chapter=Expansion of the Universe – Standard Big Bang Model |series=Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |date=2008 |arxiv=0802.2005 |quote=This singularity is termed the ''Big Bang''. |ref=harv|bibcode = 2008arXiv0802.2005R }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term can also refer to a more generic early hot, dense phase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Drees |first=W.

In either case, "the Big Bang" as an event is also colloquially referred to as the "birth" of our universe since it represents the point in history where the universe can be verified to have entered into a [[Equation of state (cosmology)|regime]] where the laws of physics as we understand them (specifically general relativity and the [[Standard Model|standard model of particle physics]]) work. Based on measurements of the expansion using [[Type Ia supernova]]e and measurements of temperature fluctuations in the [[cosmic microwave background]], the time that has passed since that event — otherwise known as the "[[age of the universe]]" — is 13.799 ± 0.021&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Planck Collaboration |title=Planck 2015 results.

Despite being extremely [[density|dense]] at this time—far denser than is usually required to form a [[black hole]]—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This may be explained by considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for [[gravitational collapse]] are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as [[star]]s, and do not apply to [[metric expansion of space|rapidly expanding space]] such as the Big Bang.

=== Inflation and baryogenesis ===
{{Main| Cosmic inflation|baryogenesis}}
The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneously]] and [[isotropic]]ally with a very high [[energy density]] and huge temperatures and [[pressure]]s and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds into the expansion, a [[phase transition]] caused a [[cosmic inflation]], during which the universe grew [[exponential growth|exponentially]] during which time [[Quantum fluctuation|density fluctuations]] that occurred because of the [[uncertainty principle]] were amplified into the seeds that would later form the [[Structure formation|large-scale structure]] of the universe.&lt;ref name="guth"&gt;{{cite book

This resulted in the predominance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] in the present universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c6"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2MASS LSS chart-NEW Nasa.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Panoramic view of the entire [[near-infrared]] sky reveals the distribution of galaxies beyond the Milky Way. Galaxies are color-coded by [[redshift]].]]
The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. [[Explicit symmetry breaking|Symmetry breaking]] phase transitions put the [[fundamental force]]s of physics and the parameters of [[elementary particles]] into their present form.&lt;ref name="kolb_c7"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; After about 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in [[particle accelerator]]s. At about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form [[baryon]]s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by [[photon]]s (with a minor contribution from [[neutrino]]s).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million) [[kelvin]] and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's [[deuterium]] and helium [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"/&gt; Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"/&gt;

As the universe cooled, the [[rest mass]] energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]]. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded.

=== Cosmic acceleration ===
{{Main|Accelerating expansion of the universe}}
Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as [[dark energy]], which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the [[Hubble's law|expansion of the universe]] to slowly begin to accelerate.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[Einstein's field equation]]s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] and relationship with the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

All of this cosmic evolution after the [[inflationary epoch]] can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of [[quantum gravity|quantum gravitation]] is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]].

== Features of the model ==
The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of [[physical law]]s and the [[cosmological principle]]. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropy|isotropic]].

These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the [[fine structure constant]] over much of the [[age of the universe]] is of order 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

If the large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler [[Copernican principle]], which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.&lt;ref&gt;

===Expansion of space===
{{Main|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Metric expansion of space}}
General relativity describes spacetime by a [[metric tensor|metric]], which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, are themselves specified using a [[coordinate chart]] or "grid" that is laid down over all [[spacetime]]. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] on large scales, which uniquely singles out the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW metric). 
This metric contains a [[scale factor]], which describes how the size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a [[coordinate system]] to be made, called [[comoving coordinates]]. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their ''coordinate'' distance ([[comoving distance]]) remains constant, the ''physical'' distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the [[scale factor]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, [[metric expansion of space|space itself expands]] with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion ''in space'', but rather an expansion ''of space''.&lt;ref name="HTUW"/&gt; Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara M. Davis and Charles H. Lineweaver, ''Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the Universe''. [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808 astro-ph/0310808]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horizons===
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of [[particle horizon]]s. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a ''past horizon'' on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a ''future horizon'', which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FLRW]] model that describes our universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Our understanding of the universe back to very early times [[Big Bang#Horizon problem|suggests]] that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the universe continues to [[accelerating universe|accelerate]], there is a future horizon as well.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Big Bang theory}}
{{See also|Timeline of cosmological theories}}

===Etymology===
English astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]] is credited with coining the term "Big Bang" during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast, saying: "These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past."&lt;ref&gt;

It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "[[steady state universe|steady state]]" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 [[Vesto Slipher]] measured the first [[Doppler shift]] of a "[[spiral nebula]]" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was [[Shapley–Curtis debate|highly controversial]] whether or not these nebulae were "island universes" outside our [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;

Independently deriving Friedmann's equations in 1927, [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian physicist, proposed that the inferred recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the universe.&lt;ref name=gl1927&gt;

}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.&lt;ref&gt;

Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the [[cosmic distance ladder]], using the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity—now known as [[Hubble's law]].&lt;ref name="hubble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="christianson"&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal [[Steady state theory|steady state]] universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory.&lt;ref&gt;

===Hubble's law and the expansion of space===
{{Main|Hubble's law|Metric expansion of space}}
{{See also|Distance measures (cosmology)|Scale factor (universe)}}
Observations of distant galaxies and [[quasar]]s show that these objects are redshifted—the [[light]] emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a [[frequency spectrum]] of an object and matching the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] pattern of [[emission line]]s or [[absorption line]]s corresponding to [[atom]]s of the [[chemical element]]s interacting with the light. These redshifts are [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniformly]] isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional [[velocity]] of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;v = H_0D&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the recessional [[velocity]] of the [[galaxy]] or other distant object,
* &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]] to the object, and
* &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is [[Hubble's constant]], measured to be {{val|70.4|+1.3|-1.4}} [[kilometres|km]]/[[second|s]]/[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] by the [[WMAP]] probe.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt;

[[Hubble's law]] has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the [[Copernican principle]]—or the universe is [[Metric expansion of space|uniformly expanding]] everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922&lt;ref name=af1922 /&gt; and Georges Lemaître in 1927,&lt;ref name=gl1927 /&gt; well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker]].

The theory requires the relation &lt;math&gt;v = HD&lt;/math&gt; to hold at all times, where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]], ''v'' is the [[recessional velocity]], and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; vary as the universe expands (hence we write &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; to denote the present-day Hubble "constant"). For distances much smaller than the size of the [[observable universe]], the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.&lt;ref name="peacock_c3"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Metric expansion of space|space is undergoing metric expansion]] is shown by direct observational evidence of the [[Cosmological principle]] and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely [[isotropic]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneous]],&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt; supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

Measurements of the effects of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position.&lt;ref&gt;

Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.

In 1964 [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the [[microwave]] band.&lt;ref name="penzias" /&gt; Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation was found to be approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725&amp;nbsp;K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1978.

The ''surface of last scattering'' corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after ''[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]'', the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly [[Thomson scattering|scattered]] from free charged particles. Peaking at around {{val|372|14|u=kyr}},&lt;ref name="WMAP2003Spergel" /&gt; the mean free path for a photon becomes long enough to reach the present day and the universe becomes transparent.

In 1989, [[NASA]] launched the [[Cosmic Background Explorer satellite]] (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements showed that the &lt;abbr title="cosmic microwave background raditation"&gt;CMB&lt;/abbr&gt; frequency spectrum is an almost perfect [[blackbody]] with no deviations at a level of 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726&amp;nbsp;K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255&amp;nbsp;K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="cobe" /&gt; [[John C. Mather]] and [[George Smoot]] were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.

During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]], found the [[shape of the universe]] to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Melchiorri |first=A., et. al. |title=A measurement of Omega from the North American test flight of BOOMERANG |volume=536 |issue=2 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=1999 |arxiv=astro-ph/9911445|doi=10.1086/312744 |pmid=10859119 |bibcode=2000ApJ...536L..63M |pages=L63–L66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Bernardis |first=P. |display-authors=etal |title=A Flat Universe from High-Resolution Maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation |pages=955–959 |journal=Nature |volume=404 |issue=6781 |year=2000 |arxiv=

In early 2003, the first results of the [[WMAP|Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific [[cosmic inflation]] models, but are consistent with the [[inflation theory]] in general.&lt;ref name="wmap1year" /&gt; The [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based [[List of cosmic microwave background experiments|cosmic microwave background experiments]] are ongoing.

===Abundance of primordial elements===
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}
Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of [[helium-4]], [[helium-3]], deuterium, and [[lithium-7]] in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen.&lt;ref name = "kolb_c4"/&gt; The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of [[photon]]s to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for &lt;chem&gt;^4He/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^2H/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^3He/H&lt;/chem&gt; and about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li/H&lt;/chem&gt;.&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for &lt;chem&gt;^4He&lt;/chem&gt;, and off by a factor of two for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li&lt;/chem&gt;; in the latter two cases there are substantial [[systematic error|systematic uncertainties]]. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to "tune" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium.&lt;ref&gt;

===Galactic evolution and distribution===
{{Main|Galaxy formation and evolution|Structure formation}}
Detailed observations of the [[Galaxy morphological classification|morphology]] and [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|distribution]] of galaxies and [[quasars]] are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as [[galaxy clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"/&gt;

Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of [[star formation]], galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"&gt;

In 2011, astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium.&lt;ref&gt;

The age of the universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of [[stellar evolution]] to [[globular clusters]] and through [[radiometric dating]] of individual [[Population II]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Problems}}Problems and related issues in physics==
{{See also|List of unsolved problems in physics}}
As with any theory, a number of mysteries and problems have arisen as a result of the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the [[horizon problem]], the [[magnetic monopole problem]], and the [[flatness problem]] are most commonly resolved with [[Cosmic inflation|inflationary theory]], but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Earman |first1=John |last2=Mosterín |first2=Jesús |date=March 1999 |title=A Critical Look at Inflationary Cosmology |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=1–49 |doi=10.1086/392675 |jstor=188736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Baryon asymmetry===
{{Main|Baryon asymmetry}}
It is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Kolb and Turner, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the [[Sakharov conditions]] must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] are violated and that the universe depart from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="sakharov"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;(Translated in ''[[Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters]]'' '''5''', 24 (1967).)
&lt;/ref&gt; All these conditions occur in the [[Standard Model]], but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.

===Dark energy===
{{Main|Dark energy}}
Measurements of the [[redshift]]–[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] relation for [[type Ia supernova]]e indicate that the expansion of the universe has been [[accelerating universe|accelerating]] since the universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large [[equation of state (cosmology)|negative pressure]], dubbed "dark energy".&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt; Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of [[gravitational lens]]es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is believed to be a property of [[vacuum energy]], but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt; According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the [[far future]] as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

The dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including Einstein's [[cosmological constant]] but also extending to more exotic forms of [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] or other modified gravity schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |journal=Particle Data Group 2014 Review of Particle Physics |date=December 2013 |arxiv=1401.0046|bibcode = 2014arXiv1401.0046M }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |work=LEVEL 5 — A Knowledgebase for Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology, NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology |date=2014-06-27 |url=https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March14/Mortonson/Mortonson_contents.html |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cosmological constant problem]], sometimes called the "most embarrassing problem in physics", results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy, and the one naively predicted from [[Planck units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rugh |first1=S.&amp;thinsp;E. |last2=Zinkernagel |first2=H. |title=The quantum vacuum and the cosmological constant problem |pages=663–705 |volume=33 |issue=4 |date=December 2002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219802000333 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(02)00033-3 |arxiv=hep-th/0012253|bibcode = 2002SHPMP..33..663R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
[[File:Cosmological Composition – Pie Chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[pie chart|Chart]] shows the proportion of different components of the universe {{spaced ndash}} about 95% is [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].]]
During the 1970s and the 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal [[baryon]]ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, [[galaxy cluster]] velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, [[gravitational lensing]] studies, and [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray measurements]] of galaxy clusters.&lt;ref&gt;

Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many [[particle physics]] candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.&lt;ref name="pdg"&gt;

Additionally, there are outstanding problems associated with the currently favored [[cold dark matter]] model which include the [[dwarf galaxy problem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bullock |first1=James |title=Notes on the Missing Satellites Problem |journal=XX Canary Islands Winter School of Astrophysics on Local Group Cosmology |arxiv=1009.4505|bibcode = 2010arXiv1009.4505B |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[cuspy halo problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diemand |first1=Jürg |last2=Zemp |first2=Marcel |last3=Moore |first3=Ben |last4=Stadel |first4=Joachim |last5=Carollo |first5=C.

===Horizon problem===
The [[horizon problem]] results from the premise that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the [[particle horizon]]—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in [[causality (physics)|causal]] contact.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; The observed isotropy of the [[Cosmic microwave background|CMB]] is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Sue Ryden|title=Introduction to cosmology|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|191–202}}

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by [[inflationary theory]] in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

[[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be [[primordial fluctuations|quantum thermal fluctuations]], which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"/&gt;{{rp|207}} Inflation predicts that the [[primordial fluctuations]] are nearly [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]] and [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spergel |first=D. N. |display-authors=etal |title=Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Implications for Cosmology |pages=377–408 |format=PDF |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume=170 |issue=2 |year=2007 |url=

If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

A related issue to the classic horizon problem arises because in most standard cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] occurs, so inflation should not be able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the [[electroweak vacuum]] since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the [[electroweak epoch]] ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Penrose|title=The Road to Reality|publisher=Vintage books|year=2007|isbn=978-0-679-77631-4|title-link=The Road to Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic monopoles===
The [[magnetic monopole]] objection was raised in the late 1970s. [[Grand unified theory|Grand unified theories]] predicted [[topological defect]]s in space that would manifest as [[magnetic monopole]]s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by [[cosmic inflation]], which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt;

===Flatness problem===
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The overall [[Shape of the universe|geometry of the universe]] is determined by whether the [[Density parameter|Omega cosmological parameter]] is less than, equal to or greater than 1. Shown from top to bottom are a [[Shape of the universe#Spherical universe|closed universe]] with positive curvature, a [[Shape of the universe#Hyperbolic universe|hyperbolic universe]] with negative curvature and a [[flat universe]] with zero curvature.]]

The [[flatness problem]] (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW).&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt; The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial [[curvature]] depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]; positive if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be ''flat''.

The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Strictly, dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant drives the universe towards a flat state; however, our universe remained close to flat for several billion years before the dark energy density became significant.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the [[Planck time]], 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds,&lt;ref name=HTUW/&gt; the fact that the universe has reached neither a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] nor a [[Big Crunch]] after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.&lt;ref&gt;

== Cause ==
{{Main|Problem of why there is anything at all}}
Physics may conclude that [[time]] did not exist before 'Big Bang', but 'started' with the &lt;!--beginning point--&gt;Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Big Bang?

== Ultimate fate of the universe ==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe}}

Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass [[density]] of the universe were greater than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]], then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Alternatively, if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach [[absolute zero]]—a [[Big Freeze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Griswold |first=Britt |title=What is the Ultimate Fate of the Universe? |work=Universe 101 Big Bang Theory |publisher=NASA |date=2012 |url=
http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if the proton were [[proton decay|unstable]], then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]]. The [[entropy]] of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Fred C. |last2=Laughlin |first2=Gregory |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A dying Universe: the long-term fate and evolution of astrophysical objects |pages=337–372 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=69 |issue=2 |date=1997 |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337| arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|sec VI.D}}

Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our [[event horizon]] and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a [[cosmological constant]]. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called [[phantom energy]] theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Misconceptions ==
The following is a partial list of misconceptions about the Big Bang model:

''The Big Bang as the origin of the universe:'' One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the belief that it was the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|title=Brief Answers to Cosmic Questions|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu|access-date=2017-07-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413195349/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Big Bang was "small"'': It is misleading to visualize the Big Bang by comparing its size to everyday objects. When the size of the universe at Big Bang is described, it refers to the size of the observable universe, and not the entire universe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Tamara M.|last2=Lineweaver|first2=Charles H.|date=January 2004|title=Expanding Confusion: Common Misconceptions of Cosmological Horizons and the Superluminal Expansion of the Universe|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/expanding-confusion-common-misconceptions-of-cosmological-horizons-and-the-superluminal-expansion-of-the-universe/EFEEEFD8D71E59F86DDA82FDF576EFD3|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|volume=21|issue=1|pages=97–109|doi=10.1071/as03040|arxiv = astro-ph/0310808 |bibcode = 2004PASA...21...97D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hubble's law]] violates the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]]'': Hubble's law predicts that galaxies that are beyond [[Hubble's law|Hubble Distance]] recede [[Faster-than-light|faster than the speed of light]]. However, special relativity does not apply beyond motion through space. Hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion ''of'' space, rather than ''through'' space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''[[Doppler effect|Doppler redshift]] vs [[Cosmological redshift|cosmological red-shift]]'': Astronomers&amp;nbsp;often refer to the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Speculations ==
{{Main|Cosmogony}}

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined. The Big Bang theory, built upon the equations of classical general relativity, indicates a [[essential singularity|singularity]] at the origin of cosmic time; this [[infinity#Physics|infinite]] [[energy density]] is regarded as impossible in [[experimental physics|physics]].  Still, it is known that the equations are not applicable before the time when the universe cooled down to the [[Planck temperature]], and this conclusion depends on various assumptions, of which some could never be experimentally verified. ''(Also see [[Planck epoch]].)''

One proposed refinement to avoid this would-be singularity is to develop a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;

It is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated, though speculation abounds in the field of [[cosmogony]].

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:
* Models including the [[Hartle–Hawking state|Hartle–Hawking no-boundary condition]], in which the whole of space-time is finite; the Big Bang does represent the limit of time but without any singularity.&lt;ref&gt;

* [[Brane cosmology]] models, in which inflation is due to the movement of branes in [[string theory]]; the pre-Big Bang model; the [[ekpyrotic]] model, in which the Big Bang is the result of a collision between branes; and the [[cyclic model]], a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Cosmic latte''' is a name assigned to the average color of the [[universe]], found by a team of [[astronomers]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In 2001, [[Karl Glazebrook]] and Ivan Baldry determined that the average color of the universe was a greenish white, but they soon corrected their analysis in a 2002 paper in which they reported that their survey of the light from over 200,000 [[galaxy|galaxies]] averaged to a slightly [[beige]]ish [[white]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldry|first=Ivan K.|last2=Glazebrook|first2=Karl|last3=Baugh|first3=Carlton M.|last4=Bland‐hawthorn|first4=Joss|last5=Bridges|first5=Terry|last6=Cannon|first6=Russell|last7=Cole|first7=Shaun|last8=Colless|first8=Matthew|last9=Collins|first9=Chris|year=2002|title=The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey: Constraints on Cosmic Star Formation History from the Cosmic Spectrum|publisher=The American Astronomical Society|publication-date=20 April 2002|volume=569|issue=2|pages=582–594|doi=10.1086/339477|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|periodical=The Astrophysical Journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0110676|bibcode=2002ApJ...569..582B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hex Triplet|hex triplet]] value for cosmic latte is #FFF8E7.

==Discovery of the color==

Finding the average color of the universe was not the focus of the study. Rather, the study examined spectral analysis of different galaxies to study [[star]] formation. Like [[Fraunhofer lines]], the dark lines displayed in the study's spectral ranges display older and younger stars and allow Glazebrook and Baldry to determine the age of different galaxies and star systems. What the study revealed is that the overwhelming majority of stars formed about 5 billion years ago. Because these stars would have been "brighter" in the past, the color of the universe changes over time shifting from blue to red as more blue stars change to yellow and eventually [[red giants]].

As light from distant galaxies reaches the Earth, the average "color of the universe" (as seen from Earth) tends towards pure white, due to the light coming from the stars when they were much younger and bluer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/Cosmic-Spectrum.html|title=The Cosmic Spectrum|last=Glazebrook|first=Karl|website=www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming of the color===
The corrected color was initially published on the Johns Hopkins News website and updated on the team's initial announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/press/color.html|title=Headlines@Hopkins: Johns Hopkins University News Releases|website=www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple news outlets, including [[NPR]] and [[BBC News|BBC]], displayed the color in stories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/jan/aas/020110.aas.html|title=NPR : The Color of the Universe Is...|last=Valentine|first=Vikki|website=www.npr.org|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some relayed the request by Glazebrook on the announcement asking for suggestions for names, jokingly adding all were welcome as long as they were not "beige".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1861957.stm|title=Universe is off colour|last=|first=|date=March 8, 2002|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2002/03/universe-beige-not-turquoise/|title=Universe: Beige, not Turquoise|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These were the results of a vote of the scientists involved based on the new color:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kgb/cosspec/topten.htm|title=The Cosmic Spectrum|date=2002-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021005185037/http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kgb/cosspec/topten.htm|archive-date=2002-10-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Drum's suggestion of "cappuccino cosmico" received the most votes, the researchers favored Drum's other suggestion, "cosmic latte". This is because the similar "Latteo" means "Milky" in Italian, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo's]] native language. It also leads to the similarity to the Italian term for the Milky Way, "Via Lattea", and they enjoyed the fact that the color would be similar to the Milky Way's average color as well, as it is part of the sum of the universe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/07/01/science/6faba612-7ee5-49bf-a652-6a0eae42d7c5/|title=SCIENCE|date=2002-07-01|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claimed to be "caffeine biased".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Cosmography''' is the science that [[map]]s the general features of the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]], describing both [[heaven]] and [[Earth]] (but without encroaching on [[geography]] or [[astronomy]]). The 14th-century work ''[['Aja'ib al-makhluqat wa-ghara'ib al-mawjudat]]'' by [[Persian people|Persian]] physician [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] is considered to be an early work of cosmography.

Traditional Hindu, Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] cosmography schematize a universe centered on [[Mount Meru]] surrounded by rivers, continents and seas.  These cosmographies posit a universe being repeatedly created and destroyed over time cycles of immense lengths.

an Engraving on Wood, attributed to---&gt; &amp;ndash; by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], in the "Cosmographie" of Munster (Basle, 1552, folio).]]
In 1551, [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]], from [[Zaragoza]], Spain, published ''[[Breve compendio de la esfera y del arte de navegar]]''. Translated into English and reprinted several times, the work was of great influence in Britain for many years. He proposed spherical charts and mentioned magnetic deviation and the existence of magnetic poles.

[[Peter Heylin]]'s 1652 book ''Cosmographie'' (enlarged from his ''Microcosmos'' of 1621) was one of the earliest attempts to describe the entire world in English, and being the first known description of [[Australia]] and among the first of [[California]]. The book has 4 sections, examining the geography, politics, and cultures of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, with an addendum on ''[[Terra incognita|Terra Incognita]]'', including Australia, and extending to [[Utopia]], [[Álfheimr|Fairyland]], and the "Land of [[Chivalry|Chivalrie]]".

In 1659, Thomas Porter published a smaller, but extensive ''Compendious Description of the Whole World'', which also included a [[chronology]] of world events from [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] forward. These were all part of a major trend in the [[European Renaissance]] to explore (and perhaps comprehend) the known world.

The word was also commonly used by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in his lectures.

In [[astrophysics]], the term "cosmography" is beginning to be used to describe attempts to determine the large-scale [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|matter distribution]] and [[kinematics]] of the [[universe|observable universe]], dependent on the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] but independent of the temporal dependence of the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] on the matter/energy composition of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''cosmos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɒ|z|m|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|m|oʊ|s}}) is the [[universe]]. Using the word ''cosmos'' rather than the word ''universe'' implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly [[system]] or entity; the opposite of [[Chaos (cosmogony)| chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;

The cosmos, and our understanding of the reasons for its existence and significance, are studied in [[cosmology]] - a very broad discipline covering any scientific, religious, or philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and its nature, or reasons for existing. Religious and philosophical approaches may include in their concepts of the cosmos various spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe.

== Etymology ==
The [[philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]] first used the term ''cosmos'' ({{lang-grc|κόσμος}}) for the order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Pyth.'', β 59; [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] ΙΙ 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaxagoras]] further introduced the concept of a Cosmic Mind (''[[Nous]]'') ordering all things (Aetius Ι 3.5).&lt;/ref&gt; The term became part of modern language in the 19th century when geographer–polymath [[Alexander von Humboldt]] resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned it to his five-volume treatise, ''[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]]'', which influenced modern and somewhat [[holism|holistic]] perception of the universe as one interacting [[entity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MfgpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe|last=Humboldt|first=Alexander von|last2=Paul|first2=Benjamin Horatio|last3=von)|first3=Wilhelm Humboldt (Freiherr|last4=Dallas|first4=William Sweetland|date=1860|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humansandnature.org/introducing-humboldt-s-cosmos-article-26.php|title=Introducing Humboldt's Cosmos {{!}} Center for Humans &amp; Nature|website=Center for Humans &amp; Nature|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosmology ==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|The Ancient and [[Medieval]] cosmos as depicted in [[Peter Apian]]'s ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539).]]
[[Cosmology]] is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems have a cosmology.

When ''cosmology'' is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.

=== Physical cosmology ===
{{main|Cosmology}}
Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In [[physical cosmology]], the term ''cosmos'' is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular [[spacetime]] continuum within a (postulated) [[multiverse]]. Our particular cosmos, the [[observable universe]], is generally capitalized as ''the Cosmos''. 

In physical cosmology, the uncapitalized term '''cosmic''' signifies a subject with a relationship to the universe, such as 'cosmic time' (time since the [[Big Bang]]), '[[cosmic rays]]' (high energy particles or radiation detected from [[outer space|space]]), and '[[cosmic microwave background]]' (microwave radiation detectable from all directions in space).

According to [[wikisource:Author:Charles Peter Mason|Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]] ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' (1870, see book screenshot for full quote), [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] described the universe.&lt;ref name=CPM&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William Smith|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year=1870|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/304/|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philolaus-and-Philomelus-Pythagorean-Book.jpg|thumb|upright|Excerpt from [[Philolaus]] Pythagoras book, (Charles Peter Mason, 1870)]]
{{quote|
It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book (from [[Philolaus]]) of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things. (p. 305)}}

=== Philosophical cosmology ===
{{main|Philosophical cosmology}}
Cosmology is a branch of [[metaphysics]] that deals with the nature of the universe, a theory or doctrine describing the natural order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cosmology|title=Definition of "Cosmology"|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic definition of Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of the universe. In modern astronomy the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] is the dominant postulation.

=== Religious cosmology ===
{{see also|Religious cosmology|Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity|Orphism (religion)}}

In [[theology]], the cosmos is the [[Creation myth|created]] heavenly bodies (sun, moon, planets, and [[fixed stars]]). In [[Christian theology]], the word is also used synonymously with ''[[aeon|aion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concerning Aion and Aionios|url=http://www.saviourofall.org/Writings/aion.html|publisher=Saviour of All Fellowship|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" or "this age" as opposed to the [[afterlife]] or [[world to come]].

The 1870 book ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' noted&lt;ref name=CPM /&gt;
:[[Thales]] dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed Orphic cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by ''Thales'', was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the [[Miletus|Milesian]]. (p. 1016)

:[[Plato]], describes the idea of the good, or the Godhead, sometimes ''teleologically'', as the ultimate purpose of all conditioned existence; sometimes ''cosmologically'', as the ultimate operative cause; and has begun to develop the ''cosmological'', as also the physico-theological proof for the being of God; but has referred both back to the idea of the Good, as the necessary presupposition to all other ideas, and our cognition of them. (p. 402)

The book ''The Works of Aristotle'' (1908, p.&amp;nbsp;80 ''Fragments'') mentioned&lt;ref name=Aristotle1908&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft|title=The Works of Aristotle|year=1908|author=Aristotle|author2=Ross, W. D. (William David), 1877|author3=Smith, J. A. (John Alexander), 1863-1939|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Aristotle says the poet ''Orpheus'' never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain ''Cercon'' (see [[Cercops]]).

[[Bertrand Russell]] (1947) noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1947|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of "enthusiasm," of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree religious.

'''Debris''' or '''débris''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|d|ɛ|b|r|iː|,_|ˈ|d|eɪ|b|r|iː}}, {{IPAc-en|US|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|iː}}) is [[rubble]], wreckage, [[ruins]], [[litter]] and discarded [[waste|garbage/refuse/trash]], scattered remains of something destroyed, discarded, or as in geology, large rock fragments left by a melting glacier etc. Depending on context, ''debris'' can refer to a number of different things. The first apparent use of the French  word in English is in a 1701 description of the army of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] upon its retreat from a battle with the army of Oliver Cromwell, in England.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Sir Philip. (1701). Memoires of the Reigne of King Charles I: With a continuation to the happy restoration of King Charles II. London: Ri.Chiswell. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
In disaster scenarios, [[tornado]]s leave behind large pieces of houses and mass destruction overall. This debris also flies around the tornado itself when it is in progress. The tornado's winds capture debris it kicks up in its wind orbit, and spins it inside its vortex. The tornado's wind radius is larger than the funnel itself. tsunamis and hurricanes also bring large amounts of debris, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Earthquakes rock cities to rubble debris.

==Geological==
[[Image:ObsidianDomeCA.JPG|thumb|[[Obsidian]] debris (talus), Obsidian Dome, [[California]].]]
In [[geology]], debris usually applies to the remains of geological activity including [[landslide]]s, [[volcanic]] explosions, [[avalanches]], [[Mudslide|mudflows]] or [[Glacial lake outburst flood]]s (Jökulhlaups) and [[moraine]], [[lahars]], and [[lava]] eruptions. Geological debris sometimes moves in a [[stream]] called a [[debris flow]].  When it accumulates at the base of hillsides, it can be called "talus" or "[[scree]]".

In [[mining]], debris called ''attle'' usually consists of rock fragments which contain little or no ore.

==Marine==
{{Main|marine debris}}
[[Image:Marine debris on Hawaiian coast.jpg|thumb|[[Marine debris]] washed ashore on [[Hawaii]]]]
''Marine debris'' applies to floating garbage such as [[bottles]], [[Tin can|cans]], [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]], cruise [[ship]] waste, offshore [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] exploration and production facilities [[pollution]], and [[fishing]] paraphernalia from professional and recreational boaters. Marine debris is also called [[litter]] or [[flotsam and jetsam]]. Objects that can constitute marine debris include used [[automobile]] [[tires]], [[detergent]] [[bottles]], [[medical waste]]s, discarded fishing line and [[Net (device)|nets]], soda cans, and [[bilge]] waste solids.

In addition to being unsightly, it can pose a serious threat to marine life, [[boats]], [[human swimming|swimmers]], [[underwater diving|divers]], and others. For example, each year millions of seabirds, sea [[turtle]]s, [[fish]], and marine [[mammal]]s become entangled in marine debris, or ingest plastics which they have mistaken for food. As many as 30,000 northern fur seals per year get caught in abandoned fishing nets and either drown or suffocate. [[Whales]] mistake [[plastic]] bags for [[squid]], and [[birds]] may mistake plastic pellets for fish [[roe|eggs]]. At other times, animals accidentally eat the plastic while feeding on natural food.

The largest concentration of marine debris is the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

Marine debris most commonly originates from land-based sources. Various international agencies are currently working to reduce marine debris levels around the world.

==Meteorological==
In [[meteorology]], debris usually applies to the remains of [[human]] habitation and natural [[flora (plants)|flora]] after [[storm]] related destruction. This debris is also commonly referred to as '''storm debris'''. Storm debris commonly consists of roofing material, downed [[tree]] [[branch|limbs]], downed [[wikt:signs|signs]], downed [[power line]]s and poles, and wind-blown garbage. Storm debris can become a serious problem immediately after a storm, in that it often blocks access to individuals and communities that may require emergency services. This material frequently exists in such large quantities that disposing of it becomes a serious issue for a community. In addition, storm debris is often hazardous by its very nature, since, for example, downed power lines annually account for storm-related deaths.
{{See also|debris ball|road debris}}

==Space==
{{Main|space debris}}
''Space debris'' usually refers to the remains of [[spacecraft]] that have either fallen to [[Earth]] or are still orbiting Earth. Space debris may also consist of natural components such as chunks of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[ice]]. The problem of space debris has grown as various space programs have left legacies of launches, explosions, repairs, and discards in both low Earth [[orbit]] and more remote orbits. These orbiting fragments have reached a great enough proportion to constitute a hazard to future space launches of both [[satellite]] and manned vehicles. Various government agencies and international organizations are beginning to track space debris and also research possible solutions to the problem. While many of these  items, ranging in size from [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[Screw|bolts]] to entire satellites and spacecraft, may fall to Earth, other items located in more remote orbits may stay aloft for centuries. The velocity of some of these pieces of space junk have been clocked in excess of 17,000 miles per hour (27,000&amp;nbsp;km/h). A piece of space debris falling to Earth leaves a fiery trail, just like a [[meteor]].

A [[debris disk]] is a circumstellar disk of dust and debris in orbit around a star.

==Surgical==
In [[medicine]], debris usually refers to biological matter that has accumulated or lodged in [[surgical instruments]] and is referred to as '''surgical debris'''. The presence of surgical debris can result in cross-infections or [[nosocomial infection]]s if not removed and the affected surgical instruments or equipment properly [[disinfect]]ed.

==War==
[[Image:Boys Toys edit.jpg|thumb|right|A child plays on an abandoned tank outside [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in 1991]]
In the aftermath of a war, large areas of the region of conflict are often strewn with ''war debris'' in the form of abandoned or destroyed hardware and vehicles, mines, [[unexploded ordnance]], bullet casings and other fragments of metal.

Much war debris has the potential to be lethal and continues to kill and maim civilian populations for years after the end of a conflict. The risks from war debris may be sufficiently high to prevent or delay the return of refugees. In addition war debris may contain hazardous chemicals or radioactive components that can contaminate the land or poison civilians who come into contact with it. Many [[Mine clearance agencies]] are also involved in the clearance of war debris.

[[Land mines]] in particular are very dangerous as they can remain active for decades after a conflict, which is why they have been banned by international war regulations.

In November 2006 the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V to the 1980 Convention)
| year=2003
| publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross
| accessdate=2006-06-20
| url=http://www.icrc.org/IHL.nsf/FULL/610?OpenDocument
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
came into effect with 92 countries subscribing to the treaty that requires the parties involved in a conflict to assist with the removal of unexploded ordnance following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2006-06-20
| url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=1803977&amp;C=mideast
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the countries most affected by war debris are [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Laos]].

Similarly ''military debris'' may be found in and around [[firing range]]s and military training areas.

Debris can also be used as [[Cover (military)|cover]] for military purposes, depending on the situation.

==Culinary==
In South Louisiana's [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] and [[Cajun]] cultures, debris (pronounced "DAY-bree") refers to chopped organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, tripe, spleen, brain, lungs and pancreas.

A '''double layer''' ('''DL''', also called an '''electrical double layer''', '''EDL''') is a structure that appears on the surface of an object when it is exposed to a fluid. The object might be a solid particle, a gas bubble, a liquid [[droplet]], or a [[porous media|porous body]]. The DL refers to two parallel layers of charge surrounding the object. The first layer, the [[surface charge]] (either positive or negative), consists of ions [[adsorbed]] onto the object due to chemical interactions.   The second layer is composed of ions attracted to the surface charge via the [[Coulomb force]], electrically [[Electric-field screening|screening]] the first layer. This second layer is loosely associated with the object. It is made of free ions that move in the fluid under the influence of [[Electromagnetism|electric attraction]] and [[thermal motion]] rather than being firmly anchored.  It is thus called the "diffuse layer".

[[Interface (chemistry)|Interfacial]] DLs are most apparent in systems with a large surface area to volume ratio, such as a [[colloid]] or porous bodies with particles or pores (respectively) on the scale of micrometres to nanometres. However, DLs are important to other phenomena, such as the [[electrochemical]] behaviour of [[electrode]]s.

DLs play a fundamental role in many everyday substances. For instance, homogenized milk exists only because fat droplets are covered with a DL that prevents their [[coagulation (milk)|coagulation]] into butter. DLs exist in practically all [[heterogeneous]] fluid-based systems, such as blood, paint, ink and ceramic and cement [[slurry]].

The DL is closely related to [[electrokinetic phenomena]] and [[electroacoustic phenomena]].

== Development of the (interfacial) double layer ==

=== Helmholtz ===
[[File:EDLC-Potentialdistribution.png|thumb|right|200px|Simplified illustration of the potential development in the area and in the further course of a Helmholtz double layer.]]
When an ''electronic'' conductor is brought in contact with a solid or liquid ''ionic'' conductor (electrolyte), a common boundary ([[Interface (chemistry)|interface]]) among the two [[Phase (matter)|phases]] appears. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=H.|periodical=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|title=Ueber einige Gesetze der Vertheilung elektrischer Ströme in körperlichen Leitern mit Anwendung auf die thierisch-elektrischen Versuche |volume=165|issue=6|year=1853|pages=211–233|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18531650603|last1=Helmholtz|bibcode=1853AnP...165..211H}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to realize that [[Electric charge|charged]] electrodes immersed in electrolyte solutions repel the co-ions of the charge while attracting counterions to their surfaces. Two layers of opposite [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] form at the interface between electrode and electrolyte.
In 1853 he showed that an electrical double layer (DL) is essentially a [[molecule|molecular]] dielectric and stores charge electrostatically.&lt;ref name="EDL"&gt;{{cite web | title = The electrical double layer | year = 2011 | url = http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/sciences/Chemistry/Electrochemis/Electrochemical/ElectricalDouble/ElectricalDouble.htm | accessdate = 23 April 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110531014449/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Chemistry/Electrochemis/Electrochemical/ElectricalDouble/ElectricalDouble.htm | archivedate = 31 May 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Below the electrolyte's decomposition voltage, the stored charge is linearly dependent on the voltage applied.

This early model predicted a constant [[differential capacitance]] independent from the charge density depending on the [[dielectric constant]] of the electrolyte [[solvent]] and the thickness of the double-layer.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk"&gt;{{cite web |author= Adam Marcus Namisnyk |title= A survey of electrochemical supercapacitor technology |url= http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |accessdate= 2012-12-10 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141222044332/http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |archivedate= 2014-12-22 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Srinivasan"&gt;Srinivasan S.

This model, with a good foundation for the description of the interface, does not consider important factors including diffusion/mixing of ions in solution, the possibility of [[adsorption]] onto the surface and the interaction between solvent [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moments]] and the electrode.

=== Gouy-Chapman ===
[[Louis Georges Gouy]] in 1910 and [[David Chapman (scientist)|David Leonard Chapman]] in 1913 both observed that capacitance was not a constant and that it depended on the applied potential and the ionic concentration. The "Gouy-Chapman model" made significant improvements by introducing a [[Diffusion|diffuse]] model of the DL. In this model the charge distribution of ions as a function of distance from the metal surface allows [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] to be applied. Thus the [[electric potential]] [[Exponential decay|decreases exponentially]] away from the surface of the fluid bulk.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Ehrenstein  | first = Gerald  | title = Surface charge  | year = 2001  | url = http://www.biophysics.org/Portals/1/PDFs/Education/ehrenstein.pdf  | accessdate = 30 May 2011  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928073500/http://www.biophysics.org/Portals/1/PDFs/Education/ehrenstein.pdf  | archive-date = 2011-09-28  | dead-url = yes  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stern ===
The Gouy-Chapman model fails for highly charged DLs. In 1924 [[Otto Stern]] suggested combining the Helmholtz model with the Gouy-Chapman model: In Stern's model, some ions adhere to the electrode as suggested by Helmholtz, giving an internal Stern layer, while some form a Gouy-Chapman diffuse layer.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, O. ''Z.Electrochem'', 30, 508 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stern layer accounts for ions' finite size and consequently an ion's closest approach to the electrode is on the order of the ionic radius. The Stern model has its own limitations, namely that it effectively treats ions as point charges, assumes all significant interactions in the [[diffuse layer]] are [[Coulomb]]ic,  and assumes [[dielectric permittivity]] to be constant throughout the double layer and that fluid viscosity is constant plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = SMIRNOV  | first = Gerald  | title = Electric Double Layer  | year = 2011| url = http://web.nmsu.edu/~snsm/classes/chem435/Lab14/double_layer.html   | accessdate = 23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grahame ===

Outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), 3. Diffuse layer, 4. Solvated ions (cations) 5. Specifically adsorbed ions (redox ion, which contributes to the pseudocapacitance), 6. Molecules of the electrolyte solvent]]
D. C. Grahame modified the Stern model in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Grahame, Chem. Rev., 41 (1947) 441&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that some ionic or uncharged species can penetrate the Stern layer, although the closest approach to the electrode is normally occupied by solvent molecules. This could occur if ions lose their [[solvation shell]] as they approach the electrode. He called ions in direct contact with the electrode "specifically adsorbed ions". This model proposed the existence of three regions. The inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) passes through the centres of the specifically adsorbed ions. The outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) passes through the centres of solvated ions at the distance of their closest approach to the electrode.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nakamura et al., "Outer Helmholtz Plane of the Electrical Double Layer Formed at the Solid Electrode–Liquid Interface" ChemPhysChem, 12 (2011) 1430&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the diffuse layer is the region beyond the OHP.

=== Bockris/Devanathan/Müller (BDM) ===
In 1963 [[John Bockris|J. O'M. Bockris]], M. A. V. Devanathan and [[Klaus Müller (chemist)|Klaus Müller]]&lt;ref&gt;J. O'M. Bockris, M. A. V Devanathan, and K. Mueller, Proc. Roy. Soc, Ser. A. 274, 55 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the BDM model of the double-layer that included the action of the solvent in the interface. They suggested that the attached molecules of the solvent, such as water, would have a fixed alignment to the electrode surface. This first layer of solvent molecules displays a strong orientation to the electric field depending on the charge. This orientation has great influence on the [[permittivity]] of the solvent that varies with field strength. The IHP passes through the centers of these molecules. Specifically adsorbed, partially solvated ions appear in this layer. The solvated ions of the electrolyte are outside the IHP. Through the centers of these ions pass the OHP. The diffuse layer is the region beyond the OHP.

=== Trasatti/Buzzanca ===
Further research with double layers on ruthenium dioxide films in 1971 by Sergio Trasatti and Giovanni Buzzanca demonstrated that the electrochemical behavior of these electrodes at low voltages with specific adsorbed ions was like that of capacitors. The specific adsorption of the ions in this region of potential could also involve a partial charge transfer between the ion and the electrode. It was the first step towards understanding pseudocapacitance.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan" /&gt;

=== Conway ===
[[File:Bockris Group At Imperical College, London 1947.png|thumb|left|Ph.D., Brian Evans Conway within the [[John Bockris]] Group At [[Imperial College]], London 1947]]

Between 1975 and 1980 [[Brian Evans Conway]] conducted extensive fundamental and development work on [[ruthenium oxide]] electrochemical capacitors. In 1991 he described the difference between 'Supercapacitor' and 'Battery' behavior in electrochemical energy storage. In 1999 he coined the term supercapacitor to explain the increased capacitance by surface redox reactions with faradaic charge transfer between electrodes and ions.&lt;ref name="Conway Transition"&gt;{{citation|last1=Conway|first1=B.E.|periodical=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|title=Transition from 'Supercapacitor' to 'Battery' Behavior in Electrochemical Energy Storage |volume=138|issue=6|pages=1539–1548|date= May 1991|language=German|doi=10.1149/1.2085829}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Shukla, T.P. Kumar, Electrochemistry Encyclopedia, [http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p05-pillars-of-ec.htm Pillars of modern electrochemistry: A brief history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820095410/http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p05-pillars-of-ec.htm |date=August 20, 2013 }} Central Electrochemical Research Institute, (November, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

His "supercapacitor" stored electrical charge partially in the Helmholtz double-layer and partially as the result of faradaic reactions with "pseudocapacitance" charge transfer of electrons and protons between electrode and electrolyte. The working mechanisms of pseudocapacitors are redox reactions, intercalation and electrosorption.

=== Marcus ===

The physical and mathematical basics of electron charge transfer absent chemical bonds leading to pseudocapacitance was developed by [[Rudolph A. Marcus]]. [[Marcus Theory]] explains the rates of electron transfer reactions—the rate at which an electron can move from one chemical species to another. It was originally formulated to address [[outer sphere electron transfer]] reactions, in which two chemical species change only in their charge, with an electron jumping. For redox reactions without making or breaking bonds, Marcus theory takes the place of [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Henry Eyring]]'s [[transition state theory]] which was derived for reactions with structural changes. Marcus received the [[List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry|Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1992 for this theory.&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1992/index.html Rudolph A.

[[File:DoubleLayer.gif|thumb|360px|detailed illustration of interfacial DL]]

As stated by Lyklema, "...the reason for the formation of a "relaxed" ("equilibrium") double layer is the non-electric affinity of charge-determining ions for a surface..."&lt;ref name="Lyklema"&gt;Lyklema, J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol.2, page.3.208, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This process leads to the buildup of an [[electric surface charge]], expressed usually in C/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This surface charge creates an electrostatic field that then affects the ions in the bulk of the liquid. This electrostatic field, in combination with the thermal motion of the ions, creates a counter charge, and thus screens the electric surface charge. The net electric charge in this screening diffuse layer is equal in magnitude to the net surface charge, but has the opposite polarity. As a result, the complete structure is electrically neutral.

The diffuse layer, or at least part of it, can move under the influence of [[tangential]] [[Stress (physics)|stress]]. There is a conventionally introduced slipping plane that separates mobile fluid from fluid that remains attached to the surface. Electric potential at this plane is called [[electrokinetic potential]] or [[zeta potential]] (also denoted as ζ-potential).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ian D.|last1=Morrison|first2=Sydney|last2=Ross|title=Colloidal dispersions : suspensions, emulsions, and foams|date=2002|publisher=Wiley|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-471-17625-1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Jingkun|last2=Oberdörster|first2=Günter|last3=Biswas|first3=Pratim|title=Characterization of size, surface charge, and agglomeration state of nanoparticle dispersions for toxicological studies|journal=Journal of Nanoparticle Research|date=25 June 2008|volume=11|issue=1|pages=77–89|doi=10.1007/s11051-008-9446-4|bibcode=2009JNR....11...77J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electric potential on the external boundary of the Stern layer versus the bulk electrolyte is referred to as [[Stern potential]]. Electric potential difference between the fluid bulk and the surface is called the electric surface potential.

Usually [[zeta potential]] is used for estimating the degree of DL charge. A characteristic value of this electric potential in the DL is 25 mV with a maximum value around 100 mV (up to several volts on electrodes&lt;ref name=Kirby /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.S. Bogotsky, Fundamentals of Electrochemistry, Wiley-Interscience, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;). The chemical composition of the sample at which the ζ-potential is 0 is called the [[point of zero charge]] or the [[iso-electric point]]. It is usually determined by the solution pH value, since protons and hydroxyl ions are the charge-determining ions for most surfaces.&lt;ref name=Kirby /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyklema /&gt;

Zeta potential can be measured using [[electrophoresis]], [[electroacoustic phenomena]], [[streaming potential]], and [[electroosmotic flow]].

The characteristic thickness of the DL is the [[Debye length]], κ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is reciprocally proportional to the square root of the ion concentration ''C''. In aqueous solutions it is typically on the scale of a few nanometers and the thickness decreases with increasing concentration of the electrolyte.

The electric field strength inside the DL can be anywhere from zero to over 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;V/m. These steep electric potential gradients are the reason for the importance of the DLs.

The theory for a flat surface and a symmetrical electrolyte&lt;ref name="Lyklema" /&gt; is usually referred to as the Gouy-Chapman theory. It yields a simple relationship between electric charge in the diffuse layer σ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; and the Stern potential Ψ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hanaor| first1=D.A.H.| last2=Ghadiri| first2=M.

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma^d = -\sqrt{{8\varepsilon_0}{\varepsilon_m}CRT}\sinh \frac{F\Psi^d}{2RT}&lt;/math&gt;

There is no general analytical solution for mixed electrolytes, curved surfaces or even spherical particles. There is an asymptotic solution for spherical particles with low charged DLs. In the case when electric potential over DL is less than 25 mV, the so-called Debye-Huckel approximation holds. It yields the following expression for electric potential'' Ψ'' in the spherical DL as a function of the distance ''r'' from the particle center:

:&lt;math&gt; {\Psi}(r) = {\Psi^d}\frac{a}{r}\exp({-\kappa}(r-a))&lt;/math&gt;

There are several asymptotic models which play important roles in theoretical developments associated with the interfacial DL.

The first one is "thin DL". This model assumes that DL is much thinner than the colloidal particle or capillary radius. This restricts the value of the Debye length and particle radius as following:

:&lt;math&gt;     {\kappa}a &gt;&gt;1    &lt;/math&gt;

This model offers tremendous simplifications for many subsequent applications. Theory of [[electrophoresis]] is just one example.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R.J. "Foundations of Colloid Science", Oxford University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[electroacoustic phenomena]] is another example.&lt;ref name="Dukhin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dukhin |first=A.S. |authorlink= |author2=Goetz, P.J. |editor= |others= |title=Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2002 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=33 |chapter=Electroacoustic Theory |chapterurl=http://www.dispersion.com/pages/theory/psd/modeltheory.html |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thin DL model is valid for most aqueous systems because the Debye length is only a few nanometers in such cases. It breaks down only for nano-colloids in solution with ionic strengths close to water.

The opposing "thick DL" model assumes that the Debye length is larger than particle radius:

:&lt;math&gt;     {\kappa}a &lt;1    &lt;/math&gt;

This model can be useful for some nano-colloids and non-polar fluids, where the Debye length is much larger.

The last model introduces "overlapped DLs".&lt;ref name="Dukhin" /&gt; This is important in concentrated dispersions and emulsions when distances between particles become comparable with the Debye length.

== Electrical double layers ==
The '''electrical double layer''' ('''EDL''') is the result of the variation of [[electric potential]] near a surface, and has a significant influence on the behaviour of [[colloid]]s and other surfaces in contact with [[solution]]s or solid-state [[fast ion conductor]]s. 

The primary difference between a double layer on an electrode and one on an interface is the mechanisms of [[surface charge]] formation. With an electrode, it is possible to regulate the surface charge by applying an external electric potential. This application, however, is impossible in colloidal and porous double layers, because for colloidal particles, one does not have access to the interior of the particle to apply a potential difference.

EDLs are analogous to the [[double layer (plasma)|double layer]] in [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. 

=== Differential capacitance ===
{{Main article|Differential capacitance}}
EDLs have an additional parameter defining their characterization: [[differential capacitance]]. Differential capacitance, denoted as ''C'', is described by the equation below:

:&lt;math&gt; C = \frac{d \sigma}{ d \Psi}&lt;/math&gt;

where σ is the [[surface charge]] and ψ is the [[electric surface potential]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6177">'''Dynamical dimensional reduction''' or '''spontaneous dimensional reduction''' is the apparent reduction in the number of spacetime dimensions as a function of the distance scale, or conversely the energy scale, with which spacetime is probed. At least within the current level of experimental precision, our universe has three dimensions of space and one of time. However, the idea that the number of dimensions may increase at extremely small length scales was first proposed more than a century ago,&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom, G. Z. Phys. 15 (1914) 504.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now fairly commonplace in theoretical physics. Contrary to this, a number of recent results in quantum gravity suggest the opposite behavior, a dynamical reduction of the number of spacetime dimensions at small length scales. 
== Evidence for dimensional reduction==
The phenomenon of dimensional reduction has now been reported in a number of different approaches to quantum gravity. String theory,&lt;ref&gt;Atick, J. J. Witten, E.; [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321388901514?via%3Dihub The Hagedorn Transition and the Number of Degrees of Freedom of String Theory].&lt;/ref&gt; causal dynamical triangulations,&lt;ref&gt;Ambjorn, J. Jurkiewicz, J. Loll, R.; [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.171301 Spectral Dimension of the Universe].&lt;/ref&gt; renormalization group approaches,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lauscher, O. M. Reuter, E.; [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1126-6708/2005/10/050/meta Fractal Spacetime Structure in Asymptotically Safe Gravity].&lt;/ref&gt; noncommutative geometry,&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti, D.; Fractal properties of quantum spacetime [https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1396 arXiv:0811.1396].&lt;/ref&gt; loop quantum gravity&lt;ref&gt;Modesto, L.; Fractal Structure of Loop Quantum Gravity [https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2214 arXiv:0812.2214].&lt;/ref&gt; and Horava-Lifshitz gravity&lt;ref&gt;Horava, P.; Spectral Dimension of the Universe in Quantum Gravity at a Lifshitz Point [https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3657 arXiv:0902.3657].&lt;/ref&gt; all find that the dimensionality of spacetime appears to decrease from approximately 4 on large distance scales to approximately 2 on small distance scales. 

The evidence for dimensional reduction has come mainly, although not exclusively, from calculations of the spectral dimension. The spectral dimension is a measure of the effective dimension of a manifold at different resolution scales. Early numerical simulations within the [[Causal_dynamical_triangulation|causal dynamical triangulation]] (CDT) approach to quantum gravity found a spectral dimension of 4.02 ± 0.10 at large distances and 1.80 ± 0.25 at small distances. This result created significant interest in dimensional reduction within the quantum gravity community. A more recent study of the same point in the parameter space of CDT found consistent results, namely 4.05 ± 0.17 at large distances and 1.97 ± 0.27 at small distances.&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N. Jurkiewicz, J.; [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP03%282015%29151 Evidence for Asymptotic Safety from Dimensional Reduction in Causal Dynamical Triangulations,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7712 arXiv:1411.7712].&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is no consensus on the correct theoretical explanation for the mechanism of dimensional reduction.  

== Possible explanations ==

The ubiquity and consistency of dimensional reduction in quantum gravity has driven the search for a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon. Currently, there exist few proposed explanations for the observation of dimensional reduction. 

One proposal is that of scale invariance. There is growing evidence that gravity may be nonperturbatively renormalizable as described by the asymptotic safety program, which requires the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point at high energies towards which the couplings defining the theory flow.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At such a fixed point gravity must be scale invariant, and hence Newton's constant must be dimensionless. Only in 2-dimensional spacetime is Newton's constant dimensionless, and so in this scenario going to higher energies and hence flowing towards the fixed point should correspond to the dimensionality of spacetime reducing to the value 2. This explanation is not entirely satisfying as it does not explain why such a fixed point should exist in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.; Spontaneous Dimensional Reduction in Short-Distance Quantum Gravity? [https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3329 arXiv:0909.3329].&lt;/ref&gt;

A second possible explanation for dimensional reduction is that of asymptotic silence. General relativity exhibits so-called asymptotic silence in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity, which is the narrowing or focusing of light cones close to the Planck scale leading to a causal decoupling of nearby spacetime points. In this scenario, each point has a preferred spatial direction, and geodesics see a reduced (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.; Dimension and Dimensional Reduction in Quantum Gravity [https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05417 arXiv:1705.05417].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimensional reduction implies a deformation or violation of Lorentz invariance and typically predicts an energy dependent speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;Sotiriou, T. Visser, M. Weinfurtner, S.; From dispersion relations to spectral dimension - and back again [https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6098 arXiv:1105.6098].&lt;/ref&gt; Given such radical consequences, an alternative proposal is that dimensional reduction should not be taken literally, but should instead be viewed as a hint of new Planck scale physics.&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N.; [https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.91.124040 Hypothesis on the nature of time,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04320 arXiv:1502.04320].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D.

Received [[radiation]] is unevenly distributed over the planet, because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions. The atmosphere and ocean work non-stop to even out solar heating imbalances through [[evaporation]] of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation. Earth is very close to being in [[radiative equilibrium]], the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space; under that condition, global temperatures will be ''relatively'' stable. Globally, over the course of the year, the Earth system—land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere—absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter. Anything that increases or decreases the amount of incoming or outgoing energy will change global temperatures in response.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2009"&gt;{{cite journal

However, Earth's energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors, such as atmospheric composition (mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases), the [[albedo]] (reflectivity) of surface properties, cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns.

Changes in surface temperature due to Earth's energy budget do not occur instantaneously, due to the [[inertia]] of the [[ocean]]s and the [[cryosphere]]. The net heat flux is buffered primarily by becoming part of the [[ocean heat content|ocean's heat content]], until a new equilibrium state is established between radiative forcings and the climate response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Energy budget==
[[File:Earth_heat_balance_Sankey_diagram.svg|thumb|250px|left|A [[Sankey diagram]] illustrating the Earth's energy budget described in this section &amp;mdash; line thickness is linearly proportional to relative amount of energy.&lt;ref name="energy_budget" /&gt;]]
In spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the Earth, it maintains a relatively constant temperature because, as a whole, there is little net gain or loss: Earth emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation (shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths) to space about the same amount of energy as it receives via insolation (all forms of electromagnetic radiation).

To quantify Earth's ''heat budget'' or ''heat balance'', let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be 100 units (100 units = about 1,360 watts per square meter facing the sun), as shown in the accompanying illustration. Called the [[albedo]] of Earth, around 35 units are reflected back to space: 27 from the top of clouds, 2 from snow and ice-covered areas, and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The 65 remaining units are absorbed: 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth’s surface. These 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation: 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere (19 through latent heat of condensation, 9 via convection and turbulence, and 6 directly absorbed). The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation) are finally radiated back to space. These 65 units (17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere) balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth.&lt;ref name="energy_budget"&gt;

===Incoming radiant energy (shortwave)===

The total amount of energy received per second at the top of [[Earth's atmosphere]] (TOA) is measured in [[watt]]s and is given by the [[solar constant]] times the cross-sectional area of the Earth. Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere (i.e. the area of a circle), the average TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earth's radiation balance and its representation in CMIP5 models|publisher=Copernicus|year=2013|author1=Wild, Martin |author2=Folini, Doris |author3=Schär, Christoph |author4=Loeb, Norman |author5=Dutton, Ellsworth |author6=König-Langlo, Gert |bibcode=2013EGUGA..15.1286W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal, seasonal and annual variations, the numbers quoted are long-term averages, typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

Of the ~340&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar radiation received by the Earth, an average of ~77&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and ~23&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected by the surface [[albedo]], leaving ~240&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar energy input to the Earth's energy budget. This gives the earth a mean net albedo of 0.29.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

===Earth's internal heat and other small effects===
The [[Earth's internal heat budget|geothermal heat flux]] from the Earth's interior is estimated to be 47 [[terawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010). Earth's surface heat flux. Solid Earth, 1(1), 5–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This comes to 0.087&amp;nbsp;watt/square metre, which represents only 0.027% of Earth's total energy budget at the surface, which is dominated by 173,000 terawatts of incoming [[solar radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=978-0-470-94341-0|author=Archer, D.|year=2012|title=Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World energy consumption|Human production of energy]] is even lower, at an estimated 18 TW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Photosynthesis]] has a larger effect: [[photosynthetic efficiency]] turns up to 2% of incoming sunlight into [[primary production|biomass]], for a total photosynthetic productivity of earth between ~1500–2250 TW (~1%+/-0.26% solar energy hitting the Earth's surface).&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV |title=Light-Dependent Electrogenic Activity of Cyanobacteria |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e10821 |year=2010 |pmid=20520829 |pmc=2876029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010821|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510821P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations, including accretion of [[interplanetary dust]] and [[solar wind]], light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space. Earlier, [[Joseph Fourier]] had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William M. Connolley's page about Fourier 1827: MEMOIRE sur les temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires|url=http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/fourier_1827/|last=Connolley|first=William M.|authorlink=William Connolley|publisher=William M. Connolley|date=18 May 2003|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longwave radiation===
{{main|Outgoing longwave radiation}}
Longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing [[infrared]] energy leaving the planet. However, the atmosphere absorbs parts initially, or cloud cover can reflect radiation. Generally, heat energy is transported between the planet's surface layers (land and ocean) to the atmosphere, transported via [[evapotranspiration]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes or [[thermal conduction|conduction]]/[[convection]] processes.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;  Ultimately, energy is radiated in the form of longwave [[Infrared#Earth as an infrared emitter|infrared radiation]] back into space.

Recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation, which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation (the latent heat flux), offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface.&lt;ref name=SatObsEva /&gt;

==Earth's energy imbalance==
If the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux, net heat is added to or lost by the planet (if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively).

===Indirect measurement===
An imbalance must show in something on Earth warming or cooling (depending on the direction of the imbalance), and the ocean being the larger [[thermal reservoir]] on Earth, is a prime candidate for measurements.

Earth's energy imbalance measurements provided by [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo floats]] have detected an accumulation of [[ocean heat content]] (OHC). The estimated imbalance was measured during a deep [[solar minimum]] of 2005–2010 to be 0.58 ± 0.15&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="Imbalance"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=James Hansen |author2=Makiko Sato |author3=Pushker Kharecha |author4=Karina von Schuckmann |publisher=NASA|date=January 2012|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=Earth's Energy Imbalance}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of detail cannot be inferred directly from measurements of surface energy fluxes, which have combined uncertainties of the order of ± 17&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations|url = http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n10/full/ngeo1580.html|journal = Nature Geoscience|date = 2012-10-01|issn = 1752-0894|pages = 691–696|volume = 5|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ngeo1580|first = Graeme L.|last = Stephens|first2 = Juilin|last2 = Li|first3 = Martin|last3 = Wild|first4 = Carol Anne|last4 = Clayson|first5 = Norman|last5 = Loeb|first6 = Seiji|last6 = Kato|first7 = Tristan|last7 = L'Ecuyer|first8 = Paul W. |last8 = Stackhouse Jr.|first9 = Matthew|last9 = Lebsock|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..691S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct measurement ===
Several [[satellite]]s indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth and by inference the energy imbalance. The [[NASA]] [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite|Earth Radiation Budget Experiment]] (ERBE) project involves three such satellites: the [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]] (ERBS), launched October 1984; NOAA-9, launched December 1984; and NOAA-10, launched September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/radforce/ Effect of the Sun's Energy on the Ocean and Atmosphere (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today NASA's satellite instruments, provided by CERES, part of the NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS), are designed to measure both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= B.A. Wielicki |display-authors=etal |title=Mission to Planet Earth: Role of Clouds and Radiation in Climate |journal=Bull. Am. Meteorol. Soc. |volume=77 |issue= 5 |year=1996 |pages=853–868 |doi= 10.1175/1520-0477(1996)077&lt;0853:CATERE&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 1996BAMS...77..853W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural greenhouse effect==
[[File:Diagram showing the Earth's energy budget, which includes the greenhouse effect (NASA).png|thumb|right|alt=refer to caption and image description|250px|Diagram showing the energy budget of Earth's atmosphere, which includes the greenhouse effect]]
{{See also|Greenhouse effect}}
The major [[atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] gases ([[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]) are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal ([[infrared]]) radiation. However, [[water vapor#Water vapor in Earth.27s atmosphere|water vapor]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and other trace gases are opaque to many [[wavelength]]s of thermal radiation. The Earth's surface radiates the net equivalent of 17 percent of the incoming [[solar radiation|solar energy]] in the form of thermal infrared. However, the amount that directly escapes to space is only about 12 percent of incoming solar energy. The remaining fraction, 5 to 6 percent, is absorbed by the atmosphere by [[greenhouse gas]] [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"&gt;Edited quote from public-domain source: {{citation

[[File:CO2 H2O absorption atmospheric gases unique pattern energy wavelengths of energy transparent to others.png|500px|thumb|Atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others. The absorption patterns of water vapor (blue peaks) and carbon dioxide (pink peaks) overlap in some wavelengths. Carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor, but it absorbs energy in wavelengths (12–15 micrometres) that water vapor does not, partially closing the "window" through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space. (Illustration NASA, Robert Rohde)&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page7.php|title=NASA: Climate Forcings and Global Warming|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions. Heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules; those molecules also absorb the heat, and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases. The atmosphere thins with [[altitude]], and at roughly 5–6&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre]]s, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt;

Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions, some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed. The Earth's surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt; It is as if the Earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation (sunlight) to enter, but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the Earth leaves.

==Climate sensitivity==
{{Main|Radiative forcing}}
A change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a [[radiative forcing]].

[[Climate sensitivity]] is the [[steady state]] change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget.

===Climate forcings and global warming===
[[File:NASA Hansen Aerosol effect on expected energy imbalance Earth budget.gif|right|300px|thumb|Expected Earth energy imbalance for three choices of aerosol climate forcing. Measured imbalance, close to 0.6 W/m², implies that aerosol forcing is close to −1.6 W/m². (Credit: NASA/GISS)&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;]]
Climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall, disrupting the energy balance. Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun's brightness, [[Milankovitch cycles]] (small variations in the shape of Earth's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years) and volcanic eruptions that inject light-reflecting particles as high as the [[stratosphere]]. Man-made forcings include particle pollution ([[aerosols]]) that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight; [[deforestation]], which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight; and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space.

A forcing can trigger [[feedback]]s that intensify ([[positive feedback]]) or weaken ([[negative feedback]]) the original forcing. For example, [[Arctic sea ice decline|loss of ice]] at the poles, which makes them less reflective, causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts, is an example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings" /&gt;

The observed planetary energy imbalance during the [[solar cycle 24|recent solar minimum]] shows that solar forcing of climate, although natural and significant, is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=NASA GISS: Science Brief: Earth's Energy Imbalance|website=www.giss.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that to stop [[global warming]] atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content would have to be reduced to 350&amp;nbsp;ppm or less, assuming all other climate forcings were fixed. The impact of anthropogenic [[aerosols]] has not been quantified, but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects.&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10327">'''Electroacoustic phenomena''' arise when [[ultrasound]] propagates through a [[fluid]] containing [[ions]]. The associated particle motion generates [[electric]] signals because ions have [[electric charge]]. This coupling between ultrasound and [[electric field]] is called electroacoustic phenomena. The fluid might be a simple [[Newtonian liquid]], or complex [[heterogeneous]] [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]], [[emulsion]] or even a porous body. There are several different electroacoustic effects depending on the nature of the fluid.

*[[Ion vibration current]] (IVI) and potential, an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] fluid.
*[[Streaming vibration current]] (SVI) and potential, an electric signal that arises when an acoustic wave propagates through a porous body in which the pores are filled with fluid.
*[[Colloid vibration current]] (CVI) and potential, an electric signal that arises when ultrasound propagates through a [[heterogeneous]] fluid, such as a [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] or [[emulsion]].
*[[Electric sonic amplitude]] (ESA), the inverse of the CVI effect, in which an acoustic field arises when an [[electric field]] propagates through a [[heterogeneous]] fluid.

==Ion vibration current==
{{main|Ion vibration current}}
Historically, the IVI was the first known electroacoustic effect. It was predicted by Debye in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Debye.P."A method for the determination of the mass of electrolyte ions"J. Chem. Phys., 1,13-16,1933&lt;/ref&gt;

==Streaming vibration current==
{{main|Streaming vibration current}}
The streaming vibration current was experimentally observed in 1948 by Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams.M. " An Electrokinetic Transducer" The review of scientific instruments, 19, 10, 640-646, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical model was developed some 30 years later by Dukhin and others.&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S., Mischuk, N.A., Kuz'menko, B.B and Il'in, B.I. "Flow current and potential in a high-frequency acoustic field" Colloid J., 45, 5, 875-881,1983&lt;/ref&gt; This effect opens another possibility for characterizing the electric properties of the surfaces in porous bodies. A similar effect can be observed at a non-porous surface, when sound is bounced off at an oblique angle. The incident and reflected waves superimpose to cause oscillatory fluid motion in the plane of the interface, thereby generating an AC streaming current at the frequency of the sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;Glauser, A.R., Robertson P.A., Lowe, C.R., "An electrokinetic sensor for studying immersed surfaces, using focused ultrasound" Sensors Actuators B, 80, 1, 68-82, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double layer compression==
The [[electrical double layer]] can be regarded as behaving like a parallel plate capacitor with a compressible dielectric filling. When sound waves induce a local pressure variation, the spacing of the plates varies at the frequency of the excitation, generating an AC displacement current normal to the interface. For practical reasons this is most readily observed at a conducting surface.&lt;ref&gt;F.I. Kukoz, L.A. Kukoz, "The nature of audioelectro-chemical phenomena" Russ. J. Phys. Chem. 36 (1962) pp. 367-369&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore possible to use an electrode immersed in a conducting electrolyte as a microphone, or indeed as a loudspeaker when the effect is applied in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;N. Tankovsky, "Capacitive ultrasound transducer, based on the electrical double layer in electrolytes" J. App. Phys. 87 (2000) pp. 538-542&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloid vibration potential and current==
{{main|Colloid vibration current}}
Colloid vibration potential measures the AC potential difference generated between two identical relaxed electrodes, placed in the dispersion, if the latter is subjected to an ultrasonic field. When a sound wave travels through a colloidal suspension of particles whose density differs from that of the surrounding medium, inertial forces induced by the vibration of the suspension give rise to a motion of the charged particles relative to the liquid, causing an alternating electromotive force. The manifestations of this electromotive force may be measured, depending on the relation between the impedance of the suspension and that of the measuring instrument, either as colloid vibration potential or as ''colloid vibration current''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Colloid vibration potential and current was first reported by Hermans and then independently by Rutgers in 1938. It is widely used for characterizing the ζ-potential of various dispersions and emulsions. The effect, theory, experimental verification and multiple applications are discussed in the book by Dukhin and Goetz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dukhin |first=A.S. |authorlink= |author2=Goetz, P.J. |title=Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids |accessdate=2007-10-03 |date=2002 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |pages=153 |chapter=Electroacoustic Theory |chapterurl=http://www.dispersion.com/pages/theory/electroacoustictheory/electoracoustictheory.html |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electric sonic amplitude==
{{main|Electric sonic amplitude}}
Electric sonic amplitude was experimentally discovered by Cannon with co-authors in early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Oja, T., Petersen, G., and Cannon, D. "Measurement of Electric-Kinetic Properties of a Solution", US Patent 4,497,208,1985&lt;/ref&gt; It is also widely used for characterizing ζ-potential in dispersions and emulsions. There is review of this effect theory, experimental verification and multiple applications published by Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R.J. "Review. Recent developments in the electroacoustic characterization of colloidal suspensions and emulsions", Colloids and Surfaces, 141, 37-65, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of CVI and ESA==
With regard to the theory of CVI and ESA, there was an important observation made by O'Brien,&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, R.W. "Electro-acoustic effects in a dilute suspension of spherical particles" J. Fluid Mech., 190, 71-86,1988&lt;/ref&gt; who linked these measured parameters with [[dynamic electrophoretic mobility]] μ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI(ESA) = A\phi\mu_d\frac{\rho_p-\rho_m}{\rho_m}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: A is calibration constant, depending on frequency, but not particles properties;
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is particle density,
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; density of the fluid,
: φ is volume fraction of dispersed phase,

Dynamic electrophoretic mobility is similar to [[electrophoretic mobility]] that appears in [[electrophoresis]] theory. They are identical at low frequencies and/or for sufficiently small particles.

There are several theories of the dynamic electrophoretic mobility. Their overview is given in the Ref.5. Two of them are the most important.

The first one corresponds to the Smoluchowski limit. It yields following simple expression for CVI for sufficiently small particles with negligible CVI frequency dependence:

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI(ESA) = A\phi\frac{\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m\zeta\Kappa_s}{\eta\Kappa_m}\frac{\rho_p-\rho_s}{\rho_s}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: ε&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt; is vacuum dielectric permittivity,
: ε&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is fluid dielectric permittivity,
: ζ is [[electrokinetic potential]]
: η is dynamic viscosity of the fluid,
: K&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is conductivity of the system,
: K&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is conductivity of the fluid,
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is density of the system.

This remarkably simple equation has same wide range of applicability as Smoluchowski equation  for [[electrophoresis]]. It is independent on shape of the particles, their concentration.

Validity of this equation is restricted with the following two requirements.
  
First, it is valid only for a thin [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]], when the [[Debye length]] is much smaller than particle's radius a:
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}a &gt;&gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

Secondly, it neglects the contribution of the [[surface conductivity]]. This assumes a small [[Dukhin number]]:
:&lt;math&gt; Du &lt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

Restriction of the thin double layer limits applicability of this Smoluchowski type theory only to aqueous systems with sufficiently large particles and not very low ionic strength. This theory does not work well for nano-colloids, including proteins and polymers at low ionic strength. It is not valid for low- or non-polar fluids.

There is another theory that is applicable for the other extreme case of a thick double layer, when  
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}a &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

This theory takes into consideration the double layer overlap that inevitably occurs for concentrated systems with thick double layer. This allows introduction of so-called "quasi-homogeneous" approach, when overlapped diffuse layers of particles cover the complete interparticle space. The theory becomes much simplified in this extreme case, as shown by Shilov and others.&lt;ref&gt;Shilov, V.N., Borkovskaya, Y.B. and Dukhin A.S. "Electroacoustic theory for concentrated colloids with overlapped DLs at arbitrary ka. Application to nanocolloids and nonaqueous colloids". JCIS, 277, 347-358 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Their derivation predicts that surface charge density σ is a better parameter than ζ-potential for characterizing electroacoustic phenomena in such systems. An expression for CVI simplified for small particles follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI = A\frac{2{\sigma}a}{3\eta}\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}\frac{\rho_p-\rho_s}{\rho_s}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[physics]], '''energy''' is the [[physical quantity|quantitative]] [[physical property|property]] that must be [[#Energy transfer|transferred]] to an [[Physical body|object]] in order to perform [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] on, or to [[heat]], the object.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[second law of thermodynamics]] imposes limitations on the capacity of a system to transfer energy by performing work, since some of the system's energy might necessarily be {{em|[[waste heat|consumed]]}} in the form of [[heat]] instead. See e.g. {{cite journal |last1=Lehrman |first1=Robert L. |title=Energy Is Not The Ability To Do Work |journal=The Physics Teacher |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=1973 |pages=15–18 |issn=0031-921X |doi=10.1119/1.2349846|bibcode=1973PhTea..11...15L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]; the law of [[conservation of energy]] states that energy can be [[Energy transformation|converted]] in form, but not created or destroyed. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of energy is the [[joule]], which is the energy transferred to an object by the [[work (physics)|work]] of moving it a distance of 1 [[metre]] against a [[force]] of 1 [[newton (unit)|newton]].

Common forms of energy include the [[kinetic energy]] of a moving object, the [[potential energy]] stored by an object's position in a force [[Classical field theory|field]] ([[gravitational field|gravitational]], [[electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field|magnetic]]), the [[elastic energy]] stored by stretching solid objects, the [[chemical energy]] released when a fuel [[combustion|burns]], the [[radiant energy]] carried by light, and the [[thermal energy]] due to an object's [[temperature]].

[[Mass]] and energy are closely related. Due to [[mass–energy equivalence]], any object that has mass when stationary (called [[rest mass]]) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called [[rest mass#Rest energy|rest energy]], and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. For example, after heating an object, its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass, with a sensitive enough [[weighing scale|scale]].

Living organisms require [[available energy]] to stay alive, such as the [[Food energy|energy humans get from food]].  Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from  [[energy resource]]s such as [[fossil fuel]]s, [[nuclear fuel]], or [[renewable energy]]. The processes of Earth's [[climate]] and [[ecosystem]] are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the [[geothermal energy]] contained within the earth.

[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania zoom.jpg|thumb|In a typical [[lightning]] strike, 500 [[megajoule]]s of [[electric potential energy]] is converted into the same amount of energy in other forms, mostly [[light energy]], [[sound energy]] and [[thermal energy]].]]
[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal energy]] is energy of microscopic constituents of matter, which may include both [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]].]]

The total energy of a [[system]] can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways. [[Kinetic energy]] is determined by the [[motion (physics)|movement]] of an object – or the [[statistical mechanics|composite motion]] of the components of an object – and [[potential energy]] reflects the potential of an object to have motion, and generally is a function of the position of an object within a [[Field (physics)|field]] or may stored in the field itself.

While these two categories are sufficient to describe all forms of energy, it is often convenient to refer to particular combinations of potential and kinetic energy as its own form. For example, macroscopic [[mechanical energy]] is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic and potential energy in a system neglects the kinetic energy due to temperature, and nuclear energy which combines utilize potentials from the [[nuclear force]] and the [[weak force]]), among others.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Thomas Young (scientist).jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] – the first to use the term "energy" in the modern sense.]]
The word ''energy'' derives from the {{lang-grc|ἐνέργεια|[[energeia]]|activity, operation}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=energy |title=Energy |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011122441/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=energy |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which possibly appears for the first time in the work of [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BC. In contrast to the modern definition, energeia was a qualitative philosophical concept, broad enough to include ideas such as happiness and pleasure.

In the late 17th century, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] proposed the idea of the {{lang-lat|[[vis viva]]}}, or living force, which defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total ''vis viva'' was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted. The modern analog of this property, [[kinetic energy]], differs from ''vis viva'' only by a factor of two.

In 1807, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] was possibly the first to use the term "energy" instead of ''vis viva'', in its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Smith | first = Crosbie | title = The Science of Energy – a Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-226-76420-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis]] described "[[kinetic energy]]" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]] coined the term "[[potential energy]]". The law of [[conservation of energy]] was also first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any [[isolated system]]. It was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance, dubbed the [[caloric theory|caloric]], or merely a physical quantity, such as [[momentum]]. In 1845 [[James Prescott Joule]] discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat.

These developments led to the theory of conservation of energy, formalized largely by William Thomson ([[Lord Kelvin]]) as the field of [[thermodynamics]]. Thermodynamics aided the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes by [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], and [[Walther Nernst]]. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of [[entropy]] by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of [[radiant energy]] by [[Jožef Stefan]]. According to [[Noether's theorem]], the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.&lt;ref name="jphysics"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Lofts| first =G|author2=O'Keeffe D |display-authors=etal | title=Jacaranda Physics 1| publisher =John Willey &amp; Sons Australia Ltd. | year =2004| location = Milton, Queensland, Australia| page = 286| chapter=11 – Mechanical Interactions| edition=2| isbn=978-0-7016-3777-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, since 1918, theorists have understood that the law of [[conservation of energy]] is the direct mathematical consequence of the [[translational symmetry]] of the quantity [[conjugate variables|conjugate]] to energy, namely time.

==Units of measure==
[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|right|Joule's apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.]]
{{Main article|Units of energy}}

In 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. The most famous of them used the "Joule apparatus": a descending weight, attached to a string, caused rotation of a paddle immersed in water, practically insulated from heat transfer. It showed that the gravitational [[potential energy]] lost by the weight in descending was equal to the [[internal energy]] gained by the water through [[friction]] with the paddle.

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the unit of energy is the joule, named after James Prescott Joule. It is a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]. It is equal to the energy expended (or [[Work (physics)|work]] done) in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre. However energy is also expressed in many other units not part of the SI, such as [[erg]]s, [[calorie]]s, [[British Thermal Unit]]s, [[kilowatt-hour]]s and [[kilocalorie]]s, which require a conversion factor when expressed in SI units.

The SI unit of energy rate (energy per unit time) is the [[watt]], which is a joule per second.  Thus, one joule is one watt-second, and 3600 joules equal one watt-hour.  The [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] energy unit is the [[erg]] and the [[imperial and US customary measurement systems|imperial and US customary]] unit is the [[foot pound]]. Other energy units such as the [[electronvolt]], [[food calorie]] or thermodynamic [[kilocalorie|kcal]] (based on the temperature change of water in a heating process), and [[British thermal unit|BTU]] are used in specific areas of science and commerce.

==Scientific use==

===Classical mechanics===
{{Classical mechanics}}
{{Main article|Mechanics|Mechanical work|Thermodynamics}}

In classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful property, as it is a [[conserved quantity]]. Several formulations of mechanics have been developed using energy as a core concept.

[[Work (physics)|Work]], a function of energy, is force times distance.

: &lt;math&gt; W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the work (&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;) is equal to the [[line integral]] of the [[force]] '''F''' along a path ''C''; for details see the [[mechanical work]] article. Work and thus energy is [[frame dependent]]. For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat. In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball. But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball.

The total energy of a system is sometimes called the [[Hamilton's equations|Hamiltonian]], after [[William Rowan Hamilton]]. The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems. These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011135413/http://www.sustech.edu/OCWExternal/Akamai/18/18.013a/textbook/HTML/chapter16/section03.html The Hamiltonian] MIT OpenCourseWare website 18.013A Chapter 16.3 Accessed February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Another energy-related concept is called the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]], after [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. This formalism is as fundamental as the Hamiltonian, and both can be used to derive the equations of motion or be derived from them. It was invented in the context of [[classical mechanics]], but is generally useful in modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy ''minus'' the potential energy. Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as systems with friction).

[[Noether's theorem]] (1918) states that any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics and the calculus of variations. A generalisation of the seminal formulations on constants of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian; for example, dissipative systems with continuous symmetries need not have a corresponding conservation law.

===Chemistry===&lt;!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (chemistry)]] links here --&gt;
In the context of [[Chemistry#Energy|chemistry]], energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said to be [[exergonic]] if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of [[endergonic]] reactions the situation is the reverse. [[Chemical reaction]]s are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the [[activation energy]]. The ''speed'' of a chemical reaction (at given temperature&amp;nbsp;''T'') is related to the activation energy&amp;nbsp;''E'', by the Boltzmann's population factor&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−''E''/''kT''&lt;/sup&gt;{{spaced ndash}}that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to&amp;nbsp;''E'' at the given temperature&amp;nbsp;''T''. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the [[Arrhenius equation]].The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be in the form of thermal energy.

[[File:Energy and life.svg|thumb|Basic overview of [[Bioenergetics|energy and human life]].]]
{{anchor|Biology}}In [[biology#Energy|biology]], energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living [[organism]]. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or an [[organelle]] of a biological [[organism]]. Energy is thus often said to be stored by [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the structures of molecules of substances such as [[carbohydrate]]s (including sugars), [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s, which release energy when reacted with [[oxygen]] in [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. In human terms, the [[human equivalent]] (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human [[metabolism]], assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500&amp;nbsp;kJ per day and a [[basal metabolic rate]] of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uic.edu/aa/college/gallery400/notions/human%20energy.htm |title=Retrieved on May-29-09 |publisher=Uic.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604191319/http://www.uic.edu/aa/college/gallery400/notions/human%20energy.htm |archivedate=2010-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a "feel" for the use of a given amount of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Bicycle calculator – speed, weight, wattage etc. {{cite web |url=http://bikecalculator.com/ |title=Bike Calculator |accessdate=2009-05-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513091201/http://bikecalculator.com/ |archivedate=2009-05-13 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunlight's radiant energy is also captured by plants as ''chemical potential energy'' in [[photosynthesis]], when carbon dioxide and water (two low-energy compounds) are converted into the high-energy compounds carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Plants also release oxygen during photosynthesis, which is utilized by living organisms as an [[electron acceptor]], to release the energy of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Release of the energy stored during photosynthesis as heat or light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire, or it may be made available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and [[catabolism]] is triggered by [[enzyme]] action.

Any living organism relies on an external source of energy – radiant energy from the Sun in the case of green plants, chemical energy in some form in the case of animals – to be able to grow and reproduce. The daily 1500–2000&amp;nbsp;[[kilocalorie|Calories]] (6–8&amp;nbsp;MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as a combination of oxygen and food molecules, the latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which [[glucose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[stearin]] (C&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;110&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) are convenient examples. The food molecules are oxidised to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water (molecule)|water]] in the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]

Only a tiny fraction of the original chemical energy is used for work:&lt;ref group=note&gt;These examples are solely for illustration, as it is not the energy available for work which limits the performance of the athlete but the [[power (physics)|power]] output of the sprinter and the [[force (physics)|force]] of the weightlifter.

It would appear that living organisms are remarkably [[Energy conversion efficiency|inefficient (in the physical sense)]] in their use of the energy they receive (chemical or radiant energy), and it is true that most real [[machine]]s manage higher efficiencies. In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe ("the surroundings").&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Crystal]]s are another example of highly ordered systems that exist in nature: in this case too, the order is associated with the transfer of a large amount of heat (known as the [[lattice energy]]) to the surroundings.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy [[ecological niche]]s that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in [[ecology]]: to take just the first step in the [[food chain]], of the estimated 124.7&amp;nbsp;Pg/a of carbon that is [[carbon fixation|fixed]] by [[photosynthesis]], 64.3&amp;nbsp;Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants,&lt;ref&gt;Ito, Akihito; Oikawa, Takehisa (2004).

===Earth sciences===
In [[Earth science#earth's energy|geology]], [[continental drift]], [[mountain|mountain ranges]], [[volcano]]es, and [[earthquake]]s are phenomena that can be explained in terms of energy transformations in the Earth's interior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html |title=Earth's Energy Budget |publisher=Okfirst.ocs.ou.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827194704/http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[metereology|meteorological]] phenomena like wind, rain, [[hail]], snow, lightning, [[tornado]]es and [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] are all a result of energy transformations brought about by [[solar energy]] on the [[atmosphere]] of the planet Earth.

Sunlight may be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbines or generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena, save those generated by volcanic events. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement.

In a slower process, [[radioactive decay]] of atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat. This thermal energy drives [[plate tectonics]] and may lift mountains, via [[orogenesis]]. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be later released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created these atoms.

===Cosmology===&lt;!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (cosmology)]] links here --&gt;
In [[Physical cosmology#Energy of the cosmos|cosmology and astronomy]] the phenomena of [[star]]s, [[nova]], [[supernova]], [[quasar]]s and [[gamma-ray burst]]s are the universe's highest-output energy transformations of matter. All [[wikt:stellar|stellar]] phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). The [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the [[Big Bang]]. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.

===Quantum mechanics===
{{Main article|Energy operator}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], energy is defined in terms of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|energy operator]]
as a time derivative of the [[wave function]]. The [[Schrödinger equation]] equates the energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. Its results can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of a slowly changing (non-relativistic) [[wave function]] of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an [[energy level]]) which results in the concept of [[quantum|quanta]]. In the solution of the Schrödinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by [[Planck's relation]]: &lt;math&gt;E = h\nu&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; the frequency). In the case of an electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta of light or [[photon]]s.

===Relativity===
When calculating kinetic energy ([[Mechanical work|work]] to accelerate a [[mass|massive body]] from zero [[speed]] to some finite speed) relativistically – using [[Lorentz transformations]] instead of [[Newtonian mechanics]] – Einstein discovered an unexpected by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He called it [[rest energy]]: energy which every massive body must possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of the body:

:&lt;math&gt; E_0 = m c^2 &lt;/math&gt;,
where
:''m'' is the mass of the body,
:''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum,
:''&lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt;'' is the rest energy.

For example, consider [[electron]]–[[positron]] annihilation, in which the rest energy of these two individual particles (equivalent to their [[invariant mass|rest mass]]) is converted to the radiant energy of the photons produced in the process. In this system the [[matter]] and [[antimatter]] (electrons and positrons) are destroyed and changed to non-matter (the photons). However, the total mass and total energy do not change during this interaction. The photons each have no rest mass but nonetheless have radiant energy which exhibits the same inertia as did the two original particles.  This is a reversible process – the inverse process is called [[pair creation]] – in which the rest mass of particles is created from the radiant energy of two (or more) annihilating photons.

In general relativity, the [[stress–energy tensor]] serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation.&lt;ref name="MTW"/&gt;

Energy and mass are manifestations of one and the same underlying physical property of a system.  This property is responsible for the inertia and strength of gravitational interaction of the system ("mass manifestations"), and is also responsible for the potential ability of the system to perform work or heating ("energy manifestations"), subject to the limitations of other physical laws.

In [[classical physics]], energy is a scalar quantity, the [[canonical conjugate]] to time. In [[special relativity]] energy is also a scalar (although not a [[Lorentz scalar]] but a time component of the [[energy–momentum 4-vector]]).&lt;ref name="MTW"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Misner, Thorne, Wheeler |title=Gravitation |year=1973 |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of [[space]], but not invariant with respect to rotations of [[space-time]] (= [[Lorentz boost|boosts]]).

==Transformation==
{{Main article|Energy transformation}}

{{Forms of energy transfer}}
[[File:Turbogenerator01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35| A [[turbo generator]] transforms the energy of pressurised steam into electrical energy]]
Energy may be [[energy transformation|transformed]] between different forms at various [[energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]]. Items that transform between these forms are called [[transducer]]s. Examples of transducers include a battery, from [[chemical energy]] to [[electric energy]]; a dam: [[gravitational potential energy]] to [[kinetic energy]] of moving water (and the blades of a [[turbine]]) and ultimately to [[electric energy]] through an [[electric generator]]; or a [[heat engine]], from heat to work.

Examples of energy transformation include generating [[electric energy]] from heat energy via a steam turbine, or lifting an object against gravity using electrical energy driving a crane motor. Lifting against gravity performs mechanical work on the object and stores gravitational potential energy in the object. If the object falls to the ground, gravity does mechanical work on the object which transforms the potential energy in the gravitational field to the kinetic energy released as heat on impact with the ground. Our Sun transforms [[nuclear potential energy]] to other forms of energy; its total mass does not decrease due to that in itself (since it still contains the same total energy even if in different forms), but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes out to its surroundings, largely as [[radiant energy]].

There are strict limits to how efficiently heat can be converted into [[Work (physics)|work]] in a cyclic process, e.g. in a heat engine, as described by [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. However, some energy transformations can be quite efficient. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often determined by [[entropy]] (equal energy spread among all available [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]) considerations. In practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.

Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy that has been available since the [[Big Bang]] later being "released" (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy) when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of such processes include nuclear decay, in which energy is released that was originally "stored" in heavy isotopes (such as [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]), by [[nucleosynthesis]], a process ultimately using the gravitational potential energy released from the [[gravitational collapse]] of [[supernova]]e, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. This energy is triggered and released in nuclear [[fission bomb]]s or in civil nuclear power generation. Similarly, in the case of a [[Chemical explosive|chemical explosion]], [[chemical potential]] energy is transformed to [[kinetic energy]] and [[thermal energy]] in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a [[pendulum]]. At its highest points the [[kinetic energy]] is zero and the [[gravitational potential energy]] is at maximum. At its lowest point the [[kinetic energy]] is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of [[potential energy]]. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no [[friction]] or other losses, the conversion of energy between these processes would be perfect, and the [[pendulum]] would continue swinging forever.

Energy is also transferred from potential energy (&lt;math&gt;E_p&lt;/math&gt;) to kinetic energy (&lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt;) and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed; therefore, the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;E_{pi} + E_{ki} = E_{pF} + E_{kF}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The equation can then be simplified further since &lt;math&gt;E_p = mgh&lt;/math&gt; (mass times acceleration due to gravity times the height) and &lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2&lt;/math&gt; (half&amp;nbsp;mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding &lt;math&gt;E_p + E_k = E_{total}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Conservation of energy and mass in transformation===
Energy gives rise to weight when it is trapped in a system with zero momentum, where it can be weighed. It is also equivalent to mass, and this mass is always associated with it. Mass is also equivalent to a certain amount of energy, and likewise always appears associated with it, as described in [[mass-energy equivalence]]. The formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''², derived by [[Albert Einstein]] (1905) quantifies the relationship between rest-mass and rest-energy within the concept of special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by [[J.J. Thomson]] (1881), [[Henri Poincaré]] (1900), [[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] (1904) and others (see [[Mass-energy equivalence#History]] for further information).

Part of the rest energy (equivalent to rest mass) of [[matter]] may be converted to other forms of energy (still exhibiting mass), but neither energy nor mass can be destroyed; rather, both remain constant during any process. However, since &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt; is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of an everyday amount of rest mass (for example, 1&amp;nbsp;kg) from rest energy to other forms of energy (such as kinetic energy, thermal energy, or the radiant energy carried by light and other radiation) can liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~&lt;math&gt;9\times 10^{16}&lt;/math&gt; joules = 21 megatons of TNT), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the mass equivalent of an everyday amount energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy (loss of mass) from most systems is difficult to measure on a weighing scale, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of large transformations between rest energy (of matter) and other forms of energy (e.g., kinetic energy into particles with rest mass) are found in [[nuclear physics]] and [[particle physics]].

===Reversible and non-reversible transformations===
Thermodynamics divides energy transformation into two kinds: [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible processes]] and [[irreversible process]]es. An irreversible process is one in which energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible excitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomisation in a crystal).

As the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder). This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic [[heat death of the universe]]. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do work through a [[heat engine]], or be transformed to other usable forms of energy (through the use of generators attached to heat engines), grows less and less.

==Conservation of energy==
{{Main article|Conservation of energy}}
The fact that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed is called the law of [[conservation of energy]].  In the form of the [[first law of thermodynamics]], this states that a [[closed system]]'s energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or [[heat]], and that no energy is lost in transfer. The total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. Whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley Physics Course Volume 1. Charles Kittel, Walter D Knight and Malvin A Ruderman&lt;/ref&gt;

While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, for cyclic processes of practical interest in [[heat engine]]s the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the system doing work always loses some energy as [[waste heat]]. This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit called the [[available energy]]. Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into [[thermal energy]] without such limitations.&lt;ref name="thermo-laws"/&gt; The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system.

[[Richard Feynman]] said during a 1961 lecture:&lt;ref name="RPF1"/&gt;
{{quote|There is a fact, or if you wish, a ''law'', governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law – it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the ''[[conservation of energy]]''. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same.|''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''}}

Most kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable exception)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/articles/noether.asg/noether.html |title=E. Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and Conservation Laws |publisher=Physics.ucla.edu |date=1918-07-16 |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514080739/http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/articles/noether.asg/noether.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are subject to strict local conservation laws as well. In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space. There is also a global law of conservation of energy, stating that the total energy of the universe cannot change; this is a corollary of the local law, but not vice versa.&lt;ref name="thermo-laws"&gt;[http://www.av8n.com/physics/thermo-laws.htm ''The Laws of Thermodynamics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215201900/http://www.av8n.com/physics/thermo-laws.htm |date=2006-12-15 }} including careful definitions of energy, free energy, et cetera.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPF1"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Richard |last=Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics; Volume 1|year=1964|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=U.S.A| isbn=978-0-201-02115-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This law is a fundamental principle of physics. As shown rigorously by [[Noether's theorem]], the conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of [[translational symmetry]] of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week9/timeinvariance.html |title=Time Invariance |publisher=Ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210455/http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week9/timeinvariance.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. This is because energy is the quantity which is [[canonical conjugate]] to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval. The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured.

Each of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of potential energy, and all types of potential energy (like all other types of energy) appears as system [[mass]], whenever present. For example, a compressed spring will be slightly more massive than before it was compressed. Likewise, whenever energy is transferred between systems by any mechanism, an associated mass is transferred with it.

In [[quantum mechanics]] energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian [[Operator (physics)|operator]]. On any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is by

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac { \hbar } {2 } &lt;/math&gt;

which is similar in form to the [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] (but not really mathematically equivalent thereto, since ''H'' and ''t'' are not dynamically conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics).

In [[particle physics]], this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of [[virtual particles]] which carry [[momentum]], exchange by which and with real particles, is responsible for the creation of all known [[fundamental forces]] (more accurately known as [[fundamental interactions]]). [[Virtual photons]] (which are simply lowest quantum mechanical [[energy state]] of [[photon]]s) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between [[electric charge]]s (which results in [[Coulomb law]]), for [[Spontaneous fission|spontaneous]] radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states, for the [[Casimir force]], for [[van der Waals force|van der Waals bond forces]] and some other observable phenomena.

==Energy transfer==
===Closed systems===
Energy transfer can be considered for the special case of systems which are [[closed system|closed]] to transfers of matter. The portion of the energy which is transferred by [[conservative force]]s over a distance is measured as the [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] the source system does on the receiving system. The portion of the energy which does not do work during the transfer is called [[heat]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Although heat is "wasted" energy for a specific energy transfer,(see: [[waste heat]]) it can often be harnessed to do useful work in subsequent interactions. However, the maximum energy that can be "recycled" from such recovery processes is limited by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;/ref&gt; Energy can be transferred between systems in a variety of ways. Examples include the transmission of [[electromagnetic energy]] via photons, physical collisions which transfer [[kinetic energy]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;The mechanism for most macroscopic physical collisions is actually [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], but it is very common to simplify the interaction by ignoring the mechanism of collision and just calculate the beginning and end result.&lt;/ref&gt; and the conductive transfer of [[thermal energy]].

Energy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved wherever it can be defined. In thermodynamics, for closed systems, the process of energy transfer is described by the [[first law of thermodynamics|first law]]:&lt;ref group=note&gt;There are several [[First law of thermodynamics#Description|sign conventions for this equation]]. Here, the signs in this equation follow the IUPAC convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W + Q &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of energy transferred, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; represents the work done on the system, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; represents the heat flow into the system. As a simplification, the heat term, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, is sometimes ignored, especially when the [[thermal efficiency]] of the transfer is high.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

This simplified equation is the one used to define the [[joule]], for example.

===Open systems===
Beyond the constraints of closed systems, [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open systems]] can gain or lose energy in association with matter transfer (both of these process are illustrated by fueling an auto, a system which gains in energy thereby, without addition of either work or heat). Denoting this energy by &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, one may write

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W + Q + E .&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

==Thermodynamics==

===Internal energy===
[[Internal energy]] is the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system. It is the energy needed to create the system. It is related to the potential energy, e.g., molecular structure, crystal structure, and other geometric aspects, as well as the motion of the particles, in form of kinetic energy. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned with changes in internal energy and not its absolute value, which is impossible to determine with thermodynamics alone.&lt;ref name=klotz&gt;I. Klotz, R. Rosenberg, ''Chemical Thermodynamics - Basic Concepts and Methods'', 7th ed., Wiley (2008), p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

===First law of thermodynamics===
The [[first law of thermodynamics]] asserts that energy (but not necessarily [[thermodynamic free energy]]) is always conserved&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Kittel and Kroemer|title=Thermal Physics |year=1980|publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=New York| isbn=978-0-7167-1088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that heat flow is a form of energy transfer. For homogeneous systems, with a well-defined temperature and pressure, a commonly used corollary of the first law is that, for a system subject only to [[pressure]] forces and heat transfer (e.g., a cylinder-full of gas) without chemical changes, the differential change in the internal energy of the system (with a ''gain'' in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}E = T\mathrm{d}S - P\mathrm{d}V\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where the first term on the right is the heat transferred into the system, expressed in terms of [[temperature]] ''T'' and [[entropy]] ''S'' (in which entropy increases and the change d''S'' is positive when the system is heated), and the last term on the right hand side is identified as work done on the system, where pressure is ''P'' and volume ''V'' (the negative sign results since compression of the system requires work to be done on it and so the volume change, d''V'', is negative when work is done on the system).

This equation is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electrical, nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as [[advection]] of any form of energy other than heat and pV-work. The general formulation of the first law (i.e., conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which the system is not homogeneous. For these cases the change in internal energy of a ''closed'' system is expressed in a general form by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}E=\delta Q+\delta W&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat supplied to the system and &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; is the work applied to the system.

===Equipartition of energy===
The energy of a mechanical [[harmonic oscillator]] (a mass on a spring) is alternatively [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential]]. At two points in the oscillation [[Frequency|cycle]] it is entirely kinetic, and at two points it is entirely potential. Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles, net energy is thus equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called [[equipartition principle]]; total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally split among all available degrees of freedom.

This principle is vitally important to understanding the behaviour of a quantity closely related to energy, called [[entropy]]. Entropy is a measure of evenness of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (i.e., given new available [[energy state]]s that are the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between "new" and "old" degrees. This mathematical result is called the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. The second law of thermodynamics is valid only for systems which are near or in [[equilibrium state]]. For non-equilibrium systems, the laws governing system’s behavior are still debatable. One of the guiding principles for these systems is the principle of [[principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Onsager|first1=L.|title=Reciprocal relations in irreversible processes.|journal=Phys.

'''Energy brokers''' assist clients in procuring [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] from energy wholesalers/suppliers.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Since electricity and natural gas are commodities, prices change daily with the market.  It is challenging for most businesses without energy managers to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers since prices must be compared on exactly the same day.  In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted.  An energy broker can provide a valuable service if they work with a large number of suppliers and can actually compile the sundry prices from suppliers.  An important aspect of this consulting role is to assure that the client understands the differences between the contract offers.  Under some State Laws they use the term "Suppliers" to refer to energy suppliers, brokers, and [[Smart Grid aggregator|aggregator]]s, however there are very important differences between them all.

Energy brokers do not own or distribute energy, nor are allowed to sell energy directly to you.  They simply present the rates of a wholesaler, or supplier.

==Product and services==
Energy consultants offer a lot more than procuring energy contracts from a supplier. In the UK and Europe where there is a lot of legislation and increasing pressure for businesses and countries to do more to reduce their energy consumption a lot of services from brokers now help ensure businesses meet a lot of compliance and accreditation requirements such as the ESOS (energy saving opportunity scheme), [[ISO 50001]], [[ISO 14001]], [[Energy Performance Certificate]]s and [[Display Energy Certificate]]s.
Other services include helping companies reduce energy consumption with the aim of meeting national and international carbon emission standards. Services include, energy health checks, energy audits, carbon zero, carbon offsetting and energy saving consulting.

Additional services such as arranging a [[power purchase agreement]], energy export contracts can be procured as well as energy monitoring and reporting technology and solutions are also offered by [[energy consultants]].

==Who do energy brokers serve?==
In the USA, energy brokers can serve residential, commercial and government entities that reside in energy deregulated states. In the [[UK]], and some countries in [[Europe]], the entire market is deregulated.

==Fees==
Energy brokers typically do not charge up front fees to provide rates.  If an entity purchases energy through a broker, the broker's fee is usually included in the rate the customer pays.    Some brokers will charge a fixed fee for their consulting services.

==Consulting==
{{main|Energy consulting}}
Not all energy brokers are consultants; However, the energy brokers who are also consultants will perform a more detailed analysis of a consumers' usage pattern in order to provide a custom rate, which typically results in more cost savings for the consumer.  Typically, they do not need any more information than that of an energy broker, because they can pull usage information from the local utility company.  There are some national energy brokers that use auditing teams to verify their client's invoices.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ. do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps].

'''Energy customer switching''' is a concept stemming from the [[Energy market|global energy markets]]. The concept refers to the action of one energy customer [[customer switching|switching]] [[energy supplier]], a switch is essentially seen as the free (by choice) movement of a customer. In addition to that a switch can include:

* A re-switch: When a customer switches for the second or subsequent time. 
* A switch-back: When a customer switches back to his/her former or previous supplier.

If a customer moves, there is often a switch, however this will only be counted if the customer is not dealing with the incumbent in the new area of residence.

The above is the official definition of switching and is being used by public energy institutions such as [[CEER]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceer.eu|title=Welcome - ceer.eu|website=www.ceer.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; [[ERGEG]] (forerunner to ACER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acer.europa.eu/Pages/ACER.aspx|title=Home|website=www.acer.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The definition was originally developed by Dr Philip E. Lewis, international switching expert.

Switching is a key concept to understanding [[competition (economics)|competition]]-related issues on the global energy markets as the switching level of a concrete market reveals the state of the competition; High switching rates equals high level of competition and low switching rates equals limited competition. Thus measuring and assessing switching rates is necessary in order to have a correct impression of the energy markets. The action of switching is often done via a [[price comparison website]] or by the traditional [[door-to-door]] sales method, where a salesperson assists the customer in switching.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In [[ecology]], '''energy flow''', also called the '''calorific flow''', refers to the flow of [[energy]] through a [[food chain]], and is the focus of study in '''ecological energetics'''. In an [[ecosystem]], [[ecologist]]s seek to [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] the relative importance of different component [[species]] and feeding relationships.

A general energy flow scenario follows:
*[[Solar energy]] is fixed by the [[photoautotroph]]s, called primary producers, like green [[plant]]s. [[Primary consumers]] absorb most of the stored energy in the plant through [[digestion]], and transform it into the form of energy they need, such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), through [[cellular respiration|respiration]]. A part of the energy received by primary consumers, [[herbivore]]s, is converted to [[thermoregulation|body heat]] (an effect of respiration), which is [[radiant energy|radiated]] away and lost from the system. The loss of energy through body heat is far greater in [[warm-blooded]] animals, which must eat much more frequently than those that are [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]. Energy loss also occurs in the expulsion of [[digestion|undigested]] food (egesta) by [[excrement|excretion]] or [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]].
*Secondary consumers, [[carnivore]]s, then consume the primary consumers, although [[omnivore]]s also consume primary producers. Energy that had been used by the primary consumers for growth and storage is thus absorbed into the secondary consumers through the process of digestion. As with primary consumers, secondary consumers convert this energy into a more suitable form (ATP) during respiration. Again, some energy is lost from the system, since energy which the primary consumers had used for respiration and regulation of body temperature cannot be utilized by the secondary consumers.
*Tertiary consumers, which may or may not be [[apex predator]]s, then consume the secondary consumers, with some energy passed on and some lost, as with the lower levels of the food chain.
*A final link in the food chain are [[decomposer]]s which break down the [[organic matter]] of the tertiary consumers (or whichever consumer is at the top of the chain) and release [[nutrient]]s into the [[soil]]. They also break down plants, herbivores and carnivores that were not eaten by organisms higher on the food chain, as well as the undigested food that is excreted by herbivores and carnivores. [[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprotrophic]] [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are decomposers, and play a pivotal role in the [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[carbon cycle]]s.

The energy is passed on from [[trophic level]] to trophic level and each time about 90% of the energy is lost, with some being lost as heat into the environment (an effect of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]) and some being lost as incompletely digested food (egesta). Therefore, primary consumers get about 10% of the energy produced by autotrophs, while secondary consumers get 1% and tertiary consumers get 0.1%. This means the top consumer of a [[food chain]] receives the least energy, as a lot of the food chain's energy has been lost between trophic levels. This loss of energy at each level limits typical food chains to only four to six links.

== History of ecological energetics ==
Ecological energetics appears to have grown out of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the concerns of the [[Physiocrats]]. It began in the works of [[Sergei Podolinsky]] in the late 1800s, and subsequently was developed by the Soviet ecologist [[Vladmir Stanchinsky]], the Austro-American [[Alfred J. Lotka]], and American limnologists, [[Raymond Lindeman]] and [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]]. It underwent substantial development by [[Howard T. Odum]] and was applied by [[systems ecology|systems ecologists]], and [[radiation ecology|radiation ecologists]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22527">'''Energy management''' includes planning and operation of [[energy production]] and [[energy consumption]] units. Objectives are [[Energy conservation|resource conservation]], [[climate protection]] and [[Saving|cost savings]], while the users have permanent access to the energy they need. It is connected closely to [[environmental management]], [[Manufacturing process management|production management]], [[logistics]] and other established business functions. The [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI-Guideline]] 4602 released a definition which includes the economic dimension: “Energy management is the proactive, organized and systematic coordination of procurement, [[Energy transformation|conversion]], [[Energy distribution|distribution]] and use of energy to meet the requirements, taking into account environmental and economic objectives”.&lt;ref&gt;VDI-Guideline VDI 4602, page 3, Beuth Verlag, Berlin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency ==

===Base line of energy assessment===
One of initial steps for an effective energy cost control program is the base line energy assessment, which examines the pattern of existing energy usage by the government or any sub-entity of the government or private organization. This program will set the reference point for improvements in energy efficiency. Energy efficiency can improve the existing energy usage and benchmarking of every individual section such as area, sub-area and the industry etc .

== Organizational integration ==
It is important to integrate the energy management in the organizational structure, so that the energy management can be implemented. Responsibilities and the interaction of the decision makers should be regularized. The delegation of functions and competencies extend from the top management to the executive worker. Furthermore, a comprehensive [[wikt:coordination|coordination]] can ensure the fulfillment of the tasks.

It is advisable to establish a separate organizational unit “energy management” in large or energy-intensive companies. This unit supports the senior management and keeps track. It depends on the basic form of the [[organizational structure]], where this unit is connected. In case of a [[functional organization]] the unit is located directly between the first ([[CEO]]) and the second hierarchical level (corporate functions such as production, [[procurement]], [[marketing]]). In a divisional organization, there should be a central and several sector-specific energy management units. So the diverse needs of the individual [[Sector (economic)|sector]]s and the coordination between the branches and the head office can be fulfilled. In a [[matrix management|matrix organization]] the energy management can be included as a matrix function and thus approach most functions directly.

== Energy management in operational functions ==

=== Facility management ===
[[Facility management]] is an important part of energy management, because a huge proportion (average 25 per cent) of complete [[operating cost]]s are energy costs. According to the [[International Facility Management Association]] (IFMA), facility management is "a profession that encompasses multiple disciplines to ensure functionality of the built environment by integrating people, place, processes and technology."

The central task of energy management is to reduce costs for the provision of energy in buildings and facilities without compromising work processes. Especially the availability and service life of the equipment and the ease of use should remain the same. The German Facility Management Association (GEFMA e.V.) has published guidelines (e.g. GEFMA 124-1 and 124-2), which contain methods and ways of dealing with the integration of energy management in the context of a successful facility management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gefma.de/uploads/tx_ttproducts/datasheet/GEFMA124-1S1.2009-11.pdf|title=GEFMA: Energiemanagement Grundlagen und Leistungsbild|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this topic the facility manager has to deal with economic, ecological, risk-based and quality-based targets. He tries to minimize the total cost of the energy-related processes (supply, distribution and use).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy20.net/pi/index.php?StoryID=317&amp;articleID=154847 |title=viewed 10. November 2012 |publisher=Energy20.net |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Passive house scheme 1.svg|thumb|300px|The '''Passivhaus''' uses a combination of [[:category:low-energy building|low-energy building]] techniques and technologies]]

The most important key figure in this context is [[kilowatt-hour]]s per square meter per year (kWh/m²a). Based on this key figure properties can be classified according to their energy consumption.

* Europe: In Germany a [[low-energy house]] can have a maximum energy consumption of 70 kWh/m²a.
*North America: In the [[United States]], the [[ENERGY STAR]] program is the largest program defining low-energy homes. Homes earning ENERGY STAR certification use at least 15% less energy than standard new homes built to the International Residential Code, although homes typically achieve 20%-30% savings.&lt;ref&gt;"Features of ENERGY STAR Qualified New Homes." - EnergyStar.gov, Retrieved 7 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, the [[Passive house]] (Passivhaus in German) ultra-low-energy standard, currently undergoing adoption in some other European countries, has a maximum space heating requirement of 15 kWh/m²a. A Passive House is a very well-insulated and virtually air-tight building. It does not require a conventional heating system. It is heated by solar gain and internal gains from people. Energy losses are minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://passiv.de/en/02_informations/01_whatisapassivehouse/01_whatisapassivehouse.htm |title=retrieved 8 December 2012 |publisher=Passiv.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also buildings that produce more energy (for example by [[solar water heating]] or [[photovoltaic system]]s) over the course of a year than it imports from external sources. These buildings are called [[energy-plus-house]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plusenergiehaus.de/index.php?p=home&amp;pid=8&amp;L=0&amp;host=1#a1 |title=retrieved 3 December 2012 |publisher=Plusenergiehaus.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the work regulations manage competencies, roles and responsibilities. Because the systems also include risk factors (e.g., oil tanks, gas lines), you must ensure that all tasks are clearly described and distributed. A clear regulation can help to avoid liability risks.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung, p. 75 – 77, Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logistics ===
[[File:A8 bei Derching LKW Richtung München MAN Mercedes.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Carriage of goods]]
Logistics is the [[management]] of the flow of [[resources]] between the point of origin and the point of destination in order to meet some requirements, for example of customers or corporations. Especially the core logistics task, transportation of the goods, can save costs and protect the environment through efficient energy management. The relevant factors are the choice of means of transportation, duration and length of transportation and cooperation with logistics service providers.

The logistics causes more than 14% percent of CO2 emissions worldwide. For this reason the term [[Green Logistics]] is becoming increasingly important.

Possible courses of action in terms of green logistics are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |title=retrieved on November 10, 2012 |publisher=Iml.fraunhofer.de |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010036/http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Shift to ecofriendly transport carrier such as railroad and waterway
* Route and load optimization
* Formation of corporate networks, which are connected by logistics service
* Optimizing physical logistics processes by providing a sophisticated IT support

Besides transportation of goods, the transport of persons should be an important part of the logistic strategy of organizations. In case of business trips it is important to attract attention to the choice and the proportionality of the means of transport. It should be balanced whether a physical presence is mandatory or a telephone or video conference is just as useful. Home Office is another possibility in which the company can protect the environment indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p.103-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy procurement ===
Procurement is the acquisition of goods or services. Energy prices fluctuate constantly, which can significantly affect the energy bill of organizations. Therefore poor energy procurement decisions can be expensive. Organizations can control and reduce energy costs by taking a proactive and efficient approach to buying energy. Even a change of the energy source can be a profitable and eco-friendly alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energieagentur.nrw.de/unternehmen/energiebeschaffung-3699.asp |title=retrieved 10 November 2012 |publisher=Energieagentur.nrw.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
Production is the act of creating output, a good or service which has value and contributes to the utility of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., Brown, L., and Adam, S. (2006) Marketing, 7th Ed. Pearson Education Australia/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This central process may differ depending on the industry. Industrial companies have facilities that require a lot of energy. Service companies, in turn, do not need many materials, their energy-related focus is mainly facility management or Green IT. Therefore the energy-related focus has to be identified first, then evaluated and optimize.

=== Production planning and control ===
Usually, production is the area with the largest energy consumption within an organization. Therefore also the production planning and control becomes very important. It deals with the operational, temporal, quantitative and spatial planning, control and management of all processes that are necessary in the production of goods and commodities. The "production planner" should plan the production processes so that they operate in an energy efficient way. For example, strong power consumer can be moved into the night time. Peaks should be avoided for the benefit of a unified [[load profile]].

The impending changes in the structure of energy production require an increasing demand for storage capacity. The Production planning and control has to deal with the problem of limited [[energy storage|storability of energy]]. In principle there is the possibility to store energy electrically, mechanically or chemically. Another trend-setting technology is lithium-based electrochemical storage, which can be used in electric vehicles or as an option to control the power grid. The German [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]] realized the significance of this topic and established an initiative with the aim to promote technological breakthroughs and support the rapid introduction of new energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/English/Navigation/Press/press-releases,did=487632.html |title=retrieved 6 December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
Maintenance is the combination of all technical and administrative actions, including supervision actions, intended to retain an item in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform a required function.&lt;ref&gt;British Standard Glossary of terms (3811:1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed maintenance is essential to support the energy management. Hereby power losses and cost increases can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ps-consulting.de/industrie/IH-Energiemanagement.html |title=abgerufen am 12. November 2012 |publisher=Ps-consulting.de |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy management challenge===
Through the energy efficiency it management is remain the key for the any industrial user across globe , to achieve  the energy management goal for the federal government or  industry  the efficiency of water and energy resources play a vital role

Examples of how it is possible to save energy and costs with the help of maintenance:

* Defrost the fridges
* Check the barometer of cars and trucks
* Insulation of hot systems
* Improve leaks in building envelopes

== Energy strategies ==
A long-term energy strategy should be part of the overall strategy of a company. This strategy may include the objective of increasing the use of renewable energies. Furthermore, criteria for decisions on energy investments, such as yield expectations, are determined.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, S. 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt; By formulating an energy strategy companies have the opportunity to avoid risks and to assure a competitive advance against their business rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential energy strategies ===
According to Kals there are the following energy strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 182-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Passive Strategy: There is no systematic planning. The issue of energy and environmental management is not perceived as an independent field of action. The organization only deals with the most essential subjects.
* Strategy of short-term profit maximization: The management is concentrating exclusively on measures that have a relatively short [[payback period]] and a high return. Measures with low profitability are not considered.
* Strategy of long-term profit maximization: This strategy includes that you have a high knowledge of the energy price and technology development. The relevant measures (for example, [[heat exchanger]]s or [[power station]]s) can have durations of several decades. Moreover, these measures can help to improve the [[image]] and increase the [[motivation]] of the employees.
* Realization of all financially attractive energy measures: This strategy has the goal to implement all measures that have a positive return on investment.
* Maximum strategy: For the climate protection one is willing to change even the object of the company.

In reality, you usually find hybrid forms of different strategies.

=== Energy strategies of companies ===
Many companies are trying to promote its image and time protect the climate through a proactive and public energy strategy. [[General Motors]] (GM) strategy is based on continuous improvement. Furthermore they have six principles: e.g. restoring and preserving the environment, reducing waste and pollutants, educating the public about environmental conservation, collaboration for the development of environmental laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gm.com/vision/environment1/our_commitment.html |title=retrieved 21. December 2012 |publisher=Gm.com |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nokia]] created its first climate strategy in 2006. The strategy tries to evaluate the energy consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of products and operations and sets reduction targets accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/operations/operations/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their environmental efforts is based on four key issues: substance management, energy efficiency, recycling, promoting environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/strategy/strategy-and-reports/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy strategy of [[Volkswagen]] (VW) is based on environmentally friendly products and a resource-efficient production according to the "Group Strategy 2018".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/content/en/sustainability_and_responsibility/Model_of_Sustainable_Development/Strategy_2018.html |title=retrieved 22. December 2012. |publisher=Volkswagenag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all locations of the Group are certified to the international standard ISO 14001 for environmental management systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html retrieved 22. December 2012.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114083829/http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html |date=November 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking at the energy strategies of companies it is important to you have the topic [[greenwashing]] in mind. This is a form of propaganda in which green strategies are used to promote the opinion that an organization's aims are environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwashingindex.com/about-greenwashing/ |title=retrieved 16.01.2013 |publisher=Greenwashingindex.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy strategies of politics ===
Even many countries formulate energy strategies. The [[Swiss Federal Council]] decided in May 2011 to resign nuclear energy medium-dated. The nuclear power plants will be shut down at the end of life and will not be replaced. In Compensation they put the focus on energy efficiency, [[renewable energies]], [[fossil energy]] sources and the development of [[water power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00526/00527/index.html?lang=de |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |publisher=Bfe.admin.ch |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] has clear instructions for its members. The "20-20-20-targets" include, that the [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below 1990 levels, increase energy efficiency by 20% and achieve a 20% share of renewable energy in total energy consumption by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101085821/http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical and normative basis of the energy strategies ===
The basis of every energy strategy is the [[corporate culture]] and the related ethical standards applying in the company.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethics]], in the sense of [[business ethics]], examines ethical principles and moral or ethical issues that arise in a business environment. Ethical standards can appear in company guidelines, energy and environmental policies or other documents.

The most relevant ethical ideas for the energy management are:

* [[Utilitarianism]]: This form of ethics has the maxim that the one acts are good or right, whose consequences are optimal for the welfare of all those affected by the action (principle of maximum happiness). In terms of energy management, the existence of external costs should be considered. They do not directly affect those who profit from the economic activity but non-participants like future generations. This error in the market mechanism can be solved by the [[internalization]] of [[external cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse ethics|Argumentation Ethics]]: This fundamental ethical idea says that everyone who is affected by the [[Decision making|decision]], must be involved in decision making. This is done in a fair [[dialogue]], the result is completely uncertain.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"&gt;Johannes Kals: Business Ethics and Corporate Energy Management, in: Karczewski, Leszek; Kretek, Henryk (eds): Odpowiedzialny biznes i konsumerysm wyzwaniem XXI Wieku (Responsible Business and Responsible Consumerism as a Challenge of the 21st Century), Polen, Raciborz 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Deontological ethics]]: The deontological ethics assigns individuals and organizations certain obligations. A general example is the [[golden rule]]: "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself." Therefore everyone should manage their duties and make an energy economic contribution.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"/&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]], [[energy]] is defined in terms of the '''energy operator''', acting on the [[wave function]] of the system as a consequence of [[time translation symmetry]].

==Definition==

It is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Mechanics Demystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (USA), 2006, {{ISBN|0-07-145546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{E} = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

It acts on the wave function (the [[probability amplitude]] for different [[Configuration space (physics)|configurations]] of the system)

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Application==

The energy operator [[correspondence principle|corresponds]] to the full energy of a system. The [[Schrödinger equation]] describes the space- and time-dependence of the slow changing (non-[[theory of relativity|relativistic]]) wave function of a quantum system. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an [[energy level]]) which results in the concept of [[quantum|quanta]].

===Schrödinger equation===
Using the energy operator to the [[Schrödinger equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat H \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

can be obtained:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; \hat{E}\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]], ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and &lt;math&gt;\hat H&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] [[operator (physics)|operator]].

In a [[stationary state]] additionally occurs the time-independent [[Schrödinger equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; E \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is an [[eigenvalue]] of energy.
===Klein–Gordon equation===

The [[Mass in special relativity#The relativistic energy-momentum equation|relativistic mass-energy relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where again ''E'' = total energy, ''p'' = total 3-[[momentum]] of the particle, ''m'' = [[invariant mass]], and ''c'' = [[speed of light]], can similarly yield the [[Klein–Gordon equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; \hat{E}^2 = c^2\hat{p}^2 + (mc^2)^2 \\
&amp; \hat{E}^2\Psi = c^2\hat{p}^2\Psi + (mc^2)^2\Psi \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} =  c^2\nabla^2\Psi - \left(\frac{mc^2}{\hbar}\right)^2\Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation==

The energy operator is easily derived from using the [[free particle]] wave function ([[plane wave]] solution to Schrödinger's equation).&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles (2nd Edition), R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1985, {{ISBN|978-0-471-87373-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in one dimension the wave function is

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi = e^{i(kx-\omega t)} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The time derivative of ''Ψ'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -i \omega e^{i(kx-\omega t)} = - i \omega \Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[De Broglie relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; E=\hbar \omega \,\!&lt;/math&gt;,

we have

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = - i \frac{E}{\hbar} \Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Re-arranging the equation leads to

:&lt;math&gt; E\Psi = i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;,

where the energy factor ''E'' is a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value, the energy the particle has and the value that is measured. The [[partial derivative]] is a [[linear operator]] so this expression ''is'' the operator for energy:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{E} = i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be concluded that the scalar ''E'' is the [[eigenvalue]] of the operator, while &lt;math&gt; \hat{E} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the operator. Summarizing these results:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{E}\Psi = i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\Psi=E\Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For a 3-d plane wave

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi = e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

the derivation is exactly identical, as no change is made to the term including time and therefore the time derivative. Since the [[linear operator|operator is linear]], they are valid for any [[linear combination]] of plane waves, and so they can act on any wave function without affecting the properties of the wave function or operators. Hence this must be true for any wave function. It turns out to work even in [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], such as the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] above.

'''''Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness''''' is a documentary/art film released in June 2015 that takes audiences through farms and urban landscapes in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]], interviewing leading practitioners in the [[Natural farming|Natural Farming]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Ryoseok|title=Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3709036/|last2=Kawaguchi|last3=Korn|first2=Yoshikazu|first3=Larry|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film began when an environmental artist (Patrick M. Lydon) and an environmental book editor (Suhee Kang), had a chance meeting in Seoul, South Korea, and began conducting short interviews together with leaders in the ecology and social justice movements. Upon meeting Korean farmer Seong Hyun Choi however, the two were so impressed by his ecological mindset and way of working, that they set out to produce a feature film about the movement. Lydon and Kang ended up quitting their jobs, giving away most of their possessions, and becoming voluntarily homeless for four years in order to afford producing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kimchiandbasil.com/interview-final-straw/|title=Final straw: food, earth, happiness - Kimchi&amp;Basil|date=2016-02-20|work=Kimchi&amp;Basil|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/a-root-solution/|title=A ‘Root’ Solution {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/21/lydon-ghost-ship-raises-broad-questions-about-art-and-culture/|title=Lydon: Ghost Ship raises big questions about arts and culture|last=|first=|date=|website=San Jose Mercury News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is split into three sections 1) Modern Life, 2) Foundations and Mindset of Natural Farming, and 3) Natural Farming in Practice and Life. According to the filmmakers, as they began to understand more about how natural farming itself was not rooted in methods, but in a way of thinking, they chose to explore the life philosophies and ways of thinking of natural farming practitioners in a more free-flowing and artistic way, rather than an instructive one; the result is an unconventional documentary that features slow paced musical interludes alongside interviews. Reviewers have called both "meditative, and mindful," and "an inspiring call to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mindfulpie.com/one-straw-revolution/|title=Love nature, eat well – Mindful Pie|website=mindfulpie.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/|title=Eco Farming|last=|first=|date=July 1, 2015|work=Clean Eating Magazine|access-date=August 1, 2015|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Active Interest Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and musician [[Alicia Bay Laurel]] called the film "both art and documentary".

== Production ==
Lydon and Kang spent what they call a "meager" life savings to make the film, along with the volunteer efforts of farmers, translators, writers, musicians they had met during their journey. Although the film was filmed, written, and edited entirely by the two directors, they readily admit that the process of making the film was co-operative effort, with more than 200 volunteers directly involved in the process in some way. The soundtrack was recorded with professional musicians from each of the three countries where filming took place, all of whom donated their time to contribute to the film project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the continued help of international volunteers, the film is available in four languages (English, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese), and three more (Chinese, Portuguese, French) are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cbjournalism.com/2016/03/24/filmmaker-spotlight-patrick-lydon-suhee-king/|title=Filmmaker Spotlight: Patrick Lydon &amp; Suhee King|date=2016-03-24|website=Chelsea Breaks the News|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/the-documentary/|title=The Documentary {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tour and critical reception ==
[[File:Seoul-youth-hub-mandala-lydon-kang.jpg|alt=Artists and filmmakers, Patrick M.

Frustrated by the lack of distribution and film festival options for low- and no-budget films, the filmmakers made the decision to manage distribution and touring in the same way they went about filming, through co-operative effort. With the help of volunteers, independent theater owners, and community organizers, they launched an extensive tour throughout Japan and South Korea from 2015-2016, eventually screening the film at over 130 venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/tour-dates-and-screenings/|title=Tour Dates and Screenings {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than simply screening the film, the filmmakers decided to transition their existing media production organization ''SocieCity,'' into a vehicle for art and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artseverywhere.ca/2016/03/07/social-practice-artwork-a-restaurant-and-garden-serving-up-connections-to-urban-nature/|title=Social Practice Artwork: A Restaurant and Garden Serving up Connections to Urban Nature|last=|first=|date=|website=artseverywhere.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a point of hosting interactive events along with their screenings and in several cases, stayed in communities for up to three months at a time to build natural gardens and host a project they call REALtimeFOOD, a grown-to-order restaurant which connects the ideas from the film with real-world practices in farming, food, and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/barndining_/220514125842|title=Bar&amp;Dining Magazine : 네이버 블로그|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://setouchiexplorer.com/real-time-food-project-day-one-worlds-slowest-restaurant-opening/|title=REAL time FOOD Project - Day One - World's Slowest Restaurant Opening|date=2016-09-18|work=Setouchi Explorer|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, these efforts were funded by grants from local philanthropic organizations and/or supported by the communities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chishimatochi.info/found/index.php/archives/service/1961|title=おおさか創造千島財団  » 2015年度|website=www.chishimatochi.info|language=ja|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablepractice.org/2013/11/15/final-straw/|title=Final Straw|date=2013-11-15|website=The CSPA|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interested in the unconventional way the film was being made and toured, multiple magazines and newspapers in Japan and Korea followed the directors during several parts of their journey, notably ESSEN, Bar and Dining, and Road magazines, and Shikoku Shinbun and Huffington Post newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shikoku-newspaper-english.pdf|title=Connecting to Life with Natural Farming in Megijima|last=|first=|date=September 18, 2016|work=Shikoku Shinbun|access-date=17 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/salimstory/story_b_8476176.html|title="모든 것이 연결되어 있다는 깨달음이 시작"|website=허핑턴포스트|language=ko-KR|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://navercast.naver.com/magazine_contents.nhn?rid=1095&amp;contents_id=45426|title=내일의 식문화를 일구는 사람들이 보내 온 새해 편지|access-date=2017-04-18|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the tour, the film was eventually picked up by festivals including Tassie Eco Film Festival and Belleville Doc Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downtowndocfest.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Belleville%20Downtown%20DocFest%20Program_2016.pdf|title=Belleville International Documentary Festival - Official Program|last=|first=|date=1 February 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1805">A '''Gold universe''' is a [[cosmology|cosmological]] model of the [[universe]].  In these models, the universe starts with a [[Big Bang]] and expands for some time, with increasing [[entropy]] and a  [[thermodynamic]] [[arrow of time]] pointing in the direction of the expansion.  After the universe reaches a low-density state, it recontracts, but entropy now decreases, pointing the thermodynamic arrow of time in the opposite direction, until the universe ends in a low-entropy, high-density [[Big Crunch]]. 
There are two models of the universe which support the possibility of a reversed direction of time. The first begins with a state of low entropy at the Big Bang which continually increases until the Big Crunch. The second, a Gold Universe, posits that entropy will increase only until a moment of contraction, then gradually decrease. This latter model suggests the universe will become more orderly after the moment of contraction. The Gold model has been linked to the possibility of retrocausal change, questions concerning the preservation of information in a time-reversed universe (states of decreasing entropy), and [[Causality (physics)|causation]] in general.  The Gold Universe is named after the cosmologist [[Thomas Gold]], who proposed the model in the 1960s.

'''Hardness''' is a measure of the resistance to localized plastic deformation induced by either mechanical indentation or abrasion. Some materials (e.g. [[Metal|metals]]) are harder than others (e.g. [[Plastic|plastics]], [[wood]]). Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong [[intermolecular bond]]s, but the behavior of solid materials under force is complex; therefore, there are different measurements of hardness: ''scratch hardness'', ''indentation hardness'', and ''rebound hardness''.

Hardness is dependent on [[ductility]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[stiffness]], [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], [[deformation (mechanics)|strain]], [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[toughness]], [[viscoelasticity]], and [[viscosity]].

Common examples of '''hard matter''' are [[ceramic]]s, [[concrete]], certain [[metal]]s, and [[superhard material]]s, which can be contrasted with [[soft matter]].

==Measuring hardness==
[[Image:Vickers-tester.jpg|thumb|A Vickers hardness tester]]

There are three main types of hardness measurements: ''scratch'', ''indentation'', and ''rebound''. Within each of these classes of measurement there are individual measurement scales. For practical reasons [[hardness comparison|conversion tables]] are used to convert between one scale and another.

===Scratch hardness{{Anchor|Scratch hardness}}===

{{main|Scratch hardness}}

Scratch hardness is the measure of how resistant a sample is to [[fracture]] or permanent [[plastic deformation]] due to friction from a sharp object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wredenberg|first=Fredrik|author2=PL Larsson|title=Scratch testing of metals and polymers: Experiments and numerics|journal=Wear|date=2009|doi=10.1016/j.wear.2008.05.014|volume=266|issue=1–2|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is that an object made of a harder material will scratch an object made of a softer material. When testing coatings, scratch hardness refers to the force necessary to cut through the film to the substrate. The most common test is [[Mohs scale]], which is used in [[mineralogy]]. One tool to make this measurement is the [[sclerometer]].

Another tool used to make these tests is the pocket hardness tester. This tool consists of a scale arm with graduated markings attached to a four-wheeled carriage. A scratch tool with a sharp rim is mounted at a predetermined angle to the testing surface. In order to use it a weight of known mass is added to the scale arm at one of the graduated markings, the tool is then drawn across the test surface. The use of the weight and markings allows a known pressure to be applied without the need for complicated machinery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.byk.com/en/instruments/products/download.php?doc=74 Hoffman Scratch Hardness Tester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323002752/https://www.byk.com/en/instruments/products/download.php?doc=74 |date=2014-03-23 }}. byk.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indentation hardness===
{{main|Indentation hardness}}

Indentation hardness measures the resistance of a sample to material deformation due to a constant compression load from a sharp object. Tests for indentation hardness are primarily used in [[engineering]] and [[metallurgy]] fields. The tests work on the basic premise of measuring the critical dimensions of an indentation left by a specifically dimensioned and loaded indenter.

Common indentation hardness scales are [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell]], [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers]], [[Shore scale|Shore]], and [[Brinell hardness test|Brinell]], amongst others.

===Rebound hardness===
Rebound hardness, also known as ''dynamic hardness'', measures the height of the "bounce" of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height onto a material. This type of hardness is related to [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. The device used to take this measurement is known as a [[scleroscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Allen | first = Robert | title = A guide to rebound hardness and scleroscope test | date = 2006-12-10 | url = http://www.articlestree.com/science/a-guide-to-rebound-hardness-and-scleroscope-test-tx301428.html | accessdate = 2008-09-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120718022923/http://www.articlestree.com/science/a-guide-to-rebound-hardness-and-scleroscope-test-tx301428.html | archivedate = 2012-07-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two scales that measures rebound hardness are the [[Leeb rebound hardness test]] and [[Bennett hardness scale]].

==Hardening==
{{Main|Hardening (metallurgy)}}

There are five hardening processes: [[Hall-Petch strengthening]], [[work hardening]], [[solid solution strengthening]], [[precipitation hardening]], and [[martensitic transformation]].

==Physics==
[[Image:stress-strain1.svg|thumb|Diagram of a [[stress-strain curve]], showing the relationship between [[Stress (physics)|stress]] (force applied per unit area) and [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] or [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of a ductile metal.]]

In [[solid mechanics]], solids generally have three responses to [[force]], depending on the amount of force and the type of material:
* They exhibit [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]—the ability to temporarily change shape, but return to the original shape when the pressure is removed. "Hardness" in the elastic range—a small temporary change in shape for a given force—is known as [[stiffness]] in the case of a given object, or a high [[elastic modulus]] in the case of a material.
* They exhibit [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]—the ability to permanently change shape in response to the force, but remain in one piece. The [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]] is the point at which elastic deformation gives way to plastic deformation. Deformation in the plastic range is non-linear, and is described by the [[stress-strain curve]]. This response produces the observed properties of scratch and indentation hardness, as described and measured in materials science. Some materials exhibit both [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[viscosity]] when undergoing plastic deformation; this is called [[viscoelasticity]].
* They [[fracture]]—split into two or more pieces.

[[Strength of materials|Strength]] is a measure of the extent of a material's elastic range, or elastic and plastic ranges together. This is quantified as [[compressive strength]], [[shear strength]], [[tensile strength]] depending on the direction of the forces involved. [[Ultimate strength]] is an engineering measure of the maximum load a part of a specific material and geometry can withstand.

[[Brittleness]], in technical usage, is the tendency of a material to fracture with very little or no detectable plastic deformation beforehand. Thus in technical terms, a material can be both brittle and strong. In everyday usage "brittleness" usually refers to the tendency to fracture under a small amount of force, which exhibits both brittleness and a lack of strength (in the technical sense). For perfectly brittle materials, yield strength and ultimate strength are the same, because they do not experience detectable plastic deformation. The opposite of brittleness is [[ductility]].

The [[toughness]] of a material is the maximum amount of [[energy]] it can absorb before fracturing, which is different from the amount of [[force]] that can be applied. Toughness tends to be small for brittle materials, because elastic and plastic deformations allow materials to absorb large amounts of energy.

Hardness increases with decreasing [[particle size]]. This is known as the [[Hall-Petch relationship]]. However, below a critical grain-size, hardness decreases with decreasing grain size. This is known as the inverse Hall-Petch effect.

Hardness of a material to deformation is dependent on its microdurability or small-scale [[shear modulus]] in any direction, not to any [[Stiffness|rigidity]] or [[stiffness]] properties such as its [[bulk modulus]] or [[Young's modulus]]. Stiffness is often confused for hardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jeandron | first = Michelle | title = Diamonds are not forever | journal = Physics World | date = 2005-08-25 | url = http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22997 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090215064216/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22997 | archivedate = 2009-02-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = San-Miguel | first = A. | last2 = Blase | first2 = P. | title = High Pressure Behavior of Silicon Clathrates: A New Class of Low Compressibility Materials | journal = Physical Review | volume = 83 | issue = 25 | date = 1999-05-19 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.5290 | pages = 5290 | last3 = Blase | first3 = X. | last4 = Mélinon | first4 = P. | last5 = Perez | first5 = A. | last6 = Itié | first6 = J. | last7 = Polian | first7 = A. | last8 = Reny | first8 = E. | last9 = Cros | first9 = C. | last10 = Pouchard | first10 = M. | bibcode=1999PhRvL..83.5290S| display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some materials are stiffer than diamond (e.g. osmium) but are not harder, and are prone to [[spall]]ing and flaking in squamose or acicular habits.

===Mechanisms and theory===
[[Image:Close-packed spheres.jpg|thumb|A representation of the crystal lattice showing the planes of atoms.]]

The key to understanding the mechanism behind hardness is understanding the metallic [[microstructure]], or the structure and arrangement of the atoms at the atomic level. In fact, most important metallic properties critical to the manufacturing of today’s goods are determined by the microstructure of a material.&lt;ref name="Haasen"&gt;Haasen, P. (1978). Physical metallurgy. Cambridge [Eng.] ; New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At the atomic level, the atoms in a metal are arranged in an orderly three-dimensional array called a [[crystal lattice]]. In reality, however, a given specimen of a metal likely never contains a consistent single crystal lattice. A given sample of metal will contain many grains, with each grain having a fairly consistent array pattern. At an even smaller scale, each grain contains irregularities.

There are two types of irregularities at the grain level of the microstructure that are responsible for the hardness of the material. These irregularities are point defects and line defects. A point defect is an irregularity located at a single lattice site inside of the overall three-dimensional lattice of the grain. There are three main point defects. If there is an atom missing from the array, a [[vacancy defect]] is formed. If there is a different type of atom at the lattice site that should normally be occupied by a metal atom, a substitutional defect is formed. If there exists an atom in a site where there should normally not be, an [[interstitial defect]] is formed. This is possible because space exists between atoms in a crystal lattice. While point defects are irregularities at a single site in the crystal lattice, line defects are irregularities on a plane of atoms. [[Dislocations]] are a type of line defect involving the misalignment of these planes. In the case of an edge dislocation, a half plane of atoms is wedged between two planes of atoms. In the case of a screw dislocation two planes of atoms are offset with a helical array running between them.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, J. (2009). ''Introduction to materials science course manual''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

In glasses, hardness seems to depend linearly on the number of topological constraints acting between the atoms of the network.&lt;ref name=mauro2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smedskjaer|first=Morten M.|author2=John C. Mauro |author3=Yuanzheng Yue |title=Prediction of Glass Hardness Using Temperature-Dependent Constraint Theory|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|year=2010|volume=105|issue=11|page=2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.115503|pmid=20867584|bibcode=2010PhRvL.105k5503S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the [[Rigidity theory (physics)|rigidity theory]] has allowed predicting hardness values with respect to composition.

[[Image:Dislocation edge d2.jpg|thumb|right|Planes of atoms split by an edge dislocation.]]

Dislocations provide a mechanism for planes of atoms to slip and thus a method for plastic or permanent deformation.&lt;ref name="Haasen" /&gt;  Planes of atoms can flip from one side of the dislocation to the other effectively allowing the dislocation to traverse through the material and the material to deform permanently. The movement allowed by these dislocations causes a decrease in the material's hardness.

The way to inhibit the movement of planes of atoms, and thus make them harder, involves the interaction of dislocations with each other and interstitial atoms. When a dislocation intersects with a second dislocation, it can no longer traverse through the crystal lattice. The intersection of dislocations creates an anchor point and does not allow the planes of atoms to continue to slip over one another&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, W. C. (1981). The physical metallurgy of steels. Washington: Hempisphere Pub. Corp., New York: McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0070377804}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A dislocation can also be anchored by the interaction with interstitial atoms. If a dislocation comes in contact with two or more interstitial atoms, the slip of the planes will again be disrupted. The interstitial atoms create anchor points, or pinning points, in the same manner as intersecting dislocations.

By varying the presence of interstitial atoms and the density of dislocations, a particular metal's hardness can be controlled. Although seemingly counter-intuitive, as the density of dislocations increases, there are more intersections created and consequently more anchor points. Similarly, as more interstitial atoms are added, more pinning points that impede the movements of dislocations are formed. As a result, the more anchor points added, the harder the material will become.

'''Intelligent Energy''' is a fuel cell engineering company focused on the development and commercialisation of its PEM fuel cell technologies for a range of markets including automotive, stationary power and UAVs. We are headquartered in the UK, with offices and representation in the US, Japan, India, and China.

== History ==

The origins of Intelligent Energy began at [[Loughborough University]] in the UK during the late 1980s, when the University became one of Europe’s first research and development centres for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology. In 1995, the UK’s first kW-level PEM fuel cell stack was produced by the R&amp;D team.  In June of that year, Advanced Power Sources (APS) Ltd was founded as a spin-out from Loughborough University by Paul Adcock, Phil Mitchell, Jon Moore and Anthony Newbold, and was the first company in the UK formed specifically to address the development and commercialisation of PEM fuel cells.

Founded by Harry Bradbury, Intelligent Energy was established in 2001, acquiring Advanced Power Sources Ltd, together with its personnel and fuel cell related intellectual property that originated from research conducted by both APS and Loughborough University into PEM fuel cell technology. This triggered investment and enabled the company to grow its business activities.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[http://www.cleantechinvestor.com/portal/mainmenucomp/companiesi/586-intelligent-energy-/11138-profile-intelligent-energy-published-in-cleantech-infocus-uk-innovation-in-fuel-cells-and-hydrogen.html Profile: Intelligent Energy - October 2012].

Intelligent Energy was acquired by Meditor Energy, part of the Meditor Group, in October 2017.

== Technology ==

Intelligent Energy's fuel-cell technology is divided into two platforms: air-cooled (AC) and evaporatively-cooled (EC). The air-cooled fuel cell systems use low-power fans to provide cooling and the oxidant supply for operation. Heat from the fuel cell stack is conducted to cooling plates and removed through airflow channels,  a simplified and cost-effective system for the power range from a few watts to several kilowatts. They  are used in a wide range of UAV, stationary power and automotive applications for two-wheel and small car range extender applications.

Evaporatively-cooled (EC) fuel cell systems provide power generation from a few kilowatts up to 200&amp;nbsp;kW. Efficient thermal management of the EC fuel cell stack reduces system complexity, mass and cost. These  systems are designed for high-volume, low-cost manufacturing, and use modular architecture that can be quickly modified to suit the application.

== Market sectors ==

=== Automotive ===

The firm's fuel cell stacks have been developed for  small and large cars, scooters and motorbikes. 
In 2010, the company was involved in the development of the report entitled “A portfolio of power-trains for Europe: a fact-based analysis.

{{quantum mechanics}}
'''Matter waves''' are a central part of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], being an example of [[wave–particle duality]]. All [[matter]] can exhibit [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave. The concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɔɪ}}) in 1924. It is also referred to as the ''de Broglie hypothesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, R.]], ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]'', Penguin 1990 Edition, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Matter waves are referred to as ''de Broglie waves''.

The ''de Broglie wavelength'' is the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}}, associated with a massive particle and is related to its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}.&lt;/math&gt;

Wave-like behavior of matter was first experimentally demonstrated by [[George Paget Thomson]]'s thin metal diffraction experiment,&lt;ref name=GPTdiff&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomson, G. P. | title = Diffraction of Cathode Rays by a Thin Film | journal = Nature | volume = 119 | issue = 3007 | pages = 890 | year = 1927 | doi = 10.1038/119890a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v119/n3007/pdf/119890a0.pdf | format = PDF |bibcode = 1927Natur.119Q.890T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently in the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] both using electrons, and it has also been confirmed for other [[elementary particle]]s, neutral [[atom]]s and even [[molecule]]s. Recently, it was also found that investigating the elementary process of diffusion gives the theoretical evidence of the relation of matter wave, regardless of the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;Okino, T. (2018) Quantum Effect on Elementary Process of Diffusion and Collective Motion of Brown Particles, Journal Modern Physics 9, pp. 1007-1028.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus revealed that the relation of matter wave is now not a hypothesis but an actual equation relevant to a characteristic of micro particle. The wave-like behavior of matter is crucial to the modern theory of atomic  structure and [[particle physics]].

==Historical context==
At the end of the 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields which propagated according to [[Maxwell's equations]], while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (See [[wave–particle duality#Brief history of wave and particle viewpoints|history of wave and particle viewpoints]]). In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of black body thermal radiation, [[Max Planck]] proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta. Light quanta are now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck–Einstein relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;
and a momentum
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{E}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ν''}} (lowercase [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) and {{math|''λ''}} (lowercase [[Lambda|Greek letter lambda]]) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, {{math|''c''}} the speed of light, and {{math|''h''}} the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1917).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern convention, frequency is symbolized by ''f'' as is done in the rest of this article. Einstein’s postulate was confirmed experimentally by [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]] and [[Arthur Compton]] over the next two decades.

==de Broglie hypothesis==
[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of '''de Broglie waves''' in 1d – real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the color [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versa. The result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[plane wave]]. Bottom: [[wave packet]].]]
De Broglie, in his 1924 PhD thesis, proposed that just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, [[electron]]s also have wave-like properties. By rearranging the momentum equation stated in the above section, we find a relationship between the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}} associated with an electron and its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship is now known to hold for all types of matter: all matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves.

{{quote|When I conceived the first basic ideas of wave mechanics in 1923–24, I was guided by the aim to perform a real physical synthesis, valid for all particles, of the coexistence of the wave and of the corpuscular aspects that Einstein had introduced for photons in his theory of light quanta in 1905.|De Broglie&lt;ref&gt;Louis de Broglie [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ "The Reinterpretation of Wave Mechanics" Foundations of Physics, Vol. 1 No. 1 (1970)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] published an [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] describing how a matter wave should evolve—the matter wave analogue of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell’s equations]]—and used it to derive the [[Emission spectrum|energy spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]].

==Experimental confirmation==
[[File:Wave-particle duality.gif|right|thumb|200px|Demonstration of a matter wave in diffraction of electrons]]

Matter waves were first experimentally confirmed to occur in [[George Paget Thomson]]'s cathode ray diffraction experiment&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; and the [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson-Germer experiment]] for electrons, and the de Broglie hypothesis has been confirmed for other elementary particles. Furthermore, neutral atoms and even molecules have been shown to be wave-like.

===Electrons===
{{further|Davisson–Germer experiment|Electron diffraction}}
In 1927 at Bell Labs, [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] [[Davisson–Germer experiment|fired]] slow-moving [[electron]]s at a [[crystal]]line [[nickel]] target. The angular dependence of the diffracted electron intensity was measured, and was determined to have the same [[diffraction|diffraction pattern]] as those predicted by [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg]] for [[x-ray]]s. At the same time George Paget Thomson at the University of Aberdeen was independently firing electrons at very thin metal foils to demonstrate the same effect.&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis, diffraction was a property that was thought to be exhibited only by waves. Therefore, the presence of any [[diffraction]] effects by matter demonstrated the wave-like nature of matter. When the de Broglie wavelength was inserted into the [[Bragg's law|Bragg condition]], the observed diffraction pattern was predicted, thereby experimentally confirming the de Broglie hypothesis for electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Dardo, ''Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics'', Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a pivotal result in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. Just as the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated the particle nature of light, the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] showed the wave-nature of matter, and completed the theory of [[wave–particle duality]]. For [[physicist]]s this idea was important because it meant that not only could any particle exhibit wave characteristics, but that one could use [[wave equation]]s to describe phenomena in matter if one used the de Broglie wavelength.

The effect has also been used to explain the spatial version of the [[quantum Zeno effect]], in which an otherwise unstable object may be stabilised by rapidly repeated observations.&lt;ref name="zeno"/&gt;

===Molecules===
Recent experiments even confirm the relations for molecules and even [[macromolecule]]s that otherwise might be supposed too large to undergo quantum mechanical effects. In 1999, a research team in [[Vienna]] demonstrated diffraction for molecules as large as [[fullerene]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Wave-particle duality of C60| first=M.| last=Arndt| author2=O.

Still one step further than Louis De Broglie go theories which in quantum mechanics eliminate the concept of a pointlike classical particle and explain the observed facts by means of wavepackets of matter waves alone.&lt;ref&gt;See section VI(e) of Everett's thesis: ''The Theory of the Universal Wave Function'', in [[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], [[R.

The de Broglie equations relate the [[wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}} to the [[momentum]] {{math|''p''}}, and [[frequency]] {{math|''f''}} to the total energy {{math|''E''}} of a particle:&lt;ref name="Resnick 1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles |edition=2nd |first=R. |last=Resnick |first2=R. |last2=Eisberg |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=1985 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-87373-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In each pair, the second equation is also referred to as the [[Planck–Einstein relation]], since it was also proposed by [[Max Planck|Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].

===Special relativity===
Using two formulas from [[special relativity]], one for the [[Momentum#Relativistic|relativistic momentum]] and one for the relativistic mass energy

:&lt;math&gt;E = m c^2 = \gamma m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = m\vec{v} = \gamma m_0 \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;

allows the equations to be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\lambda =\,\, \frac {h}{\gamma m_0v}\, =\, \frac {h}{m_0v}\,\,\,\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\
&amp; f = \frac{\gamma\,m_0c^2}{h} = \frac {m_0c^2}{h} \bigg/ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; denotes the particle's [[Invariant mass|rest mass]], &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its [[velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stationary states |first=Alan |last=Holden |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1971 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-501497-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W.S.C. (2002). ''Introducing Special Relativity'', Taylor &amp; Francis, London, {{ISBN|0-415-27761-2}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Broglie, L. (1970). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ The reinterpretation of wave mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics'' '''1'''(1): 5–15, p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; See below for details of the derivation of the de Broglie relations. Group velocity (equal to the particle's speed) should not be confused with [[phase velocity]] (equal to the product of the particle's frequency and its wavelength). In the case of a non-[[dispersion relation|dispersive medium]], they happen to be equal, but otherwise they are not.

====Group velocity====
[[Albert Einstein]] first explained the [[wave–particle duality]] of light in 1905.  [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that any particle should also exhibit such a duality. The velocity of a particle, he concluded, should always equal the group velocity of the corresponding wave. The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the particle's speed.

Both in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum physics, we can identify the group velocity of a particle's wave function with the particle velocity.  [[Quantum mechanics]] has very accurately demonstrated this hypothesis, and the relation has been shown explicitly for particles as large as [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"/&gt;

De Broglie deduced that if the duality equations already known for light were the same for any particle, then his hypothesis would hold.  This means that

:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{\partial (E/\hbar)}{\partial (p/\hbar)} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial p}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''}} is the total [[energy]] of the particle, {{math|''p''}} is its [[momentum]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the reduced Planck constant. For a free non-relativistic particle it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \frac{1}{2}\frac{p^2}{m} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{p}{m}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''}} is the [[mass]] of the particle and {{math|''v''}} its velocity.

Also in [[special relativity]] we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the rest mass of the particle and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum. But (see below), using that the phase velocity is {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''/''p'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''v''}}, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}\\
    &amp;= \frac{c^2}{v_p}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the velocity of the particle regardless of wave behavior.

====Phase velocity====
In [[quantum mechanics]], particles also behave as waves with [[complex number|complex]] phases. The [[phase velocity]] is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.

By the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{E/\hbar}{p/\hbar} = \frac{E}{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum, we have

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{E}{p} = \frac{m c^2}{m v} = \frac{\gamma m_0 c^2}{\gamma m_0 v} = \frac{c^2}{v} = \frac{c}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the total energy of the particle (i.e. [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]] plus [[kinetic energy]] in the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] sense), ''p'' the [[momentum]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and β the speed as a fraction of ''c''. The variable ''v'' can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed &lt;math&gt;v &lt; c &lt;/math&gt; for any particle that has mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} &gt; c, \,&lt;/math&gt;

and as we can see, it approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for details.

===Four-vectors===
{{Main|Four-vector}}

Using four-vectors, the De Broglie relations form a single equation:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}= \hbar\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.

Likewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega_o}{c^2}\right)\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretations==
The physical reality underlying de Broglie waves is a subject of ongoing debate. Some theories treat either the particle or the wave aspect as its fundamental nature, seeking to explain the other as an [[Emergence|emergent property]]. Some, such as the [[hidden variable theory]], treat the wave and the particle as distinct entities. Yet others propose some intermediate entity that is neither quite wave nor quite particle but only appears as such when we measure one or the other property. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the nature of the underlying reality is unknowable and beyond the bounds of scientific inquiry.

Schrödinger's quantum mechanical waves are conceptually different from ordinary physical waves such as water or sound. Ordinary physical waves are characterized by undulating real-number 'displacements' of dimensioned physical variables at each point of ordinary physical space at each instant of time. Schrödinger's "waves" are characterized by the undulating value of a dimensionless complex number at each point of an abstract multi-dimensional space, for example of configuration space.

At the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] reported as follows:

{{quote|If one wishes to calculate the probabilities of excitation and ionization of atoms [M. Born, Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange, ''Z. f. Phys.'', '''37''' (1926), 863; [Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange], ''ibid.'', '''38''' (1926), 803] then one must introduce the coordinates of the atomic electrons as variables on an equal footing with those of the colliding electron. The waves then propagate no longer in three-dimensional space but in multi-dimensional configuration space. From this one sees that the quantum mechanical waves are indeed something quite different from the light waves of the classical theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1928). Quantum mechanics, pp. 143–181 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, p. 166; this translation at p. 425 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the same conference, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] reported likewise.

{{quote|Under [the name 'wave mechanics',] at present two theories are being carried on, which are indeed closely related but not identical. The first, which follows on directly from the famous doctoral thesis by L. de Broglie, concerns waves in three-dimensional space. Because of the strictly relativistic treatment that is adopted in this version from the outset, we shall refer to it as the ''four-dimensional'' wave mechanics. The other theory is more remote from Mr de Broglie's original ideas, insofar as it is based on a wave-like process in the space of ''position coordinates'' (''q''-space) of an arbitrary mechanical system.[Long footnote about manuscript not copied here.] We shall therefore call it the ''multi-dimensional'' wave mechanics. Of course this use of the ''q''-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately, in this version also, the process to be described is one in space and time. In truth, however, a complete unification of the two conceptions has not yet been achieved. Anything over and above the motion of a single electron could be treated so far only in the ''multi''-dimensional version; also, this is the  one that provides the mathematical solution to the problems posed by the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger, E.]] (1928). Wave mechanics, pp. 185–206 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, pp. 185–186; this translation at p. 447 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, Heisenberg reiterated this:

{{quote|An important step forward was made by the work of Born [''Z. Phys.'', '''37''': 863, 1926 and '''38''': 803, 1926] in the summer of 1926. In this work, the wave in configuration space was interpreted as a probability wave, in order to explain collision processes on Schrödinger's theory. This hypothesis contained two important new features in comparison with that of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater]]. The first of these was the assertion that, in considering "probability waves", we are concerned with processes not in ordinary three-dimensional space, but in an abstract configuration space (a fact which is, unfortunately, sometimes overlooked even today); the second was the recognition that the probability wave is related to an individual process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955). The development of the interpretation of the quantum theory, pp. 12–29, in ''[[Niels Bohr]] and the Development of Physics: Essays dedicated to Niels Bohr on the occasion of his seventieth birthday'', edited by [[Wolfgang Pauli|W. Pauli]], with the assistance of [[Léon Rosenfeld|L. Rosenfeld]] and [[Victor Weisskopf|V. Weisskopf]], Pergamon Press, London, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is mentioned above that the "displaced quantity" of the Schrödinger wave has values that are dimensionless complex numbers. One may ask what is the physical meaning of those numbers. According to Heisenberg, rather than being of some ordinary physical quantity such as, for example, Maxwell's electric field intensity, or mass density, the Schrödinger-wave packet's "displaced quantity" is probability amplitude. He wrote that instead of using the term 'wave packet', it is preferable to speak of a probability packet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927). Über den anschlaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik, ''Z. Phys.'' '''43''': 172–198, translated by eds. [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, J.A.]], [[Wojciech Zurek|Zurek, W.H.]] (1983), at pp. 62–84 of ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, p. 73. Also translated as 'The actual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics' [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19840008978.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The probability amplitude supports calculation of probability of location or momentum of discrete particles. Heisenberg recites Duane's account of particle diffraction by probabilistic quantal translation momentum transfer, which allows, for example in Young's two-slit experiment, each diffracted particle probabilistically to pass discretely through a particular slit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', translated by C. Eckart, F. C. Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one does not need necessarily think of the matter wave, as it were, as 'composed of smeared matter'.

These ideas may be expressed in ordinary language as follows. In the account of ordinary physical waves, a 'point' refers to a position in ordinary physical space at an instant of time, at which there is specified a 'displacement' of some physical quantity. But in the account of quantum mechanics, a 'point' refers to a configuration of the system at an instant of time, every particle of the system being in a sense present in every 'point' of configuration space, each particle at such a 'point' being located possibly at a different position in ordinary physical space. There is no explicit definite indication that, at an instant, this particle is 'here' and that particle is 'there' in some separate 'location' in configuration space. This conceptual difference entails that, in contrast to de Broglie's pre-quantum mechanical wave description, the quantum mechanical probability packet description does not directly and explicitly express the Aristotelian idea, referred to by Newton, that causal efficacy propagates through ordinary space by contact, nor the Einsteinian idea that such propagation is no faster than light. In contrast, these ideas are so expressed in the classical wave account, through the [[Green's function]], though it is inadequate for the observed quantal phenomena. The physical reasoning for this was first recognized by Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, A. (1986).

Miller, Plenum Press, New York, {{ISBN|978-1-4684-8773-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==De Broglie's phase wave and periodic phenomenon==
De Broglie's thesis started from the hypothesis, "that to each portion of energy with a proper mass {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} one may associate a periodic phenomenon of the frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} , such that one finds: {{math|''hν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is to be measured, of course, in the rest frame of the energy packet. This hypothesis is the basis of our theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Broglie | first1 = L. | authorlink = Louis de Broglie | year = 1923 | title = Waves and quanta | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 112 | issue = 2815| page = 540 | doi=10.1038/112540a0| bibcode = 1923Natur.112..540D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie, L.]] (1924).

De Broglie followed his initial hypothesis of a periodic phenomenon, with frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, associated with the energy packet. He used the special theory of relativity to find, in the frame of the observer of the electron energy packet that is moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, that its frequency was apparently reduced to

:&lt;math&gt;f = \nu_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda f = E/p=v_\mathrm p\,.&lt;/math&gt;

using the same notation as above. The quantity &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of what de Broglie called the "phase y wave". Its wavelength is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. De Broglie reasoned that his hypothetical intrinsic particle periodic phenomenon is in phase with that phase wave. This was his basic matter wave conception. He noted, as above, that &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;, and the phase wave does not transfer energy.&lt;ref name="Medicus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009). ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}, pp. 30–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of waves being associated with matter is correct, de Broglie did not leap directly to the final understanding of quantum mechanics with no missteps. There are conceptual problems with the approach that de Broglie took in his thesis that he was not able to resolve, despite trying a number of different fundamental hypotheses in different papers published while working on, and shortly after publishing, his thesis.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;{{cite web

These difficulties were resolved by [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who developed the wave mechanics approach, starting from a somewhat different basic hypothesis.

'''Moisture expansion''' is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in moisture content. The macroscopic effect is similar to that of [[thermal expansion]] but the microscopic causes are very different. Moisture expansion is caused by [[hygroscopy]].

However, in [[quantum physics]], [[organic chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]], the term ''molecule'' is often used less strictly, also being applied to [[polyatomic ion]]s.

In the [[kinetic theory of gases]], the term ''molecule'' is often used for any gaseous [[particle]] regardless of its composition. According to this definition, [[noble gas]] atoms are considered molecules as they are monatomic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Chandra| first= Sulekh| title= Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry| date= 2005| publisher= New Age Publishers| isbn= 81-224-1512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A molecule may be [[homonuclear]], that is, it consists of atoms of one [[chemical element]], as with [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); or it may be [[heteronuclear]], a [[chemical compound]] composed of more than one element, as with [[water (molecule)|water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Atoms and complexes connected by [[non-covalent interactions]], such as [[hydrogen bond]]s or [[ionic bond]]s, are generally not considered single molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Molecule|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date =22 January 2016|url=http://global.britannica.com/science/molecule|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and therefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and [[Earth core|core of the Earth]], contain many chemical bonds, but are ''not'' made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for [[ionic crystal]]s ([[salt (chemistry)|salts]]) and covalent crystals ([[network solid]]s), although these are often composed of repeating [[unit cell]]s that extend either in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (such as in [[graphene]]) or three-dimensionally (such as in [[diamond]], [[quartz]], or [[sodium chloride]]). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with [[metallic bond]]ing, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In [[glass]]es (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.

== Molecular science ==

The science of molecules is called ''molecular chemistry'' or ''[[molecular physics]]'', depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of [[chemical bond]]s, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more [[atom]]s. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term ''unstable molecule'' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].

== History and etymology ==
{{Main|History of molecular theory}}

According to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word "molecule" derives from the [[Latin]] "[[Mole (unit)|moles]]" or small unit of mass.
* '''Molecule''' (1794)&amp;nbsp;– "extremely minute particle", from French ''{{linktext|molécule}}'' (1678), from [[New Latin]] ''{{linktext|molecula}}'', diminutive of Latin ''{{linktext|moles}}'' "mass, barrier". A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the word (used until the late 18th century only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|molecule|accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=molecule|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/molecule|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest [[list of particles#Molecules|particles]] of pure [[chemical substance]]s that still retain their [[chemical compound|composition]] and chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/m.shtml#molecule Molecule Definition] ([[Frostburg State University]])&lt;/ref&gt; This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], and [[metal]]s, are composed of large crystalline networks of [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] atoms or [[ion]]s, but are not made of discrete molecules.

== Bonding ==

Molecules are held together by either [[covalent bonding]] or [[ionic bonding]]. Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule. A molecule of a compound is made out of two or more elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hutchinson unabridged encyclopedia with atlas and weather guide|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hutchinson-unabridged-encyclopedia-with-atlas-and-weather-guide/oclc/696918830|website=worldcat.org|publisher=Oxford, England|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covalent ===
{{main|Covalent bonding}}
[[File:Covalent bond hydrogen.svg|thumb|right|A covalent bond forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (right) where two [[hydrogen atom]]s share the two electrons]]
A covalent bond is a [[chemical bond]] that involves the sharing of [[electron pair]]s between [[atom]]s. These electron pairs are termed ''shared pairs'' or ''bonding pairs'', and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed ''covalent bonding''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author2= Brad Williamson; Robin J.

=== Ionic ===
{{main|Ionic bonding}} [[File:NaF.gif|thumb|left|[[Sodium]] and [[fluorine]] undergoing a redox reaction to form [[sodium fluoride]]. Sodium loses its outer [[electron]]  to give it a stable [[electron configuration]], and this electron enters the fluorine atom [[exothermic]]ally.]]

Ionic bonding is a type of [[chemical bond]] that involves the [[electrostatic]] attraction between oppositely charged [[ion]]s, and is the primary interaction occurring in [[ionic compound]]s. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more [[electron]]s (termed [[cation]]s) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed [[anion]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VdROgeQ5M8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=ionic+bonding+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi34bOG_6nTAhVnl1QKHRLZBeoQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=ionic%20bonding%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Metallurgy and Engineering Alloys|last=Campbell|first=Flake C.|date=2008-01-01|publisher=[[ASM International]]|isbn=9781615030583|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer of electrons is termed ''electrovalence'' in contrast to [[covalent bond|covalence]]. In the simplest case, the cation is a [[metal]] atom and the anion is a [[nonmetal]] atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Basically, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.

== Molecular size ==

Most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, but there are exceptions. [[DNA]], a [[macromolecule]], can reach [[macroscopic]] sizes, as can molecules of many [[polymer]]s. Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few [[angstrom]]s (Å) to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by [[light]] (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an [[atomic force microscope]]. Some of the largest molecules are [[macromolecule]]s or [[supermolecule]]s.

The smallest molecule is the [[diatomic]] [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with a bond length of 0.74 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Roger L. DeKock |author2=Harry B.

== Molecular formulas ==

=== Chemical formula types ===
{{Main|Chemical formula}}

The [[chemical formula]] for a molecule uses one line of [[chemical element]] symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and ''plus'' (+) and ''minus'' (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.

A compound's [[empirical formula]] is a very simple type of chemical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wUmteTIc18C&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=empirical+formula&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv64bBh6rTAhUSwmMKHb3vB0IQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=empirical%20formula&amp;f=false|title=The Practice of Chemistry|last=Wink|first=Donald J.|last2=Fetzer-Gislason|first2=Sharon|last3=McNicholas|first3=Sheila|date=2003-03-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780716748717|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the simplest [[integer]] [[ratio]] of the [[chemical element]]s that constitute it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Mole/EmpiricalFormula.html|title=ChemTeam: Empirical Formula|website=www.chemteam.info|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of [[hydrogen]] to [[oxygen]] atoms, and ethyl [[alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] is always composed of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely&amp;nbsp;– [[dimethyl ether]] has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [[atom]]s in different arrangements are called [[isomer]]s. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.

The [[molecular formula]] reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.

The empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [[acetylene]] has molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.

The [[molecular mass]] can be calculated from the [[chemical formula]] and is expressed in conventional [[atomic mass unit]]s equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;[[carbon|C]] [[isotope]]) atom. For [[network solid]]s, the term [[formula unit]] is used in [[stoichiometric]] calculations.

[[File:Atisane3.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|[[Three-dimensional space|3D]] (left and center) and [[2D geometric model|2D]] (right) representations of the [[terpenoid]] molecule atisane]]

For molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural [[chemical formula]] may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a [[structural formula]] may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such [[chemical nomenclature]] requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.

== Molecular geometry ==
{{Main|Molecular geometry}}

[[File:Cyanostar STM.png|thumb|left|upright|Structure and [[Scanning tunneling microscopy|STM]] image of a "cyanostar" [[dendrimer]] molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C4CC03725A|pmid=25080328|title=Anion-induced dimerization of 5-fold symmetric cyanostars in 3D crystalline solids and 2D self-assembled crystals|journal=Chemical Communications|volume=50|issue=69|pages=9827–30|year=2014|last1=Hirsch|first1=Brandon E.|last2=Lee|first2=Semin|last3=Qiao|first3=Bo|last4=Chen|first4=Chun-Hsing|last5=McDonald|first5=Kevin P.|last6=Tait|first6=Steven L.|last7=Flood|first7=Amar H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Molecules have fixed [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]. [[Isomers]] share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. [[Stereoisomer]]s, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] activities.

== Molecular spectroscopy ==
{{Main|Spectroscopy}}

[[File:Dehydrogenation of H2TPP by STM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Hydrogen can be removed from individual [[Tetraphenylporphyrin|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP]] molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from [[diode]] like (red curve in b) to [[resistor]] like (green curve). Image (c) shows a row of TPP, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP and TPP molecules. While scanning image (d), excess voltage was applied to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP at the black dot, which instantly removed hydrogen, as shown in the bottom part of (d) and in the rescan image (e). Such manipulations can be used in [[single-molecule electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep08350|pmid=25666850|pmc=4322354|title=N and p type character of single molecule diodes|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|page=8350|year=2015|bibcode= 2015NatSR...5E8350Z|author1=Zoldan|first1=V. C.|last2=Faccio|first2=R|last3=Pasa|first3=A. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Molecular spectroscopy''' deals with the response ([[frequency spectrum|spectrum]]) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known [[energy]] (or [[frequency]], according to [[Planck's constant|Planck's formula]]). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through [[absorbance]] or [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]].&lt;ref name="iupac2"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Spectroscopy|file=S05848|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spectroscopy does not generally refer to [[diffraction]] studies where particles such as [[neutron]]s, [[electron]]s, or high energy [[X-ray]]s interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).

[[Microwave spectroscopy]] commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures changes in vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy actually measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.

== Theoretical aspects ==

The study of molecules by [[molecular physics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the [[chemical bond]]. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].

When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it "must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state".&lt;ref name="iupac" /&gt; This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which has one vibrational [[bound state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on "An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential" [J. Chem. Phys. 115, 4546 (2001)] |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=120 |issue=20 |pages=9886–7 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15268005 |doi=10.1063/1.1704638 |bibcode= 2004JChPh.120.9886A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures.

Whether or not an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [[elementary particle]]); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.

A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9251">[[File:Romuvan ritual fire.png|thumb|An ''aukuras'', a type of fire altar found in [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a modern Pagan faith characterised as a "nature religion".]]

A '''nature religion''' is a religious movement that believes [[nature]] and the [[Natural environment|natural world]] is an embodiment of divinity, sacredness or spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"/&gt; Nature religions include [[indigenous religion]]s [[Nature worship|practiced]] in various parts of the world by cultures who consider the environment to be imbued with spirits and other sacred entities. It also includes [[modern Paganism|contemporary Pagan]] faiths which are primarily concentrated in Europe and North America.

The term "nature religion" was first coined by the American [[religious studies]] scholar [[Catherine Albanese]], who used it in her work ''Nature Religion in America: From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age'' (1991) and later went on to use it in other studies. Following on from Albanese's development of the term it has since been used by other academics working in the discipline.

==Definition==
Catherine Albanese described nature religion as "a symbolic center and the cluster of beliefs, behaviours, and values that encircles it", deeming it to be useful for shining a light on aspects of history that are rarely viewed as religious.{{sfn|Albanese|1991|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}}
In a paper of his on the subject, the Canadian religious studies scholar Peter Beyer described "nature religion" as a "useful analytical abstraction" to refer to "any religious belief or practice in which devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to note that in this way nature religion was not an "identifiable religious tradition" such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Christianity]] are, but that it instead covers "a range of religious and quasi-religious movements, groups and social networks whose participants may or may not identify with one of the many constructed religions of global society which referred to many other nature religion."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 16"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amatciems July 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Amatciems, a settlement of [[Ringing Cedars' Anastasians]] in [[Drabeši Parish]], [[Latvia]]. Anastasianism is a Russian-originated modern Pagan movement that sacralises environmental and human nativity (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]''), and is therefore regarded as a "nature religion".]]

===Common characteristics===
Peter Beyer noted the existence of a series of common characteristics which he believed were shared by different nature religions. He remarked that although "one must be careful not to overgeneralise", he suspected that there were a series of features which "occur sufficiently often" in those nature religions known to recorded scholarship to constitute a pattern.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

The first of these common characteristics was nature religion's "comparative resistance to institutionalisation and legitimisation in terms of identifiable socio-religious authorities and organisations", meaning that nature religionists rarely formed their religious beliefs into large, visible socio-political structures such as churches. Furthermore, Beyer noted, nature religionists often held a "concomitant distrust of and even eschewing of politically orientated power".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Instead of this, he felt that among nature religious communities, there was "a valuing of community as non-hierarchical" and a "conditional optimism with regard to human capacity and the future."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

In the sphere of the environment, Beyer noted that nature religionists held to a "holistic conception of reality" and "a valorisation of physical place as vital aspects of their spiritualities".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Similarly, Beyer noted the [[individualism]] which was favoured by nature religionists. He remarked that those adhering to such beliefs typically had respect for "charismatic and hence purely individual authority" and place a "strong emphasis on individual paths" which led them to believe in "the equal value of individuals and groups". Along similar lines, he also commented on the "strong experiential basis" to nature religionist beliefs "where personal experience is a final arbiter of truth or validity".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

==Use within academia==
In April 1996, the [[University of Lancaster]] in North West England held a conference on contemporary Paganism entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-10-01|title=Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s. Conference at the Lake District Campus of Lancaster University, 9th to 13th April 1996|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/reli.1996.0031|journal=Religion|volume=26|issue=4|pages=373–376|doi=10.1006/reli.1996.0031|issn=0048-721X}}&lt;/ref&gt;", and ultimately led to the publication of an academic anthology of the same name two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This book, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World'', was edited by members of the University's Department of Religious Studies, a postgraduate named Joanne Pearson and two professors, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of [[Wicca]], the [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed the view that the category of "nature religion" was problematic from a "historical perspective" because it solely emphasises the "commonalities of belief and attitude to the natural world" that are found between different religions and in doing so divorces these different belief systems from their distinctive socio-cultural and historical backgrounds.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=8}}

The '''observable universe''' is a [[celestial sphere|spherical region]] of the [[Universe]] comprising all [[matter]] that can be [[observation|observed]] from [[Earth]] at the present time, because [[electromagnetic radiation]] from these [[astronomical object|objects]] has had time to reach Earth since the beginning of the [[metric expansion of space|cosmological expansion]]. There are at least 2 trillion [[galaxy|galaxies]] in the observable universe.&lt;ref name="Conselice"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Galaxy Number Density at ''z'' &lt; 8 and Its Implications |first=Christopher J. |last=Conselice et al |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=830 |issue=2 |year=2016 |arxiv=1607.03909v2 |bibcode= 2016ApJ...830...83C |doi=10.3847/0004-637X/830/2/83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20161017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fountain |first=Henry |title=Two Trillion Galaxies, at the Very Least |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/science/two-trillion-galaxies-at-the-very-least.html |date=17 October 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the Universe is [[isotropy|isotropic]], the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly [[equidistant|the same]] in every direction. That is, the observable universe has a [[sphere|spherical]] volume (a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]) centered on the observer. Every location in the Universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one [[geocentric model|centered on Earth]].

The word ''observable'' in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect [[light]] or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the [[speed of light]] itself. Because no signals can travel faster than light, any object farther away from us than light could travel in the [[age of the Universe]] (estimated {{as of|2015|lc=y}} around {{val|13.799|0.021|ul=billion}} years&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;) simply cannot be detected, as they have not reached us yet. Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the ''visible'' universe, which includes only signals emitted since [[Recombination_(cosmology)|recombination]]—and the ''observable'' universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (the [[Big Bang cosmology|Big Bang]] in traditional [[physical cosmology]], the end of the [[inflationary epoch]] in modern cosmology).

According to calculations, the current ''[[comoving distance]]''—proper distance, which takes into account that the universe has expanded since the light was emitted—to particles from which the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) was emitted, which represent the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion [[parsec]]s (about 45.7 billion light-years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years),&lt;ref name="mapofuniverse"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Gott III|first = J.

Since the expansion of the universe is known to accelerate and will become exponential in the future, the light emitted from all distant objects, past some time dependent on their current [[redshift]], will never reach the Earth. In the future all currently observable objects will slowly freeze in time while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. For instance, objects with the current redshift ''z'' from 5 to 10 will remain observable for no more than 4–6 billion years. In addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance (currently about 19 billion parsecs) will never reach Earth.&lt;ref name=Loeb2002&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.047301|title=Long-term future of extragalactic astronomy|journal=Physical Review D|volume=65|issue=4|year=2002|last1=Loeb|first1=Abraham|arxiv=astro-ph/0107568|bibcode=2002PhRvD..65d7301L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The universe versus the observable universe ==
{{Physical cosmology|comp/struct}}
Some parts of the universe are too far away for the light emitted since the [[Big Bang]] to have had enough time to reach Earth, and so lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. However, due to [[Hubble's law]], regions sufficiently distant from the Earth are expanding away from it faster than the speed of light ([[special relativity]] prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other, but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding; see [[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion) and furthermore the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|expansion rate appears to be accelerating]] due to [[dark energy]]. Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging [[cosmological constant]]), so that the expansion rate of the universe continues to accelerate, there is a "future visibility limit" beyond which objects will ''never'' enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach the Earth. (A subtlety is that, because the [[Hubble's law#Interpretation|Hubble parameter]] is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from the Earth just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches the Earth eventually.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575 Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?] (see the last two paragraphs)&lt;/ref&gt;) This future visibility limit is calculated at a [[comoving distance]] of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light-years), assuming the universe will keep expanding forever, which implies the number of galaxies that we can ever theoretically observe in the infinite future (leaving aside the issue that some may be impossible to observe in practice due to redshift, as discussed in the following paragraph) is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 2.36.&lt;ref name="mapofuniverse2"&gt;The comoving distance of the future visibility limit is calculated on p. 8 of Gott et al.'s [http://www.astro.princeton.edu/universe/ms.pdf A Map of the Universe] to be 4.50 times the [[Hubble radius]], given as 4.220 billion parsecs (13.76 billion light-years), whereas the current comoving radius of the observable universe is calculated on p. 7 to be 3.38 times the Hubble radius. The number of galaxies in a sphere of a given comoving radius is proportional to the cube of the radius, so as shown on p. 8 the ratio between the number of galaxies observable in the future visibility limit to the number of galaxies observable today would be (4.50/3.38)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Science Friday, 3 Apr 2009. According to the [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=102715275 transcript], [[Brian Greene]] makes the comment "And actually, in the far future, everything we now see, except for our local galaxy and a region of galaxies will have disappeared.

For example, the current distance to this horizon is about 16 billion light-years, meaning that a signal from an event happening ''at present'' can eventually reach the Earth in the future if the event is less than 16 billion light-years away, but the signal will never reach the Earth if the event is more than 16 billion light-years away.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;

Both popular and professional research articles in cosmology often use the term "universe" to mean "observable universe".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This can be justified on the grounds that we can never know anything by direct experimentation about any part of the universe that is [[Causality (physics)|causally disconnected]] from the Earth, although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} No evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the universe as a whole, nor do any of the mainstream cosmological models propose that the universe has any physical boundary in the first place, though some models propose it could be finite but unbounded, like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2D surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge. It is plausible that the [[galaxy|galaxies]] within our observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the universe. According to the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] initially introduced by its founder, [[Alan Guth]] (and by D. Kazanas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Dynamics of the Universe and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking" Kazanas, D., Ap. J. (Lett.), 241, L59-L63.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), if it is assumed that inflation began about 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, then with the plausible assumption that the size of the universe before the inflation occurred was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age, that would suggest that at present the entire universe's size is at least 3×10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; times the radius of the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan H.

If the universe is finite but unbounded, it is also possible that the universe is ''smaller'' than the observable universe. In this case, what we take to be very distant galaxies may actually be duplicate images of nearby galaxies, formed by light that has circumnavigated the universe. It is difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally because different images of a galaxy would show different eras in its history, and consequently might appear quite different.

Many secondary sources have reported a wide variety of incorrect figures for the size of the visible universe. Some of these figures are listed below, with brief descriptions of possible reasons for misconceptions about them.

;13.8 billion light-years
:The [[age of the universe]] is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal to or greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static [[Minkowski space]]time conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, [[spacetime]] is curved in a way that corresponds to the [[Expansion of the universe|expansion of space]], as evidenced by [[Hubble's law]]. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Wright, [http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Dltt_is_Dumb.html "Why the Light Travel Time Distance should not be used in Press Releases"].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Redshift survey|Sky surveys]] and mappings of the various [[wavelength]] bands of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (in particular [[Hydrogen line|21-cm emission]]) have yielded much information on the content and character of the [[universe]]'s structure. The organization of structure appears to follow as a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] model with organization up to the [[scale (spatial)|scale]] of [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filament]]s. Larger than this (at scales between 30 and 200 megaparsecs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292022932|edition=International|page=1178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;), there seems to be no continued structure, a phenomenon that has been referred to as the ''End of Greatness''.&lt;ref name=Kirshner /&gt;

=== Walls, filaments, nodes, and voids ===
[[File:2dfdtfe.gif|thumb|300px|left|[[Dtfe|DTFE reconstruction]] of the inner parts of the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]]]]
The organization of structure arguably begins at the stellar level, though most cosmologists rarely address [[astrophysics]] on that scale. [[Star]]s are organized into [[galaxy|galaxies]], which in turn form [[galaxy group]]s, [[galaxy cluster]]s, [[supercluster]]s, sheets, [[galaxy filament|walls and filaments]], which are separated by immense [[void (astronomy)|voids]], creating a vast foam-like structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9781292022932|edition=International|pages=1173–1174|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called the "cosmic web". Prior to 1989, it was commonly assumed that [[virial theorem|virialized]] galaxy clusters were the largest structures in existence, and that they were distributed more or less uniformly throughout the universe in every direction. However, since the early 1980s, more and more structures have been discovered. In 1983, Adrian Webster identified the Webster LQG, a [[large quasar group]] consisting of 5 quasars. The discovery was the first identification of a large-scale structure, and has expanded the information about the known grouping of matter in the universe. In 1987, Robert Brent Tully identified the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], the galaxy filament in which the Milky Way resides. It is about 1 billion light-years across. That same year, an unusually large region with a much lower than average distribution of galaxies was discovered, the [[Giant Void]], which measures 1.3 billion light-years across. Based on [[redshift survey]] data, in 1989 [[Margaret Geller]] and [[John Huchra]] discovered the "[[CfA2 Great Wall|Great Wall]]",&lt;ref name="redshift"&gt;{{cite journal |author= M. J. Geller |author2=J. P.

The existence of this structure escaped notice for so long because it requires locating the position of galaxies in three dimensions, which involves combining location information about the galaxies with distance information from [[redshift]]s.
Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E. Campusano discovered the [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], a [[large quasar group]] measuring two billion light-years at its widest point which was the largest known structure in the universe at the time of its announcement. In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the [[Sloan Great Wall]]. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12546-biggest-void-in-space-is-1-billion-light-years-across.html Biggest void in space is 1 billion light years across – space – 24 August 2007 – New Scientist]. Space.newscientist.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; It coincides with the '[[CMB cold spot]]', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the cold spot, but to do so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost as big as the Giant Void mentioned above.
[[File:Large-scale structure of light distribution in the universe.jpg|thumb|Computer simulated image of an area of space more than 50 million light-years across, presenting a possible large-scale distribution of light sources in the universe—precise relative contributions of galaxies and quasars are unclear.]]
Another large-scale structure is the [[SSA22 Protocluster]], a collection of galaxies and enormous gas bubbles that measures about 200 million light-years across.

In 2011, a large quasar group was discovered, [[U1.11]], measuring about 2.5 billion light-years across. On January 11, 2013, another large quasar group, the [[Huge-LQG]], was discovered, which was measured to be four billion light-years across, the largest known structure in the universe at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wall | first = Mike | url = http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/01/11/largest-structure-in-universe-discovered/ | title = Largest structure in universe discovered | date = 2013-01-11 | publisher = [[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, astronomers discovered the [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]],&lt;ref name=2014paper&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horváth |first1=I |last2=Hakkila |first2=Jon |last3=Bagoly |first3=Z. | title = Possible structure in the GRB sky distribution at redshift two | date = 2014 |arxiv=1401.0533 |bibcode=2014A&amp;A...561L..12H |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201323020 |volume=561 |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |pages=L12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite arXiv |last = Horvath |first = I. |last2= Hakkila |first2=J. |last3=Bagoly |first3=Z. |title = The largest structure of the Universe, defined by Gamma-Ray Bursts |date = 2013 |eprint=1311.1104 |class=astro-ph.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; an even bigger structure twice as large as the former.

===End of Greatness===
The ''End of Greatness'' is an observational scale discovered at roughly 100&amp;nbsp;[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] (roughly 300 million light-years) where the lumpiness seen in the large-scale structure of the [[universe]] is [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogenized]] and [[isotropic|isotropized]] in accordance with the [[Cosmological Principle]].&lt;ref name=Kirshner /&gt; At this scale, no pseudo-random [[fractal]]ness is apparent.&lt;ref&gt;LiveScience.com, [https://news.yahoo.com/universe-isnt-fractal-study-finds-215053937.html "The Universe Isn't a Fractal, Study Finds"], Natalie Wolchover,22 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] seen in smaller surveys are [[random]]ized to the extent that the smooth distribution of the universe is visually apparent. It was not until the [[redshift survey]]s of the 1990s were completed that this scale could accurately be observed.&lt;ref name=Kirshner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Extravagant Universe: Exploding Stars, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Cosmos |author=Robert P Kirshner |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qQ_mV2prqNYC&amp;pg=PA71 |page=71 |isbn=0-691-05862-8 |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observations===
[[File:2MASS LSS chart-NEW Nasa.jpg|right|399px|thumb|"Panoramic view of the entire near-infrared sky reveals the distribution of galaxies beyond the [[Milky Way]]. The image is derived from the [[2MASS|2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC)]]—more than 1.5 million galaxies, and the Point Source Catalog (PSC)—nearly 0.5 billion Milky Way stars. The galaxies are color-coded by '[[redshift]]' obtained from the [[Uppsala General Catalogue|UGC]], [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|CfA]], Tully NBGC, LCRS, [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dF]], 6dFGS, and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] surveys (and from various observations compiled by the [[NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database|NASA Extragalactic Database]]), or photo-metrically deduced from the [[K band (infrared)|K band]] (2.2 μm).

The map is projected with an equal area Aitoff in the Galactic system (Milky Way at center)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Large Scale Structure in the Local Universe: The 2MASS Galaxy Catalog |last=1Jarrett |first1=T.

Another indicator of large-scale structure is the '[[Lyman-alpha forest]]'. This is a collection of [[Spectral line|absorption lines]] that appear in the spectra of light from [[quasar]]s, which are interpreted as indicating the existence of huge thin sheets of intergalactic (mostly [[hydrogen]]) gas. These sheets appear to be associated with the formation of new galaxies.

Caution is required in describing structures on a cosmic scale because things are often different from how they appear. [[Gravitational lens]]ing (bending of light by gravitation) can make an image appear to originate in a different direction from its real source. This is caused when foreground objects (such as galaxies) curve surrounding spacetime (as predicted by [[general relativity]]), and deflect passing light rays. Rather usefully, strong gravitational lensing can sometimes magnify distant galaxies, making them easier to detect. [[Weak Gravitational Lensing|Weak lensing]] (gravitational shear) by the intervening universe in general also subtly changes the observed large-scale structure. 

The large-scale structure of the universe also looks different if one only uses [[redshift]] to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it, and so fall towards it, and so are slightly blueshifted (compared to how they would be if there were no cluster) On the near side, things are slightly redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster looks a bit squashed if using redshifts to measure distance. An opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a "''[[Redshift-space distortions|finger of God]]''"—the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the Earth.

===Cosmography of Earth's cosmic neighborhood===
At the centre of the [[Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster]], a gravitational anomaly called the [[Great Attractor]] affects the motion of galaxies over a region hundreds of millions of light-years across. These galaxies are all [[redshift]]ed, in accordance with [[Hubble's law]]. This indicates that they are receding from us and from each other, but the variations in their redshift are sufficient to reveal the existence of a concentration of mass equivalent to tens of thousands of galaxies.

The Great Attractor, discovered in 1986, lies at a distance of between 150 million and 250 million light-years (250 million is the most recent estimate), in the direction of the [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] and [[Centaurus]] [[constellation]]s. In its vicinity there is a preponderance of large old galaxies, many of which are colliding with their neighbours, or radiating large amounts of radio waves.

In 1987, [[astronomer]] [[R. Brent Tully]] of the [[University of Hawaii]]'s Institute of Astronomy identified what he called the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], a structure one billion [[light-year]]s long and 150 million light-years across in which, he claimed, the Local Supercluster was embedded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/science/massive-clusters-of-galaxies-defy-concepts-of-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all Massive Clusters of Galaxies Defy Concepts of the Universe N.Y.

==Mass of ordinary matter==
The mass of the observable universe is often quoted as 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes or 10&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt; kg.&lt;ref name="Paul Davies 2006 43"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, mass refers to ordinary matter and includes the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) and the [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM). However, it excludes [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. This quoted value for the mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be estimated based on critical density. The calculations are for the observable universe only as the volume of the whole is unknown and may be infinite.
===Estimates based on critical density===
Critical density is the energy density for which the universe is flat.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter]].&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no dark energy, it is also the [[density]] for which the expansion of the universe is poised between continued expansion and collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Parallel Worlds| url= https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_4_8?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=parallel+worlds&amp;sprefix=Parallel%2Cstripbooks%2C271| accessdate=1 July 2013 |date=2005|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3372-0|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Friedmann equations]], the value for &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt; critical density, is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard F. Schutz|title=Gravity from the ground up|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEZNXvYwyNwC&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45506-0|pages=361–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_c = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and H = ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the present value of the [[Hubble constant]]. The current value for ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', due to the European Space Agency's Planck Telescope, is ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 67.15 kilometers per second per mega parsec. This gives a critical density of {{val|0.85|e=-26|u=kg/m3}} (commonly quoted as about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter). This density includes four significant types of energy/mass: ordinary matter (4.8%), neutrinos (0.1%), [[cold dark matter]] (26.8%), and [[dark energy]] (68.3%).&lt;ref name='planck_cosmological_parameters'&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv=1303.5076 | title=Planck 2013 results.

The density of ordinary matter, as measured by Planck, is 4.8% of the total critical density or {{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}. To convert this density to mass we must multiply by volume, a value based on the radius of the "observable universe". Since the universe has been expanding for 13.8 billion years, the [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving distance]] (radius) is now about 46.6 billion light-years. Thus, volume ({{sfrac|4|3}}''πr''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) equals {{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}} and the mass of ordinary matter equals density ({{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}) times volume ({{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}}) or {{val|1.46|e=53|u=kg}}.

{{Main|Abundance of the chemical elements}}
Assuming the mass of ordinary matter is about {{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} (refer to previous section) and assuming all atoms are [[hydrogen atom]]s (which in reality make up about 74% of all atoms in our galaxy by mass, see [[Abundance of the chemical elements]]), calculating the estimated total number of atoms in the observable universe is straightforward. Divide the mass of ordinary matter by the mass of a hydrogen atom ({{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} divided by {{val|1.67|e=-27|u=kg}}). The result is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; hydrogen atoms.

The most distant [[astronomical object]] yet announced as of 2016 is a galaxy classified [[GN-z11]]. In 2009, a [[gamma ray burst]], [[GRB 090423]], was found to have a [[redshift]] of 8.2, which indicates that the collapsing star that caused it exploded when the universe was only 630 million years old.&lt;ref name="NASAGRB"&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/28apr_grbsmash/ New Gamma-Ray Burst Smashes Cosmic Distance Record – NASA Science].

==Horizons==
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
The limit of observability in our universe is set by a set of cosmological horizons which limit—based on various physical constraints—the extent to which we can obtain information about various events in the universe. The most famous horizon is the [[particle horizon]] which sets a limit on the precise distance that can be seen due to the finite [[age of the universe]]. Additional horizons are associated with the possible future extent of observations (larger than the particle horizon owing to the [[expansion of space]]), an "optical horizon" at the [[Cosmic microwave background|surface of last scattering]], and associated horizons with the surface of last scattering for [[cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos]] and [[gravitational wave background|gravitational waves]].

The '''Orapa Power Station''' is a [[Peaking power plant|Peak load power generation plant]] located in the mining town of [[Orapa]] in northeastern [[Botswana]] in the [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=587&amp;dir=2011/October/Monday10/|title=Mmegi Online :: Orapa power plant to be finally launched|work=Mmegi Online|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is built within the [[Debswana|Debswana Diamond Company Ltd]] [[Orapa diamond mine]] [[lease|fenced leased area]] and is operated by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]].


==Background==
The plant construction was initiated when [[Botswana]] started experiencing electricity supply challenges from year '''2007''' when demand for electricity in the [[country]] started exceeding the county's electricity generation capacity leading to forced periodic nation wide [[Rolling_blackout|load shedding]] excises by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]]. The plant was a short term response to the mining industry electricity requirements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=5796&amp;dir=2010/October/Friday22 Developers of Orapa's 90MW push for 60 % cost reduction]&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the development of Mmamabula and Morupule B power stations.

The plant site is located next to an [[electrical substation]] through which it connects to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] and was designed to use either [[natural gas]] or [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] as [[fuel]]. It was commissioned using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] with a planned conversion to [[natural gas]] once construction of a [[Pipeline transport|gas pipeline]] from nearby [[Coalbed methane|gas fields]] was complete and commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaystandard.info/kalahari-energy-convert-diesel-orapa-power-plant-cbm-operation Kalahari Energy to convert diesel Orapa Power Plant to CBM operation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
The plant consists of two 45MW [[GE LM6000]] Sprint [[Simple_cycle_combustion_turbine|Simple Cycle]] [[gas turbines]] fueled using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaystandard.info/bpc-gets-orapa-90mw-power-station|title=BPC gets Orapa 90MW Power Station {{!}} Sunday Standard|website=www.sundaystandard.info|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy produced is transferred to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] via the interconnected Orapa Substation by use of two short [[Electric power transmission|132kV overhead power lines]].

The existence, properties, and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular [[physical cosmology|cosmological model]].

==Conformal time and the particle horizon==
In terms of [[comoving distance]], the particle horizon is equal to the '''conformal time''' &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; that has passed since the [[Big Bang]], times the [[speed of light]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. In general, the conformal time at a certain time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \int_{0}^{t} \frac{dt'}{a(t')},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], and we have taken the Big Bang to be at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;. By convention, a subscript 0 indicates "today" so that the conformal time today &lt;math&gt;\eta(t_0) = \eta_0 = 1.48 \times 10^{18}\text{ s}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the conformal time is not the [[age of the universe]]. Rather, the conformal time is the amount of time it would take a photon to travel from where we are located to the furthest observable distance provided the universe ceased expanding. As such, &lt;math&gt;\eta_0&lt;/math&gt; is not a physically meaningful time (this much time has not yet actually passed), though, as we will see, the particle horizon with which it is associated is a conceptually meaningful distance.

The particle horizon recedes constantly as time passes and the conformal time grows. As such, the observed size of the universe always increases.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Paul Hobson|author2=George Efstathiou|author3=Anthony N.

==Evolution of the particle horizon==

In this section we consider the [[FLRW]] cosmological model. In that context, the universe can be approximated as composed by non-interacting constituents, each one being a perfect fluid with density &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt;, partial pressure &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and state equation &lt;math&gt;p_i=\omega_i \rho_i&lt;/math&gt;, such that they add up to the total density  &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and total pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* Hubble function   &lt;math&gt;H=\frac{\dot a}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
* The critical density   &lt;math&gt;\rho_c=\frac{3}{8\pi}H^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; H(z)=H_0\sqrt{\sum \Omega_{i0}(1+z)^{n_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_i=3(1+\omega_i)&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the addition ranges over all possible partial constituents and in particular there can be countably infinitely many. With this notation we have:&lt;ref name="Evolution2" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{The particle horizon } H_p \text{ exists if and only if } N&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the largest &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; (possibly infinite). The evolution of the particle horizon for an expanding universe (&lt;math&gt;\dot{a}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;) is:&lt;ref name="Evolution2" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dH_p}{dt}=H_p(z)H(z)+c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light and can be taken to be &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; (natural units). Notice that the derivative is made with respect to the FLRW-time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, while the functions are evaluated at the redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; which are related as stated before. We have an analogous but slightly different result for [[event horizon]].

==Horizon problem==
{{main|Horizon problem}}
The concept of a particle horizon can be used to illustrate the famous horizon problem, which is an unresolved issue associated with the [[Big Bang]] model. Extrapolating back to the time of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] when the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) was emitted, we obtain a particle horizon of about

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; H_p(t_\text{CMB}) = c\eta_\text{CMB} = 284\text{ Mpc} = 8.9 \times 10^{-3} H_p(t_0) &lt;/math&gt;}}

which corresponds to a proper size at that time of:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; a_\text{CMB}H_p(t_\text{CMB}) = 261\text{ kpc} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Since we observe the CMB to be emitted essentially from our particle horizon (&lt;math&gt;284\text{ Mpc} \ll 14.4\text{ Gpc}&lt;/math&gt;), our expectation is that parts of the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) that are separated by about a fraction of a [[great circle]] across the sky of

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{H_p(t_\text{CMB})}{H_p(t_0)}&lt;/math&gt;}}

(an [[angular size]] of &lt;math&gt;\theta \sim 1.7^\circ&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmic Microwave Background Temperature Power Spectrum|url=http://www.roe.ac.uk/ifa/postgrad/pedagogy/2006_tojeiro.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; should be out of [[causal contact]] with each other. That the entire CMB is in [[thermal equilibrium]] and approximates a [[blackbody]] so well is therefore not explained by the standard explanations about the way the [[expansion of the universe]] proceeds. The most popular resolution to this problem is [[cosmic inflation]].

'''Patterns in nature''' are visible regularities of form found in the natural world. These [[patterns]] recur in different contexts and can sometimes be [[modelled mathematically]]. Natural patterns include [[symmetries]], [[trees]], [[spirals]], [[meanders]], [[wave]]s, [[foams]], [[tessellations]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=3}} Early [[Greek philosophers]] studied pattern, with [[Plato]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Empedocles]] attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.

In the 19th century, Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] examined [[soap film]]s, leading him to formulate the concept of a [[minimal surface]]. German biologist and artist [[Ernst Haeckel]] painted hundreds of [[Marine biology|marine organisms]] to emphasise their [[symmetry]]. Scottish biologist [[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician [[Alan Turing]] predicted mechanisms of [[morphogenesis]] which give rise to [[Turing patterns|patterns]] of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] and French American mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] showed how the mathematics of [[fractals]] could create plant growth patterns.

[[Mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] can explain patterns in nature at different levels. Patterns in living things are explained by the [[biology|biological]] processes of [[natural selection]] and [[sexual selection]]. Studies of [[pattern formation]] make use of [[computer models]] to simulate a wide range of patterns.

==History==
[[File:Cycas circinalis male cone in Olomouc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fibonacci]] patterns occur widely in plant structures, including this cone of queen sago, ''[[Cycas circinalis]]'']]

Early Greek philosophers attempted to explain order in [[nature]], anticipating modern concepts. [[Plato]] (c. 427 – c. 347 BC) — looking only at his work on natural patterns — argued for the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. He considered these to consist of [[Theory of Forms|ideal forms]] ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}} ''eidos'': "form") of which physical objects are never more than imperfect copies. Thus, a flower may be roughly circular, but it is never a perfect mathematical circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/ | title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher=Stanford University | work=Platonism in Metaphysics | origyear=2004 | date=7 April 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2012 | author=Balaguer, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pythagoras]] explained patterns in nature like the harmonies of music as arising from number, which he took to be the basic constituent of existence.&lt;ref&gt;The so-called Pythagoreans, who were the first to take up mathematics, not only advanced this subject, but saturated with it, they fancied that the principles of mathematics were the principles of all things. [[Aristotle]], ''Metaphysics 1–5 '', cc. 350 BC&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empedocles]] to an extent anticipated [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s evolutionary explanation for the structures of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle reports Empedocles arguing that, "[w]herever, then, everything turned out as it would have if it were happening for a purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way; but where this did not happen, the creatures perished." ''The Physics'', B8, 198b29 in Kirk, et al., 304).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1202, [[Fibonacci|Leonardo Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 – c. 1250) introduced the Fibonacci number sequence to the western world with his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Parmanand. ''Acharya Hemachandra and the (so called) Fibonacci Numbers''. Math. Ed. Siwan, 20(1):28–30, 1986. {{issn|0047-6269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibonacci gave an (unrealistic) biological example, on the growth in numbers of a theoretical [[rabbit]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Knott | first = Ron | title = Fibonacci's Rabbits | url=http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat.html#Rabbits | publisher =[[University of Surrey]] Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1658, the English physician and philosopher [[Sir Thomas Browne]] discussed "how Nature Geometrizeth" in ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'', citing [[Pythagorean numerology]] involving the number 5, and the [[Platonic form]] of the [[quincunx]] pattern. The discourse's central chapter features examples and observations of the [[quincunx]] in botany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Browne, Thomas |authorlink=Sir Thomas Browne |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/gardennoframes/garden3.html |title=How Nature Geometrizeth |work=[[The Garden of Cyrus]] |date=1658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (1860–1948) published his book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. His description of [[phyllotaxis]] and the [[Fibonacci sequence]], the mathematical relationships in the spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of [[animal horn]]s and [[mollusc shell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darcythompson.org/about.html About D'Arcy]. D' Arcy 150. [[University of Dundee]] and the [[University of St Andrews]]. Retrieved 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] (1801–1883) formulated the [[Plateau's problem|mathematical problem]] of the existence of a [[minimal surface]] with a given boundary, which is now named after him. He studied soap films intensively, formulating [[Plateau's laws]] which describe the structures formed by films in foams.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

The German psychologist [[Adolf Zeising]] (1810–1876) claimed that the [[golden ratio]] was expressed in the arrangement of plant parts, in the [[skeleton]]s of animals and the branching patterns of their veins and nerves, as well as in the geometry of [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Proportion | author=Padovan, Richard | authorlink=Richard Padovan | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | date=1999 | isbn=978-0-419-22780-9 | pages=305–306 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vk_CQULdAssC&amp;pg=PA306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nexus Network Journal | first=Richard | last=Padovan | authorlink=Richard Padovan | title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture | volume=4 | pages=113–122 | doi=10.1007/s00004-001-0008-7 | date=2002 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Adolf | last=Zeising | title=Neue Lehre van den Proportionen des meschlischen Körpers |date=1854 | page=preface | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) painted beautiful illustrations of marine organisms, in particular [[Radiolaria]], emphasising their [[symmetry]] to support his faux-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] theories of evolution.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=41}}

The American photographer [[Wilson Bentley]] (1865–1931) took the first micrograph of a [[snowflake]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography | volume=1 | first=John | last=Hannavy | publisher=CRC Press | date=2007 | isbn=978-0-415-97235-2 | page=149 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=PJ8DHBay4_EC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=wilson+bentley+january+15#v=onepage&amp;q=wilson%20bentley%20january%2015&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drcy.svg|thumb|[[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth and form in his 1917 book]]
In 1952, [[Alan Turing]] (1912–1954), better known for his work on computing and [[codebreaking]], wrote ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'', an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Turing | first= A. M. | authorlink=Alan Turing | title = The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | volume = 237 | pages = 37–72 | date = 1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | issue= 641| bibcode = 1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted [[Chemical clock|oscillating]] [[chemical reaction]]s, in particular the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]]. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns (dubbed "[[Turing pattern]]s") of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 247–250}}

In 1968, the Hungarian theoretical biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] (1925–1989) developed the [[L-system]], a [[formal grammar]] which can be used to model [[plant development|plant growth patterns]] in the style of [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref name=L&gt;[[Rozenberg, Grzegorz]]; Salomaa, Arto. ''The Mathematical Theory of L Systems''. [[Academic Press]], New York, 1980. {{isbn|0-12-597140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; L-systems have an [[alphabet]] of symbols that can be combined using [[Formal grammar|production rules]] to build larger strings of symbols, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. In 1975, after centuries of slow development of the mathematics of patterns by [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Helge von Koch]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and others, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] wrote a famous paper, ''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension]]'', crystallising mathematical thought into the concept of the [[fractal]].&lt;ref name=Mandelbrot/&gt;

==Causes==

Living things like [[orchid]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, and the [[Structural coloration|peacock's tail]] have abstract designs with a beauty of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match.&lt;ref name=ForbesGuardian&gt;Forbes, Peter. ''All that useless beauty''. The Guardian. Review: Non-fiction. 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty that people perceive in nature has causes at different levels, notably in the mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among living things in the effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=222}}

[[Mathematics]] seeks to discover and explain abstract patterns or regularities of all kinds.&lt;ref name=Steen&gt;[[Lynn Steen|Steen, L.A.]]. ''The Science of Patterns''.

''Mathematics: The Science of Patterns: The Search for Order in Life, Mind and the Universe'' (Scientific American Paperback Library) 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
Visual patterns in nature find explanations in [[chaos theory]], fractals, logarithmic spirals, topology and other mathematical patterns. For example, [[L-system]]s form convincing models of different patterns of tree growth.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;
[[File:Dragon trees.jpg|thumb|The growth patterns of certain trees resemble these [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals.]]

The laws of [[physics]] apply the abstractions of mathematics to the real world, often as if it were [[perfection#Physics and chemistry|perfect]]. For example, a [[crystal]] is perfect when it has no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz, Władysław]]. ''Perfection in the Sciences. II. Perfection in Physics and Chemistry'', Dialectics and Humanism, vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Visible patterns in nature are governed by [[physical law]]s; for example, [[meander]]s can be explained using [[fluid dynamics]].

In [[biology]], [[natural selection]] can cause the development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including [[camouflage]],&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]].

=== Symmetry ===

{{further|Symmetry in biology|Floral symmetry|Crystal symmetry}}

[[Symmetry]] is pervasive in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as do the leaves of plants and some flowers such as [[orchid]]s.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=48–49}} Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as [[sea anemone]]s. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], the group that includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=64–65}}

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]; each flake's structure forms a record of the varying conditions during its crystallization, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=52}} [[Crystal]]s in general have a variety of symmetries and [[crystal habit]]s; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=82–84}} Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things, including the crown-shaped [[Splash (fluid mechanics)|splash]] pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond,{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=60}} and both the [[spheroidal]] shape and rings of a [[planet]] like [[Saturn]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=71}}

Symmetry has a variety of causes. Radial symmetry suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs ([[cephalisation]]), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biocongroup.eu/DA/Calendario_files/Bilateria.pdf | title=Animal Diversity | edition=Third | publisher=McGraw-Hill | work=Chapter 8: Acoelomate Bilateral Animals | date=2002 | accessdate=October 25, 2012 | author=Hickman, Cleveland P. | author2=Roberts, Larry S. | author3=Larson, Allan | pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; More puzzling is the reason for the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=4500143 | title=Ontogeny in the fossil record: diversification of body plans and the evolution of "aberrant" symmetry in Paleozoic echinoderms | author=Sumrall, Colin D. | author2=Wray, Gregory A. | journal=Paleobiology |date=January 2007 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=149–163 |doi=10.1666/06053.1}} &lt;!--http://www.psjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1666/06053.1--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trees, fractals ===

[[Fractal]]s are infinitely [[self-similarity|self-similar]], iterated mathematical constructs having [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, Benoît B. | title=The fractal geometry of nature| date=1983 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Falconer | first = Kenneth | authorlink=Kenneth Falconer (mathematician) | title = Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications | publisher = John Wiley | date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns"&gt;{{Cite book | title=Fractals:The Patterns of Chaos | last=Briggs | first=John | authorlink= |date= 1992|publisher= Thames and Hudson |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinite [[iteration]] is not possible in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of [[fern]]s and [[umbellifer]]s (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including [[bryozoa]], [[coral]]s, [[hydrozoa]] like the [[air fern]], ''Sertularia argentea'', and in non-living things, notably [[electrical discharge]]s. [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying a small number of parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points ([[Internode (botany)|internode]] length), and number of branches per branch point.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;

=== Spirals ===
{{further|phyllotaxis}}

[[Spirals]] are common in plants and in some animals, notably [[molluscs]]. For example, in the [[nautilus]], a cephalopod mollusc, each [[Camera (cephalopod)|chamber]] of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a [[logarithmic spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;Maor, Eli. ''e: The Story of a Number''. Princeton University Press, 2009. Page 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral can be seen as a special case of self-similarity.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=29–32}}

Plant spirals can be seen in [[phyllotaxis]], the arrangement of leaves on a stem, and in the arrangement ([[parastichy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526030701/http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=26 May 2010 | title=Spiral Lattices &amp; Parastichy | publisher=Smith College | accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of other parts as in [[compositae|composite]] [[flower|flower heads]] and [[seed|seed heads]] like the [[sunflower]] or [[fruit]] structures like the [[pineapple]]&lt;ref name=Kappraff&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/1904/19040335.pdf | title=Growth in Plants: A Study in Number | author=Kappraff, Jay | journal=Forma | date=2004 | volume=19 | pages=335–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|337}} and [[salak|snake fruit]], as well as in the pattern of scales in [[pine cones]], where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise. These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=13}} Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from [[Fibonacci]] ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In [[hazel]] the ratio is 1/3; in [[apricot]] it is 2/5; in [[pear]] it is 3/8; in [[almond]] it is 5/13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to geometry|first=H. S. M. |last=Coxeter|author-link =Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|publisher =Wiley|date=1961|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In disc phyllotaxis as in the [[sunflower]] and [[Bellis perennis|daisy]], the florets are arranged in [[Fermat's spiral]] with Fibonacci numbering, at least when the flowerhead is mature so all the elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the [[golden angle]], 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Prusinkiewicz | first =Przemyslaw | authorlink =Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz |author2=Lindenmayer, Aristid |authorlink2=Aristid Lindenmayer | title =The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants | publisher =Springer-Verlag | date =1990 | pages =101–107 | url =http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#webdocs | isbn = 978-0-387-97297-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy configurations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levitov LS |title=Energetic Approach to Phyllotaxis |journal=Europhys.

Phyllotaxis is controlled by [[protein]]s that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone [[auxin]], which activates [[meristem]] growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 249–250}} From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Kappraff/&gt;

=== Chaos, flow, meanders ===

In mathematics, a [[dynamical system]] is chaotic if it is (highly) sensitive to initial conditions (the so-called "[[butterfly effect]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz|first=Edward N. |authorlink=Edward Norton Lorenz |title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |date=March 1963 |volume=20|issue=2 |pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2| bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which requires the mathematical properties of [[topological mixing]] and [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |date=1999 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside fractals, [[chaos theory]] ranks as an essentially universal influence on patterns in nature. There is a relationship between chaos and fractals—the ''[[strange attractors]]'' in chaotic systems have a [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruelle, David. ''Chance and Chaos''. Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[cellular automata]], simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns, have chaotic behaviour, notably [[Stephen Wolfram]]'s [[Rule 30]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Stephen. ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''. Wolfram Media, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vortex street]]s are zigzagging patterns of whirling [[Vortex|vortices]] created by the unsteady [[flow separation|separation of flow]] of a [[fluid]], most often air or water, over obstructing objects.&lt;ref&gt;von Kármán, Theodore. ''Aerodynamics''. McGraw-Hill (1963): {{isbn|978-0070676022}}. Dover (1994): {{isbn|978-0486434858}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth ([[Laminar flow|laminar]]) flow starts to break up when the size of the obstruction or the velocity of the flow become large enough compared to the [[viscosity]] of the fluid.

[[Meander]]s are sinuous bends in rivers or other channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As soon as the path is slightly curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as [[helical flow]] drags material like sand and gravel across the river to the inside of the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so [[erosion]] accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful [[positive feedback loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Lewalle | title=Lecture Notes in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics: Phenomenology, Concepts and Analytical Tools | chapter=Flow Separation and Secondary Flow: Section 9.1 | url=http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | date=2006 | location=Syracuse, NY | publisher=Syracuse University | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075022/http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-29 | df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waves, dunes ===

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind wave]]s are sea [[surface wave]]s that create the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | date=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}&lt;/ref&gt; As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of ripples. When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create [[dune]]s, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the [[Taklamakan]] desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/ | title=Types of Dunes | publisher=USGS | date=29 October 1997 | accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barchan]]s or crescent dunes are produced by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the [[slip face]] point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the [[angle of repose]] of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand [[avalanche]]s, which is a [[nonlinear]] behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then the addition of a further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;Strahler, A. &amp; Archibold, O.W. ''Physical Geography: Science and Systems of the Human Environment''. John Wiley, 4th edition 2008. Page 442.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like [[soliton|solitary waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schwämmle, V. | author2=Herrman, H.J. | title=Solitary wave behaviour of sand dunes| journal=Nature | volume=426 | issue=Dec. 11 | date=2003 | pages=619–620 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/426619a Abstract] | doi=10.1038/426619a | pmid=14668849|bibcode = 2003Natur.426..619S }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bubbles, foam===

A [[soap bubble]] forms a [[sphere]], a [[minimal surface|surface with minimal area]] — the smallest possible surface area for the volume enclosed. Two bubbles together form a more complex shape: the outer surfaces of both bubbles are spherical; these surfaces are joined by a third spherical surface as the smaller bubble bulges slightly into the larger one.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

A [[foam]] is a mass of bubbles; foams of different materials occur in nature. Foams composed of [[soap film]]s obey [[Plateau's laws]], which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant [[mean curvature|average curvature]] at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back).{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=68}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and [[Jean E. Taylor]], ''The geometry of soap films and soap bubbles'', Scientific American, vol. 235, pp. 82–93, July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. [[Lord Kelvin]] identified the problem of the most efficient way to pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the [[bitruncated cubic honeycomb]] with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]]; the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] adapted the structure for their outer wall in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=73–76}}

At the scale of living [[cell (biology)|cells]], foam patterns are common; [[radiolarian]]s, [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s, [[silicoflagellate]] [[exoskeleton]]s and the calcite skeleton of a [[sea urchin]], ''[[Cidaris rugosa]]'', all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=96–101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artfeb05/cbdiatoms.html | title=Geometry and Pattern in Nature 3: The holes in radiolarian and diatom tests | publisher=Microscopy-UK | date=February 2005 | accessdate=May 28, 2012 | author=Brodie, Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skeleton of the [[Radiolarian]], ''Aulonia hexagona'', a beautiful marine form drawn by [[Ernst Haeckel]], looks as if it is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The [[Euler characteristic]] states that for any [[convex polyhedron]], the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a [[Euler characteristic#Soccer ball|soccer ball]], [[Buckminster Fuller]] [[geodesic dome]], or [[fullerene]] molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=51–54}}

=== Tessellations ===
{{main|tessellation}}

[[Tessellation]]s are patterns formed by repeating [[tile]]s all over a flat surface. There are 17 [[wallpaper group]]s of tilings.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;{{cite book | last=Armstrong | first=M.A. | title=Groups and Symmetry | date=1988 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; While common in art and design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social [[wasp]]s, and the wax cells in [[honeycomb]] built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the [[pangolin]], or fruits like the [[salak]] are protected by overlapping scales or [[osteoderms]], these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, ''[[Fritillaria meleagris]]'', have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of [[minerals]] provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite the hundreds of thousands of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a [[crystal]], defined by [[crystal structure]], [[crystal system]], and [[point group]]; for example, there are exactly 14 [[Bravais lattices]] for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"&gt;Hook, J.R.; Hall, H.E.

=== Cracks ===

[[Fracture|Cracks]] are linear openings that form in materials to relieve [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]. When an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks meet at a node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress in the same direction would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=207}} In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=208}}

===Spots, stripes===

Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; angelfish and zebras are striped.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}} These patterns have an [[evolution]]ary explanation: they have [[Function (biology)|functions]] which increase the chances that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is [[camouflage]];&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4/&gt; for instance, a [[leopard]] that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is [[Signalling theory|signalling]]&lt;ref name=Wickler/&gt; — for instance, a [[ladybird]] is less likely to be attacked by [[predator]]y birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also [[Aposematism|distastefully bitter or poisonous]], or [[Mimicry|mimics]] other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting [[gene]]s that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}}

===Pattern formation===
{{main|Pattern formation}}

Alan Turing,&lt;ref name=Turing/&gt; and later the mathematical biologist [[James D. Murray|James Murray]],&lt;ref name="Murray2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James D.|title=Mathematical Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3LmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-08539-4|pages=436–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a [[reaction-diffusion]] system.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}} The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a [[morphogen]], resulting in the growth of a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be [[feedback]] control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create [[standing wave]] patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a [[chemical oscillator]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}}

Later research has managed to create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=168–180}} [[Richard Prum]]'s activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables to account for the observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array of dots.{{sfn|Rothenberg|2011|pages=93–95}}&lt;ref name=Prum/&gt;{{rp|6}} More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl ''[[Numida meleagris]]'' in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.&lt;ref name=Prum&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.yale.edu/eeb/prum/pdf/Prum%20&amp;%20Williamson%202002.pdf | title=Reaction–diffusion models of within-feather pigmentation patterning | author=Prum, Richard O. |author1link=Richard Prum | author2=Williamson, Scott | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | date=2002 | volume=269 | issue=1493 | pages=781–792 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1896| pmid=11958709 | pmc=1690965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

Patterns can form for other reasons in the [[patterned vegetation|vegetated landscape]] of [[tiger bush]]&lt;ref name=TigerBush&gt;{{cite book | title=Banded vegetation patterning in arid and semiarid environments | publisher=Springer-Verlag | author=Tongway, D.J. | author2=Valentin, C. | author3=Seghieri, J. | last-author-amp=yes | date=2001 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fir wave]]s.&lt;ref name=FirWave&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tiee.esa.org/vol/v1/figure_sets/disturb/disturb_back4.html | title=Fir Waves: Regeneration in New England Conifer Forests | publisher=TIEE | date=22 February 2004 | accessdate=26 May 2012 | author=D'Avanzo, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it.&lt;ref name=TigerBush/&gt; Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees.&lt;ref name=FirWave/&gt; Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the [[Mima mounds]] of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of [[pocket gopher]]s,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |last=Morelle |first=Rebecca |title=‘Digital gophers’ solve Mima mound mystery |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25259133 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the so-called [[fairy circle]]s of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sample|first1=Ian|title=The secret of Namibia's 'fairy circles' may be explained at last|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/18/the-secret-of-namibias-fairy-circles-may-be-explained-at-last|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In permafrost soils with an active upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, [[patterned ground]] can form, creating circles, nets, [[ice wedge]] polygons, steps, and stripes. [[Thermal contraction]] causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Permafrost: Patterned Ground |url=http://permafrosttunnel.crrel.usace.army.mil/permafrost/patterned_ground.html |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gyrification|fissured pattern]] that develops on vertebrate brains are caused by a physical process of constrained expansion dependent on two geometric parameters: relative tangential cortical expansion and relative thickness of the [[cerebellar cortex|cortex]]. Similar patterns of [[Gyrus|gyri]] (peaks) and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] (troughs) have been demonstrated in models of the brain starting from smooth, layered gels, with the patterns caused by compressive mechanical forces resulting from the expansion of the outer layer (representing the cortex) after the addition of a solvent. Numerical models in computer simulations support natural and experimental observations that the surface folding patterns increase in larger brains.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-brain-s-bizarre-folding-pattern-re-created-in-a-vat/|last1=Ghose|first1=Tia|title=Human Brain's Bizarre Folding Pattern Re-Created in a Vat|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tallinen|first1=Tuoma|last2=Chung|first2=Jun Young|last3=Biggins|first3= John S.|last4=Mahadevan|first4=L.|title=Gyrification from constrained cortical expansion|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=35|pages=12667–12672|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion]] and [[esotericism]], the term "'''physical universe'''" or "'''material universe'''" is used to distinguish the [[nature|physical]] [[matter]] of the [[universe]] from a proposed [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[supernatural]] essence. 

In the [[Book of Veles]], and perhaps in traditional [[Slavic mythology]], the physical universe is referred to as [[Jav, Prav and Nav|Yav]]. [[Gnosticism]] holds that the physical universe was created by a [[Demiurge]]. In [[Dharmic religion]]s [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] is believed to be the illusion of a physical universe.

[[Physicalism]], a type of [[monism]], holds that only physical things exist. This is also known as [[metaphysical naturalism]].

'''Physis''' (Greek: {{lang|grc|φύσις|italic=yes}} ''phusis'') is a Greek [[theology|theological]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], and [[science|scientific]] term usually translated into English as "[[nature (philosophy)|nature]]".

The term is central to [[Greek philosophy]], and as a consequence to [[Western philosophy]] as a whole.
In [[pre-Socratic]] usage, ''phusis'' contrasted with {{lang|grc|νόμος}} ''nomos'' "law, human convention"
Since  [[Aristotle]], however, the ''physical'' (the subject matter of ''[[physics]]'', properly  {{lang|grc|τὰ φυσικά}} "natural things") has more typically  been juxtaposed to the ''[[metaphysics|metaphysical]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in Aristotle's works so titled, ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' "Physis, translated since the Third Century B.C. usually as "nature" and less frequently as "essence", means one thing for the presocratic philosophers and quite another thing for Plato." Welch, Kathleen Ethel. "Keywords from Classical Rhetoric: The Example of Physis." Rhetoric Society Quarterly 17.2 (1987): 193-204. Print.
The Pontifical Academy of Sciences. ''Evolving Concepts of Nature''. Proceedings of the Plenary Session, 24–28 October 2014, Acta 23, Vatican City, 2015. [http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/publications/acta/acta23.html link].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-socratic usage ==
The word φύσις is a verbal noun based on [[:wikt:φύω|φύω]] "to grow, to appear" ([[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰuH-|cognate]] with English "to be"). In [[Homeric Greek]] it is used quite literally, of the manner of growth of a particular species of plant.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302-3:  {{lang|grc|ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε}}. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]''  (ed. A.T. Murray).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[pre-Socratic philosophers|pre-Socratic]] philosophy, beginning with [[Heraclitus]], ''phusis'' in keeping with its etymology of "growing, becoming" is always used in the sense of the "natural" ''development'', although the focus might lie either with the origin, or the process, or the end result of the process. There is some evidence that by the 6th century BC, beginning with the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]], the word could also be used 
in the comprehensive sense, as referring to "''all'' things", as it were "Nature" in the sense of "[[Universe]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press, 2005, p. 3.
Guthrie, W. K. C., ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.{{page needed|date=December 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sophist]] tradition, the term stood in opposition to ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' ({{lang|grc|νόμος}}), "[[law]]" or "[[convention (norm)|custom]]", in the debate on which parts of human existence are natural, and which are due to convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunkie |first1=Roger |title=The Classical Origins of Western Culture: The Core Studies 1 Study Guide |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/studygde.htm |accessdate=30 January 2012 |series=Brooklyn College Core Curriculum Series |date=1986 |publisher=[[Brooklyn College]] |location=[[Brooklyn, NY]]  |chapter=Philosophical background of the 5th Century B.C. |chapterurl=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/sophists.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The contrast of ''phisis'' vs. ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' could be applied to any subject, much like the modern contrast of "[[nature vs. nurture]]".

== In Plato's Laws ==
In book 10 of ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', Plato criticizes those who write works ''peri phuseōs''. The criticism is that such authors tend to focus on a purely "naturalistic" explanation of the world, ignoring the role of "intention" or ''technē'', and thus becoming prone to the error of naive [[History_of_atheism#Classical_Greece_and_Rome|atheism]]. Plato accuses even [[Theogony|Hesiod]] of this, for the reason that the gods in Hesiod "grow" out of primordial entities after the physical universe had been established.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'' (2005), 1f.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Because those who use the term mean to say that nature is the first creative power; but if the soul turns out to be the primeval element, and not fire or air, then in the truest sense and beyond other things the soul may be said to exist ''by'' nature; and this would be true if you proved that the soul is older than the body, but not otherwise."
::— Plato's Laws, Book 10(892c) – ''translation by Benjamin Jowett''

== Aristotle ==
Aristotle sought out the definition of "physis" to prove that there was more than one definition of "physis", and more than one way to interpret nature. "Though Aristotle retains the ancient sense of "physis" as growth, he insists that an adequate definition of "physis" requires the different perspectives of the [[four causes]] (aitia): material, efficient, formal, and final."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed"&gt;Atwill, Janet. "The Interstices of Nature, Spontaneity, and Chance." Rhetoric Reclaimed: Aristotle and the Liberal Arts Tradition. Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1998. N. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that nature itself contained its own source of matter (material), power/motion (efficiency), form, and end (final). A unique feature about Aristotle's definition of "physis" was his relationship between art and nature. Aristotle said that "physis" (nature) is dependent on [[techne]] (art). "The critical distinction between art and nature concerns their different efficient causes: nature is its own source of motion, whereas techne always requires a source of motion outside itself."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed" /&gt; What Aristotle was trying to bring to light, was that art does not contain within itself its form or source of motion. Consider the process of an acorn becoming an oak tree. This is a natural process that has its own driving force behind it. There is no external force pushing this acorn to its final state, rather it is progressively developing towards one specific end ([[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]).


==Biblical usage==
Though φύσις was often used in Hellenistic philosophy, it is used only 14 times in the New Testament (10 of those in the writings of Paul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=[[William B.

Eerdmans Publishing Company|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of φύσις as referring to a "natural order" in ''Romans 1:26'' and ''1 Corinthians 11:14''  may have been influenced by [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Greek philosophers, including [[Aristotle]] and the Stoics are credited with distinguishing between man-made laws and a [[natural law]] of universal validity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World|date=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192801463.001.0001/acref-9780192801463-e-1250.|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Gerhard Kittel]] states that the Stoic philosophers were not able to combine the concepts of νόμος (law) and φύσις (nature) to produce the concept of "natural law" in the sense that was made possible by [[Judeo-Christian]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kittel|first1=Gerhard|title=Theological Dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=Eerdman's Publishing Company|location=Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline theology]] of [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] by [[Grace in Christianity|grace]], Paul writes in ''Ephesians 2:3'' that "we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by ''nature'' children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. In the next verse he writes, "by grace you have been saved." &lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Ephesians|2:3-2:4|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=Zondervan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in patristic theology ==
Theologians of the early Christian period differed in the usage of this term. In [[School of Antioch|Antiochene]] circles, it connoted the humanity or divinity of Christ conceived as a concrete set of characteristics or attributes. In [[Alexandrian School|Alexandrine]] thinking, it meant a concrete individual or independent existent and approximated to [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] without being a synonym.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' A&amp;C Black(1965) p.318&lt;/ref&gt;  While it refers to much the same thing as [[ousia]] it is more empirical and descriptive focussing on function while ousia is metaphysical and focuses more on reality.&lt;ref name="GiPT"&gt;Prestige, G.L. ''God in Patristic Thought'', SPCK (1964), p.234&lt;/ref&gt; Although found in the context of the [[Trinity|Trinitarian debate]], it is chiefly important in the [[Christology]] of [[Cyril of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="GiPT"/&gt;

== Modern usage ==
The Greek adjective ''phusikos'' is represented  in various forms in modern English:
As ''[[physics]]'' "the study of nature", as ''[[:wikt:physical|physical]]'' (via Middle Latin ''physicalis'') referring both to physics (the study of nature, the material universe) and to the [[human body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=physical |title=Physical |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[physiology]] (''physiologia'') is of 16th-century coinage ([[Jean Fernel]]). The term ''physique'', for "the bodily constitution of a person", is a 19th-century loan from French. 

In medicine the suffix ''-physis'' occurs in such compounds as ''[[symphysis]]'', ''[[epiphysis]]'', and a few others, in the sense of "a growth". The physis also refers to the "[[Epiphyseal plate|growth plate]]", or site of growth at the end of long bones.

'''Primary energy''' ('''PE''') is an [[energy]] form found in nature that has not been subjected to any [[energy engineering|human engineered]] conversion process. It is energy contained in raw [[fuel|fuels]], and other forms of energy received as input to a [[system]]. Primary energy can be [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] or [[renewable energy|renewable]].

Where primary energy is used to describe fossil fuels, the [[embodied energy]] of the fuel is available as thermal energy and around 70% is typically lost in conversion to electrical or mechanical energy. There is a similar 60-80% conversion loss when solar and wind energy is converted to electricity, but today's UN conventions on energy statistics counts the electricity made from wind and solar as the primary energy itself for these sources. One consequence of this counting method is that the contribution of wind and solar energy is under reported compared to fossil energy sources, and there is hence an international debate on how to count primary energy from wind and solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauar|first1=Erik|title=IEA underreports contribution solar and wind by a factor of three compared to fossil fuels|url=http://energypost.eu/iea-underreports-contribution-solar-wind-factor-three-compared-fossil-fuels/|website=energypost.eu|publisher=Energy Post|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Total primary energy supply''' ('''TPES''') is the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/06/01/01/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2ffactbook-2013-41-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f18147364&amp;accessItemIds=|title=OECD Factbook 2013: Economic, Environmental and Social Statistics|year=2013|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of primary energy is used in [[energy distance|energy statistics]] in the compilation of [[energy accounting|energy balances]], as well as in the field of [[energetics]]. In energetics, a primary energy source (PES) refers to the energy forms required by the energy sector to generate the supply of [[energy carrier|energy carriers]] used by human society.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giampietro |first1=Mario |last2=Mayumi |first2=Kozo |title=The Biofuel Delusion: The Fallacy of Large Scale Agro-Biofuels Production |publisher=Earthscan, Taylor &amp; Francis group |year=2009 |pages=336 |isbn=978-1-84407-681-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary energy''' is a carrier of energy, such as electricity. These are produced by conversion from a primary energy source.

The use of primary energy as a measure ignores conversion efficiency. Thus forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency, particularly the thermal sources, coal, gas and nuclear are overstated, whereas energy sources such as hydroelectricity which are converted efficiently, while a small fraction of primary energy are significantly more important than their total raw energy supply may seem to imply.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

PE and TPES are better defined in the context of [[worldwide energy supply]].

==Examples of sources==
Primary energy sources should not be confused with the [[energy system]] components (or conversion processes) through which they are converted into energy carriers.

In certain situations, the use of resources by human society is performed at a much higher rate than the minimum rate at which it can be geophysically renewed. This is the rationale behind the differentiation between non-renewable primary energy sources (oil, coal, gas, uranium) and renewable primary energy sources (wind, solar, hydro).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usable energy==
{{main|exergy}}
[[File:Different energy forms (PES).png|thumb|Primary energy sources are transformed by the energy sector to generate energy carriers.]]
Primary energy sources are transformed in [[energy conversion]] processes to more convenient forms of energy that can directly be used by society, such as [[electrical energy]], refined [[fuels]], or synthetic fuels such as [[hydrogen fuel]]. In the field of [[energetics]], these forms are called [[energy carrier]]s and correspond to the concept of "secondary energy" in energy statistics.

===Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)===
Energy carriers are energy forms which have been transformed from primary energy sources. Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind. Electricity is particularly useful since it has low entropy (is highly ordered) and so can be converted into other forms of energy very efficiently. [[District heating]] is another example of secondary energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference   U.S. EPA Energy STAR] Retrieved 2017-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[laws of thermodynamics]], primary energy sources cannot be produced. They must be available to society to enable the production of energy carriers.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009" /&gt;

[[Thermal efficiency|Conversion efficiency]] varies. For thermal energy, electricity and mechanical energy production is limited by [[Carnot's theorem]], and generates a lot of [[waste heat]]. Other non-thermal conversions can be more efficient. For example, while wind turbines do not capture all of the wind's energy, they have a high conversion efficiency and generate very little waste heat since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow ranges of wavelength, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also very ordered, and converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the [[exergy]] of a system.

===Site and source energy===
Site energy is the term used in North America for the amount of end-use energy of all forms consumed at a specified location. This can be a mix of primary energy (such as natural gas burned at the site) and secondary energy (such as electricity). Site energy is measured at the campus, building, or sub-building level and is the basis for energy charges on utility bills.&lt;ref name="NRCan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring energy: site energy vs. source energy in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/buildings/energy-benchmarking/update/getready/19453|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source energy, in contrast, is the term used in North America for the amount of primary energy consumed in order to provide a facility’s site energy. It is always greater than the site energy, as it includes all site energy and adds to it the energy lost during transmission, delivery, and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torcellini|first=Paul|last2=Pless|first2=Shanti|last3=Deru|first3=Michael|last4=Crawley|first4=Drury|date=June 2006|title=Zero energy buildings: a critical look at the definition|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf|journal=ACEEE Summer Study|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory/U.S. Department of Energy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While source or primary energy provides a more complete picture of energy consumption, it cannot be measured directly and must be calculated using conversion factors from site energy measurements.&lt;ref name="NRCan" /&gt; For electricity, a typical value is three units of source energy for one unit of site energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Energy vs Source Energy|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/energy/content/site-energy-vs-source-energy|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can vary considerably depending on factors such as the primary energy source or fuel type, the type of power plant, and the transmission infrastructure. One full set of conversion factors is available as technical reference from [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pdf/reference/Source%20Energy.pdf|title=Technical Reference: Source Energy|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Either site or source energy can be an appropriate metric when comparing or analyzing energy use of different facilities. The U.S [[Energy Information Administration]], for example, uses primary (source) energy for its energy overviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/|title=Total Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but site energy for its Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/terminology.php|title=Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Residential Building Energy Consumption Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/terminology.php|title=Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]] program recommends using source energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference|title=The difference between source and site energy|website=www.energystar.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] uses site energy in its definition of a [[Zero-energy building|zero net energy building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/articles/doe-releases-common-definition-zero-energy-buildings-campuses-and|title=DOE Releases Common Definition for Zero Energy Buildings, Campuses, and Communities|website=Energy.gov|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy accidents are accidents that occur in systems that provide energy or power. These can result in fatalities, as can the normal running of many systems, for example those deaths due to pollution.

Globally, coal is responsible for 100,000 deaths per trillion kWh.&lt;ref name=deadly&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#2f9f079649d2 How Deadly Is Your Kilowatt? We Rank The Killer Energy Sources James Conca, June 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sociology of space''' is a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] that mostly borrows from theories developed within the discipline of [[geography]], including the sub fields of [[human geography]], [[economic geography]], and [[feminist geography]]. The "sociology" of space examines the social and material constitution of spaces. It is concerned with understanding the social practices, institutional forces, and material complexity of how humans and spaces interact. The sociology of space is an inter-disciplinary area of study, drawing on various theoretical traditions including [[Marxism]], [[postcolonialism]], and [[Science and Technology Studies]], and overlaps and encompasses theorists with various academic disciplines such as [[geography]] and [[architecture]].  Edward T. Hall developed the study of [[Proxemics]] which concentrates on the empirical analysis of space in psychology.  

== Definition of space ==
Space is one of the most important concepts within the disciplines of social science as it is fundamental to our understanding of geography. The term "space" has been defined variously by scholars:

In general terms, the Oxford English Dictionary defines space in two ways;

1. A continuous extension viewed with or without reference to the existence of objects within it.  
2. The interval between points or objects viewed as having one, two or three dimensions.

However, the human geographers’ interest is in the objects within the space and their relative position, which involves the description, explanation and prediction of the distribution of phenomena. Thus, the relationships between objects in space is the central of the study.

[[Michel Foucault]] defines space as;
“The space in which we live, which draws us out of ourselves, in which the erosion of our lives, our time and our history occurs, the space that claws and gnaws at us, is also, in itself, a heterogeneous space…..we live inside a set of relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kham|first=Miriam|title=Tahiti Intertwined: Ancestral Land, Tourist Postcard, and Nuclear Test Site|journal=American Anthropologist|date=March 2000|volume= 102| issue = 1|series=New Series|pages=7–26|jstor=683535|doi=10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Thrift]] also defines space as;
"The outcome of a series of highly problematic temporary settlements that divide and connect things up into different kinds of collectives which are slowly provided with the meaning which render them durable and sustainable." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, "space" is the social space in which we live and create relationships with other people, societies and surroundings. Space is an outcome of the hard and continuous work of building up and maintaining collectives by bringing different things into alignments. All kinds of different spaces can and therefore do exist which may or may not relate to each other. Thus, through space, we can understand more about social action.

== History of the sociology of space ==

[[Georg Simmel]] has been seen as the classical sociologist who was most important to this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last1 = Urry | first1 = John | contribution = The Sociology of Space and Place  | series = Blackwell companion to sociology | pages = 5 | year = 2004|isbn=1-4051-2267-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel wrote on "the sociology of space" in his 1908 book "Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation". His concerns included the process of metropolitanisation and the separation of leisure spaces in modern economic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Theory and Method |last=Jary| first=David |url =http://www.reading.ac.uk/RevSoc/archive/volume10/number1/10-1b.htm | year=1997 |accessdate =2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of [[space]] long played a subordinate role in sociological theory formation. Only in the late 1980s did it come to be realised that certain changes in society cannot be adequately explained without taking greater account of the spatial components of life. This shift in perspective is referred to as the [[topological turn]]. The space concept directs attention to organisational forms of juxtaposition. The focus is on differences between places and their mutual influence. This applies equally for the micro-spaces of everyday life and the macro-spaces at the nation-state or global levels.

The theoretical basis for the growing interest of the social sciences in space was set primarily by English and French-speaking sociologists, philosophers, and human geographers. Of particular importance is [[Michel Foucault| Michel Foucault’s]] essay on “Of Other Spaces”,&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1991, orig. 1967), »Andere Räume«, in: Wentz, Martin (Hg.), Stadt-Räume, Frankfurt a. M./New York, S. 65–72&lt;/ref&gt; in which the author proclaims the “age of space”, and [[Henri Lefebvre| Henri Lefebvre’s]] seminal work “La production de l’espace”.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri (1991, orig. 1974), The Production of Space, D. Nicholson-Smith trans., Oxford: Basil Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-14048-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter provided the grounding for Marxist spatial theory on which [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], [[Manuel Castells]], [[Edward Soja]], and others have built. Marxist theories of space, which are predicated on a structural, i.e., capitalist or global determinants of spaces and the growing homogenization of space, are confronted by action theoretical conceptions, which stress the importance of the corporeal placing and the perception of spaces as albeit habitually predetermined but subjective constructions. One example is the theory of space of the German sociologist [[Martina Löw]].&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2001), Raumsoziologie, Frankfurt a. M.&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches deriving from the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse have attracted greater attention in recent years. Also in contrast to (neo)Marxist concepts of space, British geographer [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]]&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999a), Power-Geometries and the Politics of Space-Time, Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999b), »Spaces of Politics«, in: Massey, Doreen/Allen, John/Sarre, Philip (Hg.), Human Geography Today, Cambridge/Oxford/Malden, S. 279–294&lt;/ref&gt; and German sociologist [[Helmuth Berking]],&lt;ref&gt;Berking, Helmuth (1998), »›Global Flows and Local Cultures‹. Über die Rekonfiguration sozialer Räume im Globalisierungsprozeß«, in: Berliner Journal für Soziologie, 8, 3, S. 381–392&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, emphasise the heterogeneity of local contexts and the place-relatedness of our knowledge about the world.

== Duality of space ==

[[Martina Löw]] developed the idea of a "relational" model of space, which focuses on the “orderings”&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2008), »The Constitution of Space: The Structuration of Spaces Through the Simultaneity of Effects and Perception«, in: European Journal of Social Theory, 1, 11&lt;/ref&gt; of living entities and social goods, and examines how space is constituted in processes of perception, recall, or ideation to manifest itself as societal structure. From a social theory point of view, it follows on from the theory of structuration proposed by [[Anthony Giddens]],&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1984), The Constitution of Society. Outline of the Theory of Structuration. Cambridge: Polity&lt;/ref&gt; whose concept of the “duality of structure” Löw extends sociological terms into a “duality of space.” The basic idea is that individuals act as social agents (and constitute spaces in the process), but that their action depends on economic, legal, social, cultural, and, finally, spatial structures. Spaces are hence the outcome of action. At the same time, spaces structure action, that is to say spaces can both constrain and enable action.

With respect to the constitution of space, Löw distinguishes analytically between two, generally mutually determining factors: “spacing” and “synthesis.” Spacing refers to the act of placing or the state of being placed of social goods and people in places. According to Löw, however, an ordering created through placings is only effectively constituted as space where the elements that compose it are actively interlinked by people – in processes of perception, ideation, or recall. Löw calls this synthesis. This concept has been empirically tested in studies such as those by [[Lars Meier]] (who examined the constitution of space in the everyday life of financial managers in London and Singapore), [[Cedric Janowicz]] (who carried out an ethnographical-space sociological study of food supply in the Ghanaian city of [[Accra]]), and [[Silke Streets]] (who looked at processes of space constitution in the creative industries in Leipzig).

== Marxist approaches ==

The most important proponent of Marxist spatial theory was [[Henri Lefebvre]]. He proposed "social space" to be where the [[relations of production]] are reproduced and that dialectical contradictions were spatial rather than temporal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lefebvre, Henri | title=The Survival of Capitalism: Reproduction of the Relations of Production | publisher=Allison &amp; Busby | year=1973 | isbn=0-85031-173-X}}, p17-19&lt;/ref&gt; Lefèbvre sees the societal production of space as a dialectical interaction between three factors. Space is constituted:

* by “spatial practice,” meaning space as reproduced in everyday life
* by the “representation of space”, meaning space as developed cognitively
* and by “spaces of representation,” by which Lefebvre means complex symbolisations and ideational spaces.

In Lefebvre’s view of the 1970s, this spatial production resulted in a space of non-reflexive everydayness marked by alienation, dominating through mathematical-abstract concepts of space, and reproduced in spatial practice. Lefebvre sees a line of flight from alienated spatiality in the spaces of representation – in notions of non-alienated, mythical, pre-modern, or artistic visions of space.

Marxist spatial theory was given decisive new impetus by [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], in particular, who was interested in the effects of the transition from [[Fordism]] to “flexible accumulation” on the experience of space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (1989), The Condition of Postmodernity, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; He shows how various innovations at the economic and technological levels have breached the crisis-prone inflexibility of the Fordist system, thus increasing the turnover rate of capital. This causes a general acceleration of economic cycles. According to Harvey, the result is “time-space compression.” While the feeling for the long term, for the future, for continuity is lost, the relationship between proximity and distance becomes more and more difficult to determine.

== Postcolonial theories of space ==

Theories of space that are inspired by the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse focus on the heterogeneity of spaces. According to [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]], calling a country in Africa a “developing country” is not appropriate, since this expression implies that spatial difference is temporal difference (Massey 1999b). This logic treats such a country not as different but merely as an early version of countries in the “developed” world, a view she condemns as "Eurocentrism." In this vein, [[Helmuth Berking]] criticises theories that postulate the increasing homogenisation of the world through globalisation as “globocentrism.” He confronts this with the distinctiveness and importance of local knowledge resources for the production of (different and specific) places. He claims that local contexts form a sort of framework or filter through which global processes and globally circulating images and symbols are appropriated, thus attaining meaning. For instance, the film character [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]] is a different figure in radical rightwing circles in Germany than in the black ghettoes of the Chicago Southside, just as [[McDonald’s]] means something different in Moscow than in Paris.

== Third Space ==
[[Henri Lefebvre]] (see also [[Edward Soja]]) says that (social) space is a (social) product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. He explains space embraces a multitude of intersection in his great book, “Production of Space”. That means that we need to consider how the various modes of spatial production relate to each other.

He argues that there are three aspects to our spatial existence, which exist in a kind of triad:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lefebvre|first=Henri|title=Marxist &amp; Social Constructivist Approaches to Place|url=http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~janzb/courses/hum3930b/lefebvre1.htm|publisher=Pegasus|accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. First Space
(Physical space/perceived space)
"The spatial practice of a society secretes that society's space; it propounds and presupposes it, in a dialectical interaction; it produces it slowly and surely as it masters and appropriates it."

2. Second Space
(Mental space/conceived space)
"Conceptualized space, the space of scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers, as of a certain type of artist with a scientific bent -- all of whom identify what is lived and what is perceived with what is conceived."

3. Third Space
(Social space/lived space)
"Space as directly lived through its associated images and symbols."

Even though there are many disciplines in the study of Human Geography, the most well-known approach is “The third space” formulated by [[Edward Soja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. Smith|first=Susan|title=Introducing Human Geographies|year=1999|publisher=Arnold|location=London|pages=12–22|chapter=Society-Space|editor=Paul Cloke |editor2=Philip Crang |editor3=Mark Goodwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In unitary theory, there are three approaches; first space, second space and third space. First space is physical space, and spaces are measurable and mappable. The second space is a mental or conceived space which comes from our thinking and ideas. However, the third space is a social space/lived space which is a social product that is a space created by society under oppression or marginalization that want to reclaim the space of inequality and make it into something else. Soja argues that our old ways to thinking about space (first and second space theories) can no longer accommodate the way the world works because he believed that spaces may not be contained within one social category, they may include different aspects of many categories or developed within the boundaries of a number of category. For instance, two different cultures combine together and emerge as a third culture. This third hybrid space displaces the original values that constitute it and set up new values and perspectives that is different from the first two spaces. Thus, the third space theory can explain some of the complexity of poverty, social exclusion and social inclusion, gender and race issues.

== Rational view of space ==
In the work of geographer and critical theorist [[Nigel Thrift]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote a rational view of space in which, rather than seeing space being viewed as a container within which the world proceeds, space should be seen as a co-product of these proceedings. He explained about four constructed space in modern human geography. 
There are four different kinds of space according to how modern geography thinks about space. They are 1. Empirical Construction of Space, 2. Unblocking space, 3. Image space and 4. Place Space.

'''First Space''' is the empirical construction of space. Empirical space refers to the process whereby the mundane fabric of daily life is constructed. These simple things like, cars, houses, mobiles, computers and roads are very simple but they are great achievements of our daily life and they play very important role in making up who we are today. For example, today’s technology such as GPS did not suddenly come into existence; in fact, it is laid down in the 18th century and developed throughout time. The first space is real and tangible, and it is also known as physical space.
'''Second space''' is the unblocking space. This type of space refers to the process whereby routine pathways of interaction as set up around which boundaries are often drawn. The routine may include the movement of office workers, the interaction of drunk teenagers, and the flow of goods, money, people, and information. Unlike the old time in geography when people accepted a space as blocked boundary (Example: A capitalist space, neoliberal space or city space), we began to realize that there is no such thing like boundaries in space. The space of the world is flowing and transforming continuously that it is very difficult to describe in a fixed way. The second space is ideology/conceptual and it is also known as mental space. For example, the second space will explain the behaviors of people from different social class and the social segregation among rich and poor people. 
'''Third space''' is the image space that refers to the process whereby the images has produced new kind of space. The images may be in different form and shape; ranging from painting to photograph, from portrait to post card, and from religious theme to entertainment. Nowadays, we are highly influenced by images in many ways and these certain images can tell us new social and cultures values, or something new about how we see the world. Images, symbols and sign do have some kind of spatial expression. 
'''Fourth space''' is the place that refers to the process whereby spaces are ordered in ways that open up affective and other embodied potentials. Place space has more meaning than a place, and it can represent as different type of space. This fourth type of space tries to understand that place is a vital actor in bringing up people's lives in certain ways and place will let us to understand all kind of things which are hidden form us..

==Scale: the local and the global==
Andrew Herod &lt;ref&gt;Harod, A. 2003. "Scale: the local and the global".  Key Concepts in Geography. London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that scale, within human geography, is typically seen in one of the two ways: either as a real material thing which actually exists and is the result of political struggle and/or social process, or as a way of framing our understanding of the world. People’s lives across the globe have been re-scaling by contemporary economic, political, cultural and social processes, such as [[globalization]], in complex ways. As a result, we have seen the creation of [[supra-national]] political bodies such as the [[European Union]], the devolution of political power from the nation-state to regional political bodies.&lt;ref&gt;PoliticalGeography. 1997. Special Issue on " The political geography of scale".Political Geography.&lt;/ref&gt; We have also experienced the increasing homogenization and ‘[[Americanization]]’ through the process of globalization while the locals’ tendencies (or counter force)among people who defend traditional ways of life increase around the world .The process of re-scaling people‘s lives and the relationship between the two extremes of our scaled lives- the ‘global’ and the ‘local’ were brought into question.

===Ontological status of the global and the local===
Until the 1980s, theorizing the concept of ‘scale’ itself was taken for granted although physical and human geographers looked at issues from ‘regional scale’ or‘national scale’. The questions such as whether scale is simply a mental device categorizing and ordering the world or whether scales really exists as material social products, particularly, were debated among [[materialists]] and [[idealists]]. Some geographers draw upon Immanuel Kant’s idealist philosophy that scales were handy conceptual mechanism for ordering the world while others, by drawing upon Marxist ideas of materialism, argue that scales really exist in the world and they were the real social products. For those idealists based on Kantian‘s inspiration, the ‘global’ is defined by the geologically given limits of the earth and the ‘local’ is defined as a spatial resolution useful for comprehending the process and practices. For materialists, the ‘national’ scale is a scale that had to be actively created through economic and political processes but not a scale existed in a logical hierarchy between global and the regional.

The notion of ‘becoming’ and the focus on the politics of producing scales have been central to materialist&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P.J. 1982. "A materialist framework for political geography", Transactions, Institute of British Geographers.&lt;/ref&gt; arguments concerning the global scale. It is important to recognize that social actors may have to work just as hard to become ‘local’as they have to work to become ‘global’. People paid attention to how transnational corporations have ‘gone global’, how institutions of governance have‘become’ supra-national and how labour unions have sought to ‘globalize’ their operations to match those of an increasingly ‘globalized’ city.

For the scale ‘global’ and ‘local’, Kevin Cox mentioned that moving from the local to the global scale ‘is not a movement from one discrete arena to another’ but a process of developing networks of associations that allow actors to shift between various spaces of engagement. According to his view, ‘scale’ is seen as a process rather than as a fixed entity and, in other words, the global and the local are not static ’arenas’within which social life plays out but are constantly made by social actions.For example, a political organization might attempt to go ‘global’ to engage with actors or opportunities outside of its own space; likewise, a transnational corporation may attempt to ‘go local’ through tailoring its products and operations in different places.

===Discourses of the global and the local===
[[J. K. Gibson-Graham|Gibson-Graham]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibson-Graham, J.K. 2002. "Beyond global vs. local: economic politics outside the binary frame" in: A. Herold and M.W. Wright(eds) . Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) has identified at least six ways in which the relationship between the local and the global is often viewed.

1. The global and the local are seen as interpretive frames for analyzing situations

2. Drawing on Dirlik, Gibson-Graham suggests that in such a representation, the global is ‘something more than the national or regional ..anything other than the local’. Meaning that, the global and the local each derive meaning from what they are not.

3. According to French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]], the local and the global ‘offer different points of view on networks that are by nature neither local nor global, but are more or less long and more or less connected. Also, in Latour’s view, it is impossible to distinguish where the local ends and the global begins.

4. The concept ‘The global is local’ was proposed by Gibson-Graham. For instance, multinational firms are actually ‘multi local‘ rather than ‘global’.

5. The local is global. In this view, the local is an entry point to the world of global flows which encircle the planet.

6. The global and the local are actually the processes rather than the locations. All spaces are the hybrids of global and local; so they are ‘glocal.’

There are some western thoughts that greater size and extensiveness imply domination and superior power, such that the local is often represented as ‘small and relatively powerless, defined and confined by the global’. So, the global is a force and the local is its field of play. However, the local can serve as a powerful scale of political organization; the global is not a scale just controlled by capital – those who challenge capital can also organize globally( Herod, A). There has been the concept ‘Think globally and act locally’ viewed by [[neoliberals]].

===Metaphors of scale===
For representing how the world is scaled, there are five different and popular metaphors: they are the ladder, concentric circles, Matryoshka nesting dolls, earthworm burrows and tree roots. First, in using such a metaphor of hierarchical ladder, the global as the highest rung on the ladder is seen to be above the local and all other scales. Second, the use of concentric metaphor leaves us with a particular way of conceptualizing the scalar relationship between places. In this second metaphor, the local is seen as a relatively small circle, with the regional as a larger circle encompassing it, while the national and the global scales are still larger circles encompassing the local and the regional. For the hierarchy of Russian Matryoshka nesting dolls, the global can contain other scales but this does not work the other way round; for instance, the local cannot contain the global. For the fourth metaphor concerning with thinking on scale, what French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]] argued is that a world of places is ‘networked’ together. Such the metaphor leaves us with an image of scale in which the global and the local are connected together and not totally separated from each other.  For the tree roots metaphor similar with the earthworm burrow metaphor, as the earthworm burrows or tree roots penetrating different strata of the soil, it is difficult to determine exactly where one scale ends and another begins. When thinking about the use of metaphor, it should be aware that the choice of metaphor over another is not made on the basis of which is empirically a ‘more accurate’representation of something but, on the basis of how someone is attempting to understand a particular phenomenon.

Such an appreciation of metaphors is important because it suggests that how we talk about scale impacts upon the ways in which we engage socially and politically with our scaled world and that may impact on how we conduct our social, economic and political praxis and so make landscapes ( Herod,A&lt;ref&gt;Herod, A., Wright, M.W (eds). 2002. Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; )

The earliest scientific models of the Universe were developed by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] and [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]] and were [[geocentric model|geocentric]], placing [[Earth]] at the centre of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From China to Paris: 2000 Years Transmission of Mathematical Ideas |first=Yvonne |last=Dold-Samplonius |date=2002 |publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |title=Medieval Science Technology and Medicine: An Encyclopedia |author1=Thomas F.

In developing the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] built upon Copernicus' work as well as observations by [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]].

Further observational improvements led to the realization that our Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in a [[galaxy]] we call the [[Milky Way]], which is one of at least hundreds of billions of galaxies in the Universe. Many of the stars in our galaxy [[exoplanet|have planets]]. [[Observable universe#End of Greatness|At the largest scale]] galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in [[galactic cluster|clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s which form immense [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] and [[void (cosmology)|voids]] in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLwangEACAAJ|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|date=2013-07-23|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-1292022932|edition=International|pages=1173–74|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then,&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawking, Stephen |date=1988 |title=A Brief History of Time |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=978-0553053401 |page=125 |authorlink=Stephen Hawking}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.&lt;ref name="nobel_2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 |accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Big Bang]] theory is the prevailing [[cosmology|cosmological]] description of the development of the Universe. Under this theory, space and time emerged together {{val|13.799|0.021|u=billion years}} ago&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Planck Collaboration|date=2015|title=Planck 2015 results.

After an [[inflationary epoch|initial accelerated expansion]] at around 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, and the separation of the [[fundamental interaction|four known fundamental forces]], the Universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first [[subatomic particle]]s and simple [[atom]]s to form. [[Dark matter]] gradually gathered forming a [[foam|foam-like]] structure of [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] and [[void (cosmology)|voids]] under the influence of [[gravity]]. Giant clouds of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most [[density|dense]], forming the first [[galaxy|galaxies]], [[star]]s, and everything else seen today. It is possible to see objects that are now further away than 13.799 billion [[light-year]]s because [[metric expansion of space|space itself has expanded]], and it is still expanding today. This means that objects which are now up to 46 billion light years away can [[observable universe|still be seen]] in their distant past, because in the past when their light was emitted, they were much closer to the Earth.

From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more [[matter]] than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as [[dark matter]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Redd|first1=Nola|title=What is Dark Matter?|url=https://www.space.com/20930-dark-matter.html|website=Space.com|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''dark'' means that there is a wide range of strong [[indirect evidence]] that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly). The [[Lambda-CDM]] model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. It suggests that about {{val|69.2|1.2|u=%}} [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a [[scalar field]] known as [[dark energy]] which is responsible for the current [[expansion of space]], and about 25.8% [2015] is dark matter.&lt;ref name="planck_2015"&gt;[https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/10/aa27101-15/T9.html Planck 2015 results, table 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary ("[[baryonic matter|baryonic]]") matter is therefore only 4.9% [2015] of the physical universe.&lt;ref name="planck_2015" /&gt; Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of ordinary matter, or about 0.3% of the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

There are many competing hypotheses about the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various [[multiverse]] hypotheses, in which the Universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.&lt;ref name="Brian Greene 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EllisKS032" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Jason.

== Etymology ==
The word ''universe'' derives from the [[Old French]] word ''univers'', which in turn derives from the [[Latin]] word ''universum''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary'', volume II, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 3518.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word was used by [[Cicero]] and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern [[English language|English]] word is used.&lt;ref name="lewis_short"&gt;Lewis, C.T. and Short, S (1879) ''A Latin Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0198642016}}, pp. 1933, 1977–1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synonyms ===
A term for "universe" among the ancient Greek philosophers from [[Pythagoras]] onwards was {{lang|grc|τὸ πᾶν}}, ''tò pân'' ("the all"), defined as all matter and all space, and {{lang|grc|τὸ ὅλον}}, ''tò hólon'' ("all things"), which did not necessarily include the void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott | title=A Greek-English Lexicon | quote=πᾶς | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/πᾶς}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott | title=A Greek-English Lexicon | quote=ὅλος | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/ὅλος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another synonym was {{lang|grc|ὁ κόσμος}}, ''ho kósmos'' (meaning the [[world (philosophy)|world]], the [[cosmos]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott |title = A Greek–English Lexicon | quote = κόσμος | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/κόσμος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms are also found in Latin authors (''totum'', ''mundus'', ''natura'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lewis, C.T. | author2=Short, S | date=1879 | title=A Latin Dictionary | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-864201-5 | pages=1175, 1189–90, 1881–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; and survive in modern languages, e.g., the German words ''Das All'', ''Weltall'', and ''Natur'' for ''Universe''. The same synonyms are found in English, such as everything (as in the [[theory of everything]]), the cosmos (as in [[cosmology]]), the world (as in the [[many-worlds interpretation]]), and [[nature]] (as in [[natural law]]s or [[natural philosophy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary | volume=II | isbn= 978-0198611172 | publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press | date=1971 | pages=569, 909, 1900, 3821–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology and the Big Bang ==
{{Main|Big Bang|Chronology of the universe}}
{{Nature timeline}}
The prevailing model for the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Silk|title=Horizons of Cosmology|publisher=Templeton Pressr|date=2009|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Singh|title=Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe|publisher=Harper Perennial|date=2005|page=560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was an extremely hot and dense one, and that the Universe subsequently expanded and cooled. The model is based on [[general relativity]] and on simplifying assumptions such as [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space. A version of the model with a [[cosmological constant]] (Lambda) and [[cold dark matter]], known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]], is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and [[redshift]] of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.

The initial hot, dense state is called the [[Planck epoch]], a brief period extending from time zero to one [[Planck time]] unit of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, and [[gravity]] - currently the weakest by far of the [[fundamental interactions|four known forces]] - is believed to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been [[grand unification|unified]]. Since the Planck epoch, space has been [[metric expansion of space|expanding]] to its present scale, with a very short but intense period of [[cosmic inflation]] believed to have occurred within the first [[Scientific Notation|10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt;]] seconds.&lt;ref name=Sivaram&gt;{{cite journal | author=C. Sivaram | journal=Astrophysics &amp; Space Science | date=1986 | volume=125 | issue=1 | pages=189–99 | doi=10.1007/BF00643984 | bibcode=1986Ap&amp;SS.125..189S | title= Evolution of the Universe through the Planck epoch}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a kind of expansion different from those we can see around us today. Objects in space did not physically move; instead the [[metric expansion of space|metric]] that defines space itself changed. Although objects in [[spacetime]] cannot move faster than the [[speed of light]], this limitation does not apply to the metric governing spacetime itself. This initial period of inflation is believed to explain why space appears to be very flat, and much larger than light could travel since the start of the universe.

Within the first fraction of a second of the universe's existence, the four fundamental forces had separated. As the universe continued to cool down from its inconceivably hot state, various types of [[subatomic particles]] were able to form in short periods of time known as the [[quark epoch]], the [[hadron epoch]], and the [[lepton epoch]]. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. These [[elementary particle]]s associated stably into ever larger combinations, including stable [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, which then formed more complex [[atomic nuclei]] through [[nuclear fusion]]. This process, known as [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], only lasted for about 17 minutes and ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred. About 25% of the [[proton]]s and all the [[neutron]]s in the universe, by mass, were converted to [[helium]], with small amounts of [[deuterium]] (a [[isotope|form]] of [[hydrogen]]) and traces of [[lithium]]. Any other [[chemical element|element]] was only formed in very tiny quantities. The other 75% of the protons remained unaffected, as [[hydrogen]] nuclei.

After nucleosynthesis ended, the universe entered a period known as the [[photon epoch]]. During this period, the Universe was still far too hot for matter to form neutral [[atom]]s, so it contained a hot, dense, foggy [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of negatively charged [[electron]]s, neutral [[neutrino]]s and positive nuclei. After about 377,000 years, the universe had cooled enough that electrons and nuclei could form the first stable [[atom]]s. This is known as [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] for historical reasons; in fact electrons and nuclei were combining for the first time. Unlike plasma, neutral atoms are [[Opacity (optics)|transparent]] to many [[wavelength]]s of light, so for the first time the universe also became transparent. The photons released ("[[photon decoupling|decoupled]]") when these atoms formed can still be seen today; they form the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB).

As the Universe expands, the [[energy density]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] decreases more quickly than does that of [[matter]] because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. At around 47,000 years, the [[energy density]] of matter became larger than that of photons and [[neutrino]]s, and began to dominate the large scale behavior of the universe. This marked the end of the [[radiation-dominated era]] and the start of the [[matter-dominated era]].

In the earliest stages of the universe, tiny fluctuations within the universe's density led to [[filament (cosmology)|concentrations]] of [[dark matter]] gradually forming. Ordinary matter, attracted to these by [[gravity]], formed large gas clouds and eventually, stars and galaxies, where the dark matter was most dense, and [[void (cosmology)|voids]] where it was least dense. After around 100 - 300 million years,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} the first [[star]]s formed, known as [[Population III]] stars. These were probably very massive, luminous, [[metallicity|non metallic]] and short-lived. They were responsible for the gradual [[reionization]] of the Universe between about 200-500 million years and 1 billion years, and also for seeding the universe with elements heavier than helium, through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Scientific American | title= The First Stars in the Universe |author1=Richard B. Larson  |author2=Volker Bromm  |lastauthoramp=yes | date=March 2002 | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-first-stars-in-the-un/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universe also contains a mysterious energy - possibly a [[scalar field]] - called [[dark energy]], the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present [[dark-energy-dominated era]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33&lt;/ref&gt; In this era, the expansion of the Universe is [[accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerating]] due to dark energy.

Of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s, [[gravitation]] is the dominant at astronomical length scales. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on astronomical length scales. The remaining two interactions, the [[weak nuclear force|weak]] and [[strong nuclear force]]s, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.

The Universe appears to have much more [[matter]] than [[antimatter]], an asymmetry possibly related to the [[CP violation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=October 28, 2003 |url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Ps/bbs/bbs_antimatter.asp |title=Antimatter |publisher=Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council |accessdate=August 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307075727/http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Ps/bbs/bbs_antimatter.asp |archivedate=March 7, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This imbalance between matter and antimatter is partially responsible for the existence of all matter existing today, since matter and antimatter, if equally produced at the [[Big Bang]], would have completely annihilated each other and left only [[photon]]s as a result of their interaction.&lt;ref name="TT-20171025"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adamson |first=Allan |title=Universe Should Not Actually Exist: Big Bang Produced Equal Amounts Of Matter And Antimatter |url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/214821/20171025/universe-should-not-actually-exist-big-bang-produced-equal-amounts-of-matter-and-antimatter.htm |date=19 October 2017 |work=TechTimes.com |accessdate=26 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20171020"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smorra C. et al. |title=A parts-per-billion measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment |url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v550/n7676/full/nature24048.html |date=20 October 2017 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=550 |issue=7676 |pages=371–74 |doi=10.1038/nature24048 |pmid=29052625 |accessdate=26 October 2017 |bibcode=2017Natur.550..371S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universe also appears to have neither net [[momentum]] nor [[angular momentum]], which follows accepted physical laws if the Universe is finite.

Namely, every closed surface in a finite space encloses on each side of itself a finite region of space. Therefore the flux of the electric field through this surface is equal, on th eone hand, to the total charge located in the interior of the surface, and on the other hand to the total charge outside of it, with opposite sign. Consequently, the sum of the charges on the two sides of the surface is zero."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Size and regions ===
{{See also|Observable universe|Observational cosmology}}
The size of the Universe is somewhat difficult to define. According to the general theory of relativity, far regions of [[space]] may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite [[speed of light]] and the ongoing [[expansion of space]]. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.&lt;ref name="Kaku2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ube-MQcFFZQC&amp;pg=PA202|date=March 11, 2008|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0385525442|pages=202–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distant regions of space are assumed to exist and to be part of reality as much as we are, even though we can never interact with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the [[observable universe]]. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler will not be able to interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.&lt;!-- [[Hubble's law]] links to this section --&gt;

Astronomers calculate the [[age of the Universe]] by assuming that the [[Lambda-CDM model]] accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision [[astronomical observation]]s such as [[WMAP]] and [[Planck (satellite)|Planck]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for [[Type Ia supernovae]], and large-scale galaxy clustering including the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, [[weak gravitational lensing]] and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Assuming that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of the age of the Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 [[Measurement uncertainty|±]] 0.021 billion years.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;

Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been [[redshift]]ed; the [[photon]]s emitted have been stretched to longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency]] during their journey. Analyses of [[Type Ia supernova]]e indicate that the spatial expansion is [[accelerating expansion of the Universe|accelerating]].&lt;ref name="riess"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Adam Riess|Riess, Adam G.]]|year=1998|title=Observational evidence from supernovae for an accelerating universe and a cosmological constant|journal=Astronomical Journal|volume=116|issue=3|pages=1009–38|arxiv=astro-ph/9805201 |doi=10.1086/300499|bibcode=1998AJ....116.1009R|last2=Filippenko|last3=Challis|last4=Clocchiatti|last5=Diercks|last6=Garnavich|last7=Gilliland|last8=Hogan|last9=Jha|last10=Kirshner|last11=Leibundgut|last12=Phillips|last13=Reiss|last14=Schmidt|last15=Schommer|last16=Smith|last17=Spyromilio|last18=Stubbs|last19=Suntzeff|last20=Tonry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perlmutter"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Saul Perlmutter|Perlmutter, S.]] |journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=517|issue=2|pages=565–86|year=1999|title=Measurements of Omega and Lambda from 42 high redshift supernovae|arxiv=astro-ph/9812133 |doi=10.1086/307221|bibcode=1999ApJ...517..565P|last2=Aldering|last3=Goldhaber|last4=Knop|last5=Nugent|last6=Castro|last7=Deustua|last8=Fabbro|last9=Goobar|last10=Groom|last11=Hook|last12=Kim|last13=Kim|last14=Lee|last15=Nunes|last16=Pain|last17=Pennypacker|last18=Quimby|last19=Lidman|last20=Ellis|last21=Irwin|last22=McMahon|last23=Ruiz‐Lapuente|last24=Walton|last25=Schaefer|last26=Boyle|last27=Filippenko|last28=Matheson|last29=Fruchter|last30=Panagia|display-authors=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more matter there is in the Universe, the stronger the mutual [[gravitational]] pull of the matter. If the Universe were ''too'' dense then it would re-collapse into a [[gravitational singularity]]. However, if the Universe contained too ''little'' matter then the self-gravity would be too weak for astronomical structures, like galaxies or planets, to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded [[monotonic]]ally. [[Anthropic principle#Anthropic coincidences|Perhaps unsurprisingly]], our universe has [[Critical Mass Density of the Universe|just the right mass-energy density]], equivalent to about 5 protons per cubic meter, which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | author=[[Sean Carroll (physicist)|Sean Carroll]] and [[Michio Kaku]] | title=How the Universe Works 3 | volume=End of the Universe | date=2014 | publisher=Discovery Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, it was expected that the expansion rate would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe; and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the [[deceleration parameter]], which most cosmologists expected to be positive and related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be negative, approximately -0.55, which technically implies that the second derivative of the cosmic [[scale factor cosmology|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a}&lt;/math&gt; has been positive in the last 5-6 billion years.&lt;ref name="nobel_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=A 'Cosmic Jerk' That Reversed the Universe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/11/us/a-cosmic-jerk-that-reversed-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This acceleration does not, however, imply that the Hubble parameter is currently increasing; see [[deceleration parameter]] for details.

=== Spacetime ===
{{Main|Spacetime|World line}}
{{See also|Lorentz transformation}}
Spacetimes are the arenas in which all physical events take place. The basic elements of spacetimes are [[event (relativity)|events]]. In any given spacetime, an event is defined as a unique position at a unique time. A spacetime is the union of all events (in the same way that a line is the union of all of its points), formally organized into a [[manifold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The Universe appears to be a smooth spacetime continuum consisting of three [[space|spatial]] [[dimension]]s and one temporal ([[time]]) dimension (an event in the spacetime of the physical Universe can therefore be identified by a set of four coordinates: {{nowrap begin}}(''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t''){{nowrap end}} ). On the average, [[3-space|space]] is observed to be very nearly [[Shape of the universe|flat]] (with a [[curvature]] close to zero), meaning that [[Euclidean geometry]] is empirically true with high accuracy throughout most of the Universe.&lt;ref name="Shape"&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/mr_content.html WMAP Mission: Results&amp;nbsp;– Age of the Universe]. Map.gsfc.nasa.gov. Retrieved November 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Spacetime also appears to have a [[simply connected space|simply connected]] [[topology]], in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions (which is postulated by theories such as the [[String theory]]) and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or [[toroid]]al topologies of two-dimensional [[space]]s.&lt;ref name="Nat03"&gt;{{cite journal

The spacetime of the Universe is usually interpreted from a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] perspective, with space as consisting of [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]], and time as consisting of [[one dimension]], the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10714-006-0254-9 | bibcode=2006GReGr..38..643B | arxiv=gr-qc/0407022 | title=Spacetime and Euclidean geometry | journal= General Relativity and Gravitation | volume=38 | issue=4 | year=2006 | pages=643–51 | last1=Brill | first1=Dieter | last2=Jacobsen | first2=Ted| citeseerx=10.1.1.338.7953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By combining space and time into a single [[manifold]] called [[Minkowski space]], physicists have simplified a large number of [[Theoretical physics|physical theories]], as well as described in a more uniform way the workings of the Universe at both the [[Physical cosmology|supergalactic]] and [[quantum mechanics|subatomic]] levels.

Spacetime [[event (relativity)|events]] are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally but rather are known to be relative to the motion of an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]]. Minkowski space approximates the Universe without [[gravity]]; the [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s of [[general relativity]] describe spacetime with matter and gravity.

=== Shape ===
{{Main|Shape of the universe}}
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|250px|The three possible options for the shape of the Universe]]

General relativity describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy (gravity). The [[topology]] or [[geometry]] of the Universe includes both [[Shape of the universe#Local geometry (spatial curvature)|local geometry]] in the [[observable universe]] and [[Shape of the universe#Global geometry|global geometry]].
Cosmologists often work with a given [[space-like]] slice of spacetime called the [[Comoving distance|comoving coordinates]]. The section of spacetime which can be observed is the backward [[light cone]], which delimits the [[cosmological horizon]].
The cosmological horizon (also called the particle horizon or the light horizon) is the maximum distance from which [[Elementary particle|particles]] can have traveled to the [[observation|observer]] in the [[age of the Universe]]. This horizon represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the Universe.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Robert Harrison|title=Cosmology: the science of the universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNxeHD2cbLYC&amp;pg=PA447|accessdate=May 1, 2011|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521661485|pages=447–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew R.

An important parameter determining the future evolution of the Universe theory is the [[density parameter]], Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This selects one of three possible [[Shape of the universe|geometries]] depending on whether Ω is equal to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes.&lt;ref name=FateOfTheUniverse&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Ultimate Fate of the Universe?|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html|website=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|publisher=NASA|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations, including the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE), [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP), and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] maps of the CMB, suggest that the Universe is infinite in extent with a finite age, as described by the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] (FLRW) models.&lt;ref name="nasa_popular_uni_curv"&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html Will the Universe expand forever?], WMAP website at NASA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RBSG08"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Roukema|first =Boudewijn|author2=Zbigniew Buliński |author3=Agnieszka Szaniewska |author4=Nicolas E.

=== Support of life ===
{{main|Fine-tuned Universe}}
The Universe may be ''fine-tuned''; the Fine-tuned Universe hypothesis is the proposition that the conditions that allow the existence of observable [[life]] in the Universe can only occur when certain universal [[physical constant|fundamental physical constants]] lie within a very narrow range of values, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe would have been unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of [[matter]], astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood.&lt;ref name=toa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CI/CI301.html |title=CI301: The Anthropic Principle |accessdate=October 31, 2007 |author=Mark Isaak (ed.) |date=2005 |work=Index to Creationist Claims |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposition is discussed among [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[science|scientists]], [[theology|theologians]], and proponents of [[creationism]].

=== Dark matter ===
{{main|Dark matter}}
Dark matter is a hypothetical kind of [[matter]] that is invisible to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]], but which accounts for most of the matter in the Universe. The existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] of the Universe. Other than [[neutrinos]], a form of [[hot dark matter]], dark matter has not been detected directly, making it one of the greatest mysteries in modern [[astrophysics]]. Dark matter neither [[blackbody spectrum|emits]] nor absorbs light or any other [[electromagnetic radiation]] at any significant level. Dark matter is estimated to constitute 26.8% of the total mass–energy and 84.5% &lt;!--26.8/(4.9 + 26.8)--&gt; of the total matter in the Universe.&lt;ref name = DarkMatter&gt;Sean Carroll, Ph.D., Caltech, 2007, The Teaching Company, ''Dark Matter, Dark Energy: The Dark Side of the Universe'', Guidebook Part 2 p. 46, Accessed October 7, 2013, "...dark matter: An invisible, essentially collisionless component of matter that makes up about 25 percent of the energy density of the universe... it's a different kind of particle... something not yet observed in the laboratory..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=planckcam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/planck-captures-portrait-of-the-young-universe-revealing-earliest-light |title=Planck captures portrait of the young Universe, revealing earliest light |date=March 21, 2013 |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ordinary Matter ===
{{main|Matter}}
The remaining 4.9% of the mass–energy of the Universe is ordinary matter, that is, [[atom]]s, [[ion]]s, [[electron]]s and the objects they form. This matter includes [[star]]s, which produce nearly all of the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] and [[intergalactic medium|intergalactic]] media, [[planet]]s, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze.&lt;ref name=Davies2&gt;

Ordinary matter commonly exists in four [[state of matter|states]] (or [[phase (matter)|phases]]): [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. However, advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases, such as [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s and [[fermionic condensate]]s.

Ordinary matter is composed of two types of [[elementary particle]]s: [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s.&lt;ref name=Hooft&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the proton is formed of two [[up quarks]] and one [[down quark]]; the neutron is formed of two down quarks and one up quark; and the electron is a kind of lepton. An atom consists of an [[atomic nucleus]], made up of protons and neutrons, and electrons that orbit the nucleus. Because most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus, which is made up of [[baryons]], astronomers often use the term ''baryonic matter'' to describe ordinary matter, although a small fraction of this "baryonic matter" is electrons.

Soon after the [[Big Bang]], primordial protons and neutrons formed from the [[quark–gluon plasma]] of the early Universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in a process known as [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to [[lithium]] and [[beryllium]], but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some [[boron]] may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, [[carbon]], was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of [[metallicity|heavier elements]] resulted from [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Clayton1983&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Donald D.|title=Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis|date=1983|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226109534|pages=362–435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hadrons ====
{{Main|Hadron}}
A hadron is a [[composite particle]] made of [[quark]]s [[bound state|held together]] by the [[strong force]]. Hadrons are categorized into two families: [[baryon]]s (such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) made of three quarks, and [[meson]]s (such as [[pion]]s) made of one quark and one [[antiparticle|antiquark]]. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.
From approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]], during a period is known as the [[hadron epoch]], the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the Universe was dominated by [[hadron]]s. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the Universe was about one second old.&lt;ref name=Allday2002&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allday|first1=Jonathan|title=Quarks, Leptons and the Big Bang|date=2002|publisher=IOP Publishing|isbn=978-0750308069|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|244–66}}

==== Leptons ====
{{main|Lepton}}
A lepton is an [[elementary particle|elementary]], [[half-integer spin]] particle that does not undergo strong interactions but is subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]; no two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main classes of leptons exist: [[electric charge|charged]] leptons (also known as the ''electron-like'' leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as [[neutrino]]s). Electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the Universe, whereas [[muon]]s and [[tau (particle)|taus]] are unstable particle that quickly decay after being produced in [[high energy physics|high energy]] collisions, such as those involving [[cosmic ray]]s or carried out in [[particle accelerator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[lepton epoch]] was the period in the evolution of the early Universe in which the [[lepton]]s dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the [[Big Bang]], after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the [[hadron epoch]]. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermal history of the Universe and early growth of density fluctuations|url=http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~gamk/TUM_Lectures/Lecture4.pdf|work=Guinevere Kauffmann|publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]|accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons.

==== Photons ====
{{Main|Photon epoch}}
{{See also|Photino}}
A photon is the [[quantum]] of [[light]] and all other forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is the [[force carrier]] for the [[electromagnetic force]], even when [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|static]] via [[virtual photons]]. The effects of this [[force]] are easily observable at the [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] and at the [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] level because the photon has zero [[rest mass]]; this allows long distance [[fundamental interaction|interactions]]. Like all elementary particles, photons are currently best explained by [[quantum mechanics]] and exhibit [[wave–particle duality]], exhibiting properties of [[wave]]s and of [[wikt:particle|particles]].

The photon epoch started after most leptons and anti-leptons were [[annihilation|annihilated]] at the end of the lepton epoch, about 10 seconds after the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei were created in the process of nucleosynthesis which occurred during the first few minutes of the photon epoch. For the remainder of the photon epoch the Universe contained a hot dense [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of nuclei, electrons and photons. About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine with electrons to create neutral atoms. As a result, photons no longer interacted frequently with matter and the Universe became transparent. The highly redshifted photons from this period form the cosmic microwave background. Tiny variations in temperature and density detectable in the CMB were the early "seeds" from which all subsequent [[structure formation]] took place.&lt;ref name=Allday2002/&gt;{{rp|244–66}}

== Cosmological models ==
=== Model of the Universe based on general relativity ===
{{main|Solutions of the Einstein field equations}}
{{See also|Big Bang|Ultimate fate of the Universe}}
[[General relativity]] is the [[Differential geometry|geometric]] [[Theoretical physics|theory]] of [[gravitation]] published by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in [[modern physics]]. It is the basis of current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes [[special relativity]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of [[space]] and [[Time in physics|time]], or spacetime. In particular, the [[curvature]] of spacetime is directly related to the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of whatever [[matter]] and [[radiation]] are present. The relation is specified by the [[Einstein field equations]], a system of [[partial differential equation]]s. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the [[acceleration]] of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the Universe over time.&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt;

With the assumption of the [[cosmological principle]] that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere, a specific solution of the field equations that describes the Universe is the [[metric tensor]] called the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]],
:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = -c^{2} dt^2 +
R(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where (''r'', θ, φ) correspond to a [[spherical coordinate system]]. This [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] has only two undetermined parameters. An overall [[dimensionless]] length [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] ''R'' describes the size scale of the Universe as a function of time; an increase in ''R'' is the [[expansion of the Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A curvature index ''k'' describes the geometry. The index ''k'' is defined so that it can take only one of three values: 0, corresponding to flat [[Euclidean geometry]]; 1, corresponding to a space of positive [[curvature]]; or −1, corresponding to a space of positive or negative curvature.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas66" /&gt; The value of ''R'' as a function of time ''t'' depends upon ''k'' and the [[cosmological constant]] ''Λ''.&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |last1=Zeilik |first1=Michael |last2=Gregory |first2=Stephen A. |date=1998 |edition=4th |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0030062285 | section=25-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt; The equation describing how ''R'' varies with time is known as the [[Friedmann equation]] after its inventor, [[Alexander Friedmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Friedmann A.|date = 1922|title = Über die Krümmung des Raumes|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 377–86|doi = 10.1007/BF01332580|bibcode = 1922ZPhy...10..377F|authorlink = Alexander Friedmann|url=http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/files/16735/E001554876.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solutions for ''R(t)'' depend on ''k'' and ''Λ'', but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale ''R'' of the Universe can remain constant ''only'' if the Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (''k''=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt; However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe is known to be inhomogeneous on smaller scales, ''R'' must change over time. When ''R'' changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; and never moved faster than the [[speed of light]].

Second, all solutions suggest that there was a [[gravitational singularity]] in the past, when ''R'' went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because it is based on the questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems]] show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, ''R'' grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when ''R'' had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the [[Big Bang]] model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a [[quantum theory of gravity]], which has not yet been formulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|pp=122–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, the curvature index ''k'' determines the sign of the mean spatial curvature of spacetime&lt;ref name="RaineThomas66"&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion [[light year]]s). If ''k''=1, the curvature is positive and the Universe has a finite volume.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas70" /&gt; A Universe with positive curvature is often visualized as a [[3-sphere|three-dimensional sphere]] embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if ''k'' is zero or negative, the Universe has an infinite volume.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas70"&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when ''R''=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when ''k'' does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a [[torus]] is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with [[periodic boundary conditions]].

The [[ultimate fate of the Universe]] is still unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index ''k'' and the cosmological constant ''Λ''. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, ''k'' would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a [[Big Crunch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly starting a new Universe in a [[Big Bounce]]. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, ''k'' would equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the [[Future of an expanding universe|Big Freeze]] and the [[heat death of the Universe]].&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt; Modern data suggests that the rate of expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a [[Big Rip]]. Observationally, the Universe appears to be flat (''k'' = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|pp=88, 110–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speculative theories have proposed that our Universe is but one of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the [[multiverse]], challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the Universe.&lt;ref name="EllisKS032"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Munitz MK|date = 1959|title = One Universe or Many?|journal = Journal of the History of Ideas|volume = 12|pages = 231–55|doi = 10.2307/2707516|issue = 2|jstor = 2707516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific multiverse models are distinct from concepts such as [[plane (esotericism)|alternate planes of consciousness]] and [[simulated reality]].

[[Max Tegmark]] developed a four-part [[Multiverse#Max Tegmark's four levels|classification scheme]] for the different types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in response to various [[Physics]] problems. An example of such multiverses is the one resulting from the [[bubble universe theory|chaotic inflation]] model of the early universe.&lt;ref name="chaotic_inflation"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Linde A.|date = 1986|title = Eternal chaotic inflation|journal = Mod.

In this interpretation, parallel worlds are generated in a manner similar to [[quantum superposition]] and [[decoherence]], with all states of the [[wave function]]s being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, in the many-worlds interpretation the multiverse evolves as a [[universal wavefunction]]. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.&lt;ref name=everett1957&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Everett | first1 = Hugh | authorlink = Hugh Everett | year = 1957 | title = Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 454–62 |bibcode = 1957RvMP...29..454E |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.29.454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The least controversial category of multiverse in Tegmark's scheme is [[Multiverse#Level I: An extension of our Universe|Level I]]. The multiverses of this level are composed by distant spacetime events "in our own universe". If space is infinite, or sufficiently large and uniform, identical instances of the history of Earth's entire [[Hubble volume]] occur every so often, simply by chance. Tegmark calculated that our nearest so-called [[doppelgänger]], is 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; meters away from us (a [[double exponential function]] larger than a [[googolplex]]).&lt;ref name="TegmarkPUstaple"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12701329|title=Parallel universes.

Historically, there have been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by physical laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt; Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Gernet|first = J.|date = 1993–1994|title=Space and time: Science and religion in the encounter between China and Europe|journal=Chinese Science|volume=11|pages=93–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Ng|first=Tai|title=Chinese Culture, Western Culture: Why Must We Learn from Each Other?|chapter=III.3|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1915 [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]], which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name="Blandford"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A century of general relativity: Astrophysics and cosmology|author=Blandford R.

=== Mythologies ===
{{Main|Creation myth|Creator deity|Religious cosmology}}
Many cultures have [[List of creation myths|stories describing the origin of the world and universe]]. Cultures generally regard these stories as having some [[truth]]. There are however many differing beliefs in how these stories apply amongst those believing in a supernatural origin, ranging from a god directly creating the Universe as it is now to a god just setting the "wheels in motion" (for example via mechanisms such as the big bang and evolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | quote="In common usage the word 'myth' refers to narratives or beliefs that are untrue or merely fanciful; the stories that make up national or ethnic mythologies describe characters and events that common sense and experience tell us are impossible. Nevertheless, all cultures celebrate such myths and attribute to them various degrees of literal or symbolic ''truth''." | last=Leeming | first=David A. | isbn=978-1598841749 | date=2010|page=xvii | title= Creation Myths of the World | publisher= ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnologists and anthropologists who study myths have developed various classification schemes for the various themes that appear in creation stories.&lt;ref name=Eliade1964&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Myth and Reality (Religious Traditions of the World)|date=1964|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-0042910017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonard2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=Scott A.|last2=McClure|first2=Michael|title=Myth and Knowing: An Introduction to World Mythology|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0767419574|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a [[world egg]]; such stories include the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Kalevala]]'', the [[China|Chinese]] story of [[Pangu]] or the [[History of India|Indian]] [[Brahmanda Purana]]. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the [[Tibetan Buddhism]] concept of [[Adi-Buddha]], the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Mother Earth), the [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] goddess [[Coatlicue]] myth, the [[ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian]] [[Ennead|god]] [[Atum]] story, and the [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Genesis creation narrative]] in which the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic God]] created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union of male and female deities, as in the [[Maori mythology|Maori story]] of [[Rangi and Papa]]. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god&amp;nbsp;— as from [[Tiamat]] in the [[Babylon]]ian epic ''[[Enuma Elish]]'' or from the giant [[Ymir]] in [[Norse mythology]]&amp;nbsp;– or from chaotic materials, as in [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] in [[Japanese mythology]]. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as [[Brahman]] and [[Prakrti]], the [[Serer creation myth|creation myth]] of the [[Serer people|Serers]],&lt;ref&gt;([[Henry Gravrand]], "La civilisation Sereer -Pangool") [in] [[Universität Frankfurt am Main]], Frobenius-Institut, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturmorphologie, Frobenius Gesellschaft, "Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde, Volumes 43–44", F. Steiner (1997), pp. 144–45, {{ISBN|3515028420}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[yin and yang]] of the [[Tao]].

=== Philosophical models ===
{{Further|Cosmology}}
{{See also|Pre-Socratic philosophy|Physics (Aristotle)|Hindu cosmology|Islamic cosmology|Philosophy of space and time}}
The [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic Greek philosophers]] and Indian philosophers developed some of the earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unfinished Universe|page=21|publisher=Oxford University Press|first=Louise|last=B. Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or ''[[arche]]''. The first to do so was [[Thales]], who proposed this material to be [[Water (classical element)|water]]. Thales' student, [[Anaximander]], proposed that everything came from the limitless ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]''. [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] proposed the primordial material to be [[Air (classical element)|air]] on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the ''arche'' to condense or dissociate into different forms. [[Anaxagoras]] proposed the principle of ''[[Nous]]'' (Mind), while [[Heraclitus]] proposed [[fire (classical element)|fire]] (and spoke of ''[[logos]]''). [[Empedocles]] proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]] believed that all things were composed of [[number]], with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the [[Platonic solids]]. [[Democritus]], and later philosophers—most notably [[Leucippus]]—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible [[atom]]s moving through a [[void (astronomy)|void]] ([[vacuum]]), although [[Aristotle]] did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers [[Drag (physics)|resistance to motion]]. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;

Although Heraclitus argued for eternal change, his contemporary [[Parmenides]] made the radical suggestion that all change is an illusion, that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature. Parmenides denoted this reality as {{lang|grc|τὸ ἐν}} (The One). Parmenides' idea seemed implausible to many Greeks, but his student [[Zeno of Elea]] challenged them with several famous [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]]. Aristotle responded to these paradoxes by developing the notion of a potential countable infinity, as well as the infinitely divisible continuum. Unlike the eternal and unchanging cycles of time, he believed that the world is bounded by the celestial spheres and that cumulative stellar magnitude is only finitely multiplicative.

The [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]] [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], founder of the [[Vaisheshika]] school, developed a notion of [[atomism]] and proposed that [[light]] and [[heat]] were varieties of the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant]], ''Our Oriental Heritage'': {{quote|"Two systems of Hindu thought propound physical theories suggestively similar to those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika philosophy, held that the world is composed of atoms as many in kind as the various elements. The [[Jainism|Jains]] more nearly approximated to [[Democritus]] by teaching that all atoms were of the same kind, producing different effects by diverse modes of combinations. Kanada believed light and heat to be varieties of the same substance; [[Udayana]] taught that all heat comes from the Sun; and [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vachaspati]], like [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], interpreted light as composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the eye."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century AD, the [[Buddhist atomism|Buddhist atomist]] philosopher [[Dignāga]] proposed [[atom]]s to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. They denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed that movement consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Stcherbatsky, F. Th. (1930, 1962), ''Buddhist Logic'', Volume 1, p. 19, Dover, New York: {{quote|"The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether. Movement consists for them of moments, it is a staccato movement, momentary flashes of a stream of energy... "Everything is evanescent",... says the Buddhist, because there is no stuff... Both systems &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Samkhya|Sānkhya]], and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency to push the analysis of existence up to its minutest, last elements which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one unique quality. They are called "qualities" (''guna-dharma'') in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality,... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in Sānkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called ''guna'', "quality", but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called ''dharmas'' ('qualities')."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of [[temporal finitism]] was inspired by the doctrine of creation shared by the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]], [[John Philoponus]], presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past and future. Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Muslim philosopher]], [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus); the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]], [[Saadia Gaon]] (Saadia ben Joseph); and the [[Kalam|Muslim theologian]], [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel).&lt;ref name=Viney1985&gt;{{cite book|title=Charles Hartshorne and the Existence of God|chapter=The Cosmological Argument|author=Donald Wayne Viney|pages=65–68|year=1985|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0873959070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astronomical concepts ===
{{Main|History of astronomy|Timeline of astronomy}}
[[File:Aristarchus working.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus's]] 3rd century BCE calculations on the relative sizes of, from left to right, the Sun, Earth, and Moon, from a 10th-century AD Greek copy.]]

Astronomical models of the Universe were proposed soon after [[astronomy]] began with the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]], who viewed the Universe as a [[Flat Earth|flat disk]] floating in the ocean, and this forms the premise for early Greek maps like those of [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus]].

Later [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers, observing the motions of the heavenly bodies, were concerned with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on [[empirical evidence]]. The first coherent model was proposed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidos]]. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, [[celestial spheres]] eternally [[uniform circular motion|rotate with uniform motion]] around a stationary Earth. Normal [[classical elements|matter]] is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.

''[[De Mundo]]'' (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC), stated, "Five elements, situated in spheres in five regions, the less being in each case surrounded by the greater—namely, earth surrounded by water, water by air, air by fire, and fire by ether—make up the whole Universe".&lt;ref name=1908DeMundo&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/demundoarisrich|title=De Mundo|year=1914|author=Aristotle; Forster, E. S. (Edward Seymour), 1879–1950; Dobson, J. F. (John Frederic), 1875–1947|page=2|publisher=Oxford : The Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model was also refined by [[Callippus]] and after concentric spheres were abandoned, it was brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical observations by [[Ptolemy]]. The success of such a model is largely due to the mathematical fact that any function (such as the position of a planet) can be decomposed into a set of circular functions (the [[Fourier series|Fourier modes]]). Other Greek scientists, such as the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean]] philosopher [[Philolaus]], postulated (according to [[Stobaeus]] account) that at the center of the Universe was a "central fire" around which the [[Earth]], [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and [[Planet]]s revolved in uniform circular motion.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. (1968) [https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfMathematics ''A History of Mathematics'']. Wiley, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomer]] [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known individual to propose a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the Universe. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in [[Archimedes]]' book ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'' describes Aristarchus's heliocentric model. Archimedes wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You, King Gelon, are aware the Universe is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the Universe is many times greater than the Universe just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as the reason why [[stellar parallax]] had not been observed, that is, the stars had not been observed to move relative each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments. The geocentric model, consistent with planetary parallax, was assumed to be an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar parallax. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from [[Plutarch]] suggests (''On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Cleanthes]] [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the [[Stoics]]] thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe [i.e. the Earth], ... supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the Earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Flammarion engraving]], Paris 1888]]

The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus's heliocentric model was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], a [[Hellenistic astronomer]] who lived a century after Aristarchus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Otto E.

The Aristotelian model was accepted in the [[Western world]] for roughly two millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the [[Earth]] rotated on its axis and if the [[Sun]] were placed at the center of the Universe.

{{quote|In the center rests the Sun. For who would place this lamp of a very beautiful temple in another or better place than this wherefrom it can illuminate everything at the same time?|Nicolaus Copernicus| in Chapter 10, Book 1 of ''De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestrum'' (1543)}}

As noted by Copernicus himself, the notion that the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] is very old, dating at least to [[Philolaus]] (c. 450 BC), [[Heraclides Ponticus]] (c. 350 BC) and [[Ecphantus the Pythagorean]]. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar [[Nicholas of Cusa]] also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, ''On Learned Ignorance'' (1440).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Misner|Misner, Thorne and Wheeler]], p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Sijzi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science in the Quran|volume=1|publisher=Malik Library|first=Ema Ākabara|last=Ālī|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. [[Empirical research|Empirical evidence]] for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of [[comet]]s, was given by [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Tusi]] (1201–1274) and [[Ali Qushji]] (1403–1474).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ragep |first=F.

In 1919, when [[Hooker Telescope]] was completed, the prevailing view still was that the Universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, [[Edwin Hubble]] identified [[Cepheid variable]]s in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved conclusively that [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda Nebula]] and [[Triangulum Nebula|Triangulum]] among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that Universe consists of multitude of galaxies.&lt;ref name="SharovNovikov1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharov|first1=Aleksandr Sergeevich|last2=Novikov|first2=Igor Dmitrievich|title=Edwin Hubble, the discoverer of the big bang universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttEwkEdPc70C&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=December 31, 2011|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521416177|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no formal definition for the '''water-energy nexus''' - the concept refers to the relationship between the [[water]] used for [[energy production]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Spang, E. S., Moomaw, W. R., Gallagher, K. S., Kirshen, P. H., and Marks, D. H. (2014). "The water consumption of energy production: an international comparison." ''Environmental Research Letters'', 9(10), 105002.&lt;/ref&gt; including both [[electricity]] and sources of fuel such as [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]], and the energy consumed to extract, purify, deliver, heat/cool, treat and dispose of water (and wastewater) sometimes referred to as the [[energy intensity]] (EI). The relationship is not truly a closed loop as the water used for energy production need not be the same water that is processed using that energy, but all forms of energy production require some input of water making the relationship inextricable.

Among the first studies to evaluate the water and energy relationship was a [[life-cycle analysis]] conducted by [[Peter Gleick]] in 1994 that highlighted the interdependence and initiated the joint study of water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, P. H. (1994). "Water and Energy." ''Annual Review of Energy and the Environment'', 19(1), 267-299.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the [[US Department of Energy]] (DOE) released their report on the water-energy nexus citing the need for joint water-energy policies and better understanding of the nexus and its susceptibility to [[climate change]] as a matter of [[national security]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bauer, D., Philbrick, M., and Vallario, B. (2014). "The Water-Energy Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities." U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrid Sankey diagram in the DOE's 2014 water-energy nexus report summarizes water and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flows]] in the US by sector, demonstrating [[interdependence]] as well as singling out [[Electric power|thermoelectric power]] as the single largest user of water, used mainly for cooling. 

==  Water Used for Energy Production ==
[[File:Spang-2014-The water consumption of energy production.tif|thumb|486x486px|Figure 1. Total WCEP by energy category, 2008]]
All types of energy generation consume water either to process the raw materials used in the facility, constructing and maintaining the plant, or to just generate the electricity itself. Renewable power sources such as [[Photovoltaic solar cell|photovoltaic solar]] and [[wind power]], which require little water to produce energy, require water in processing the raw materials to build. Water can either be ''used'' or ''consumed,'' and can be categorised as fresh, ground, surface, blue, grey or green among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Water is considered used if it does not reduce the supply of water to downstream users, i.e. water that is taken and returned to the same source (instream use), such as in thermoelectric plants that use water for cooling and are by far the largest users of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While used water is returned to the system for downstream uses, it has usually been degraded in some way, mainly due to thermal or chemical pollution, and the natural flow has been altered which does not factor into an assessment if only the quantity of water is considered. Water is consumed when it is removed completely from the system, such as by evaporation or consumption by crops or humans. When assessing water use all these factors must be considered as well as spatiotemporal considerations making precise determination of water use very difficult.

Spang et al. (2014) conducted a study looking at the water consumption for energy production (WCEP) internationally that both showed the variation in energy types produced across countries as well as the vast differences in efficiency of energy production per unit of water use (figure 1).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Operations of water distribution systems and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of limited power and water availability is an important consideration for improving the overall resilience of the water - energy nexus. Khatavkar and Mays (2017) &lt;ref&gt; Khatavkar, P., &amp; Mays, L. W. (2017 a) Model for the Real-Time Operation of Water Distribution Systems under Limited Power Availability. In World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2017 (pp. 171-183). &lt;/ref&gt; present a methodology for control of water distribution and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of drought and limited power availability to ascertain at least minimal supply of cooling water to the power plants.

In Congress on Technical Advancement 2017 (pp. 1-9).&lt;/ref&gt; applied an optimization model for water - energy nexus system for a hypothetical regional level system which showed an improved resilience for several contingency scenarios.

== Energy Intensity ==

=== US (California) ===
In 2001 operating water systems in the US consumed approximately 3% of the total annual electricity (~75 TWh).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Cohen, R., Nelson, B., and Wolff, G. (2004). "Energy Down The Drain: The Hidden Costs of California’s Water Supply." E. Cousins, ed., Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/ref&gt; The California's [[State Water Project]] (SWP) and [[Central Valley Project]] (CVP) are together the largest water system in the world with the highest water lift, over 2000&amp;nbsp;ft. across the [[Tehachapi mountains]], delivering water from the wetter and relatively rural north of the state, to the [[agricultural]]ly intensive central valley, and finally to the [[arid]] and heavily populated south. Consequently, the SWP and CVP are the single largest consumers of electricity in California consuming approximately 5 TWh of electricity each per year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2001, 19% of the state’s total electricity use (~48 TWh/year) was used in processing water including end uses, with the urban sector accounting for 65% of this.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Klein, G., Krebs, M., Hall, V., O’Brien, T., and Blevins, B. B. (2005). "California's Water – Energy Relationship." California Energy Commission, Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to electricity, 30% of California’s natural gas consumption was due to water-related processes, mainly residential water heating, and 88 million gallons of diesel was consumed by groundwater pumps for agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The residential sector alone accounted for 48% of the total combined electricity and natural gas consumed for water-related processes in the state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) Energy Division’s Embedded Energy in Water Studies report:&lt;blockquote&gt;''“'[[Energy Intensity]]' refers to the average amount of energy needed to transport or treat water or wastewater on a per unit basis"''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Energy Intensity is sometimes used synonymously with embedded or [[embodied energy]]. In 2005, water deliveries to Southern California were assessed to have an average EI of 12.7 MWh/MG, nearly two-thirds of which was due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following the findings that a fifth of California’s electricity is consumed in water-related processes including end-use,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the CPUC responded by authorising a statewide study into the relationship between energy and water that was conducted by the California Institute for Energy and Environment (CIEE), and developed programs to save energy through water conservation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 1: Statewide and Regional Water-Energy Relationship." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 2: Water Agency and Function Component Study and Embedded Energy- Water Load Profiles." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydroelectricity ==
[[Hydroelectricity]] is a special case of water used for energy production mainly because hydroelectric power generation is regarded as being clean and [[renewable]], and dams (the main source of hydroelectric production) serve multiple purposes besides energy generation, including flood prevention, storage, control and recreation which make justifiable allocation analyses difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the impacts of hydroelectric power generation can be hard to quantify both in terms of evaporative consumptive losses and altered quality of water, since damming results in flows that are much colder than for flowing streams. In some cases the moderation of flows can be seen as a rivalry of water use in time may also need to accounted for in impact analysis.

'''Zeta potential titration''' is a [[titration]] of [[heterogeneous]] systems, for example  [[colloid]]s and [[emulsion]]s. Solids in such systems have very high [[surface area]]. This type of titration is used to study the [[zeta potential]] of these [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]s under different conditions.

[[File:Titration Zeta.gif|thumb|500px|Zeta potential titrations of concentrated [[alumina]] and [[rutile]] dispersions]]

==Iso-electric Point==

The [[iso-electric point]] is one such property. The iso-electric point is the pH value at which the [[zeta potential]] is approximately zero. At a pH near the iso-electric point (± 2 pH units), colloids are usually unstable; the particles tend to [[coagulation|coagulate]] or [[flocculation|flocculate]]. Such titrations use acids or bases as titration [[reagent]]s. Tables of iso-electric points for different materials are available.&lt;ref name=Kosmulski2001&gt;{{citation | last=Kosmulski | first=Marek | title = Chemical properties of Material Surfaces | series = Surfactant Science Series | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | date = 2001 | isbn=978-0-8247-0560-2 | volume = 102)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attached figure illustrates results of such titrations for concentrated dispersions of [[alumina]] (4% v/v) and [[rutile]] (7% v/v). It is seen that iso-electric point of alumina is around pH 9.3, whereas for rutile it is around pH 4. Alumina is unstable in the pH range from 7 to 11. Rutile is unstable in the pH range from 2 to 6.

==Surfactants and Stabilization==

Another purpose of this titration is determination of the optimum dose of [[surfactant]] for achieving [[chemical stability|stabilization]] or [[flocculation]] of a heterogeneous system. Examples can be found in the book by Dukhin and Goetz.&lt;ref name=Dukhin2002&gt;{{citation | last=Dukhin | first=Andrei S. | last2 = Goetz | first2 = Philip J. | title = Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date=2002 | isbn=978-0-444-51164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==

In a zeta-potential titration, the [[Zeta potential]] is the [[wikt:indicator|indicator]]. Measurement of the '''zeta potential''' can be performed using [[microelectrophoresis]], or [[electrophoretic light scattering]], or [[electroacoustic phenomena]]. The last method makes possible to perform titrations in concentrated systems, with no dilution. The book by Dukhin and Goetz provides a detailed description of such titrations.
