      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5019">In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, '''abuse of rights''' (also known as Prohibition of Chicane) is the exercise of a [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]] only to cause annoyance, harm, or injury to another. The abuser is liable for the harm caused by their actions. Some examples of this are [[abuse of power]], [[barratry (common law)|barratry]], [[frivolous litigation|frivolous]] or [[vexatious litigation]], a [[spite fence]] or [[spite wall|wall]], [[forum shopping]], [[abuse of process]], [[malicious prosecution]], [[tax avoidance]] (vs. [[Tax avoidance#Anti-avoidance measures|anti-avoidance rules]], [[step transaction doctrine]], [[economic substance]]), etc. The principle is a creature of case law and was expanded from the neighborhood law doctrine of ''[[aemulatio vicini]]'' under the ''[[jus commune]]''. This principle departs from the classical theory that “he who uses a right injures no one” (= ''neminem laedit qui suo iure utitur''), instead embracing the maxim “a right ends where abuse begins” (= ''le droit cesse où l'abus commence'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Planiol]], ''Traité élémentaire de droit civil'', 11th edn., No. 871, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation ==
The [[:de:Rechtsmissbrauch|abuse of rights]] principle is laid out in German law by the so-called ''Schikaneverbot'' ‘ban on vexatiousness’ ([[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]] [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__226.html §226]). It reads as follows:
{{Verse translation|{{lang|de|Die Ausübung eines Rechts ist unzulässig, 
wenn sie nur den Zweck haben kann, einem anderen Schaden zuzufügen.}}
|
The exercise of a right is unlawful if its purpose 
is only to cause harm to another.}}

Article 2 of the ''Titre préliminaire'' to the [[Swiss Civil Code]] states: 
{{Verse translation|{{lang|fr|Chacun est tenu d'exercer ses droits et d'exécuter ses obligations selon les règles de la bonne foi. L'abus manifeste d'un droit n'est pas protégé par la loi.}}|Everyone is expected to exercise their rights and fulfill their [[Law of obligations|obligations]] according to the rules of [[Good faith (law)|good faith]]. The manifest abuse of a right is not protected by [[statute]].}}

Articles 19, 20 and 21 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]] state that:

* Art. 19. “Every person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due and observe honesty and good faith.”
* Art. 20. “Every person who, contrary to law, wilfully or negligently causes damage to another, shall indemnify the latter for the same.”
* Art. 21. “Any person who wilfully causes loss or injury to another in manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage.”

== Conditions ==
At least one of four conditions is required to invoke the doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abuse of Rights|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/a/abuse-of-rights/|work=uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*the predominant motive for exercising the right is to cause harm
*no serious or legitimate interest exists for judicial protection
*the exercise of the right is ''contra bonos mores'' or violates [[good faith]] or elementary fairness (equity)
*the right is exercised for a purpose other than its intended legal purpose.

The principle does not exist in [[Common law|common law jurisdictions]].

In [[Scots law]] (which is mixed civil/common law jurisdiction), abuse of rights is called ''aemulatio vicini'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strange Gods in the Twenty-First Century: the Doctrine of Aemulatio Vicini|author=Elspeth Reid|url=http://edinburgh.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.3366/edinburgh/9780748623358.001.0001/upso-9780748623358-chapter-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adhesion procedure''', '''adhesive procedure''' or '''ancillary proceedings''' is a [[Procedural law|procedure]] through which a [[Court|court of law]] can rule on [[Compensatory damages|compensation]] for the victim of a [[criminal offense]]. Rather than pursuing damages in a separate [[civil action]], the victim files a civil claim against the offender as a part of a [[criminal trial]].

'''Attorney's fee''' is a chiefly [[United States]] term for compensation for legal services performed by an [[Lawyer|attorney]] ([[lawyer]] or [[law firm]]) for a client, in or out of court. It may be an hourly, flat-rate or contingent fee. Recent studies suggest that when lawyers charge a flat-fee rather than billing by the hour, they work less hard on behalf of clients and client get worse outcomes.&lt;ref name="Brian Leiter's Law School Reports"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2016/05/do-clients-lose-when-lawyers-work-for-a-fixed-fee-michael-simkovic.html|title=Brian Leiter's Law School Reports|website=leiterlawschool.typepad.com|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwall"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwall|first=Benjamin|date=2015-06-25|title=High-Powered Attorney Incentives: A Look at the New Indigent Defense System in South Carolina|ssrn=2623202|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amanda Y. Agan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/amandayagan/research|title=Research |author= Amanda Y. Agan|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney fees are separate from fines, compensatory and [[punitive damages]], and (except in [[Nevada]]) from [[court costs]] in a legal case. Under the "[[American rule (attorney's fees)|American rule]]", attorney fees are usually not paid by the losing party to the winning party in a case, except pursuant to specific [[Statute|statutory]] or [[contract]]ual rights.

==Overview==
The phrase is a legal [[term of art]] in American jurisprudence (in which lawyers are collectively referred to as "attorneys", a wording practice not found in most other legal systems). '''Attorney's fees''' (or '''attorneys' fees''', depending upon number of attorneys involved, or simplified to '''attorney fees''') are the fees, including labor charges and costs, charged by lawyers or their firms for legal services provided by them to their clients.  They do not include incidental, non-legal costs (e.g., expedited shipping costs for legal documents). Generally ([[Nevada]] being an exception), attorney fees are tabulated separately from [[court costs]], and are also separate from fines, compensatory and punitive damages, and other monies in a legal case not enumerated as court costs.

The analogous concept has differing names and applicability in [[common law]] systems such as in most of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems such as those of most of Europe and many former European colonies.  For example, in a court case under [[English law]], the fees of [[solicitors]] and [[barristers]] (two types of lawyer) are combined with court costs and various other expenses into a combined "[[Costs (English law)|costs]]", while non-court solicitor expenses may be separately billed as per-hour charges and those of barristers as daily brief fees. The losing party in a case in most common law systems pays for the costs (including fees) of both parties.

[[State law]]s or [[bar association]] regulations, many of which are based on Rule 1.5 of the [[American Bar Association]]'s ''[[Rules of Professional Conduct]]'', govern the terms under which lawyers can accept fees.&lt;ref name="1.5"&gt;Cornell Law School web site, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ethics/aba/current/ABA_CODE.HTM#Rule_1.5 ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2004), Rule 1.5: Fees]&lt;/ref&gt; Many complaints to ethics boards regarding attorneys revolve around excessive attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Chin &amp; Scott Wells, ''Can a Reasonable Doubt have an Unreasonable Price? Limitations on Attorney's Fees in Criminal Cases,'' [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224273&amp;high=%20Gabriel%20CHin 41 ''Boston College Law Review'' 1 (1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some American [[jurisdiction]]s, a lawyer for the [[plaintiff]] in a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] case can take a case on a contingent fee basis. A contingent fee is a percentage of the monetary [[Legal judgment|judgment]] or settlement. The contingent fee may be split among several firms who have contractual arrangements amongst themselves for referrals or other assistance.  Where a plaintiff loses, the attorney may not receive any money for his or her work. In practice, historically [[tort]] cases involving [[personal injury]] often involve contingent fees, with attorneys being paid a portion of the [[pain and suffering]] damages; one commentator says a typical split of pain and suffering is one-third for the lawyer, one-third for the physician, and one-third for the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell. (1981). [http://www.law.virginia.edu/pdf/faculty/hein/o%27connell/1981u_ill_l_rev333_1981.pdf "A Proposal to Abolish Defendants' payment for Pain and Suffering in Return for Payment of Claimants' attorneys' fees"]. ''University of Illinois Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contingent fee has been described as the ‘poor man’s key to the courthouse".&lt;ref&gt;American Bar Association ;   “Providing Keys to the Courthouse Without Giving Up Full Recovery” by Nicole Liguori Micklich, in ''Construct!'', Volume 2, No. 15, Winter 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas, corporations or wealthy individuals can afford to hire attorneys to pursue their legal interests, the contingency fee affords any injury victim the opportunity, regardless of ability to pay, to hire the best attorney in his or her field. Most jurisdictions in the United States prohibit working for a contingent fee in [[family law]] or criminal cases.

In the United States, an up-front fee paid to a lawyer is called a [[Retainer agreement|retainer]]. Money within the retainer is often used to "buy" a certain amount of work.  Some contracts provide that when the money from the retainer is gone, the fee is renegotiated. This is to be differentiated between a retainer in Commonwealth states, where a retainer is the contract that is initially signed by a client to engage a lawyer. Money may or may not be paid upfront, but the lawyer is still "retained".

==Amount of fees==
Attorney fees are negotiated between the attorney and client, subject to any limits imposed by state law and the general principle that an attorney fee must be reasonable. Although fee agreements in most cases can be oral agreements, it is good practice for lawyers to enter formal written fee agreements with their clients, and to clearly describe how fees are calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=David C.|title=Attorney Fees: Five Keys to Ethical Compliance|journal=GPSolo|date=October 2010|url=https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/solo_lawyer_ethics_fee_client_relationship.html|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hourly rates===
The range of fees charged by lawyers varies widely from one city to the next.  Most large [[law firm]]s in the United States bill between $200 and $1,000 per hour for their lawyers' time, though fees charged by smaller firms are much lower.  The rate varies tremendously by location as well as the specific area of law practiced. Typically insurance defense firms have lower hourly rates than non-insurance firms, but are compensated by having steady, regular paying work provided. Regional urban centers such as [[Salt Lake City]] will average $150 per hour for an associate's time on a basic case, but will increase for larger firms.

In the United States, lawyers typically earn between $100,000 and $200,000 per year, although earnings vary by age and experience, practice setting, sex, and race.&lt;ref&gt;United States Census Bureau, American Community Survey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Census Bureau, [https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html Current Population Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Labor, [http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231011.htm Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.du.edu/documents/directory/publications/sterling/AJD2.pdf After the JD II]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2016/06/will-the-new-york-times-correct-more-than-1-out-of-6-clear-factual-errors-in-noam-scheibers-coverage.html Why the New York Times Should Correct Remaining Factual Errors in Its Law School Coverage], Brian Leiter's Law School Reports&lt;/ref&gt;

Many surveys of hourly rates are done. The [[American Intellectual Property Law Association]] (AIPLA) commissions a survey of its members every two years and it publishes these in what it calls a "Report of the Economic Survey". The latest one is dated June 2007. Rates are collected for 14 geographic areas and by associate or partner.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.aipla.org for more information, although the Surveys are not made available online, but must be purchased.&lt;/ref&gt; Many courts have followed the rates shown by these AIPLA surveys and they are highly regarded for intellectual property litigation.

The [[Oregon State Bar|State Bar of Oregon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Hourly Rate Survey|url=http://www.osbar.org/surveys_research/08hourlyratesurvey|publisher=Oregon Bar Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Colorado Bar Association|Colorado State Bar]] have published surveys of rates for various areas of their states which are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Economic Survey |url=http://www.cobar.org/repository/LPM%20Dept/2010EconSurvey.pdf |publisher=Colorado Bar Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014091730/http://www.cobar.org//repository/LPM%20Dept/2010EconSurvey.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most widely followed set of rates are what is called the [[Laffey Matrix]] available from the [[United States Attorney for the District of Columbia|United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia]]. These have been available since 1982 and are updated annually. Hourly rates are shown by years of experience. For June 1, 2006, to May 31, 2007, the rates are as follows: 20+ years of experience, $425 per hour; 11–19 years, $375; 8–10 years, $305; 4–7 years, $245; 1–3 years, $205; and [[paralegals]] and [[law clerk]]s, $120.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/dc/Divisions/Civil_Division/Laffey_Matrix_6.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Laffey Matrix appears to be growing in acceptance by many courts throughout the United States, but the matrix must be adjusted to account for higher or lower costs for legal services in other areas.

Hourly rates are increasing almost every year and some lawyers charge substantially higher than the rates shown by the Laffey Matrix. The first American attorney to regularly charge a four-digit hourly fee ($1,000 and higher) was [[Benjamin Civiletti]] in late 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Soltis, "Lawyer Rai$es the Bar – First-ever 1G/hr. Fee," ''[[New York Post]]'', 13 December 2005, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contingent fees===
{{main|Contingent fee}}
A contigent fee, or contingency fee, is an attorney fee that is made contingent on the outcome of a case. A typical contingent fee in a [[tort]] case is normally one third to forty percent of the recovery, but the attorney does not recover a fee unless money is recovered for the client. States prohibit contingent fees in certain types of cases. For example, most states forbid contingent fees in criminal cases. States typically require that a fee agreement that involves a contingent fee be reduced to writing and signed by the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Lawyer Fee Agreements and Retainers|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer-protection/lawyer-fee-agreements-and-retainers|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fee arrangements===
With the ongoing recession of the 2000s, corporate clients began driving attorneys increasingly toward alternative fee arrangements (AFAs), which can include flat fees (per matter), fixed fees (for a "book" of matters), success bonuses, and other options.&lt;ref name="AFAs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2009/06/success-of-alternative-fees-depends-on-trust.html|title=GCs, Law Firms, and Flat Fee Arrangements: A Matter of Trust|work=typepad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent studies suggest that when lawyers charge a fixed-fee rather than billing by the hour, they work less hard on behalf of clients and client get worse outcomes.&lt;ref name="Brian Leiter's Law School Reports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amanda Y. Agan"/&gt;

===Regulation of attorney fees===
In some types of cases, such as [[workers' compensation]] cases, attorney fees may be limited by statute, or subject to judicial review. Contingency fees in [[personal injury]] and [[medical malpractice]] cases are often capped by state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethics: Contingency Fees for Lobbyists|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/ethics/50-state-chart-contingency-fees.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, attorney fees may be subject to review for reasonableness. For example, in [[class action]] cases the court in which the case is resolved will review the attorney fees of class counsel for reasonableness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Theodore|last2=Miller|first2=Geoffrey P.|title=Attorney Fees in Class Action Settlements: An Empirical Study|journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies|date=March 2004|volume=1|issue=1|pages=27–78|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2004.00002.x/full|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a landmark 1985 decision, ''Walters v. National Association of Radiation Survivors'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held that statutory restrictions on attorney's fees are subject only to highly deferential [[rational basis review]] when challenged as limitations upon the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to freedom of speech and the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right to [[due process]].&lt;ref name="walters"&gt;''Walters v. National Ass'n of Radiation Survivors'', {{ussc|473|305|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, if the legislature can articulate ''any'' rational basis for restricting attorney's fees, the court must defer to the legislature's considered judgment, and it would take an "extraordinarily strong showing" for a court to decide otherwise.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; The Court then held that Congress had a rational basis for restricting attorney's fees in veterans' benefits cases to $10.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;  In 2006, the statute at issue in ''Walters'' was heavily revised so as to remove the $10 attorney's fee restriction for most veterans' benefits cases. However, the principles articulated by the ''Walters'' court remain the law of the land for attorney's fees in general.&lt;ref&gt;''Department of Labor v. Triplett'', {{ussc|494|715|1990}} (applying ''Walters'' to attorney's fee restrictions in [[Black Lung Benefits Act of 1973]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson v. Daley'', 339 F.3d 582 (7th Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Long before the ''Walters'' case, conservatives in the United States had begun to put forward [[tort reform]] proposals to restrict attorney fees, which gained traction in the 1970s. Medical malpractice tort reforms often include maximum limits on plaintiffs' attorney fees, such as the percentage schedule in California's [[Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act]] of 1975. In 2004, [[Florida]] passed a constitutional amendment limiting contingent fees in [[medical malpractice]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&amp;Submenu=3#A01S26|title=Flsenate Archive: Statutes &amp; Constitution &gt; Constitution|work=flsenate.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=June 2011|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use [[Cite web]] or similar to provide source details.}}

Although some people have objected to these laws as an unfair restriction on [[freedom of contract]], Justice [[William Rehnquist]] shot down that argument in his majority opinion for the ''Walters'' court.&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Rehnquist implied that there was no principled way for the Court to overturn such laws as a violation of freedom of contract without returning to the now-discredited paternalism of the [[Lochner era]], in which the Court had routinely invoked freedom of contract as an excuse to overturn laws regulating [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wages]] and [[Child labor laws in the United States|child labor]].&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] filed a [[dissenting opinion]] in which he specifically attacked the majority opinion on that point, among others; he began and ended his dissent with the accusation that the majority "does not appreciate the value of individual liberty".&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt;

==Who pays==
Most countries operate under a "loser pays" system, sometimes called the [[English rule (attorney's fees)|English rule]] (in [[Law of England and Wales|English law]] it is described as "costs following the event"). Under the English rule, the losing party pays the successful party's legal costs (including lawyers' fees), as well as other court costs. The United States is a notable exception, operating under the [[American rule (attorney's fees)|American rule]], whereby each party is generally liable only for costs (i.e., [[photocopying]] fees, filing fees, etc.) ''but not'' the other side's attorney's fees unless a specific statute or rule of court provides otherwise. Some [[tort reform]] advocates propose adopting a "loser pays" rule in the United States. [[Federal district court]] and [[United States Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] judges award costs to the prevailing party under [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] 54.&lt;ref&gt;FRCP 54(d)&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions, statutes may permit [[judge]]s and [[jury|juries]] to independently impose "loser pays"; for example, a judge may say: "I am ruling for the plaintiff on the amount of $[sum] plus all court costs and attorney fees". But generally, state court judges have no ''common law'' authority to award such fees against the losing party. Some [[Settlement (law)|settlement agreements]], [[arbitration]] agreements and other extrajudicial [[contract]]s may also stipulate a loser-pays arrangement.

A number of federal laws provide for an award of attorney fees for a prevailing [[plaintiff]], such as:
* [[Antitrust]] actions
* [[Civil rights]] violations, see [[Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976]]
* [[Class action]]s
* [[Copyright]] and [[patent]] cases
* [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] violations
* [[Lemon law]] cases
* Suits against the [[federal government]] where the position of the government was not "substantially justified"

Note that these "fee shifting" awards are a characteristic of the law enforced and do not necessarily depend upon the court in which they were brought; state courts can and do sometimes hear lawsuits brought under federal law. So if, for example, a person brings a civil rights action in state court and wins, he may be entitled to an award of attorney fees.

Most states have statutes under which attorneys' fees may be awarded to a prevailing plaintiff, such as an action on a contract where the contract contains a provision allowing recovery, or an action brought under [[consumer protection]] laws. Both plaintiffs and defendants are sometimes awarded attorneys fees in divorce and [[child custody]] actions, although this is an unusual circumstance, since such awards are made under the court's power to divide property or award [[alimony]] and [[child support]].

A majority of states allow generally for an award to any party in a lawsuit, if another party has forced him to expend money on attorneys fees to defend against a claim utterly or substantially lacking any possible merit and brought in bad faith (frequently called "abusive litigation" or a "frivolous lawsuit"). For example, in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], a trial court ''must'' award attorneys fees if a party has brought a claim "with respect to which there existed such a complete absence of any justiciable issue of law or fact that it could not be reasonably believed that a court would accept the asserted claim, defense, or other position".&lt;ref&gt;O.C.G.A. § 9-15-14(a).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a trial court ''may'', but is not required to, award attorney's fees if a party has made a claim "that lacked substantial justification or...was interposed for delay or harassment, or if [the opposing party] unnecessarily expanded the proceeding by other improper conduct".&lt;ref&gt;O.C.G.A. § 9-15-14(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways of calculating prevailing-party attorney fees. Most courts recognize that actual costs may be disproportionate and inequitable. Thus, many [[jurisdiction]]s rely on other calculations. Many courts or laws invoke a ''lodestar''' calculation: reasonably expected billable hours multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate, sometimes multiplied by a factor reflecting the risk or complexity of the case. Courts in class actions frequently award fees proportionate to the damages recovered.  In 2013, a federal court awarded class counsel attorneys' fees totaling over $90 million for a $1.25 billion settlement in ''In Re Black Farmers Discrimination Litigation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Re Black Farmers Settlement Update 48|url=http://www.mysettlementclaims.com/blog/?p=1859|publisher=MySettlementClaims.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005]], which, among other provisions, regulates the fees that can be awarded in a class action, was passed in response to concerns that courts were not adequately overseeing the award of such fees.

The overriding principle in awarding attorney’s fees is reasonableness. Courts will often reduce attorney’s fee awards they find to be unreasonable and excessive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sterlinganalytics.com/category/publications/|title=Publications - Sterling Analytics|work=sterlinganalytics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples of unreasonable billing include; billing for [[Overhead (business)|overhead]], overstaffing for uncomplicated tasks, rebilling recycled work product, and billing for improbably long days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sterlinganalytics.com/fee-drivers/ |title=Fee Drivers |work=sterlinganalytics.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915010459/http://www.sterlinganalytics.com/fee-drivers/ |archivedate=2011-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the private sector, many companies now use [[legal auditing]] to determine whether their outside counsel is billing them for excessive legal fees.

A '''bench memorandum''' (pl. ''bench memoranda'') (also known as a ''bench memo'') is a short and neutral [[Memorandum|memo]] which summarizes the facts, issues, and arguments of a [[court case]]. Bench memos are used by the judge as a reference when preparing for trial, when hearing lawyers' arguments, when drafting a decision, and to give the judge an idea of the arguments given by each side in the court case.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100615173822/http://www.law.mercer.edu/academics/handouts/Drafting%20Judicial%20Opinions--JFP.doc&lt;/ref&gt; Bench memos are generally written by the judge's [[law clerk]], although lawyers can also submit their own memos that argue their case, so long as their memos remain neutral.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

{{Rights |Distinctions}}

Some [[philosophy|philosophers]] and [[political science|political scientists]] make a distinction between '''claim rights''' and '''liberty rights'''. A ''claim right'' is a [[rights|right]] which entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on other parties regarding the right-holder. In contrast, a ''liberty right'' is a right which does not entail obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christendom-awake.org/pages/may/rights.html|title=THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RIGHT AND A LIBERTY by Prof. William E. May|website=www.christendom-awake.org|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The distinction between these two senses of "rights" originates in American jurist [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld]]'s analysis thereof in his seminal work ''Fundamental Legal Conceptions, As Applied in Judicial Reasoning and Other Legal Essays''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MurUEJL/2005/9.html|title=Hohfeld's Analysis of Rights: An Essential Approach to a Conceptual &amp; Practical Understanding of the Nature of Rights - [2005] MurUEJL 9|website=classic.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so; and likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, that other person's liberty is thus limited. This is because the [[deontic logic|deontic]] concepts of obligation and permission&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tappolet|first=Christine|title=Evaluative vs. Deontic Concepts|date=2013-02-01|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee118|encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of Ethics|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee118|isbn=9781405186414|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[De Morgan dual]]; a person is permitted to do all and only the things he is not obliged to refrain from, and obliged to do all and only the things he is not permitted to refrain from.

==Overview==
A person's ''liberty right to x'' consists in his freedom to do or have ''x'', while a person's ''claim right to x'' consists in an obligation on others to allow or enable him to do or have ''x''. For example, to assert a ''liberty right'' to [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech|title=Free Speech|work=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/topic/free-speech|title=Free Speech|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to assert that you have permission to speak freely; that is, that you are not doing anything wrong by speaking freely. But that liberty right does not in itself entail that others are obligated to help you communicate the things you wish to say, or even that they would be wrong in preventing you from speaking freely. To say these things would be to assert a ''claim right'' to free speech; to assert that others are obliged to refrain (i.e. prohibited) from preventing you from speaking freely (that is, that it would be wrong for them to do so) or even perhaps obliged to aid your efforts at communication (that is, it would be wrong for them to refuse such aid). Conversely, such claim rights do not entail liberty rights; e.g. laws prohibiting [[vigilante justice]] (establishing a legal claim right to be free thereof) do not thereby condone or permit all the acts which such violent enforcement might otherwise have prevented.

To illustrate, a world with only liberty rights, without any claim rights, would by definition be a world wherein everything was permitted and no act or omission was prohibited; a world wherein none could rightly claim that they had been wronged or neglected. Conversely, a world with only claim rights and no liberty rights would be a world wherein nothing was merely permitted, but all acts were either obligatory or prohibited. The assertion that people have a claim right to liberty – i.e. that people are obliged only to refrain from preventing each other from doing things which are permissible, their liberty rights limited only by the obligation to respect others' liberty – is the central thesis of [[Liberalism|liberal]] theories of [[justice]].

==Second-order rights==
Hohfeld's original analysis included two other types of right: besides ''claims'' (or ''rights'' proper) and ''liberties'' (or ''privileges''), he wrote of ''powers'', and ''immunities''. The other two terms of Hohfeld's analysis, ''powers'' and ''immunities'', refer to second-order liberties and claims, respectively. Powers are liberty rights regarding the modification of first-order rights, e.g. the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] has certain powers to modify some of U.S. citizens' [[legal rights]], inasmuch as it can impose or remove legal duties. Immunities, conversely, are claim rights regarding the modification of first-order rights, e.g. U.S. citizens have, per their [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], certain immunities limiting the positive powers of the U.S. Congress to modify their legal rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/additional-amendments/|title=Additional Amendments - Bill of Rights Institute|work=Bill of Rights Institute|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As such, immunities and powers are often subsumed within claims and liberties by later authors, or grouped together into "active rights" (liberties and powers) and "passive rights" (claims and immunities)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freedman|first=R.|date=2014-02-01|title=UN Immunity or Impunity? A Human Rights Based Challenge|url=https://academic.oup.com/ejil/article/25/1/239/497359|journal=European Journal of International Law|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=239–254|doi=10.1093/ejil/cht082|issn=0938-5428}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

These different types of rights can be used as building blocks to explain relatively complex matters such as a particular piece of property. For example, a right to use one's computer can be thought of as a liberty right, but one has a power right to let somebody else use your computer (granting them a liberty right), as well as a claim right against others using the computer; and further, you may have ''immunity rights'' protecting your claims and liberties regarding the computer.

'''''Collymore v Attorney General''''' [1969] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1969/1969_11.pdf UKPC 11] is a case of the [[Privy Council]] relevant for [[UK labour law]], concerning the [[right to strike]].

==Facts==
Collymore and other trade union members for oil companies claimed that a new Industrial Stabilisation Act 1965 in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] was ultra vires the constitution, which guaranteed freedom of association. The Act required no strikes pending binding arbitration.

==Judgment==
The Privy Council advised that the Act did not breach the Constitution. Lord Donovan said the following:

{{Cquote|The question thus posed is therefore simply a question of construction. But the arguments presented for the appellants, based on the assertion that the right to free collective bargaining and the right to strike are essential elements in freedom of association in trade unions, led to a prolonged examination in the courts below as to whether there is in law any "right" to strike. The question does not really arise if the respondent's contention as above summarised is right: for if "freedom of association" does not of itself import freedom to bargain collectively and to do so effectively by means of a strike, it is immaterial whether strike action is or is not the exercise of a "right" or a "freedom" or the enjoyment of "an immunity." Since, however, the matter was exhaustively canvassed in the courts below, their Lordships may say that they are in substantial agreement with the analysis of the situation which emerged. It was agreed before their Lordships that trade union law in Trinidad and Tobago was the same as trade union law in Great Britain as at the date when the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, took effect. Neither before that date nor since has there been in Great Britain any express enactment by statute of any right to strike, although in certain quarters such an enactment is still advocated. At common law before the enactment of the [[Trade Union Act 1871]], the [[Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875]], and the amendment to section 3 thereof effected by section 1 of the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]], combinations of workmen to improve their wages and conditions were certainly in peril if in combination they withheld their labour or threatened to do so: but (subject to certain esoteric questions arising out of the decision in ''[[Rookes v Barnard]]'' [1964] AC 1129 and still unresolved by the [[Trade Disputes Act 1965]]) it is now well recognised that by reason of the statutes cited, as well as by decisions such as ''[[Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch]]'' [1942] AC 435 employees may lawfully withhold their labour in combination free from the restrictions and penalties which the common law formerly imposed. In this sense there is "freedom to strike."}}

'''Constant visual observation''', often abbreviated to "constant visual", is a term used in various [[Mental Health]] [[Service (economics)|Services]], [[Prison]]s and [[Special School]]s to describe the status of a prisoner or [[patient]] who poses a threat to himself or a third party, and must therefore be kept under constant observation.

There are essentially two levels of constant visual observations. The highest level, employed only for those patients who are considered to be extremely high risk to either themselves or a third party, involves a care worker remaining within arms reach of the service user at all times. The second level involves only maintaining a constant watch on a patient, sometimes from a distance.

Constant visual observations have been criticised by many service user groups.

A '''deed of gift''' is a signed [[Legal instrument|legal document]] that voluntarily and without [[Financial compensation|recompense]] transfers [[Ownership|ownership]] of [[real property|real]], [[personal property|personal]], or [[intellectual property]] – such as a [[Gift|gift]] of materials – from one person or institution to another. It should include any possible conditions specifying access, use, preservation, etc. of the gift, although these are generally discouraged by recipient institutions.

The [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]-language term '''''desafuero''''' refers to the process through which a government official's [[parliamentary immunity|official immunity]] to criminal prosecution is removed, i.e., [[impeachment]].

Strictly speaking the term is incorrect, as ''[[fuero]]'' (from Latin "forum") refers to the freedom of speech protection enjoyed by members of Congress, but since this protection is frequently confused with the immunity against criminal prosecution of top executive branch officials, the term is commonly used by the public in this latter sense.

In [[family law]], '''effects of marriage''' is a legal [[legal term of art|term of art]] used to describe all of the rights and obligations that individuals may be subject and entitled to if they are in a [[common-law marriage]], an [[annulment|annulled]] marriage, [[domestic partnership]] or a [[civil union]].

Thus, even if the underlying marriage is held to be void there may still be rights and obligations that continue and are recognized by [[court order]]. An example may be an annulled marriage where the court awards alimony to the weaker, poorer or less well educated spouse to allow them a period of time to go back to school or re-enter the work force.

There are a few positive and negative influences of marriage on an individual.  First of all, an individual becomes excited that they will begin to share their life with someone who cares for them, and whom they feel comforted by. They will feel excited to know that soon they will be starting a family of their own, and that they will become parents of their own children.  Research has shown that those individuals who live a stable marital relationship tend to live longer, have a better physical health, better functional health at old age and better emotional health than those in troubled marriages or who are divorced.

On the other hand, there a few negative influences of marriage on an adult.  An adult can become stressed out on the fact that they will need to make compromises and sacrifices, in order to form a good marital relationship.  This can lead to a loss of hobbies, because there are restrictions about what the individuals can do; and these restrictions are for both the men and women in the relationship.  The adult may develop a sense of stress because they have a lot of responsibility ahead of them.  In addition, the individuals in the relationship can become upset by the fact that they have to make sure that their relationship has no betrayals, and it is kept loyal, throughout the couple’s lives.

== Traditional marriage ==
Healthier people in marriages may have a better chance of having a successful marriage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/report/effects-marriage-health-synthesis-recent-research-evidence-research-brief#1|title=The Effects of Marriage on Health: A Synthesis of Recent Research Evidence. Research Brief|date=2016-04-11|work=ASPE|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A healthier person may be more appealing to their partner. Married people are generally happier than unmarried people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is said that marriage can affect person's health in many ways. For example, having a higher income could improve the health care person receives or lower stress. In certain marriages, a spouse may help in monitoring and encouraging healthy behaviors. As well as discouraging unhealthy habits. Marriage may provide an emotional fulfilling relationship. Which would satisfy the need for a social connection. This could have implications on a person's physical and mental health. Marriage is able to reduce depressive symptoms for both men and women. As marriage is able to reduce them, divorce is able to increase them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marriage can also be associated with less healthier behaviors. For example, alcohol consumption, drug use, cigarette smoking, diet, and exercise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Same-sex marriage ==
In [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex marriages]], marriage has a more positive effect than negative. Single persons in the same-sex world happen to be more distressed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wight|first=Richard G.|last2=LeBlanc|first2=Allen J.|last3=Lee Badgett|first3=M. V.|date=2013-2|title=Same-Sex Legal Marriage and Psychological Well-Being: Findings From the California Health Interview Survey |journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=103|issue=2|pages=339–346|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2012.301113 |pmc=3558785|pmid=23237155}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to same-sex marriage, heterosexuals have the lowest psychological distress. Lesbians, gays, and bisexuals who are not in a legalized marriages have the highest psychological distress.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Marriage diminishes mental health issues between people in the same-sex community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Polygamy ==
[[Polygamy|Polygamous marriages]] can have negative effects on women. Many women experience feelings of neglect and jealousy. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/polygamy-can-negatively-affect-women-study-finds-1.234509|title=Polygamy can negatively affect women, study finds|work=The National|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men, often times, are not fair when it comes to equally splitting their time. Although they may desire to be, they are not. It is possible that women rarely see their husbands or rarely have their needs met. This not only applies to women, but also their children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The severity of the negative effects depend on the tolerance and patience of the wife. In more serious cases, it can range from depression, tantrums, or illness. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Differences between sex, race, and education ==
In opposition to men, women are more likely to get married and remarried. Women are also more likely to get married younger. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2013/article/marriage-and-divorce-patterns-by-gender-race-and-educational-attainment.htm#_edn1|title=Marriage and divorce: patterns by gender, race, and educational attainment : Monthly Labor Review: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=Aughinbaugh,Alison;Robles,Omar;Sun,Hugette|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to Hispanics and Whites, Blacks were less likely to get married and more likely to get divorced.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; People who did not complete high school were less likely to get married over people who did complete high school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Divorce ==
As time goes on, many changes have affected divorce and marriage rates. Approximately 43% of people who get married at ages 15–16 get divorced. The rate for college marriages ending up in divorce, is a little less compared to high school. It happens to be 30%. Divorce rates decline as educational attainment increases. It is also said that people who marry later are less inclined to get divorced.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

{{Politics sidebar|Organs}}
The '''executive''' is the organ exercising [[authority]] in and holding [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for the governance of a [[State (polity)|state]]. The executive executes and enforces [[law]].

In [[political system]]s based on the principle of [[separation of powers]], [[authority]] is distributed among several branches (executive, [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Judiciary|judicial]])—an attempt to prevent the concentration of power in the hands of a small group of people. In such a system, the executive does not pass laws (the role of the legislature) or interpret them (the role of the judiciary). Instead, the executive enforces the law as written by the legislature and interpreted by the judiciary. The executive can be the source of certain types of law, such as a [[decree]] or [[executive order]].  Executive bureaucracies are commonly the source of [[regulation]]s.

In the [[Westminster system|Westminster political system]], the principle of separation of powers is not as entrenched. Members of the executive, called [[Minister (government)|ministers]], are also members of the legislature, and hence play an important part in both the writing and enforcing of law.

In this context, the executive consists of a leader(s) of an office or multiple offices.  Specifically, the top leadership roles of the executive branch may include:

*[[head of state]] – often the [[supreme leader]], the [[president]] or [[monarch]], the chief public representative and living symbol of national unity. 
**[[head of government]] – often the ''[[de facto]]'' leader, [[prime minister]], overseeing the administration of all affairs of state.
***[[defence minister]] – overseeing the [[armed forces]], determining military policy and managing external safety.
***[[interior minister]] – overseeing the [[police forces]], enforcing the law and managing internal safety. 
***[[foreign minister]] – overseeing the [[diplomatic service]], determining [[foreign policy]] and managing [[foreign relations]].
***[[finance minister]] – overseeing the treasury, determining [[fiscal policy]] and managing [[national budget]].
***[[justice minister]] – overseeing criminal prosecutions, corrections, enforcement of court orders.
 
In a [[presidential system]], the leader of the executive is both the ''head of state and head of government''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Executive Branch|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/executive-branch|website=The White House|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[parliamentary system]], a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] [[minister (government)|minister]] [[vote of no confidence|responsible to the]] [[legislature]] is the head of government, while the head of state is usually a largely ceremonial monarch or president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Branch of Government in Canada|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/House/compendium/web-content/c_d_executivebranchgovernmentcanada-e.htm|website=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its goals was to complete the "voids" of legal order&lt;ref&gt;See also [[A Theory of Legal Order]]&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilling them with scientific elements, so denying law as the unique source of that order.&lt;ref name="TRADULEX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradulex.org/Actes2000/kasirer.pdf|title=François Gény's "Libre Recherche Scientifique" as a Guide to Legal Translation|author=Kasirer, Nicholas|publisher=Tradulex.org|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CONTJUR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conteudojuridico.com.br/monografia-tcc-tese,a-hermeneutica-na-aplicacao-dos-principios-juridicos,23352.html|title=A Hermenêutica na Aplicação dos Princípios Jurídicos|author=Mendonça, Aline Cala|date=12 March 2009|publisher=Conteúdo Jurídico|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thinking paradigm emphasizes the use of [[Equity (law)|equity]] as source of the law.&lt;ref name="STUD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studility.com/?q=node/16|title=La réalisation du droit|publisher=Studility|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JUSNAV2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/9032/estudos-sobre-interpretacao-constitucional|title=Estudos sobre Interpretação Constitucional|author=Chamone, Marcelo Azevedo|date=September 2006|publisher=Jus Navigandi|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free scientific research and ''nature of things'' ==
The free scientific school has elements which have come from the philosophical school called the ''[[Nature (philosophy)|nature of things]]''.&lt;ref name="HASSO"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6cfY3iaYnsC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321|last=Hasso|first=Hofmann|title=A Treatise of Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence - From Jhering to Hadbruch|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-90-481-2963-8|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISCSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscsp.utl.pt/~cepp/autores/franceses/geny.htm|title=Gény, François|publisher=Insituto Superior de Ciências Sociais e Políticas da Universidade Técnica de Lisboa|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Confusion ==
The free scientific school may not be identified to the ''[[natural law]]'', they are different concepts.&lt;ref name="JUSCOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jus.com.br/revista/texto/6751/o-processo-do-conhecimento-humano-e-as-correntes-do-pensamento-juridico|title=O Processo do Conhecimento Humano e as Correntes do Pensamento Jurídico|author=Borges, José Ademir Campos|date=June 2004|publisher=Jus Navigandi|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can also be confusion between free scientific with ''free law''.&lt;ref&gt;This school denies application of imposed law when unfair in the concrete case&lt;/ref&gt; These two schools are not identical one to the other.&lt;ref name="BUSCAUFSC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buscalegis.ufsc.br/revistas/files/anexos/15235-15236-1-PB.htm|title=O Direito Alternativo e a Escola do Direito Livre|author=Liberato, Gustavo Tavares Cavalcanrti|publisher=Buscalegis|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Position of the school between other thinking paradigms ==
As said above, this school is a start in facing the challenges of adjusting juspositivism to a value-oriented paradigm.

In the 1760s [[William Blackstone]] described the '''Fundamental Laws of England''' in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]], Book the First – Chapter the First : Of the Absolute Rights of Individuals''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk1ch1.htm The Avalon Project : Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329045450/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk1ch1.htm |date=2013-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as "the absolute [[Rights of Englishmen|rights of every Englishman]]" and traced their basis and evolution as follows:
*[[Magna Carta]] between [[John, King of England|King John]] and his barons in 1215
*confirmation of Magna Carta by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in 1216, 1217, and 1225
*''Confirmatio Cartarum'' ([[Confirmation of Charters]]) 1253
*a multitude of subsequent corroborating statutes, from [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] to [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]
*the [[Petition of Right]], a parliamentary declaration in 1628 of the liberties of the people, assented to by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]
*more concessions made by King Charles I to his Parliament
*many laws, particularly the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]], passed under [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]
*the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] assented to by [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]]
*the [[Act of Settlement 1701]]

Blackstone's list was an 18th-century constitutional view, and the [[Union of the Crowns]] had occurred in 1603 between [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and the 1628 Petition of Right had already referred to the ''fundamental laws'' being violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/361/361-24.htm|title=1625-29: Charles I - the first crisis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=wisc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recorded usage==

The phrase ''Fundamental Laws of England'' has often been used by those opposing particular legislative, royal or religious initiatives.

For example, in 1641 the [[House of Commons of England]] protested that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was "... subverting the fundamental laws of England and Ireland....",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://personal.pitnet.net/primarysources/protests.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2004-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407010049/http://personal.pitnet.net/primarysources/protests.html |archive-date=2004-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; part of a campaign ending in 1649 with the [[beheading]] of King Charles I.

Subsequently, the phrase was used by the [[Leveller]] Lieut. Col. [[John Lilburne]] (later to become a [[Quaker]]) accusing the [[House of Lords]] and House of Commons of tyranny in ''The Just Defence of John Lilburne, Against Such as charge him with Turbulency of Spirit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.strecorsoc.org/docs/defence2.html|title=The Just Defence of John Lilburne (Part 2)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031219101110/http://www.strecorsoc.org/docs/defence2.html|archive-date=2003-12-19|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilburne also wrote a 1646 book called ''The Legal Fundamental Liberties of the People of England, asserted, revived and vindicated''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.strecorsoc.org/docs/vindicated2.html|title=The Levellers (False so called) Vindicated|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040102172147/http://www.strecorsoc.org/docs/vindicated2.html|archive-date=2004-01-02|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1646, the [[General Court of Massachusetts]] referred to the Fundamental Laws of England in regard to the Magna Carta, while defending their representative and legislative autonomy in their address to the [[Long Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/sourcesconstitut00stev|title=Sources of the Constitution of the United States, considered in relation to colonial and English history|first=C. Ellis (Charles Ellis)|last=Stevens|date=3 August 1894|publisher=New York : Macmillan and co.|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1670 trial, [[William Penn]] called upon the phrase many times, including "... However, this I leave upon your Consciences, who are of the Jury (and my sole Judges) that if these Ancient Fundamental Laws, which relate to Liberty and Property, and (are not limited to particular Persuasions in Matters of Religion) must not be indispensably maintained and observed, Who can say he hath Right to the Coat upon his Back? ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/globalrights/religion/penn-trial.html |title=The Tryal of Wm.

In the 1774 pamphlet [[American Claim of Rights]], South Carolina's [[William Henry Drayton|Chief Justice William Drayton]] wrote 
&lt;blockquote&gt;That the Americans being descended from the same ancestors with the people of England, and owing fealty to the same [[The Crown|Crown]], are therefore equally with them, entitled to the common law of England formed by their common ancestors; and to all and singular the benefits, rights, liberties and claims specified in Magna Charta, in the petition of Rights, in the Bill of Rights, and in the Act of Settlement. They being no more than principally declaratory of the grounds of the fundamental laws of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.schistory.org/displays/RevWar/archives-online/Gibbes__v__1__p__011b.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2004-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040312142152/http://www.schistory.org/displays/RevWar/archives-online/Gibbes__v__1__p__011b.html |archive-date=2004-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other famous subscribers to the phrase include [[Edward Coke|Lord Coke]] (1522&amp;ndash;1634), [[Emerich de Vattel]] (1714&amp;ndash;1767), and [[Samuel Adams]] (1722&amp;ndash;1803).

==Unwritten history==

[[John Locke|Locke]]'s view in ''... Civil Government'' 1690 was "..., that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions; ...". This philosophy was in keeping with the view that the Fundamental Laws predated the Magna Carta in both [[custom (law)|custom]] and [[natural law]]. Influenced by Locke, the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]] stated: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

For those who believed that the Fundamental Laws of England predated the Magna Carta, there was debate about whether they arose from [[time immemorial]], were somehow immanent to society, from post-[[Roman law|Roman]] [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] times, or from various combinations of these and other origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/rpw_center/pdfs/PARKER.PDF|title=Constructing a Juridical Memory: The Antiquarian Response to the Union of Kingdoms|last=Parker|first=Brett|date=2002-08-04|website=vanderbilt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century and later==

In ''[[MacCormick v. Lord Advocate]]'' (1953), an action over the legitimacy of the numeric [[Style of the British Sovereign]], asserting only the style [[List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II#Royal titles and styles|Elizabeth I for Elizabeth II]] would only carry legal authority in Scotland [[Lord President Cooper]] gave judicial recognition to the concept of a "fundamental law" of Scotland that merged with that of England into the law of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the time of the [[Act of Union 1707]], a corpus of law which the supremacy of Parliament may not extend to altering as “the principle of unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle and has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law”. He raised as a hypothetical consideration the question of whether such fundamental laws could be judged by an English or Scottish [[court]] in the same manner as other countries consider constitutional cases. However, he left the matter open, saying "I reserve my opinion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawscot.org.uk/whatis/case8.html Transcript]from Law Scot website {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040421023411/http://www.lawscot.org.uk/whatis/case8.html |date=2004-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of [[parliamentary supremacy]] was upheld in the highest court by [[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]] in 1969:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is often said that it would be unconstitutional for the United Kingdom Parliament to do certain things, meaning that the moral, political and other reasons against doing them are so strong that most people would regard it as highly improper if Parliament did these things. But that does not mean that it is beyond the power of Parliament to do such things. If Parliament chose to do any of them the courts would not hold the Act of Parliament invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Madzimbamuto v. Lardner-Burke|vol=1|reporter=AC|opinion=645|pinpoint=723|court=UKPC|date=1969|url=http://iclr.co.uk/document/1961002667/casereport_71129/html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under this precedent, Parliament has the legal authority to do anything, even though its Acts might contradict common-law [[principles of natural justice]]. The classic rebuttal or at least qualification is expressed by [[Albert Venn Dicey]], whose 1885 text ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'' argues that the [[democratic legitimacy|will of the electorate]] must ultimately prevail over any attempt at tyranny: it is "a political, not a legal fact" that fundamental principles of natural justice cannot be denied. This implies that in most scenarios principles of the Fundamental Laws can be upheld by [[statutory interpretation]] or as an alternative since 1998 by issuing a [[Declaration of incompatibility]].

Laws LJ in ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]'' [2002] EWHC 195 (Admin) at [62] recognised what he called "constitutional statutes":

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the present state of its maturity the common law has come to recognise that there exist rights which should properly be classified as constitutional or fundamental: see for example such cases as Simms [2000] 2 AC 115 per Lord Hoffmann at 131, Pierson v Secretary of State [1998] AC 539, [R v] Leech [1994] QB 198, Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers Ltd. [1993] AC 534, and [R v] Witham [1998] QB 575. And from this a further insight follows. We should recognise a hierarchy of Acts of Parliament as it were: "ordinary" statutes and "constitutional" statutes. The two categories must be distinguished on a principled basis. In my opinion a constitutional statute is one which (a) conditions the legal relationship between citizen and State in some general, overarching manner, or (b) enlarges or diminishes the scope of what we would now regard as fundamental constitutional rights. (a) and (b) are of necessity closely related: it is difficult to think of an instance of (a) that is not also an instance of (b). The special status of constitutional statutes follows the special status of constitutional rights. Examples are the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act of Union, the Reform Acts which distributed and enlarged the franchise, the HRA, the Scotland Act 1998 and the Government of Wales Act 1998. The [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|ECA]] clearly belongs in this family. It incorporated the whole corpus of substantive Community rights and obligations, and gave overriding domestic effect to the judicial and administrative machinery of Community law. It may be there has never been a statute having such profound effects on so many dimensions of our daily lives. The ECA is, by force of the common law, a constitutional statute. (cf [[obiter dictum|obiter]] remarks by the House of Lords in ''Watkins v Home Office'' [2006] UKHL 17 at [62])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004 the [[Joint Committee]] (of the House of Commons and House of Lords) overseeing the drafting of the Civil Contingencies Bill published its first report in which, among other things, suggested:
*Amending the proposed clauses, operative in a State of Emergency, that would grant [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|the Cabinet]], by Emergency Regulations, the power "to disapply or modify any [[Act of Parliament]]" on the grounds that such a clause is overly wide.
*An amendment to preclude changes to the following Acts, which, it suggested, formed "the fundamental parts of constitutional law" of the United Kingdom:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200203/jtselect/jtdcc/184/18407.htm#a44|title=Joint Committee on Draft Civil Contingencies Bill - First Report|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Lords/Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Judicial interpretation}}
The '''golden rule''' in [[English law]] is one of the rules of [[statutory interpretation|statutory construction]] traditionally applied by English courts. The rule can be used to avoid the consequences of a [[plain meaning rule|literal interpretation]] of the wording of a statute when such an interpretation would lead to a manifest absurdity or to a result that is obnoxious to principles of [[public policy]]. The rule can be applied in two different ways, named respectively the ''narrower approach'' and the ''wider approach''.

==History==

In ''Becke v Smith'' (1836) [[James Parke, 1st Baron Wensleydale|Justice Parke]] (later Lord Wensleydale) stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is a very useful rule in the construction of a [[statute]] to adhere to the ordinary meaning of the words used, and to the grammatical construction, unless that is at variance with the intention of the [[legislature]] to be collected from the statute itself, or leads to any manifest absurdity or repugnance, in which case the language may be varied or modified so as to avoid such inconvenience but no further.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Twenty years later, Lord Wensleydale restated the rule in different words in ''Grey v. Pearson'' (1857):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]n construing statutes, and all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified, so as to avoid that absurdity or inconsistency, but not farther.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Narrower approach== 

The rule may be applied in the narrower sense where there is some ambiguity or absurdity in the words themselves.&lt;ref name="LawMentor"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lawmentor.co.uk/glossary/G/golden-rule/ |title= 
 Golden rule  |website=LawMentor |access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the leading case of ''R v Allen ''(1872) the defendant was charged with [[bigamy]] under Section 57 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] which made it an offence to marry whilst one's spouse is still alive and not divorced.  The court held that the word 'marry' could not in that context mean 
'become legally married' since that could never apply to someone who is already married to someone else. To make sense of the provision, the word should be interpreted as meaning to 'go through a second ceremony of marriage'.&lt;ref name="LawMentor"/&gt;

==Wider approach==   
In its wider sense the rule may be used to avoid a result that is obnoxious to principles of [[public policy]], even where words may prima facie carry only one meaning. 

The rule was applied in this sense in ''In re Sigsworth''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=ICLR Case Reports: High Court Chancery Division. 1935 Vol. 1|publisher=The Incorporated Council for Law Reporting for England and Wales|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1935) in the context of the [[Administration of Estates Act 1925]].  A man had murdered his mother and then committed suicide. Under the plain terms of section 46, as the woman had died [[intestacy|intestate]] her son stood to inherit substantially her entire estate, which would then have passed to his descendants. This was challenged by other members of the woman's family. The court used the golden rule to find in favour of the family, preventing the son's descendants as a matter of public policy from profiting from his crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ox.libguides.com/content.php?pid=141334&amp;sid=1205598|publisher=Oxford University - UK Law guide|title=Unlocking UK case citations|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sharon Hanson|title=Legal Method, Skills and Reasoning|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-45851-1|year=2009|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule as applied in that particular case has subsequently been put onto a statutory footing in the [[Forfeiture Act 1982]] and the [[Estates of Deceased Persons (Forfeiture Rule and Law of Succession) Act 2011]].

The leading case on the wider approach is ''Adler v George'' (1964) in which the defendant was charged with obstructing a military guard in the execution of his duty. In order to succeed, the prosecution had to show that the act took place ‘in the vicinity of’ a military establishment. The defendant argued that ‘in the vicinity’ meant 'outside or in the proximity or area' of the establishment, whereas he was in fact inside. The court decided that such an interpretation would lead to an absurd result, and interpreted ‘in the vicinity of’ to cover a person already on the premises.&lt;ref name="LawMentor"/&gt;

The '''Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters''', more commonly called the '''Hague Service Convention''', is a [[multilateral treaty]] which was adopted in [[The Hague]], The [[Netherlands]], on 15 November 1965 by member states of the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]]. It came into existence to give litigants a reliable and efficient means of [[service of proces|serving]] the documents on parties living, operating or based in another country. The provisions of the convention apply to service of process in civil and commercial matters but not criminal matters. Also, [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/full-text/?cid=17 Article 1] states that the Convention shall not apply if the address of the person to be served with the document is not known.

== Diplomatic service via letters rogatory ==
{{Main|Letter rogatory}}

For states which are not party to the Hague Service Convention, diplomatic channels are generally used for the service of legal documents. It is generally effected by a [[letter rogatory]], which is a formal request to issue a judicial order from a court in the state where proceedings are underway to a court in another state. This procedure generally requires transmission of the document to be served from the originating court to the foreign ministry in the state of origin. The foreign ministry in the state of origin forwards the request to the foreign ministry in the destination state. The foreign ministry then forwards the documents to the local court. The local court then makes an order to allow for the service. Once service is made, a certificate of service would then pass through the same channels in reverse. Under a somewhat more streamlined procedure, courts can sometimes forward service requests to the foreign ministry or the foreign court directly, cutting out one or more steps in the process.

== Procedure ==
The Hague Service Convention established a more simplified means for parties to effect service in other contracting states. Under the convention, each contracting state is required to designate a central authority to accept incoming requests for service. A judicial officer who is competent to serve process in the state of origin is permitted to send request for service directly to the central authority of the state where service is to be made. Upon receiving the request, the central authority in the receiving state arranges for service in a manner permitted within the receiving state, typically through a local court. Once service is effected, the central authority sends a certificate of service to the judicial officer who made the request. Parties are required to use three standardized forms: a request for service, a summary of the proceedings (similar to a summons), and a certificate of service.

The main benefits of the Hague Service Convention over letters rogatory is that it is faster (requests generally take two to four months rather than six months to one year), it uses standardized forms which should be recognized by authorities in other states, and it is cheaper (in most cases) because service can be effected by a local attorney without hiring a foreign attorney to advise on foreign service procedures.

The Hague Service Convention does not prohibit a receiving state from permitting international service by methods otherwise authorized by domestic law. For example, a state could allow for service directly by mail or by personal service. States which permit parties to use these alternative means of service make a separate designation in the documents they file upon ratifying or acceding to the Convention.

== Alternate methods of service ==
The Hague Convention provides various modes of process service of documents such as by postal channel or by diplomatic/consular agents, judicial officers, officials or other competent persons. These provisions are covered under Articles 8 to 10 and may or not be allowed by member countries as a valid mode of serving the documents in their territory. The method of serving the documents through the Central Agency (Article 5) is not optional but is binding on all the member countries. The services done by the Central Agency usually takes a long time: 4 to 12 months. The convention gives relief to the litigants if they have not received certificate of service or delivery from the Central Agency even after waiting for six months. In such cases, the Court may, if it considers that a reasonable time has elapsed, give its judgement. Also, in case of urgency, the court may issue a provisional order or protective measure even before six-month waiting period.  
  
=== Central Authority ===
Although the service is free, it may take 4 to 12 months for the Central Authority to process. The Central Authority decides which method is to be used. In many cases, a bailiff will be assigned by a local court to serve the documents and mail back the proof of service, but service by mail is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Service of Process in Hong Kong|url=https://plexus-pi.com/the-hague-convention/process-service-under-the-hague-convention/|website=www.plexus-pi.com|publisher=Plexus Investigative Solutions|accessdate=22 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808080125/https://plexus-pi.com/the-hague-convention/process-service-under-the-hague-convention/|archivedate=8 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service by mail ===
Service by mail is possible only in states that have not objected to that method under Article 10(a) of the convention and if the jurisdiction where the court case takes place allows it under its applicable law. It is therefore possible in France and the Netherlands but not in Germany, Switzerland, and South Korea, where incoming service to be effected exclusively through the state's central authority.&lt;ref name="List of states"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&amp;cid=17 |title=Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters: Status table |publisher=Hague Conference on Private International Law |accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the interpretation of a provision in Article 10(a) has long been controversial, as the judiciary in some of its jurisdictions contended that service by mail was impossible because the word "send" rather than "serve" was used in the English-language version of the convention. The matter was finally resolved in May 2017 by the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Water Splash, Inc. v. Menon]]'', bringing the interpretation in line with parties in other US jurisdictions and the rest of the world.

== Relation with other instruments ==
Under the convention, states may conclude different agreements between them that take precedence over the convention. Thus, in the [[European Union]] (except for [[Denmark]]) [[Service regulation|other rules]] are applied instead of the Convention.

==State parties==
{{As of|2017|July}}, 73 states are contracting parties of the Hague Service Convention. They include 61 of the 82 Hague Conference on Private International Law member states in addition to 12 other states.&lt;ref name="List of states"/&gt;

{{TopicTOC-Law}}

This collection of '''[[lists of law topics]]''' collects the names of topics related to [[law]]. Everything related to law, even quite remotely, should be included on the alphabetical list, and on the appropriate topic lists.  All links on topical lists should also appear in the main alphabetical listing. The process of creating lists is ongoing&amp;nbsp;– these lists are neither complete nor up-to-date&amp;nbsp;– if you see an article that should be listed but is not (or one that shouldn't be listed as legal but is), please update the lists accordingly. You may also want to include [[Wikipedia:Wikiproject Law|Wikiproject Law]] talk page banners on the relevant pages.

{{Insolvency}}
'''[[Bankruptcy|Insolvency]] law of Russia''' mainly includes Federal Law № 127-FZ "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)" and Federal Law № 40-FZ "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Credit Institutions".
Federal Law № 127-FZ "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)" dated 26 October 2002 (as amended) (the "Bankruptcy Act"), replacing the previous law in 1998, to better address the above problems and a broader failure of the action.
Russian insolvency law is intended for a wide range of borrowers: individuals and companies of all sizes, with the exception of state-owned enterprises, government agencies, political parties and religious organizations. There are also special rules for insurance companies, professional participants of the securities market, agricultural organizations and other special laws for financial institutions and companies in the [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] in the energy industry.
Federal Law № 40-FZ "On [[Bankruptcy|Insolvency (Bankruptcy)]] of Credit Institutions" dated 25 February 1999 (as amended) (the "Insolvency Law of Credit Institutions") contains special provisions in relation to the opening of insolvency proceedings in relation to the credit company. Insolvency Provisions Act, credit organizations used in conjunction with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.

Bankruptcy law provides for the following stages of insolvency proceedings:
* Monitoring procedure or Supervision (nablyudeniye);
* The economic recovery (finansovoe ozdorovleniye);
* External control (vneshneye upravleniye);
* Liquidation (konkursnoye proizvodstvo) and
* Comprehensive Agreement (mirovoye soglasheniye).

The main face of the [[bankruptcy]] process is the insolvency officer (trustee in bankruptcy). At various stages of bankruptcy, he has to be determined: the temporary officer, external control, the receiver or administrative officer. During the bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy (insolvency officer) has a decisive influence on the movement of assets (property) of the debtor - the debtor and has a key influence on the economic and legal aspects of its operations.

Insolvency Officer (Trustee in [[bankruptcy]]) performs the some functions of the head of the debtor and has a right to decide how the company - the debtor will continue its work, in what order will curl or develop its activities, which assets (property) will be put up for sale and under what conditions, as well as a variety of legal issues last and present activities of the debtor.

Insolvency official state vary depending on the stage of the proceedings. It will:
* Interim Officer (vremenniy upravlyayuschiy) in the monitoring phase;
* Administrative Officer (administrativniy upravlyayuschiy) in the economic scenario of rehabilitation;
* External Manager (vneshniy upravlyayuschiy) in the management of external and
* Settlement Officer (konkursniy upravlyayuschiy) in liquidation.

The powers of the liquidator, depending on the phase of the competition depends on the question. For example, the interim manager has no right to manage the affairs of the debtor during the monitoring step, but has the right to do so at a later stage.
In the settlement process, current liabilities have priority and are satisfied before other claims are met.
Claims priority:
* First, the claims for damages to life or human health and moral damage;
* Second, the claim for breach obligations in respect of salaries and other payments to the relation to employment and royalties and
* Third, other requirements, with the exception of required by the above described procedure, it can still be to the satisfaction of all rights to satisfy the priority.

The agreement between the debtor, creditors and the company under [[bankruptcy]] may be reached at any stage of the proceedings. The agreement on the settlement on behalf of the debtor must be entered:
* Executive Director of the debtor in the period of monitoring and financial recovery;
* External administrator in the phase of external control, and
* Elimination of a manager in the settlement process.
Settlement Agreement on behalf of the bankruptcy creditors and authorized bodies need a simple majority (50% + 1 vote) approved the bankruptcy creditors and authorized bodies for the meeting of creditors.

The '''International Law Association''' ('''ILA''') is a non-profit organization based in [[Great Britain]] that — according to its constitution — promotes "the study, clarification and development of international law" and "the furtherance of international understanding and respect for international law".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=International Law Association|title=About Us|year=2015|location=London|publisher=ILA|url=http://www.ila-hq.org/en/about_us/index.cfm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013065635/http://www.ila-hq.org/en/about_us/index.cfm|archivedate=2015-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ILA was founded in [[Brussels]] in 1873 and its present-day headquarters are in [[London]]. It holds biennial (once in 2 years) conferences and releases reports of the same for use of the international community. Members as well as outsiders are allowed to participate in the conference, at a cost. The ILA maintains several committees and study groups that analyze specific facets of international law. The findings of these groups are distributed to its members several times a year.

The 78th biennial Conference of the ILA took place in August 2018 in Sydney, Australia. 

== Branches ==
The ILA operates through branches which are regional but are often limited to one state only. There are currently 62 branches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ila-hq.org/index.php/branches&lt;/ref&gt;

Politics in the European Union, 2nd ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;For a critical view on the concept of ''judicial activism'' in regard to the ECJ, see Grimmel, Andreas (2014).

==Cases==
In the [[Cassis de Dijon Case]], the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled the German laws prohibiting sales of liquors with alcohol percentages between 15% and 25% conflicted with [[EU laws]]. This ruling confirmed that [[EU law]] has [[wikt:primacy|primacy]] over [[member-state law]].&lt;ref&gt;EUabc – Cassis de Djion case: http://en.euabc.com/word/140&lt;/ref&gt;
When the [[treaties]] are unclear, they leave room for the Court to interpret them in different ways. When [[EU treaties]] are negotiated, it is difficult to get all governments to agree on a clear set of laws. In order to get a compromise, governments agree to leave a decision on an issue to the Court. &lt;ref&gt; Bache, Ian and Stephen George (2006). Politics in the European Union, 2nd ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
The Court can only practice [[judicial activism]] to the extent the EU Governments leave room for interpretation in the [[treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;Moravcsik, A. (2002) ‘In defense of the democratic deficit: reassessing legitimacy in the European Union’ Journal of Common Market Studies. Vol 40, Issue 4 &lt;/ref&gt;
The Court makes important rulings that set the agenda for further [[EU integration]], but it cannot happen without the consensual support of the [[member-states]].&lt;ref&gt;Moravcsik, A. (2002) ‘In defense of the democratic deficit: reassessing legitimacy in the European Union’ Journal of Common Market Studies. Vol 40, Issue 4 &lt;/ref&gt;
The most recent case of [[judicial activism]] of the [[European Court of Justice]] is the [[Metock case]] which determined that the strict [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[Irish immigration laws]] conflict with [[EU laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Metock case brings down Danish immigration laws http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/3457&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lisbon Treaty==
In the [[Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty]] many issues not directly related to the treaty, such as [[abortion]] were included in the debate because of worries that the [[Lisbon Treaty]] will enable the [[European Court of Justice]] to make activist rulings in these areas.
After the rejection of the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in Ireland, the [[Irish Government]] received concessions from the rest of the [[member states of the European Union]] to make written guarantees that the EU will under no circumstances interfere with Irish abortion, taxation or military neutrality. &lt;ref&gt;Irish secure concessions on Lisbon Treaty: http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2008/12/irish-secure-concessions-on-lisbon-treaty/63409.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ireland]] voted on the [[Lisbon Treaty]] a second time in 2009, with a 67.13% majority voting Yes to the treaty.

'''Law and development''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] study of law and economic and [[social development]].  It examines the relation between law and development and analyzes how to use law as an instrument to promote economic and social development.

In the 1960s, some American organizations such as the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] and the [[Ford Foundation]] sponsored the law reform in [[developing countries]]. Legal scholars from leading American law schools wrote many articles discussing the contribution of law reform to economic development.  This was called the law and development movement. However, after only one decade, both key involved scholars and former [[Ford Foundation]] officials declared this movement failed.&lt;ref&gt;Trubek &amp; Galanter (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The presumably failed law and development revived in the 1980s, with the proliferation of law reform projects based on neoliberal ideals. These projects supported liberal reforms such as privatization and trade liberalization, with the emphasis on the rule of law. Substantial investments were made on these projects by international development agencies such as the World Bank, USAID, and other public agencies and private foundations, but these law reform projects were criticized for being ineffective or causing adverse impacts on development in many places in the world. 

The cause of the failure in the first and second law and development movements is that the law reform projects were developed and implemented without sufficient understanding of the mechanism by which LFIs impact economic and social development, which is affected by various socio-economic factors on the ground. &lt;ref&gt;Lee (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.lawanddevelopment.net The Law and Development Institute] was set up in 2009 to promote studies in law and development and develop a comprehensive analytical model for law and development, and the [http://www.degruyter.com/ldr Law and Development Review] was launched in 2008 as the only peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to law and development.

'''Legal practice''' is sometimes used to distinguish the body of judicial or administrative [[precedent]]s, [[regulation|rule]]s, [[policy|policies]], [[Custom (law)|custom]]s, and [[doctrine]]s from legislative [[enactment (British legal term)|enactments]] such as [[statute]]s and [[constitution]]s which might be called "laws" in the strict sense of being commands to the general public, rather than only to a set of parties.&lt;ref&gt;''Anastasoff v. United States'', 223 F.3d 898, 903 (8th Cir. 2000). Discussed in "Precedent and Judicial Power after the Founding", Polly J. Price, ''Bostom College L.R.'', Vol. 42 No. 1, Dec. 2000, pg. 81-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==England from Henry II==

===Common law forms of pleading: Writs===

In the legal practice that emerged in royal courts under [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] any case had to fit into a narrowly defined form of pleading usually called a "writ". By the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] the number of such writs had grown to over 500, but even that many did not cover all the possible claims that people sought to make.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rembar, ''The Law of the Land: The Evolution of Our Legal System'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1980. Pp. 172''ff''. {{ISBN|0-06-097219-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Provisions of Oxford]] in 1258 forbade the royal clerks to create any new writs. The result of this was that the courts began to adopt "fictions" such as imaginary parties or actors so that the facts of a case could be fit within one of the established forms, and the [[Writ of Trespass]] came to become the catchall form for most claims.&lt;ref&gt;Rembar, ''Law of the Land'', p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to understand that, unlike much current practice, the writs of pleading were not court orders granting relief but the [[summons]], prepared by the plaintiff, filed with the court, and served on the respondent.

==United States==

===U.S. Constitution===

The nonconflicting parts of the English and American common law and its forms of pleading were explicitly incorporated into the U.S. Constitution.

[[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Field Code 1848===

By the middle of the 19th century strong resistance developed to the rigidities of the common law forms of pleading brought over from England, whose monarchical forms often conflicted with U.S. republican law that made the people the [[sovereign]].

[[New York State]] was the first to adopt a codification of legal forms and procedures, called the [[Field Code]] from its principal author, [[David Dudley Field II]]. Within a few years, most but not all other states adopted similar codes. One of the reforms made was to unite courts of law and equity. The reforms made it easier to get a case started without loading most of the argument and proof at the outset, and made discovery more important during the course of the case. However, there was opposition to the reforms,&lt;ref&gt;Is Codification of the Law Expedient?, by William B. Hornblower. Address delivered before the American Social Science Association (Department of Jurisprudence) at Saratoga, N.Y., September 6, 1888. [http://www.constitution.org/cmt/hornblower/cod_law_over.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt; and resistance from the legal profession, including judges, that prevented the codes from being implemented as intended.

===Federal Rules 1938===

Before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) were enacted in 1938, [[common law]] pleading was more formal, traditional, and particular in its phrases and requirements. For example, a plaintiff bringing a [[trespass]] suit would have to mention certain key words in his complaint or risk it being dismissed with prejudice. In contrast, the FRCP is based on a legal construction called '''[[notice pleading]]''', which is less formal, created and modified by legal experts, and far less technical in requirements. In notice pleading, the same plaintiff bringing suit would not face dismissal for lack of the exact legal term, so long as the claim itself was legally [[legal action|actionable]]. The policy behind this change is to simply give "notice" of your grievances, and leave the details for later in the case. This acts in the interest of [[Justice|equity]] by concentrating on the actual law and not the exact construction of pleas.

Thirty-five states have adopted versions of the federal rules as their own procedural code.

In addition to notice pleading, a minority of states (''e.g.'', [[California]]) use an intermediate system known as ''code pleading''. Code pleading is an older system than notice pleading and is based on legislative [[statute]]. It tends to straddle the gulf between obsolete common-law pleading and modern notice pleading. Code pleading places additional burdens on a party to plead the "ultimate facts" of its case, laying out the party's entire case and the facts or allegations underlying it. Notice pleading, by contrast, simply requires a "short and plain statement" showing only that the pleader is entitled to [[relief]]. (FRCP 8(a)(2)).  One important exception to this rule is that when a party alleges [[fraud]], that party must plead the [[fact]]s of the alleged fraud with particularity. (FRCP 9(b)).

There has been some controversy over whether the FCRP violate the Eighth Amendment requirement of common law rules, but the usual answer has been that the changes are only in form and not in substance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6003">'''Legal research''' is "the process of identifying and retrieving information necessary to support [[Law|legal]] decision-making.  In its broadest sense, legal research includes each step of a course of action that begins with an analysis of the facts of a problem and concludes with the application and communication of the results of the investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barkan|first1=Steven M.|last2=Bintliff|first2=Barbara|last3=Whisner|first3=Mary|title=Fundamentals of Legal Research|publisher=Foundation Press|isbn=1609300564|page=1|edition=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoD7rQEACAAJ|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The processes of legal research vary according to the country and the [[legal system]] involved. However, legal research generally involves tasks such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Perform Legal Research|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/links|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=25 February 2018|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Finding primary [[sources of law]], or [[primary authority]], in a given [[jurisdiction]] ([[Case law|cases]], [[statutes]], [[regulations]], etc.).
# Searching [[secondary authority]] (for example, [[law review]]s, [[Law dictionary|legal dictionaries]], [[legal treatise]]s, and legal encyclopedias such as [[American Jurisprudence]] and [[Corpus Juris Secundum]]), for background information about a legal topic. 
# Searching non-legal sources for investigative or supporting information.

Legal research is performed by anyone with a need for legal information, including [[lawyers]], law [[librarians]], and [[paralegals]]. Sources of legal information range from printed books, to free legal research websites (like [[Legal Information Institute|Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute]], [[Findlaw|Findlaw.com]], [[LexisNexis Martindale-Hubbell|Martindale Hubbell]] or [[CanLII]]) and information portals to fee database vendors such as [[Wolters Kluwer]], [[LexisNexis]], [[Westlaw]], [[VLex]] and [[Bloomberg Law]]. [[Law libraries]] around the world provide research services to help their patrons find the legal information they need in [[law school]]s, [[law firm]]s and other research environments. Many law libraries and institutions provide free access to legal information on the web, either individually or via [[collective action]], such as with the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].

A number of books are available for those wishing to undertake legal research in the UK context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Using a law library : A student's guide to legal research skills.|last=Clinch|first=Peter|publisher=Blackstone|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Butterworths legal research guide (2nd ed.)|last=Holborn|first=Guy|publisher=Butterworths|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dane &amp; Thomas : How to use a law library : An introduction to legal skills. (4th ed)|last=Knowles|first=J|last2=Thomas|first2=P|publisher=Sweet and Maxwell|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Databases and software tools==
===Free-to-use===
Although many jurisdictions publish laws online,&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{cite web|title=legislation.gov.uk|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; case law is often accessed through specialty online databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Law Online|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations.php|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=24 July 2017|date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free-to-access services, through the free law movement, include: [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]], [[British and Irish Legal Information Institute]], [[CanLII]], [[Legal Information Institute]], [[LexML Brasil]], World Legal Information Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WorldLII|url=http://worldlii.org/|website=World Legal Information Institute|publisher=AustLII|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindworks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mindworks|url=http://mindworks.altervista.org/|website=Altervisa|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jurispedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jurispedia|url=http://jurispedia.org/|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial===
Commercial services for legal research include both [[primary source|primary and secondary sources]]. Commercial services can be country-specific, international or comparative. As of 2010, commercial legal research tools in the United States generated an estimated $8 billion in revenues per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Russell|title=Bloomberg Hangs New Shingle|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704545004575353143750422612|accessdate=24 July 2017|agency=Wall Street Journal|date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some governments also provide access to certain resources through paid databases, such as the [[PACER (law)|United States PACER law system]].

==Third-Party Legal Research Providers==
Legal research is known to take much time and effort, and access to online legal research databases such as LexisNexis and Westlaw can be costly. Consequently, with due consideration given to ethical concerns, law firms and other practitioners may turn to third-party legal research providers to outsource their legal research needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Adam I.|last2=Lender|first2=David J.|title=Electronic Discovery: Law and Practice|date=2016|publisher=Aspen Publishers Online|isbn=1454815604|page=SA13-32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBWECwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, LexisNexis pioneered the electronic accessibility of legal and journalistic documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203721704577157211501855648?KEYWORDS=lexisnexis | newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | first=Stephen | last=Miller | title=For Future Reference, a Pioneer in Online Reading | date=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, the company has the world's largest electronic database for legal and public-records related information.&lt;ref name=twosix/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:LexisNexis.JPG|thumb|LexisNexis office in Markham, a suburb of Toronto, Ontario, Canada]]
Currently a division of [[RELX Group]] (formerly Reed Elsevier),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/06/business/the-media-business-reed-elsevier-building-big-presence-in-the-us.html?src=pm | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Edward A. | last=Gargan | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Reed-Elsevier Building Big Presence in the U.S. | date=October 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; LexisNexis was first a product of the Mead Data Central company.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=twosix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2006/12/01/Lexis-Nexis-founder-Don-Wilson-dies/UPI-36121164992489/ |title=Lexis-Nexis founder Don Wilson dies |website=UPI.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-Dutch publishing company [[Reed Elsevier]] has owned LexisNexis and its predecessor company since 1994. At its inception in 1970, the database was named LEXIS by Mead Data Central (MDC), a subsidiary of the [[Mead Paper|Mead Corporation]]. It was a continuation of an experiment organized by the Ohio State Bar in 1967.

On April 2, 1973, LEXIS launched publicly, offering full-text search in all Ohio and New York cases. In 1980, LEXIS completed its hand-keyed electronic archive of all U.S. federal and state cases. The NEXIS service, added that same year, gave journalists a searchable database of news articles.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the capital letters in the name; it was then standard to capitalize the names of online services.&lt;/ref&gt;  LexisNexis' world headquarters is located in [[New York City]], United States.&lt;ref name="Corporate"/&gt; In 1989, MDC acquired the Michie Company, a legal publisher, from [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Macmillan Agrees to Sell Michie to Mead | agency = Associated Press | accessdate = 2014-08-23 | url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Macmillan-Agrees-to-Sell-Michie-to-Mead/id-c5740ca1895b2bc50f15e9f481161d1d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota]] launched the [[Lexus]] line of luxury vehicles in 1987, Mead Data Central sued for [[trademark infringement]] on the grounds that consumers of upscale products (such as lawyers) would confuse "Lexus" with "Lexis". A market research survey asked consumers to identify the spoken word "Lexis". Survey results showed that a nominal number of people thought of the computerized legal search system; a similarly small number thought of Toyota's luxury car division.&lt;ref&gt;A far greater number, although by no means a majority, thought of a television character; most thought of nothing at all.&lt;/ref&gt; A judge ruled against Toyota, and the company appealed the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-04/business/fi-194_1_lexus-cars |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Distinctiveness of 'Lexis' Trademark Cited Toyota Can't Call Car 'Lexus,' Judge Says |date=January 4, 1989 |author=James Risen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mead Data Cent. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A.'' 702 [[F.Supp.]] 1031 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Mead lost on appeal in 1989 when the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit]] held that there was little chance of consumer confusion.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=10399856046401781554 Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales]'' 875 [[F.2d]] 1026 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the two companies have an amicable business relationship, and in 2002 implemented a joint promotion called "Win a Lexus on Lexis!"

In December 1994, Mead sold the LexisNexis system to Reed Elsevier for $1.5 billion.  The U.S. state of [[Illinois]] subsequently audited Mead's income tax returns and charged Mead an additional $4 million in income tax and penalties for the sale of LexisNexis; Mead paid the tax under protest, then sued for a refund in an Illinois state court.  On April 15, 2008, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] agreed with Mead that the Illinois courts had incorrectly applied the Court's precedents on whether Illinois could constitutionally apply its income tax to Mead, an out-of-state, Ohio-based corporation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[MeadWestvaco Corp. v. Illinois Dep't. of Revenue]]'', 553 U.S. 16 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court reversed and remanded so that the lower courts could apply the correct test and determine whether Mead and Lexis were a "unitary" business.

In 2000, LexisNexis purchased RiskWise, a [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/03/business/company-news-nexis-agrees-to-purchase-of-riskwise-international.html | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; NEXIS AGREES TO PURCHASE OF RISKWISE INTERNATIONAL | date=June 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2000, the company acquired the American legal publisher Matthew Bender from [[Times Mirror Company|Times Mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Barringer| first = Felicity| title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Times Mirror Sells Legal Unit To British-Dutch Publisher| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-02-04| date = 1998-04-28| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/business/the-media-business-times-mirror-sells-legal-unit-to-british-dutch-publisher.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 it acquired a Canadian research database company, [[Quicklaw]]. In 2002, LexisNexis acquired the Ohio legal publisher Anderson Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Anderson Publishing - LexisNexis Company Information| accessdate = 2018-04-28| url = https://www.lexisnexis.com/presscenter/mediakit/anderson.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Reed Elsevier Group, parent company of LexisNexis, purchased Seisint, Inc, from founder [[Michael Brauser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/us/politics/14giuliani.html | work=The New York Times | title=Giuliani Firm Stood to Benefit From U.S. Deals, Florida Company’s Files Show | date=December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Boca Raton, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/business/company-news-reed-elsevier-to-acquire-seisint-for-775-million.html | work=The New York Times | title=COMPANY NEWS; REED ELSEVIER TO ACQUIRE SEISINT FOR $775 MILLION | date=July 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seisint housed and operated the [[Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange]] (MATRIX).

On March 9, 2005, LexisNexis announced the possible theft of personal information of some Seisint users. It was originally estimated that 32,000 users were affected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/03/09/news/midcaps/lexisnexis/index.htm | work=CNN | title=LexisNexis customer IDs stolen | date=2005-03-09 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that number greatly increased to over 310,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/12/technology/personaltech/lexis/?cnn=yes | work=CNN | title=LexisNexis acknowledges more ID theft | date=2005-04-12 | accessdate=2010-05-07 | first1=Caleb | last1=Silver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affected persons were provided with free fraud insurance and credit bureau reports for a year. However, no reports of identity theft or fraud were discovered to have stemmed from the security breach.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In February 2008, Reed Elsevier purchased [[data aggregator]] [[ChoicePoint]] (previous NYSE ticker symbol CPS) in a cash deal for US$3.6 billion.  The company was rebranded as LexisNexis Risk Solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/risk/ |title=LexisNexis Risk Solutions |publisher=LexisNexis.com |accessdate=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, LexisNexis Risk Solutions bought Health Market Science (HMS), a supplier of high quality data about US healthcare professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20141113/NEWS/311139944|author=Adam Rubenfire|title=LexisNexis to acquire Health Market Science|work=Modern Healthcare|date=13 November 2014| accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal content offerings==

===LexisNexis UK===
The organization that eventually became LexisNexis UK was founded in 1818 by Henry Butterworth (1786–1860) .&lt;ref name="LexisNexis website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk |title=LexisNexis UK – Butterworths – Tolley Innovative Business, Legal Solutions |website=Lexisnexis.co.uk |date=2014-03-13 |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pupil at [[King Henry VIII School, Coventry|King Henry VIII School]], [[Coventry]]. After leaving Coventry he was apprenticed to and, for some time, worked for his uncle [[Joseph Butterworth]], the great law bookseller of [[Fleet Street]]. In 1818, however, disagreement between them as to the terms of partnership made Henry set up on his own account at the corner of Middle Temple Gate (7 Fleet Street), where he became the well-known Queen's Law Bookseller.

Butterworths was acquired by [[International Publishing Corporation]] in 1965; IPC was acquired by the Reed Group in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = FOB: Firms Out of Business| accessdate = 2018-04-28| url = http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/watch/fob_search_results.cfm?FOBFirmName=Butterworths&amp;FOBNote=&amp;fob-submit.x=0&amp;fob-submit.y=0&amp;fob-submit=Submit}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] Professional Publishing was merged with Butterworths Scientific in 1990 to form [[Butterworth-Heinemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-1-4831-0372-3| pages = –| last = Medlik| first = S.| title = Managing Tourism| chapter = Publisher's note| date = 2016-06-06|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gB6TDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=butterworths%20scientific%20reed%20international&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Butterworths publishing business is now owned and operated in the UK by Reed Elsevier (UK) Ltd, a company in the [[Reed Elsevier]] Group. Publications continue to be produced by RELX (UK) Ltd using the "LexisNexis", "Butterworths" and "Tolley" trade marks. Such publications include ''[[Halsbury's Laws of England]]'' and the ''[[All England Law Reports]]'', amongst others.

The Butterworths name is also used to publish works in many countries such as Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

LexisNexis also produces a range of software, services and products which are designed to support the practice of the legal profession. For example, case management systems, customer relationship management systems ("CRMs"), practice management systems, electronic disclosure systems, background checking and identity verification products.&lt;ref name="LexisNexis website"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">'''Lydia Fairchild''' is an [[Americans|American]] woman who exhibits [[chimera (genetics)|chimerism]], in having two distinct populations of DNA among the cells of her body.  She was pregnant with her third child when she and the father of her children, Jamie Townsend, separated. When Fairchild applied for enforcement of child support in 2002, providing [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]] of Townsend's paternity was a routine requirement. While the results showed Townsend to be certainly their father, they seemed to rule out her being their mother.

Fairchild stood accused of fraud by either claiming benefits for other people's children, or taking part in a [[surrogacy]] scam, and records of her prior births were put similarly in doubt. Prosecutors called for her two children to be taken away from her.{{dubious|date=September 2017|reason= "pros'r" is a role in a criminal trial. The logically related custody matter is a civil case with different *roles*, for attys, even if the prosecuter who brought the crim case happens  to bring the civil action. (Likelihood of same atty having both roles is ruffly proportional to both pop'n and level of litigousness in that jurisdiction, but even so would not be acting in role of pros'ctor in the custody matter.)}} As time came for her to give birth to her third child, the judge ordered that an observer be present at the birth, ensure that blood samples were immediately taken from both the child and Fairchild, and be available to testify. Two weeks later, DNA tests seemed to indicate that she was also not the mother of that child.

A breakthrough came when a lawyer for the prosecution{{cn|date= September 2017|reason = this might have been involved only in the civil matter, since this editor demonstrated ignorance or neglect of the distinction}} knew of  [[Karen Keegan]], a [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] woman in Boston, and suggested the similar possibility to Fairchild's lawyer, Alan Tindell, who then introduced an article in the ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]]'' about Keegan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa013452|last=Yu|first=Neng|date=16 May 2002|title=Disputed Maternity Leading to Identification of Tetragametic Chimerism|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=346|issue=20|pages=1545–1552|pmid=12015394|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa013452|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowlands|first=Letitia|title=When your unborn twin is your children's mother|url=http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/life-style/nutrition-and-wellbeing/when-your-unborn-twin-is-your-childrens-mother-20140203-31woi.html|publisher=Essential Baby|accessdate=26 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301211020/http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/life-style/nutrition-and-wellbeing/when-your-unborn-twin-is-your-childrens-mother-20140203-31woi.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He realised that Fairchild's case might also be caused by [[chimera (genetics)|chimerism]]. As in Keegan's case, DNA samples were taken  from members of the extended family. The DNA of Fairchild's children matched that of Fairchild's mother to the extent expected of a grandmother. They also found that, although the DNA in Fairchild's skin and hair did not match her children's, the DNA from a [[Pap test|cervical smear]] test did match. Fairchild was carrying two different sets of DNA, the defining characteristic of chimerism.&lt;!-- Chimerism is a largely insignificant medical anomoly. A "chimera" is a superstitious fantasy of the ancient, biologically benighted, Greek shitkickers (and even of their wisest shitkicker pre-scientists), making failure to clearly distinguish between the condition and a person exhibiting it a crime against humanity. --&gt;

'''''Monitor Polski''''' ({{lang-en|Official Gazette of the Republic of Poland}}, abbreviated '''M. P.''' or '''MP''') is a publication of the [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland]]. It publishes legal acts in [[Polish law]] that are not a source of new laws, and various public decisions that are required to be made public. Unlike [[Dziennik Ustaw]], acts published in Monitor are not a source of laws or obligations on the part of Polish citizens.

There is also 'Monitor Polski B' which publishes financial statements of the Republic of [[Poland]].

'''Moot court''' is an [[extracurricular activity]] at many [[law school]]s in which participants take part in simulated court or [[arbitration]] proceedings, usually involving drafting memorials or memoranda and participating in [[oral argument]]. In most countries, the phrase "moot court" may be shortened to simply "moot" or "mooting". Participants are either referred to as "mooters" or, less conventionally, "mooties".

Moot court involves a simulated [[appellate court]] (appellate advocacy) or arbitral case, which is different from a [[mock trial]] that involves a simulated [[jury trial]] or [[bench trial]] (trial advocacy). Moot court does not involve actual [[testimony]] by witnesses, [[cross-examination]], or the presentation of [[evidence law|evidence]], but is focused solely on the application of the law to a common set of evidentiary assumptions, facts, and clarifications/corrections to which the competitors are introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D.|last2=Kind|first2=Vanessa|date=2017-09-12|title=Using a moot to develop students’ understanding of human cloning and statutory interpretation|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0968533217726350|journal=Medical Law International|language=en|doi=10.1177/0968533217726350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not a moot in the traditional sense, [[alternative dispute resolution]] competitions focusing on [[mediation]] and [[negotiation]] have also branded themselves as moot competitions in recent times, as had role-playing competitions in the past.

Moot court is one of the key extracurricular activities in many law schools (the others being [[law review]] and [[legal clinic|clinical work]] around the world). Depending on the competition, students may spend a semester researching and writing the written submissions or memorials, and another semester practicing their oral arguments, or may prepare both within the span of a few weeks. Whereas domestic moot court competitions tend to focus on municipal law such as [[criminal law]] or [[contract law]], regional and international moot competitions tend to focus on subjects such as [[public international law]], [[international human rights law]], [[international humanitarian law]], [[international criminal law]], [[international trade law]], international [[maritime law]], international commercial [[arbitration]], and [[foreign direct investment]] arbitration. [[Procedural law|Procedural issues]] pertaining to [[jurisdiction]], [[standing (law)|standing]], and [[choice of law]] are also occasionally engaged, especially in arbitration moots.

In most moot court competitions, each side is represented by two speakers or oralists (though the entire team composition may be larger) and a third member, sometimes known as of counsel, may be seated with the speakers. Each speaker usually speaks between 10 and 25 minutes, covering one to three main issues. After the main submissions are completed, there will usually be a short round of rebuttal and even surrebuttal. Depending on the format of the moot, there may be one or two rounds of rebuttal and surrebuttal, and communications between speakers may or may not be prohibited. Throughout the course of the submissions, judges may ask questions, though in some competitions questions are reserved to the end of submissions. In larger competitions, teams have to participate in up to ten rounds; the knockout/elimination stages are usually preceded by a number of preliminary rounds to determine seeding (power seeding is often used). Teams almost always must switch sides (applicant/appellant/claimant on one side, and respondent on the other) throughout a competition, and, depending on the format of the moot, the moot problem usually remains the same throughout. The scores of the written submissions are taken into consideration for most competitions to determine qualification and seeding, and sometimes even up to a particular knockout stage.

==International moot court competitions==
International moot competitions are generally targeted at students and only allow participants who have not [[bar examination|qualified to practice law]] in any jurisdiction. However, there are a handful of international moot competitions that are targeted at young lawyers, such as the [[Essex Court Chambers-Singapore Academy of Law Moot|ECC-SAL Moot]], which is a regional moot started in 2012 and is jointly organised by [[Essex Court Chambers]] and the [[Singapore Academy of Law]]. 

The first table below lists some of the more notable international moot competitions for students, the second table lists the champions and finalists for the major or grand slam competitions, while the third and final table lists the champions and finalists for the minors and regionals. Major or grand slam international moots typically refer to class-leading moots or those that attract a substantial number of teams, while smaller or less established and region-only competitions are known as minors and regionals respectively; "international" class moots are sandwiched between grand slams and minors and regionals in terms of scale and prestige.&lt;ref name="lawgazette.com.sg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lawgazette.com.sg/news/events/another-season-record-breaking-international-moot-court-achievements-smu/|title=Another Season of Record-Breaking International Moot Court Achievements (SMU) - The Singapore Law Gazette|date=1 November 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/smu-team-wins-moot-contest-in-the-hague|title=SMU team wins moot contest in The Hague|first=|last=hermes|date=15 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawgazette18"/&gt; Some countries also divide competitions into various tiers of prestige for the purpose of awarding points in league tables, with moots such as the [[Jessup Moot|Jessup]] and [[Vis Moot|Vis]] competitions being considered as belonging to the highest tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legallyindia.com/the-bench-and-the-bar/mooting-premier-league-is-back-mpl-7-sees-nliu-nalsar-uils-nls-lead-after-strong-start-in-2016-00011130-8208|title=Mooting Premier League is back: MPL 7 sees Nalsar, UILS, NLS, NLIU lead after strong 2016 start|first=Kian|last=Ganz|website=www.legallyindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Operation====
Law schools structure their moot court programs differently. Some moot court organizations accept a small group of people for membership, and those members each participate in a number of national or regional moot court competitions. Other schools accept a larger number of members, and each member is matched with one competition. A few schools conduct moot court entirely intramurally. Moot court competitions are typically sponsored by organizations with interest in one particular area of law, and the moot court problems address an issue in that field. Competitions are often judged by legal practitioners with expertise in the particular area of law, or sometimes by sitting judges.

The basic structure of a moot court competition roughly parallels what would happen in actual appellate practice. Participants will typically receive a problem ahead of time, which includes the facts of the underlying case, and often an [[Legal opinion|opinion]] from a lower court that is being challenged in the problem. Students must then research and prepare for that case as if they were lawyers or advocates for one or sometimes both of the parties. Depending on the competition, participants will be required to submit written [[legal brief|briefs]], participate in oral argument, or both. The case or problem is often one of current interest, sometimes mimicking an actual case, and sometimes fabricated to address difficult legal issues.

A number of moot court competitions focus on specific areas of law. For example, the [[First Amendment Center]] annually holds a National First Amendment Moot Court Competition, in which the judges have included numerous [[United States court of appeals|United States Circuit Court]] judges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?item=moot_court National First Amendment Moot Court Competition].&lt;/ref&gt;

====The American Collegiate Moot Court Association====
{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
In the United States, undergraduates experience moot court in a variety of disciplines and a variety of settings. The most common are in-class exercises that are assigned by professors. Other schools actually form competitive teams. These teams often compete in intramural events, some in statewide competitions, or they can enter tournaments sponsored by the [[American Collegiate Moot Court Association]]. While undergraduate moot court is still a relatively new [[forensics]] activity, when compared with speech and debate and intercollegiate [[mock trial]], by 2010, there were 248 teams who competed at the regional tournaments. The regional tournaments vary by size, but there is a standardized process for awarding bids to nationals. Currently, teams that finish in the top 25 percent of each regional earn an automatic bid to the national tournament. The remainder of the 64 team field is awarded to at-large teams with the best records at the qualifying events. No school can earn more than eight bids to the national field. ACMA tournaments currently have three preliminary rounds and a series of elimination rounds are very much like the “sudden death”/”one-and-done” nature of the NCAA basketball tournament. The qualifying tournaments are held during the fall semester, most are in November, and the championship tournament is in mid-January.

Undergraduate moot court cases pose two certified questions. The case (known as the “record”) includes an appellate majority opinion and a dissent. The “library” is a closed one. Typically, the record includes twenty opinions that students can rely upon for their arguments. Rules allow them to refer to cases cited in the cases directly included in the record. However, they can only rely on these cases within cases to the degree that they were used by the authorities directly in the record. All teams competing in ACMA-sponsored events will argue the same case. ACMA students have engaged in oral argument on issues such as [[same-sex marriage]], national health care, privacy under the 4th Amendment, life terms for minors who are not guilty of [[murder]] or [[attempted murder]], [[freedom of religion]], a federal ban on firearms on school grounds, and warrantless domestic [[wiretapping]] of suspected terrorists. Cases are written by the ACMA. The case problem is released on the ACMA website by May 1 of each year.

Undergraduate moot court teams consist of two oral advocates. The advocates are responsible for knowing both issues&amp;nbsp;– but typically are only asked about one certified question. Each team will receive 20 minutes to argue its case, and each advocate must speak for a minimum of seven minutes. Teams are judged on their forensics, knowledge of the law, demeanor, and ability to answer questions from the bench.

Good judges are the key to a good moot court hearing. Judges are typically lawyers or members of the state or federal bench. At times, law students (especially those with past undergraduate moot court experience) are asked to judge. Past judges at ACMA events have included former US Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] and federal judges [[Otis Wright]] and [[George Schiavelli]].

The ACMA also sponsors a brief writing contest. Students are not required to prepare briefs in order to compete for the oral advocacy national title. Teams who enter follow a specific set of rules and compete for prizes. The competition is judged by lawyers and law professors. This competition is named for the late Sandra Knerr, who along with her husband, was a dedicated supporter of intercollegiate moot court.

===United Kingdom===
The courts systems differ in various parts of the [[United Kingdom]]. Thus, the style of a moot will often vary depending in which jurisdiction it is to be heard, although some national competitions do exist. The principal differences are between the laws in [[Scotland]] and those in [[England and Wales]].

====England and Wales====
In England and Wales the moot will typically simulate proceedings in either the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] or the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]]. Moot questions generally involve two [[questions of law]] that are under dispute and come with a set of facts about the case that have been decided at the first instance trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstlight.demon.co.uk/law/mooting/first.html#facts|title=Mooting Net - How to Moot I|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the question will surround a subject that is unclear under the present state of the law and for which no direct precedent exists. Mooting is a team effort, consisting of senior or lead [[counsel]] and junior counsel. It is normal practice for the senior counsel to take on the first point and the junior the second; although this may vary depending upon the exact nature, and necessary length, of the arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstlight.demon.co.uk/law/mooting/first.html#split|title=Mooting Net - How to Moot I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the question will focus on one area of law, e.g. [[tort]], [[contract]], [[criminal law]] or [[property law]].

The question will be provided to the teams a few weeks in advance of the moot along with details as to which of the [[appellant]] or [[wikt:respondent|respondent]] they are to represent. It is then up to each team to prepare their case as though they were [[barrister]]s. Authority for each argument is necessary and will usually take the form of precedent from [[case law]] but may also involve [[legislation]]. Reliance may also be placed on governmental papers, research from [[NGO]]s and academic journals and texts.

A few days before the moot takes place each team will prepare and exchange their skeleton arguments or [[legal brief|brief]]. Copies will also be provided to the judge along with the moot problem. The judge is normally an academic or practising solicitor or barrister. The moot itself takes the form of an [[oral argument]]. The competition may also allow the appellants an additional few minutes in order to reply to the respondents arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstlight.demon.co.uk/law/mooting/day.html#reply|title=Mooting Net - How to Moot II&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the presentation of arguments has concluded, the judge will retire to deliberate on both the law and the overall winning of the moot. A moot is not won and lost on the legal argument, but on the advocacy skills of the participants. It is often the case that the team that has the weaker legal argument is in a better position as they have to argue that much more persuasively.

====Scotland====
In [[Scots Law|Scotland]] a moot can be set in a variety of fora; in civil law problems it is set most commonly in either the Inner House of the [[Court of Session]] or in the [[House of Lords]], although it is not uncommon for a moot to be heard in the [[Sheriff Court]] before the Sheriff or Sheriff Principal. Occasionally, an [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]] may also be used as a forum for a Scottish civil law moot. If the moot problem concerns Criminal Law, the moot will most likely be heard as though in the Appellate division of the [[High Court of Justiciary]] (commonly known as the Court of Criminal Appeal).

The moot points and style of the problem are similar to that of England and Wales stated above; however, the format of the moot is significantly different. Junior counsel is more likely to take the first moot point and senior counsel the second (this can however be reversed depending on the problem). The format of the moot is far more adversarial than that of English and Welsh moots. This is primarily due to a more adversarial legal system. This manifests itself in different ways, most notably with the appellants and respondents facing each other during a moot, rather than, as in England and Wales, facing the judge.

There is only one national Scottish competition, the Alexander Stone National Legal Debate, administered by the Law School at the [[University of Glasgow]]. All Scottish universities that offer the LL.B. are eligible to take part, although in recent years the competition has been fought out mainly between Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Strathclyde universities. The final is held in the Alexander Stone Court Room at the University of Glasgow in February or March each year. There are also several annual inter-varsity competitions between law schools, including the Glasgow Sheriff's Cup (the University of Glasgow v the University of Strathclyde) and the Granite City Moot ([[the University of Aberdeen]] v [[Robert Gordon University]]). These competitions are ordinarily judged by a [[Senator of the College of Justice]]. 

Law schools also take part in UK-wide competitions, such as the [[Oxford University Press]] and the [[English Speaking Union Moot]]. These moots are UK-wide in participation, but typically follow the style and law of moots in England and Wales. The University of Glasgow reached the semi-final of the English Speaking Union moot in 2008 and the final in 2005. The University of Dundee reached the semi finals of The Oxford University Press moots in 2009.

Judges in Scottish moots are typically legal academics, solicitors, sheriffs, advocates or Senators of the College of Justice.

===India===
Surana and Surana International Attorneys have been conducting various moot competitions from mid 1990s including Surana &amp; Surana International Technology Law Moot Court Competition, Surana &amp; Surana National Corporate Law Moot Court Competition, and [[Surana and Surana Moots|Surana &amp; Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot Court Competition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5604">In [[United States constitutional law]], '''police power''' is the capacity of the [[U.S. state|states]] to [[Regulation|regulate]] behavior and enforce order within their territory for the betterment of the [[health]], [[safety]], [[Morality|morals]], and [[Common good|general welfare]] of their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title =Police Power| encyclopedia =Encyclopædia Britannica|url =http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9060615/police-power| accessdate = 2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the powers not delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the states or to the people. This implies that the Federal Government does not possess all possible powers, because most of these are reserved to the State governments, and others are reserved to the people.

Police power is exercised by the legislative and executive branches of the various states through the enactment and [[law enforcement|enforcement of law]]s. States have the power to compel [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] to these laws through whatever measures they see fit, provided these measures do not infringe upon any of the rights protected by the [[United States Constitution]] or in the various state constitutions, and are not unreasonably arbitrary or oppressive. Methods of enforcement can include [[Sanctions (law)|legal sanctions]], [[violence#Law|physical means]], and other forms of [[coercion]] and inducement. Controversies over the exercise of state police power can arise when exercise by state authorities conflicts with individual rights and freedoms.

== Origins ==

The authority for use of police power under American Constitutional law has its roots in [[English law#Common law|English]] and European common law traditions.&lt;ref name=Pox&gt;{{cite book|last=Willrich|first=Michael|title=Pox|date=2012|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312078-0|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more fundamentally, use of police power draws on two (Latin) principles, ''[[sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas]]'' ("use that which is yours so as not to injure others"), and ''[[salus populi suprema lex esto]]'' ("the welfare of the people shall be the supreme law"), to justify restriction of individual liberties in order to protect the general welfare.&lt;ref name=Pox /&gt; The concept of police power in America was further expanded in a series of notable court cases in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, including the landmark 1851 [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] case [[Commonwealth v. Alger]], and the 1905 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]].

== Restrictions ==
{{Geographical imbalance|United States|section|date=July 2017}}
Due to the nebulous definition of the police power, restrictions on its use are few and far between. In Commonwealth v. Alger, Chief Justice [[Lemuel Shaw]] wrote that "It is much easier to perceive and realize the existence and sources of [the police power] than to mark its boundaries, or prescribe limits to exercise."&lt;ref name=Pox /&gt; However, according to historian Michael Willrich, "Shaw recognized certain constitutional restraints on police power, but they were few. Laws must apply equally to all under like circumstances... government interferences with individual rights must be 'reasonable' – they must have a clear relation to some legitimate legislative purpose. Beyond those outer limits... most courts stayed out of the way of state police power."&lt;ref name="Pox 302"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willrich|first=Michael|title=Pox |date=2012|publisher=Penguin |location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312078-0|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later court cases have expanded somewhat on these restrictions by limiting the ability of states to infringe upon implied constitutional rights and by demanding a stricter standard of [[Legal burden of proof|reasonability]], but regulation of police power remains fairly minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Galva, Jorge E., Christopher Atchinson, and Samuel Levey. "Public Health Strategy and the Police Powers of the State." Public Health Reports 120.1 (2005): 20–27. National Center for Biotechnology Information. Web. 18 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis of United States land-use planning authority ==
The police power is the basis for [[land-use planning]] authority in the United States. This authority is usually delegated by state governments to local governments, including counties and municipalities. It is these local governments that most frequently exercise police power in land use planning matters. The regulation of land use based on police power is distinct from the taking of private property by the government through the power of eminent domain. If the regulation of land use is done under the authority of the police power, the private property owner isn't typically entitled to compensation as they would be if property was taken under the power of eminent domain. The court decision in the case [[Commonwealth v. Alger]] was related to land use planning and dealt with the construction of a wharf on privately owned tidelands around Boston Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Understanding the Law of Zoning and Land Use Controls, Barlow Burke, Lexisnexis, Chapter 1, Published 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political demography''' is the study of how population change affects politics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Myron Weiner|Weiner, Myron]] and Michael S. Teitelbaum. 2001. ''Political Demography and Demographic Engineering''. New York: Bergahn Books; [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Goldstone, Jack A., Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft, ed. 2011. Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Population change is driven by classic [[Demographics|demographic]] mechanisms – birth, death, age structure, and migration. 

However, in political demography, there is always scope for assimilation as well as boundary and identity change, which can redraw the boundaries of populations in a way that is not possible with biological populations.&lt;ref&gt;Bookman, Milica Zarkovic. 1997. The demographic struggle for power : the political economy of demographic engineering in the modern world. London ; Portland, OR: Frank Cass&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, political-demographic projections can account for both demographic factors and transitions caused by social change. A notable leader in the area of sub-state population projection is the [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/POP/ World Population Program] of the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. 

Some of the issues which are studied in the context of political demography are: surges of young people in the developing world, significantly increasing aging in the developed world, and the impact of increasing urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 |title=Political Demography - Jack A. Goldstone; Eric P. Kaufmann - Oxford University Press |publisher=Oup.com |date=2011-12-31 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political demographers study issues like population growth in a political context. A population's growth is impacted by the relative balance of variables like mortality, fertility and immigration.&lt;ref name="sneps1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sneps.net/research-interests/political-demography-ethnicity-nationalism-religion |title=The Political Demography of Ethnicity, Nationalism and Religion &amp;#124; Eric Kaufmann |publisher=Sneps.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of the present world's most powerful nations are aging quickly, largely as a result of major decreases in fertility rates and major increases in life expectancies.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/political-demography-identity-institutions-and-conflict-book-launch |title=Political Demography: How Population Changes Are Reshaping International Security and National Politics |publisher=Wilson Center |date=2012-01-10 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the labor pools in these nations shrink, and spending on the elderly increases, their economies are likely to slow down.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"/&gt; By 2050, the workforce in Japan and Russia is predicted to decrease by more than 30 percent, while the German workforce is expected to decline by 25 percent by that year.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"/&gt; The governments of these countries have made financial commitments to the elderly in their populations which will consume huge percentages of their national GDP.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"/&gt; For example, based on current numbers, more than 25% of the national GDPs of Japan, France and Germany will be consumed by these commitments by 2040.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"/&gt;

==Political demography and evolution==
Differential reproductive success is the mechanism through which evolution takes place. For much of human history this occurred through migrations and wars of conquest, with disease and mortality through famine and war affecting the power of empires, tribes and city-states. Differential fertility also played a part, though typically reflected resource availability rather than cultural factors.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. (1997). Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York: W.W. Norton; McNeill, William Hardy. 1976. Plagues and peoples. 1st ed. Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; Though culture has largely usurped this role, some claim that differential demography continues to affect cultural and political evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Michael. 2009. "'The Reproductive Benefits of Religious Affiliation'." In The Biological Evolution of Religious Mind and Behavior, ed. E. Voland and W. Schiefenhövel. New York: Springer-Verlag, pp. 117-26 (Blume 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uneven transition, democratization and globalization==
The demographic transition from the late eighteenth century onwards opened up the possibility that significant change could occur within and between political units. Though the writings of Polybius and Cicero in classical times bemoaned the low fertility of the patrician elite as against their more fecund barbarian competitors,&lt;ref name="autogeneratedci"&gt;Jackson, Richard, and Neil Howe. 2011. "'Global Aging And Global Security In The 21st Century'." in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; differential fertility has probably only recently emerged as a central aspect of political demography. 

This has come about due to medical advances which have lowered infant mortality while conquest migrations have faded as a factor in world history. Differences in immunity levels to infectious diseases between populations also play no major role in our age of modern medicine and widespread exposure to a common disease pool. 

It is not so much the trajectory of demographic transition that counts as the fact that it has become more intense and uneven in the late twentieth century as it has spread into the developing world. Uneven transitions lend themselves to differential growth rates between contending groups. These changes are in turn, magnified by democratization, which entrenches majority rule and privileges the power of numbers in politics as never before.

Indeed, in many new democracies riven by ethnic and religious conflicts, elections are akin to censuses while groups seek to 'win the census'. Ethnic parties struggle to increase their constituencies through pronatalism ('wombfare'), oppose family planning, and contest census and election results.&lt;ref&gt;Toft, Monica Duffy. 2011. "Wombfare: The Religious and Political Dimensions of Fertility and Demographic Change." in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]; Horowitz, D. 1985. Ethnic Groups in Conflict. Berkeley: University of California Press, esp. chapters 3-4,7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic, national and civilizational conflict===
One branch of political demography examines how differences in population growth between nation-states, religions, ethnic groups and civilizations affects the balance of power between these political actors. For instance, Ethiopia is projected to have a larger population than Russia in 2020, and while there were 3.5 Europeans per African in 1900, there will be four Africans for each European in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Demeny, P, and G. McNicoll, eds. 2006. The Political Economy of Global Population Change, 1950-2050. New York: Population Council&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1" /&gt; Population has always counted for national power to some degree and it is unlikely that these changes will leave the world system unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Goldstone, Jack A., Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft, ed. 2011. Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]., 'Introduction'.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The same dynamic can be witnessed within countries due to [[Demographic threat|differential ethnic population growth]].&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb, Milton, and Victor Baras (eds). 1978. Zero Population Growth-For Whom?: differential fertility and minority group survival. Westport, CT: Praeger; Leuprecht, C. 2011. "'Deter or Engage?:Demographic Determinants of Bargains in Ethno-Nationalist Conflicts'." in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Irish Catholics in Northern Ireland increased their share of the population through higher birthrates and the momentum of a youthful age structure from 35 to nearly 50 percent of the total between 1965 and 2011. Similar changes, also affected by in- and out-migration, have taken place in, amongst others, the United States (Hispanics), Israel-Palestine (Jews and Arabs), Kosovo (Albanians), Lebanon (Shia, with decline of Christians) and Nagorno-Karabakh (Armenians). 

In the US, the growth of Hispanics and Asians, and Hispanics' youthful age profile as against whites, has the potential to tilt more states away from the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Frey, William H. 2011. "Racial Demographics and the 2008 Presidential Election in the United States " in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the fertility advantage of conservative over liberal white voters is significant and rising, thus the Republicans are poised to win a larger share of the white vote - especially over the very long run of 50 to 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;Lesthaeghe, R., and L. Neidert. 2006. "The Second Demographic Transition in the United States:. Exception or Textbook Example?" Population and Development Review 32 (4):669-98; Kaufmann, Eric, A.

According to London-based scholar [[Eric Kaufmann]], the high birth rates of religious fundamentalists as against seculars and moderates has contributed to an increase in religious fundamentalism and decrease of moderate religion within religious groups, as in Israel, the US and the Muslim Middle East. Kaufmann, armed with empirical from a number of countries, also posits that this will be further bolstered by the higher retention rates of religious fundamentalists, with individuals in religiously fundamentalist households less likely to become religiously non-observant than others.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Eric. 2011.

==Age structure and politics==
===Youth bulges===
A second avenue of inquiry considers age structures: be these [[Population pyramid|'youth bulges']] or aging populations. Young populations are associated with a ratio of dependents to producers: a high proportion of the population under age 16 puts pressure on resources. A 'youth bulge' of those in the 16-30 bracket creates a different set of problems.

A large population of adolescents entering the labor force and electorate strains at the seams of the economy and polity, which were designed for smaller populations. This creates unemployment and alienation unless new opportunities are created quickly enough - in which case a 'demographic dividend' accrues because productive workers outweigh young and elderly dependents. Yet the 16-30 age range is associated with risk-taking, especially among males.

In general, youth bulges in developing countries are associated with higher unemployment and, as a result, a heightened risk of violence and political instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Huntington | first1 = Samuel P | year = 1996 | title = The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. | location = New York, NY|publisher= Simon and Schuster }}; {{cite journal | authorlink=Henrik Urdal |last1=Urdal|first1= Henrik|year= 2006| title = A Clash of Generations? Youth Bulges and Political Violence | url = | journal = International Studies Quarterly | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 607–29 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2478.2006.00416.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Cincotta and Doces (2011), the transition to more mature age structures is almost a sine qua non for democratization.&lt;ref&gt;Cincotta, Richard, and John Doces. 2011. "The Age-structural Maturity Thesis: The Youth Bulge's Influence on the Advent and Stability of Liberal Democracy?" In [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population aging===
Population aging presents the obverse effect: older populations are less risk-taking and less prone to violence and instability. However, like those under-16, they place great strain on the social safety net, especially in countries committed to old-age provision and high-quality medical care. 

Some observers believe that the advent of a much older planet, courtesy of below-replacement fertility in Europe, North America, China and much of the rest of Asia and Latin America, will produce a 'geriatric peace'.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, M. L. 2007. "A geriatric peace? The future of US power in a world of aging populations." International Security 32 (1):112-32; Haas, Mark. 2011. "'America’s Golden Years?:U.S. Security in an Aging World'." in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others are concerned that population aging will bankrupt the welfare state and handicap western liberal democracies' ability to project power abroad to defend their interests. A more cautious climate could also herald slower economic growth, less entrepreneurship and reduced productivity in mature democracies.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedci" /&gt; 

It is also possible that ageing leads to lower inflation as elderly people are both inflation averse and politically powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vlandas|first1=T|title=Grey power and the economy: Ageing and inflation across advanced economies|journal=Comparative Political Studies |date=2017|doi=10.1177/0010414017710261}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that older people in the developed world have much higher productivity, human capital and better health than their counterparts in developing countries, so the economic effects of population aging will be largely mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=[[Vegard Skirbekk|Skirbekk, Vegard]], Elke Loichinger and Daniela Weber|date=2011|title='Variation in cognitive functioning as a refined approach to comparing aging across countries'|publisher=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/12/13/1112173109|accessdate=2013-10-06|doi=10.1073/pnas.1112173109|volume=109|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=770–774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emerging discipline==
The study of political demography is in its early stages and can be traced back to the works of figures such as Jack Goldstone, whom is often considered to be the father of Political Demography. Since 2000 the subject has drawn the attention of policymakers and journalists and is now emerging as an academic subfield. Panels on political demography appear at demography conferences such as the [http://www.populationassociation.org/ Population Association of America (PAA)] and [http://www.eaps.nl/index.php European Association for Population Studies (EAPS)]. There is now a [http://www.isanet.org/pd/page/2/ political demography section] at the International Studies Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isanet.org/pd/page/2/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521160905/http://www.isanet.org/pd/page/2/ |archivedate=May 21, 2012 |title=The Political Demography &amp; Geography Section Charter |deadurl=yes |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of important international conferences have also taken place since 2006 on the subject.&lt;ref name="sneps1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2871">'''Political naturalism''' is a minor [[political ideology]] and [[legal system]] which believes that there is a [[natural law]], just and obvious to all, that crosses ideologies, faiths and personal thinking, that naturally guaranties justice. It is inspired by [[sociological naturalism]], and [[methodological naturalism|scientific naturalism]]'s belief that the precision of [[natural sciences]] can be applied to social sciences, and hence to practical social activities like politics and law.

It may be seen as a natural law-based version of [[Liberal legalism|legalism]]/[[constitutionalism]] (especially [[Constitutionalism#Prescriptive use|of prescriptive constitutionalism]], in the way it tries, idealistically, to make a constitution how it should justly be), and it bears relation with many [[constitutional monarchies]] (as in that system they too believe in [[rule of the law]] and in certain things who are naturally correct (like [[monarchy]], monarchic [[institutions]] and [[traditions]].

The roots of this legal political ideology may be found in positive visions of natural law (like [[John Locke]]'s and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s, and even in the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence|United States Declaration of Independence]], 1776, "We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic]] [[Germany|German]] [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] politician and diplomat Karl Friedrich von Savigny also thought so.&lt;ref&gt;He stated that "laws are not made ''but found''", implying the existence of already existing natural laws.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main modern thinker is [[Egypt]]ian legal scholar and creator of the [[Egyptian Civil Code]] [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri|Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri]].&lt;ref&gt;Abd Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri, Egyptian Civil Code, Article 1, 1949, ''«in the absence of any applicable legislation, the judge shall decide according to the custom and failing the custom, according to the principles of Islamic Law. In the absence of these principles,'' '''the judge shall have recourse to natural law''' ''and the rules of equity.»''&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Egyptian Code, many other Arab constitutions (in monarchist and pre-dictatorships [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] and modern [[Qatar]]) ended up including political naturalist laws, and Al-Sanhuri himself wrote the [[Syrian]] and [[Jordan]]ian [[civil codes]] and the [[Kuwait]]i [[commercial code (law)|commercial code]].

'''Political philosophy''', also known as '''political theory''', is the study of topics such as [[politics]], [[liberty]], [[justice]], [[property]], [[rights]], [[law]], and the enforcement of laws by [[authority]]: what they are, why (or even if) they are needed, what, if anything, makes a [[The purpose of government|government legitimate]], what rights and freedoms it should protect and why, what form it should take and why, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever.

In a [[vernacular]] sense, the term "political philosophy" often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics, synonymous to the term "[[political ideology]]".

Political philosophy is a branch of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Leo (1959). An introduction to Political Philosophy. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[political science]], a strong focus has historically been placed on the role of political philosophy (also known as [[normative theory]]), [[moral philosophy]] and the [[humanities]], although in recent years there has been increased focus to political theory based on [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] methodological approaches as well as [[economic theory]], the [[natural sciences]] and [[behaviouralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Savigny |first1=Heather |last2=Marsden |first2=Lee |title=Doing Political Science and International Relations: Theories in Action |date=2011 |publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education |isbn=9780230344136 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaUcBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|History of political thought}}

=== Ancient traditions ===

==== Ancient India ====
[[Indian political philosophy]]  in ancient times demarcated a clear distinction between (1) nation and state (2) religion and state. The constitutions of Hindu states evolved over time and were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions. The institutions of state were broadly divided into governance, administration, defense, law and order. ''Mantranga,'' the principal governing body of these states, consisted of the King, Prime Minister, Commander in chief of army, Chief Priest of the King. The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive (Maha Amatya).

[[Chanakya]] was a 4th-century BC Indian political philosopher. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'' provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler, policies for foreign affairs and wars, the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roger Boesche|last=Boesche|first=Roger|title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K85NA7Rg67wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0739106074&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0-7391-0401-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanakya quotes several authorities including Bruhaspati, Ushanas, Prachetasa Manu, Parasara, and Ambi, and described himself as a descendant of a lineage of political philosophers, with his father Chanaka being his immediate predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangarajan|first1=L N|title=The Arthashastra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jbzZkoR36QC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9788184750119|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra Neeti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=D.

Sewell and J. Debrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient China ====
Chinese political philosophy dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]], specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the [[Warring States period]]. The major philosophies during the period, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Mohism]], [[School of Agrarianism|Agrarianism]] and [[Taoism]], each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], and [[Mozi]], focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly [[authoritarian]] government based on [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] punishments and laws. [[Mohism]] advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on [[frugality]] and [[ascetism]]. The Agrarians advocated a peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Eliot|author2=Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999|page=183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taoism advocated a proto-[[anarchism]]. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the [[Qin Dynasty]], but was replaced by State Confucianism in the [[Han Dynasty]]. Prior to China's adoption of [[communism]], State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsü|first=Leonard Shihlien|title=The political philosophy of Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FWFtQIyun-8C|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-36154-5|pages=xvii–xx|quote=The importance of a scientific study of Confucian political philosophy could hardly be overstated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient Greece ====
Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of [[ancient Greece]], where political philosophy dates back to at least Plato.&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahakian|first=Mabel Lewis|title=Ideas of the great philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vi7cQMw8SwYC&amp;pg=PA59|year=1993|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2|page=59|quote=... Western philosophical tradition can be traced back as early as Plato (427–347 BC).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greece was dominated by city-states, which experimented with various forms of political organization, grouped by Plato into five categories of descending stability and morality: [[monarchy]], [[timocracy]],[[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[tyranny]]. One of the first, extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato's ''Republic'',&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"/&gt; which was followed by [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraut|first=Richard|title=Aristotle: political philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9BDmX3FBbS4C&amp;pg=PA3|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-878200-1|page=3|quote=To understand and assess Aristotle's contributions to political thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman political philosophy was influenced by the [[Stoics]] and the Roman statesman [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radford|first=Robert T.|title=Cicero: a study in the origins of republican philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1cKLGcvuYxQC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2002|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1467-1|page=1|quote=His most lasting political contribution is in his work on political philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saint Augustine ====

The early [[Christian philosophy]] of [[Augustine of Hippo]] was heavily influenced by Plato. A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderation of the [[Stoicism]] and theory of [[justice]] of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying [[mercy]] as a [[moral example]]. Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]] (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man ([[Civitas]] Terrena). Augustine's ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schall|first=James V.|title=At the Limits of Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yZK79kiFFtsC&amp;pg=PA40|year=1998|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-0922-7|page=40|quote=In political philosophy, St. Augustine was a follower of Plato ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== St. Thomas Aquinas ====
{{main|Treatise on Law}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] meticulously dealt with the varieties of [[philosophy of law|law]]. According to Aquinas, there are four kinds of law:

# Eternal law ("the divine government of everything")
# Divine positive law (having been "posited" by God; external to human nature)
# [[Natural law]] (the right way of living discoverable by natural reason; what cannot-not be known; internal to human nature)
# Human law (what we commonly call "[[law]]"—including [[customary law]]; the law of the ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'')

Aquinas never discusses the nature or categorization of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]. There is scholarly debate surrounding the place of canon law within the Thomistic jurisprudential framework.

Aquinas was an incredibly influential thinker in the [[Natural law|Natural Law tradition]].

The rise of [[Islam]], based on both the [[Qur'an]] and [[Muhammad]] strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. [[Early Islamic philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between [[science]] and [[religion]], and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find [[truth]]—in effect ''all'' philosophy was "[[Political aspects of Islam|political]]" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the "rationalist" [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenic]] view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first [[speculative philosophy|speculative]] theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. By the late ancient period, however, the "traditionalist" [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aslan|first=Reza|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title=No god but God|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AkyupJn81RMC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2005|publisher=Random House Inc.|isbn=978-1-58836-445-6|page=153|quote=By the ninth and tenth centuries... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]], was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of [[Islam]]—i.e., the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Abunaser), [[Avicenna|İbn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace) and [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes). The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), [[sultan]], [[ummah]], cemaa (obligation)-and even the "core" terms of the Qur'an—i.e., [[ibadah]] (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and [[ilah]] (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, however. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotleanism]] flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the [[Peripatetic school|peripaetic]] philosophers who implemented the ideas of [[Aristotle]] in the context of the Islamic world. Abunaser, Avicenna and Ibn Rushd where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelation. They believed, for example, that natural phenomena occurs because of certain rules (made by god), not because god interfered directly (unlike Al-Ghazali and his followers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Farabi|title=Al-Fārābī {{!}} Muslim philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/#H5|title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina) {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-22|title=Averroes|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Averroes&amp;oldid=837663527|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Ghazali|title=Al-Ghazālī {{!}} Muslim jurist, theologian, and mystic|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable political philosophers of the time include [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a Persian scholar and [[vizier]] of the Seljuq Empire who composed the ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', or the "Book of Government" in English. In it, he details the role of the state in terms of political affairs (i.e. how to deal with political opponents without ruining the government's image), as well as its duty to protect the poor and reward the worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-30|title=Siyasatnama|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Siyasatnama&amp;oldid=788295179|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his other work, he explains how the state should deal with other issues such as supplying jobs to immigrants like the [[Turkmens]] who were coming from the north (present day southern Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nizam-al-Mulk-Seljuq-vizier|title=Niẓām al-Mulk {{!}} Seljuq vizier|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ibn Khaldun ====

The 14th-century [[Arab]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist [[Ernest Gellner]] considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of [[government]], "...an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself," the best in the history of political theory. For Ibn Khaldun, government should be restrained to a minimum for as a necessary evil, it is the constraint of men by other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gellner|first=Ernest|authorlink=Ernest Gellner|title=Plough, Sword, and Book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WwduQjFiB7kC&amp;pg=PA239|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28702-7|page=239|quote=Ibn Khaldun's definition of government probably remains the best: ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Europe ===
[[Medieval]] political philosophy in [[Europe]] was heavily influenced by [[Christian]] thinking. It had much in common with the Mutazilite [[Islamic]] thinking in that the [[Roman Catholic]]s though subordinating [[philosophy]] to [[theology]] did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam. The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koetsier|first=L. S.|title=Natural Law and Calvinist Political Theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7uLE3DynB0YC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2004|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4122-1440-7|page=19|quote=...the Medieval Scholastics revived the concept of natural law. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] who helped reintroduce [[Aristotle]]'s works, which had only been transmitted to [[Catholic]] [[Europe]] through [[Muslim]] [[Spain]], along with the commentaries of [[Averroes]]. Aquinas's use of them set the agenda, for [[scholasticism|scholastic]] political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA346|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|page=346|quote=There was, however, at least one department of thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval political philosophers, such as Aquinas in ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', developed the idea that a king who is a tyrant is no king at all and could be overthrown.

[[Magna Carta]], viewed by many as a cornerstone of Anglo-American political liberty, explicitly proposes the right to revolt against the ruler for justice sake. Other documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valente|first=Claire|title=The theory and practice of revolt in medieval England|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8yRrtm0LicC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0901-8|page=14|quote=The two starting points of most medieval discussions ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Renaissance ===
During the [[Renaissance]] secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe. While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the academic field was wholly [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and therefore Christian in nature.

==== Niccolò Machiavelli ====

One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|The Discourses]]'', a rigorous analysis of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Ian|title=Lecture on Machiavelli's The Prince|publisher=[[Malaspina University College]]|date=February 2002|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/introser/machiavelli.htm|accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the [[Republic of Florence]] rather than the [[oligarchy]] of the di [[Medici]] family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] and somewhat [[consequentialist]] view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the secure and powerful state. [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the [[English Renaissance]]. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA310|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|pages=310–12|quote=...we witness the growth of political absolutism ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Enlightenment ===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|right|upright=1.45|thumb|Eugène Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830, Louvre), a painting created at a time when old and modern political philosophies came into violent conflict.]]During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, new theories about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]]), and the [[Haitian Revolution]] led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of "state" and "government." It was decided that "state" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term "government" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in [[political science]], although some political scientists, philosophers, [[history|historians]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of [[natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] was not introduced, the [[social sciences]] could not evolve independently of [[theistic]] thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barens|first1=Ingo|last2=Caspari|first2=Volker|last3=Schefold|first3=Bertram|editor1-last=Barens|editor1-first=Ingo|others=Volker Caspari ed., Bertram Schefold ed.|title=Political events and economic ideas|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x6C5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA206|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-152-6|pages=206–07|quote=Economic theory as political philosophy: the example of the French Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the [[guild]] was subordinated to the theory of [[free trade]], and [[Roman Catholic]] dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by [[Protestant]] churches subordinate to each [[nation-state]], which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region. However, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity. The most outspoken critic of the church in France was [[François Marie Arouet de Voltaire]], a representative figure of the enlightenment. After Voltaire, religion would never be the same again in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=James M.|title=Religion and the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FcEy8SF63TgC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1997|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25760-6|pages=1–2|quote=... there emerged groups of freethinkers intent on grounding knowledge on the exercise of critical reason, as opposed to ... established religion ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later. As well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the [[New World]] and the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Inca]], [[Mohican]], [[Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and especially the [[Iroquois]]. The [[Iroquois]] philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the [[United States]]: for example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a great admirer of some of the methods of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johansen|first=Bruce Elliott|title=Native American political systems and the evolution of democracy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H593mgxQNu4C&amp;pg=PA69|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30010-3|page=69|quote=... the three-tier system of federalism ... is an inheritance of Iroquois inspiration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== John Locke ====

[[John Locke]] in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir [[Robert Filmer]]'s paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the [[divine right of kings]] became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from [[original sin]], Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as [[tabula rasa]]. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.

=== Industrialization and the Modern Era ===
The [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] critique of capitalism—developed with [[Friedrich Engels]]—was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century. The [[industrial revolution]] produced a parallel revolution in political thought. [[Urbanization]] and [[capitalism]] greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the [[History of Socialism|socialist movement]] began to form. In the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] was developed, and [[socialism]] in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Fidel Castro]]. Though [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s philosophy of history is similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s, and [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was "standing on its head", "the right side up again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm|title=Capital Volume One, Afterword to the Second German Edition|last=Marx|first=Karl|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Marx who believed in [[historical materialism]], Hegel believed in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kain|first=Philip J.|title=Marx and modern political theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kvG8DVBeT9QC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1993|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-7866-2|pages=1–4|quote=Some of his texts, especially the ''Communist Manifesto'' made him seem like a sort of communist Descartes ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]]s were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of [[anarchism]], with thinkers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] or [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[syndicalism]] also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|reason=Pluralism possibly earlier|date=April 2017}}

[[World War I]] was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought [[communism]]—and in particular the political theory of [[Leninism]], but also on a smaller level [[Luxemburgism]] (gradually)—on the world stage. At the same time, [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspalter|first=Christian|title=Importance of Christian and Social Democratic movements in welfare politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vouKut-RAYoC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2001|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-56072-975-4|page=70|quote=The pressing need for universal suffrage ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary ==
From the end of [[World War II]] until 1971, when [[John Rawls]] published ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and [[behavioralism]]. In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with [[Marxism]] dominating the field. This was the time of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and the victories of [[Mao Zedong]] in [[China]] and [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], as well as the events of [[May 1968]] led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the [[New Left]]. A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including [[Karl Popper]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[Judith Shklar]]—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.

[[Communism]] remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Colonialism]] and [[racism]] were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply [[utilitarianism]] to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as [[rational choice theory]]) to political issues. The rise of [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements]] and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as [[African Americans]] and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, [[postcolonial]], and [[multicultural]] thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the [[social contract]] by philosophers [[Charles W. Mills]] in his book ''[[The Racial Contract]]'' and [[Carole Pateman]] in her book ''[[The Sexual Contract]]'' that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.

In Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a [[thought experiment]], the [[original position]], in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. [[Robert Nozick]]'s 1974 book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', which won a [[National Book Award]], responded to Rawls from a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis Schaefer, [http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia], [[The New York Sun]], April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the [[Frankfurt School]], thinkers like [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on [[structuralism]] and on a "return to [[Hegel]]". Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Claude Lefort]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. The [[Situationist International|Situationists]] were more influenced by Hegel; [[Guy Debord]], in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of [[commodity fetishism]] to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.

Another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by [[Michael Walzer]], [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. The [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[communitarian]] debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective.These and other communitarians (such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Daniel A. Bell]]) argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus. Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of [[social capital]].

A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are [[republicanism]] (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the [[capability approach]]. The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s positive and negative forms of liberty, namely "liberty as non-domination." Unlike the American liberal movement which understands liberty as "non-interference," "non-domination" entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person. To a liberal, a slave who is not interfered with may be free, yet to a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian [[Quentin Skinner]], jurist [[Cass Sunstein]], and political philosopher [[Philip Pettit]]. The capability approach, pioneered by economists [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and [[Amartya Sen]] and further developed by legal scholar [[Martha Nussbaum]], understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.

Current emphasis on "commoditization of the everyday" has been decried by many contemporary theorists, some of them arguing the full brunt of it would be felt in ten years' time. "Pricing" such ethical categories like personal relations or sex, though always present, pushed by media agenda, is thus seen as crossing boundaries and having adverse societal and philosophical consequences.

A prominent subject in recent political philosophy is the theory of [[deliberative democracy]]. The seminal work was done by Jurgen Habermas in [[Germany]], but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as [[Jane Mansbridge]], Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson, ''Democracy and Disagreement'' (Princeton University Press, 1996). Also see Gutmann and Thompson, ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' (Princeton University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential political philosophers ==
A larger [[list of political philosophers]] is intended to be closer to exhaustive. Listed below are some of the most [[Archetype|canonical]] or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]: In synthesizing Christian theology and Peripatetic (Aristotelian) teaching in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'', Aquinas contends that God's gift of higher reason—manifest in human law by way of the divine virtues—gives way to the assembly of righteous government.
* [[Aristotle]]: Wrote his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as an extension of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the [[polis]] (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals. His political theory is based upon an ethics of [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]] (as is [[Marx]]'s, on some readings).
* [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: After [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], Bakunin became the most important political philosopher of [[anarchism]]. His specific version of anarchism is called [[collectivist anarchism]].
* [[Jeremy Bentham]]: The first thinker to analyze social justice in terms of maximization of aggregate individual benefits. Founded the philosophical/ethical school of thought known as [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Isaiah Berlin]]: Developed the distinction between positive and negative liberty.
* [[Edmund Burke]]: Irish member of the British parliament, Burke is credited with the creation of conservative thought. Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' is the most popular of his writings where he denounced the French revolution. Burke was one of the biggest supporters of the American Revolution.
* [[Confucius]]: The first thinker to relate ethics to the political order.
* [[William E. Connolly]]: Helped introduce postmodern philosophy into political theory, and promoted new theories of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]] and [[agonistic democracy]].
* [[John Dewey]]: Co-founder of [[pragmatism]] and analyzed the essential role of education in the maintenance of democratic government.
* [[Han Feizi]]: The major figure of the Chinese Fajia ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]) school, advocated government that adhered to laws and a strict method of administration.
* [[Michel Foucault]]: Critiqued the modern conception of power on the basis of the [[prison–industrial complex|prison complex]] and other prohibitive institutions, such as those that designate sexuality, madness and knowledge as the roots of their infrastructure, a critique that demonstrated that subjection is the power formation of subjects in any linguistic forum and that revolution cannot just be thought as the reversal of power between classes.
* [[Antonio Gramsci]]: Instigated the concept of ''[[hegemony]]''. Argued that the [[Sovereign state|state]] and the ruling class uses [[culture]] and [[ideology]] to gain the consent of the classes it rules over.
* [[Thomas Hill Green]]: Modern liberal thinker and early supporter of [[positive freedom]].
* [[Jürgen Habermas]]: Contemporary democratic theorist and sociologist. He has pioneered such concepts as the [[public sphere]], [[communicative action]], and [[deliberative democracy]]. His early work was heavily influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]].
* [[Friedrich Hayek]]: He argued that central planning was inefficient because members of central bodies could not know enough to match the preferences of consumers and workers with existing conditions. Hayek further argued that [[command economy|central economic planning]]—a mainstay of socialism—would lead to a "total" state with dangerous power. He advocated [[free-market]] capitalism in which the main role of the state is to maintain the [[rule of law]] and let spontaneous order develop.
* [[G. W. F. Hegel]]: Emphasized the "cunning" of history, arguing that it followed a rational trajectory, even while embodying seemingly irrational forces; influenced Marx, [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Michael Oakeshott|Oakeshott]].
* [[Thomas Hobbes]]: Generally considered to have first articulated how the concept of a [[social contract]] that justifies the actions of rulers (even where contrary to the individual desires of governed citizens), can be reconciled with a conception of sovereignty.
* [[David Hume]]: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement. Hume was a realist in recognizing the role of force to forge the existence of states and that [[consent of the governed]] was merely hypothetical. He also introduced the concept of [[utility]], later picked up on and developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]].
* [[Thomas Jefferson]]: Politician and political theorist during the [[American Enlightenment]]. Expanded on the philosophy of Thomas Paine by instrumenting [[republicanism]] in the United States. Most famous for the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].
* [[Immanuel Kant]]: Argued that participation in civil society is undertaken not for self-preservation, as per [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], but as a moral duty. First modern thinker who fully analyzed structure and meaning of obligation. Argued that an international organization was needed to preserve world peace.
* [[Peter Kropotkin]]: One of the classic anarchist thinkers and the most influential theorist of [[anarcho-communism]].
* [[John Locke]]: Like Hobbes, described a social contract theory based on citizens' fundamental rights in the [[state of nature]]. He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property. His arguments may have been deeply influential to the formation of the [[United States Constitution]].
* [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]: First systematic analyses of: (1) how consent of a populace is negotiated between and among rulers rather than simply a naturalistic (or theological) given of the structure of society; (2) precursor to the concept of ideology in articulating the epistemological structure of commands and law.
* [[James Madison]]: American politician and protege of Jefferson considered to be "Father of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]" and "Father of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]" of the United States. As a political theorist, he believed in [[separation of powers]] and proposed a comprehensive set of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]] that are necessary to protect the rights of an individual from the [[tyranny of the majority]].
* [[Herbert Marcuse]]: Called the father of the [[new left]]. One of the principal thinkers within the [[Frankfurt School]], and generally important in efforts to fuse the thought of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Introduced the concept of "[[repressive desublimation]]", in which social control can operate not only by direct control, but also by manipulation of desire. His work [[Eros and Civilization]] and notion of a non-repressive society was influential on the 1960s and its counter-cultural social movements.
* [[Karl Marx]]: In large part, added the historical dimension to an understanding of society, culture and economics. Created the concept of ''ideology'' in the sense of (true or false) beliefs that shape and control social actions. Analyzed the fundamental nature of class as a mechanism of governance and social interaction. Profoundly influenced world politics with his theory of communism.
* [[Mencius]]: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.
* [[John Stuart Mill]]: A [[utilitarian]], and the person who named the system; he goes further than Bentham by laying the foundation for liberal democratic thought in general and modern, as opposed to classical, liberalism in particular. Articulated the place of individual liberty in an otherwise utilitarian framework.
* [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]: Analyzed protection of the people by a "balance of powers" in the divisions of a state.
* [[John Rawls]]: Revitalized the study of normative political philosophy in Anglo-American universities with his 1971 book [[A Theory of Justice]], which uses a version of [[social contract theory]] to answer fundamental questions about [[justice]] and to criticise [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Mozi]]: Eponymous founder of the Mohist school, advocated a form of [[Mohist consequentialism|consequentialism]].
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: Philosopher who became a powerful influence on a broad spectrum of 20th-century political currents in [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], and [[conservatism]]. His interpreters have debated the content of his political philosophy.
* [[Robert Nozick]]: Criticized Rawls, and argued for [[libertarianism]], by appeal to a hypothetical history of the [[State (polity)|state]] and of [[property]].
* [[Thomas Paine]]: [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer who defended [[liberal democracy]], the [[American Revolution]], and [[French Revolution]] in ''[[Common Sense]]'' and The ''[[Rights of Man]]''.
* [[Plato]]: Wrote a lengthy dialog ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' in which he laid out his political philosophy: citizens should be divided into three categories. One category of people are the rulers: they should be philosophers, according to Plato, this idea is based on his [[Theory of Forms]].
* [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]: Commonly considered the father of modern [[anarchism]], specifically [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].
* [[Ayn Rand]]: Founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and prime mover of the Objectivist and Libertarian movements in mid-twentieth-century America. Advocated a complete, laissez-faire capitalism. Rand held that the proper role of government was exclusively the protection of individual rights without economic interference. The government was to be separated from economics the same way and for the same reasons it was separated from religion. Any governmental action not directed at the defense of individual rights would constitute the initiation of force (or threat of force), and therefore a violation not only of rights but also of the legitimate function of government.
* [[Murray Rothbard]]: The central theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]] and an [[Austrian School]] economist.
* [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: Analyzed the social contract as an expression of the [[general will]], and controversially argued in favor of absolute [[democracy]] where the people at large would act as [[Sovereignty|sovereign]].
* [[Carl Schmitt]]: German political theorist, tied to the Nazis, who developed the concepts of the Friend/Enemy Distinction and the State of exception. Though his most influential books were written in the 1920s, he continued to write prolifically until his death (in academic quasi-exile) in 1985. He heavily influenced 20th-century political philosophy both within the Frankfurt School and among others, not all of whom are philosophers, such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Giorgio Agamben]].
* [[Adam Smith]]: Often said to have founded modern [[economics]]; explained emergence of economic benefits from the self-interested behavior ("the invisible hand") of artisans and traders. While praising its efficiency, Smith also expressed concern about the effects of industrial labor (e.g., repetitive activity) on workers. His work on moral sentiments sought to explain social bonds which enhance economic activity.
* [[Socrates]]: Widely considered the founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.
* [[Baruch Spinoza]]: Set forth the first analysis of ''[[rational egoism]]'', in which the rational interest of self is conformance with pure reason. To Spinoza's thinking, in a society in which each individual is guided by reason, political authority would be superfluous.
* [[Max Stirner]]: Important thinker within [[anarchism]] and the main representative of the anarchist current known as [[individualist anarchism]].
* [[Leo Strauss]]: Famously rejected modernity, mostly on the grounds of what he perceived to be modern political philosophy's excessive self-sufficiency of reason and flawed philosophical grounds for moral and political normativity. He argued instead we should return to pre-modern thinkers for answers to contemporary issues. His philosophy was influential on the formation of [[Neo-Conservativism]], and a number of his students later were members of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].
* [[Henry David Thoreau]]: Influential American thinker on such diverse later political positions and topics such as [[pacifism]], [[anarchism]], [[environmentalism]] and [[civil disobedience]] who influenced later important political activists such as [[Martin Luther King]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22222">In [[financial regulation]], "'''politically exposed person'''" ('''PEP''') is a term describing someone who has been entrusted with a prominent public function. A PEP generally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in [[bribery]] and [[corruption]] by virtue of their position and the influence that they may hold. The terms politically exposed person and '''senior foreign political figure''' are often used interchangeably, particularly in international forums.  [[Foreign official]] is a term for individuals deemed as government persons under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] or FCPA, and although definitions are similar to PEP, there are quite a few differences and should not be used interchangeably.  The term PEP is typically used referring to customers in the financial services industry, while 'foreign official' refers to the risks of third party relationships in all industries.

==Definition by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering==
While there is no global definition of a PEP, most countries have based their definition on the 2003 [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) standard, as for example the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority|Swiss financial market regulator]] in 2011, which quoted it as "the international standard"&lt;ref name="FINMA Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Due diligence obligations of Swiss banks when handling assets of "politically exposed persons".|url=http://www.finma.ch/e/aktuell/Documents/bericht_pep-abkl%C3%A4rung_20111110_e.pdf|date=10 November 2011|publisher=Eidgenoessische Finanzmarktaufsicht (FINMA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Australian government in 2015.&lt;ref name="Austrac Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft guidance note 15/01. Key terms used in 'politically exposed person' definition.|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/draft-gn1501-pep.docx|date=January 2015|publisher=Australian government|author=Australian Transaction reports and Analysis Center(Austrac)|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
FATF is an international inter-governmental body, founded in 1989 on the initiative of the [[G7]] and hosted by the [[OECD]], to set standards and promote implementing measures against [[money laundering]], [[financing of terrorism]] and financing of proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to preserve the integrity of the [[global financial system]].&lt;ref name="FATF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF_Recommendations.pdf|title=INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM &amp; PROLIFERATION|author=FATF|publisher=ATF/OECD|date=15 February 2012|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In February 2012, the FATF's latest definition of politically exposed persons (PEP), revised from 2003, is as follows:&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|123}} 
*''Foreign PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example [[Head of state|Heads of state]] or [[Head of government|Heads of government]], senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. 
*''Domestic PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with prominent public functions, for example Heads of State or of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. (Not all countries subscribe to the concept of domestic PEPs with respect to regulatory requirements/application of due diligence. For example, US law, specifically Section 312 of the USA Patriot Act and its implementing regulations provide for enhanced due diligence for SFPFs (Senior Foreign Political Figure) only, defined as: "a current or former senior official in the executive, legislative, administrative, military, or judicial branches of a 'foreign' government...a senior official of a major 'foreign' political party; and a senior executive of a 'foreign' government-owned commercial enterprise.)
*Persons who are or have been entrusted with a prominent function by a [[state owned enterprise]] or an [[international organisation]] refers to members of [[senior management]], i.e. directors, deputy directors and members of the board or equivalent functions.

Requirements for a PEP apply to [[family member]]s or close associates, any individual publicly known, or known by the financial institution to be a close personal or professional associate.&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|18}}
"The FATF definition is not intended to include middle-ranking or more junior individuals."&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|121}}

A forerunner definition was by the 1997 [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] aimed at reducing corruption in developing countries, which came into force February 1999; it used the term 'foreign official'.

==Implementation==
Most of the 37 FATF member countries treat domestic and foreign PEPs with heightened [[scrutiny]].  
The FATF guidance implies that if a person is a foreign PEP, it ''de facto'' makes them a domestic PEP in their own country. This makes sense for crime prevention, because to export proceeds of crime, the PEP must first use their own domestic financial system and thus, importance is placed on domestic, and non-foreign PEPs.&lt;ref name="Ukraine Crisis"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime |first=Christine |title=The $70 Billion Missing From the Ukraine: Does it Demonstrate a Whopping Failure of Global Anti-Money Laundering and Corruption Laws? Duhaime's Financial Guide and Anti-Money Laundering Law.|url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/2014/02/the-ukrainian-crisis-means-for-banks-funds-and-bitcoin.html|publisher=Duhaime Law|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Under Australia's AML/CTF Rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/businesses/legislation/amlctf-act|title=AML/CTF Act|first=Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre|last=(AUSTRAC)|date=30 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically exposed persons (PEPs) are individuals who occupy a prominent public position or functions in a government body or international organisation, both within and outside Australia. This definition also extends to their immediate family members and close associates.

The AML/CTF Rules define three categories of PEPs:

* Domestic PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an Australian government body
* Foreign PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in a government body of a foreign country.
* International organisation PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an international organisation.

A reporting entity must have procedures to identify whether any individual customer or beneficial owner is a PEP, or an associate of a PEP. The reporting entity must undertake this identification process before it provides the customer with a designated service, or as soon as practicable afterwards. A reporting entity must implement additional due diligence measures and risk management systems where the PEP is high ML/TF risk or is a foreign PEP.

===Canada===
Canada considers all foreign PEPs to pose a money laundering and terrorist financing risk.&lt;ref name="Politically Exposed Persons"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime |first=Christine |title=Politically Exposed Persons, Duhaime's Financial Guide and Anti-Money Laundering Law.|url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/aml-law-in-canada/politically-exposed-person|publisher=Duhaime Law|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act that came into effect in 2016, a politically exposed person now also includes all domestic PEPs and Heads of International Organisations (HIOs). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://complyadvantage.com/pep-screening-and-monitoring-in-canada/|title=PEP Screening &amp; Monitoring in Canada|last=|first=|date=7 June 2017|website=ComplyAdvantage|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{See also|Banco de Chile#Controversies{{!}}Banco de Chile}}

In Chile, financial institutions are mandated to report any transaction suspicious for potential involvement in bribery by virtue of a PEP's position and the influence that they may hold. {{As of| 2015}}, 2,200 to 3,000 individuals are considered PEPs, 150 of them foreign, and also their second grade relatives are under financial observation by the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Chilean newspaper ''[[La Tercera]]'' 22 February 2015, [http://www.latercera.com/noticia/negocios/2015/02/655-617858-9-pep-asi-opera-la-vigilancia-financiera-a-la-clase-politica.shtml PEP: así opera la vigilancia financiera a la clase política] Fernando Vega, retrieved on 22 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Financial Intelligence Centre amended the Financial Intelligence Centre Act to refer to Politically Influential Persons (PIP) instead of PEP. This was done in order to include private sector officials who have business dealings with public sector officials and elected officials in the public services procurement deals.

===UK===
{{As of |January 2015}} likewise the UK's PEP definition is identical to the 2003 FATF definition, i.e. without the 2012 update to include domestic PEPs; It is found in the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 Section 14(5)&lt;ref name=uk&gt;{{cite web|title=The Money Laundering Regulations 2007|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/2157/regulation/14/made|work=No. 2157 PART 2 Enhanced customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring, Regulation 14|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A politically exposed person is considered any individual who fits any of the criteria listed below:

* A foreign person who has held any time in the preceding year a prominent public function outside the United Kingdom, in a state or international institution
* Members of courts of auditors or of the boards of central banks
* Ambassadors, chargés d’affaires and high-ranking officers in the armed forces
* Members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of state-owned enterprises
* Heads of state, heads of government, ministers and deputy or assistant ministers
* Members of parliaments
* Members of supreme courts, constitutional courts or of other high-level judicial bodies
The definition explicitly excludes middle-ranking or more junior officials.

PEP status also extends to relatives and close associates. Relatives and close associates include a spouse, a partner, children and their spouses or partners and parents. Close associates include any individual who is known to have joint beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement, or any other close business relations. It also includes any individual who has sole beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement which is known to have been set up for the benefit of a person referred to in regulation.

The [[Financial Conduct Authority]] and Joint Money Laundering Steering Group both publish comprehensive guidance on both PEPs and other KYC related matters to assist firms in complying with their legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-fca.org.uk/money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing|title=FCA Information on Money Laundering &amp; Terrorist Financing|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th EU AML Directive is expected update the definition to include domestic PEPs, and limit relatives-status to spouse and partner only, and no longer the children and parents of PEPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMLD4 and Domestic PEPS

|url=http://www.lkshields.ie/publications/the-fourth-anti-money-laundering-directive|publisher=LK Shields}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The term [[foreign official]] has been used by US enforcement agencies relating to persons who have similar characteristics as PEPs, as referenced in the US [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].{{UnitedStatesCode|15|78dd-1}} It is used in all industries, not only by financial institutions. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]]'s [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN) did not use the term PEP in its regulations as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/testimony/pdf/20100204.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicious activity requires a financial institution to submit a [[suspicious activity report]] to FinCEN. The term 'Senior Foreign Political Figure', as defined by section 312 of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] is to a great extent similar to the definition of PEP, and also excludes middle-ranking or more junior individuals.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The term PEP is recognized (and was defined) by the 'Wolfsberg Group' of eleven global banks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/pdf/faq/Wolfsberg_PEP_FAQs_(2008).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The designation "politically exposed person" dates back to the late 1990s, in what was known as the "Abacha Affair." [[Sani Abacha]] was a Nigerian dictator who organized a large scale, systematic theft of assets from the Nigerian central bank for some years with his family members and associates. It is believed that several billion dollars were stolen, and that the funds were transferred to bank accounts in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="senat.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/ue/pac/E2734.html|date=30 June 2004|title=Proposition de directive du Parlement européen et du Conseil relative à la prévention de l'utilisation du système financier aux fins du blanchiment de capitaux, y compris le financement du terrorisme|language=French|author=French Senate,Justice et affaires intérieures|publisher=French Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Nigerian Government that succeeded the Abacha Regime made an effort to recover the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200108080222.html|title=Nigeria: Abacha Loot: Swiss Govt to Dock 60 Bankers, Lawyers|first=Chidi|last='Uzor|date=8 August 2001|publisher=|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lodged complaints with several European agencies, including the [[Federal Office of Police]] of [[Switzerland]] which investigated close to sixty Swiss banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=en&amp;msg-id=22828|title=Switzerland provides mutual legal assistance in the Abacha case - To date, USD 645 million have been frozen in Switzerland|author=|date=21 January 2000|publisher=Federal Office of Justice Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this investigation, the concept of "politically exposed person" emerged, around which the UN organised a committee in December 2000, that eventually led to the October 2003 resolution of [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], entered into force in December 2005, with ongoing annual reviews of implementation and asset recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention against Corruption|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html#UNCACfulltext|publisher=UN office of drugs and crime (UNODC)|accessdate=12 February 2015|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had become [[European Union law]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="senat.fr"/&gt;

PEP-specific compliance legislation addresses the link between [[government corruption]], [[money laundering]] and [[terrorism financing]].&lt;ref name="FATF Guidance"&gt;{{cite web|title=FATF Guidance on PEP Legislation.|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Guidance-PEP-Rec12-22.pdf|publisher=FATF|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 11, 2001, more than 100 countries have changed their laws related to financial services regulation, combating political corruption.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Heavy fines have been imposed on financial institutions for conducting business with PEPs without following adequate procedures, as in the case of [[Riggs Bank]].&lt;ref name="Riggs Bank"&gt;{{cite web|title=At Riggs Bank, A Tangled Path Led to Scandal.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/19/us/at-riggs-bank-a-tangled-path-led-to-scandal.html|publisher=New York Times|date=19 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of regulation, political leaders like [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]] have made news in 2013 for having [[Toxic asset|frozen assets]] in US banks that did not follow [[due diligence]].&lt;ref name="Mubarak Asset Freeze"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frozen Mubarak assets worth around $1bn.|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/04/17/efsa-frozen-mubarak-assets-worth-around-1bn/|publisher=Daily News Egypt|date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk screening and PEP datasets==
Most financial institutions view a PEP as a potential compliance risk, and perform enhanced monitoring of accounts that fall within this category. Screening for PEPs is usually performed at the beginning of account opening, called initial [[due diligence]] or [[know your customer]] (KYC). Screening of accounts periodically is performed as part of ongoing due diligence.

There are a number of companies advertising for regulatory, financial and reputational risk screening. 

Due diligence to uncover PEPs can be time consuming and requires the checking of names, dates of birth, national identification numbers and photos of clients against a reputable database of known PEPs, which usually contains over one million profiles.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} No 'official' PEP list exist. The [[CIA]] and [[United Nations|UN]] have lists of [[heads of state]]s, which fall below the PEP definitions of FATF. 

Vendors maintain their own particular database of PEPs and other high-risk customers.  The world's largest PEP database of 1.6 million counterparts gives Accuity [4] part of RELX Group (formerly Reed Elsevier) [5] a strong market position.

Geneva based Polixis&lt;ref&gt;http://polixis.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is seen as a challenger solution since it offers an AI-driven database of PEPs with a peculiarity that the data can be linked to a much larger set of economic data through their ARDIS software.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tdg.ch/geneve/geneve-bureau-polixis-robotise-controle-clients-fortunes-banques/story/19614383&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of crowd sourced lists of Politically Exposed Persons being made available utilizing public contributions. As of March 2016, Ukrainian activists has announced the launch of publicly available Register of Politically Exposed Persons – pep.org.ua, an exclusive public online database designed to help to withstand money laundering from state Ukrainian budget through international banks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7880">'''Prohibitionism''' is a [[legal philosophy]] and [[political theory]] often used in [[lobbying]] which holds that citizens will abstain from actions if the actions are typed as unlawful (i.e. prohibited) and the prohibitions are enforced by law enforcement.&lt;ref name=cantystrategies&gt;C Canty, A Sutton. ''Strategies for community-based drug law enforcement: From prohibition to harm reduction''; in T Stockwell, PJ Gruenewald, JW Toumbourou, WLoxley W, eds. ''Preventing Harmful Substance Use: The Evidence Base for Policy and Practice.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2005. pp. 225-236.&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy has been the basis for many acts of [[statutory law]] throughout history, most notably when a large group of a given population disapproves of and/or feels threatened by an activity in which a smaller group of that population engages, and seeks to render that activity legally prohibited.&lt;ref name=cantystrategies/&gt;

== Examples ==
Acts of prohibition have included [[sumptuary law|prohibitions on types of clothing]] (and [[Public nudity|prohibitions on lack of clothing]]), prohibitions on [[gambling]] and [[striptease|exotic dancing]], the [[prohibition of drugs]] (for example, [[prohibition of alcohol|alcohol prohibition]] and [[cannabis prohibition]]), [[smoking ban|prohibitions on tobacco smoking]], and [[gun prohibition]]. Indeed, the period of [[Prohibition in the United States]] between 1920 and 1933 due to the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and the [[Volstead Act]] often is referred to simply as "[[Prohibition]]", as is the "[[War on Drugs]]" that succeeded it. &lt;br /&gt;
An additional example, called ''nettle war'': Since 2002 in [[France]] the sale of nettle liquid manure was prohibited, and since 2006, unauthorized plant protection products (such as nettle liquid manure) to sell, own and operate.  Even [[advertising]] and recommendations for these products were not allowed. Only since 2011, it was legalized again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000023912654 Decree 2011: Nettles were legalized again (fr)] Retrieved 16 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The film by [[Arte]] about it was completed in 2010 (''Nettle-war, mysterious plants - Nettle'', 42:04 minutes)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eraclito450.blogspot.de/2013/09/brennessel-krieg-geheimnisvolle.html nettle-war in France] Retrieved 16 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2009}}
The success of a measure of prohibitionism has been criticized as often depending too much upon effective enforcement of the relevant legislation. Some people{{Who|date=July 2011}} have argued this is because the majority of the targets of prohibitionism are in the category of [[victimless crime]], where they claim the harm that comes from the crime is non-existent, questionable, or only to the person who performs the act and even then the magnitude of the harm being relatively small.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Under this interpretation enforcement becomes a conflict between violation of statue and violation of free will.{{Why?|date=July 2011}} Since the acts prohibited often are enjoyable, enforcement is often the most harmful choice to the individual. This sometimes results in laws which rarely are enforced by anybody who does not have a financial or personal motivation to do so.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The difficulty of enforcing prohibitionist laws also criticized as resulting in selective enforcement, wherein the enforcers select the people they wish to prosecute based on other criteria, resulting in [[discrimination]] based on races, culture, nationality, or financial status. For example, [[United States|American]] philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] has criticized drug prohibition as being a technique of [[social control]] of the "so-called dangerous classes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20020208.htm Noam Chomsky, "On the War on Drugs", ''Week Online'', DRCNet, February 8, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prohibitionism based laws have the added problem of calling attention to the behavior that they are attempting to prohibit.  This can make the behavior interesting and exciting, and cause its popularity to increase. This is essentially in relation with the [[Streisand effect]].

'''Qanun''' is an Arabic word ({{lang-ar|قانون}}, ''qānūn''; {{lang-ota|قانون}}, ''kānūn'', derived from {{lang-grc|κανών}} ''kanōn'', which is also the root for the modern English word "[[canon law|canon]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kanw/n|κανών|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Between God and the Sultan: A History of Islamic Law|author=Knut S.

It is thus frequently translated as "dynastic law". The idea of ''kanun'' first entered the Muslim World in the thirteenth century, as it was borrowed from the [[Mongol Empire]] in the aftermath of their invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burak |first=Guy |title=The Second Formation of Islamic Law: The Ḥanafī School in the Early Modern Ottoman Empire |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-107-09027-9 |pages=17–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th sultan of the Ottoman Empire, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman]] was known in the Ottoman Empire as Suleiman Kanuni ("the Lawgiver"), due to his code of laws. 

After the fall of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in 1258, a practice known to the [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Mongols]] transformed itself into qanun, which gave power to [[caliphate|caliphs]], [[governor]]s, and sultans alike to "make their own regulations for activities not addressed by the sharia."&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"&gt;Berg, Herbert. "Islamic Law." Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History 3 (2005): 1030. In History Reference Center[database online]. Available from Snowden Library . Retrieved February 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This became increasingly important as the Middle East started to modernize, thus running into the problems of a modern state, which were not covered by sharia. The Qanun began to unfold as early as Umar I (586–644 CE).&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"/&gt; Many of the regulations covered by qanun were based on financial matters or tax systems adapted through the law and regulations of those territories Islam conquered.&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"/&gt;

The term ḳānūn derives itself from the Greek word κανών. Originally having the less abstract meaning of “any straight rod” it then later referred to any “measure or rule” in Greek. The word was then translated into and adopted by the Arabic language after the Ottoman Empire’s conquest of Egypt under Sultan [[Selim I]] (ca. 1516). In the Ottoman empire, the term ḳānūn still carried the word’s original meanings of a system of tax regulation. However, it later came to also refer to “code of regulations” or “state law”, a well-defined secular distinction to “Muslim law” known as the s̲h̲arīʿa. The ḳānūn took on significant importance during the period of modernization in the Ottoman Empire. The ḳānūn and s̲h̲arīʿa did not contradict each other concerning administrative matters, and therefore the ḳānūn was assimilated easily into Ottoman regulatory functions. The ḳānūn promulgated by Ottoman sultans also came to be used for financial and penal law. Under Sultan Mehmed II (1451-1481) the ḳānūn continued to be strictly applied for these practices. However due to the influence of [[Ebussuud Efendi|Abu ʾl-Suʿūd]], [[Grand Mufti|grand muftī]] of Istanbul from 1545 to 1574 the ḳānūn was applied to deal with matters concerning property rights as well. Previously, property rights were exclusively under the jurisdiction of the s̲h̲arīʿa. Despite this seeming contradiction, due to skillful bureaucratic operations, the ḳānūn and the s̲h̲arīʿa existed harmoniously. The ḳānūn has retained its relevance in the Middle East regarding civil, commercial, administrative, and penal laws that were inspired by originally Western legislation. It also has an influence in the ways that provisions of the s̲h̲arīʿa are reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Linant de Bellefonds, Y., Cahen, Cl., İnalcık, Halil, and Ed. “Ḳānūn”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6067">In [[law]], a '''question of law''', also known as a '''point of law''', is a question that must be answered by applying relevant legal principles to interpretation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Treatise on Trial by Jury, Including Questions of Law and Fact |last=Proffatt |first=John |date=1877 |publisher=William S. Hein &amp; Co. |isbn=9780899417073 |edition=1986 reprint |location=Buffalo, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a question is distinct from a '''question of fact''', which must be answered by reference to facts and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] as well as inferences arising from those facts. Answers to questions of law are generally expressed in terms of broad legal principles and can be applied to many situations rather than be dependent on particular circumstances or factual situations. An answer to a question of law as applied to the particular facts of a case is often referred to as a "conclusion of law."

In several civil law jurisdictions, the highest courts consider questions of fact settled by the lower court and will only consider questions of law. They thus may refer a case back to a lower court to re-apply the law and answer any fact-based evaluations based on their answer on the application of the law. International courts such as the [[Benelux Court of Justice]] and the [[European Court of Justice]] will only answer questions of law, asked by judges of national courts if they are not certain about the interpretation of the law of multilateral organizations.

While questions of fact are resolved by a ''trier of fact'', which in the [[common law]] system is often a [[jury]], questions of law are always resolved by a [[judge]] or equivalent. Whereas findings of fact in a common law legal system are rarely overturned by an [[appellate court]], conclusions of law are more readily reconsidered.

==Question of fact==
In [[law]], a question of fact, also known as a point of fact, is a question that must be answered by reference to facts and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] as well as inferences arising from those facts. Such a question is distinct from a question of law, which must be answered by applying relevant legal principles. The answer to a question of fact (a "'''finding of fact'''") usually depends on particular circumstances or factual situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Question of fact|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/question_of_fact|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=[[Cornell University Law School]]|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All questions of fact are capable of proof or disproof by reference to a certain standard of proof. Depending on the nature of the matter, the standard of proof may require that a fact be proven to be "more likely than not" (there is barely more evidence for the fact than against, as established by a preponderance of the evidence) or true beyond [[legal burden of proof|reasonable doubt]].

Answers to questions of fact are determined by a ''[[trier of fact]]'' such as a [[jury]], or a [[judge]]. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[appellate court]]s generally do not consider appeals based on errors of fact (errors in answering a question of fact). Rather, the findings of fact of the first venue are usually given great [[deference]] by [[appellate court]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharma|first1=Riecha|last2=Tacey|first2=Sam|title=The Decision is Final: English High Court Rules That There Can Be No Appeal Against Arbitration Awards on Issues of Fact|url=http://www.edwardswildman.com/insights/PublicationDetail.aspx?publication=2112|website=edwardswildman.com|publisher=[[Edwards Wildman Palmer]]|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The distinction between "law" and "fact" has proved obscure wherever it is employed. For instance, the common law used to require that a plaintiff's complaint in a civil action only state the "facts" of his case, not any "legal conclusions." Unfortunately, no one has ever been able to tell whether the allegation that "on November 9, the defendant negligently ran over the plaintiff with his car at the intersection of State Street and Chestnut Street" is a statement of fact or a legal conclusion. In fact, the distinction between law and fact is just the legal version of the philosophical distinction between "empirical" and "analytical" statements, a distinction on whose existence philosophers have been unable to agree to this day.... we will see that many defendants charged with impossible attempts are not in fact attempting the crime they are charged with attempting. They merely think they are committing a crime.... It would be merely foolish to assert that it is of no interest whatever to know that ''The Disciples'' is a forgery. But to the man who has never heard of either Vermeer or van Meegeren and who stands in front of ''The Disciples'' admiring it, it can make no difference whether he is told that it is a seventeenth-century Vermeer or a twentieth-century van Meegeren in the style of Vermeer. And when some deny this and argue vehemently that, indeed, it does make a great deal of difference, they are only admitting that ''they'' do know something about Vermeer and van Meegeren and the history of art and the value and reputation of certain masters. They are only admitting that they do not judge a work of art on purely aesthetic grounds, but also take into account when it was created, by whom, and how great a reputation it or its creator has.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Bad Acts and Guilt Minds: Conundrums of Criminal Law |last=Katz |first=Leo |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1987 |isbn=9780226425924 |location=Chicago, IL |pages=276–293 |chapter=The Crime That Never Was: a Fake Opinion in Case involving Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Publisher: Thomson Gale, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7876-6367-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''the rule according to a higher law'' may serve as a practical legal criterion to qualify the instances of political or economical decision-making, when a [[government]], even though acting in conformity with clearly defined and properly enacted legal [[Law|rules]], still produces results which many observers find unfair or unjust.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers|M.N.S. Sellers]], ''Republican Legal Theory: The History, Constitution and Purposes of Law in a Free State'', Basingstoke, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The idea of a law of ultimate justice over and above the momentary law of the state—a higher law—was first introduced into post-Roman Europe by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] jurists.&lt;ref&gt;Wormser, ''The Story of the LAW'', pg. 189&lt;/ref&gt; "Higher law" can be interpreted in this context as the [[divine law|divine]] or [[natural law]] or basic legal values, established in the [[international law]] – the choice depending on the viewpoint. But this is definitely a Law above the law.&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Corwin, ''The “Higher Law” Background of American Constitutional Law'' (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; And it is in this capacity that it possesses the equal legal value for both the [[common law|common]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, as opposed to natural law which is largely associated with common law.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie F. Goldstein, ''Popular Sovereignty, the Origins of Judicial Review, and the Revival of Unwritten Law'', Journal of Politics 48 (1986): 51–71&lt;/ref&gt; "To recognize the necessary connection between the rule of law as an ideal and well-constructed constitutional government does not and should not be taken to imply that all states can or should maintain the same constitutional structures in practice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers]], ''An Introduction. The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, pp. 4–5. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The rule according to higher law'' is a practical approach to the implementation of the higher law theory which creates a bridge of mutual understanding (with regard to universal legal values) between the English language doctrine of the [[rule of law]], traditional for the countries of common law, and the originally German doctrine of ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'', translated into other languages of continental Europe as ''État de droit'' (Fr.), ''Estado de derecho'' (Sp.), ''Stato di diritto'' (It.), and ''Правовое государство'' (Ru.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75 Anniversary of the Roerich Pact, Grid Belgium, 2010]. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter doctrine is the product of continental European legal thought which had adopted it from German legal philosophy. Its name can be translated into English as "state of law" —meaning the state in which the exercise of governmental power is kept in check by the higher law rather than by the changeable law established by this state.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Amartya Sen]] mentioned that the legal theorists in ancient India used term of classical Sanskrit "nyāya" in the sense of not just a matter of judging institutions and rules, but of judging the societies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Amartya Sen, ''Global justice'' in ''Global Perspectives on the Rule of Law'', edited by [[James J. Heckman]], Robert L. Nelson, Lee Cabating and Paul Lepore, Routledge, London and New York, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Before the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], [[African American]]s were legally denied equal rights and freedoms pursuant to formally valid codes prescribing the relations between master and slave. Although these codes were ''de jure'' fully suitable for application in legal practice, their enforcement by the then U.S. government ''de facto'' violated basic human rights of a significant part of the population. [[William H. Seward]] famously proclaimed that slavery is forbidden under "a higher law than the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]."

Generally speaking, the occurrence of such "justly enacted unjust laws" fully depends on the stance taken by the country's political leadership towards [[the rule of law]] principle.

In some countries, the political leaders assert that the rule of law is purely a procedural concept. Therefore, they argue that any government may strip its subjects of their fundamental freedoms or infringe their vital interests so long as this is done by way of a duly implemented legal mechanism. For example, at the [[Nuremberg trials]], in an attempt to justify their crimes against Jewish and Romany population of Europe during [[World War II]], some of the former leaders of [[Nazi Germany]] argued that they had broken none of the laws effective when Hitler had been in power. It was only by invoking the rule according to a higher law that the Allied prosecutors were able to overcome such defenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/ha/ga_95-I/ga_95-I.html Introductory note by Antonio Cassese] for General Assembly resolution 95(I) of 11 December 1946 (Affirmation of the Principles of International Law recognized by the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal) on the website of the [https://www.un.org/law/avl/ UN Audiovisual Library of International Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, conversely, the political leaders assert that all written laws must be kept in line with the universal principles of morality, fairness, and justice. These leaders argue that, as a necessary corollary to the axiom that "no one is above the law," the rule of law requires the government to treat all persons equally under the law. However, the proclaimed right to equal treatment is susceptible to instantly becoming void each time the government denies a sufficient level of respect, dignity, and autonomy to a certain class of individuals or to human rights in general."&lt;ref&gt;Augusto Zimmermann, ''Constitutions Without Constitutionalism: The Failure of Constitutionalism in Brazil, The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, p.101. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the unwritten and universally self-explanatory principles of equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect are said to overrule conventional written laws enacted by the government. It is these principles that are often referred to as "natural law." They also constitute the basis of the "higher law theory".

==''Rechtsstaat''==
The ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' doctrine (legal state, state of right, constitutional state, constitutional government) was first introduced by the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in his latest works completed after the U.S. and French constitutions had been adopted in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=[[The Constitution of Liberty]]|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|date=1960|pages=196-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of country’s written [[constitution]] created using principles of the Higher Law. This supremacy meant creating guarantees for the implementation of his central idea: a permanently peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness and prosperity of the citizens. Kant was basing his doctrine exclusively on the idea of constitutionalism and constitutional government.

The Russian legal system, born in the 19th century as a result of the transformations initiated by the reforms of the [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]], was (and still is) based primarily upon the German legal tradition. It was from the latter that Russia had adopted the doctrine of ''Rechtsstaat'', which literally translates as "Legal State." Its closest English analogue is "the rule of law."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, ''Defining the rules'', ''The European Lawyer'', Issue 90, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Legal state concept adopts the written constitution as the country's supreme law (the rule of constitution). It is a fundamental but undefined principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia’s post-Communist constitution: "The Russian Federation – Russia – constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance." Similarly, the very first dispositive provision of Ukraine’s Constitution declares that "Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state." Hence, the effort to invest meaning to the "Legal State" definition is anything but theoretical.

[[Valery Zorkin]], President of the Constitutional Court of Russia, wrote in 2003, "Becoming a legal state has long been our ultimate goal, and we have certainly made serious progress in this direction over the past several years. However, no one can say now that we have reached this destination. Such a legal state simply cannot exist without a lawful and just society. Here, as in no other sphere of our life, the state reflects the level of maturity reached by the society."&lt;ref&gt;''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform'', edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concept of Legal state has adopted many segments of [[constitutional economics]] which serves as a practical implementation of the higher law theory in economics.

Economist [[James M. Buchanan]] argues that, in the framework of constitutional government, any governmental intervention or regulation must be conditioned by the three following assumptions. First, every failure of the market economy to function smoothly and perfectly can be corrected by governmental intervention. Second, those holding political office and manning the bureaucracies are altruistic upholders of the public interest, unconcerned with their own personal economic well-being. And third, changing the government responsibilities towards more intervention and control will not profoundly and perversely affect the social and economic life.

Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the [[state (polity)|state]] as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members." This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics. A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid a one-dimensional understanding. Buchanan, together with Kant, believes that a [[constitution]] in its capacity as the Higher Law, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions, while balancing interests of the state and society against those of individuals, with their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness.

Buchanan also outlines importance of protection of the moral principles underlying constitutional norms. He writes that "the ethics of constitutional citizenship is not directly comparable to ethical behavior in interaction with other persons within the constraints imposed by the rules of an existing regime. An individual may be fully responsible, in the standard ethical sense, and yet fail to meet the ethical requirement of constitutional citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J., ''Logical Formulations of Constitutional Liberty'', Vol. 1., Indianapolis, 1999. P. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarah Anne Coakley''' (born 10 September 1951) is an English [[Anglican]] [[systematic theologian]] and [[philosopher of religion]] with interdisciplinary interests. She is the [[Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], and professorial fellow of [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge]].

==Early life and education==
Born on 10 September 1951 into a wealthy family of lawyers in [[London]], Coakley attended [[Blackheath High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2714 |title=Sarah Coakley Reconstructs Feminism |publisher=Religion-online.org |date=2003-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, she spent a gap year teaching English and Latin in Lesotho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humbleapproach.templeton.org/faith/chair.html |title=Faith, Rationality, and the Passions - Chair |publisher=Humbleapproach.templeton.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her education continued at [[New Hall, Cambridge|New Hall]] (now [[Murray Edwards College]]), University of Cambridge (BA, First Class Honours, 1973) and at [[Harvard Divinity School]] (ThM, 1975), to which she went as a Harkness Fellow.  Her PhD on [[Ernst Troeltsch]] is also from the [[University of Cambridge]] (1983).

==Career==
===Academic career===
Coakley has taught at [[Lancaster University]] (1976–1991), at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] (1991–1993) and at [[Harvard University]] in the divinity school (1993–2007; as Mallinckrodt Professor of Divinity, 1995–2007). She was a visiting professor of religion at [[Princeton University]] (2003–2004). In 2006, she was elected the [[Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity]] at the University of Cambridge (the first woman appointed to this chair) and took up the position in 2007. In 2011, she became Deputy Chair of the School of Arts and Humanities with a four-year appointment on the General Board of the university.

Coakley's teaching and research interests cover a number of disciplines cognate to [[systematic theology]], including the [[philosophy of religion]], the [[philosophy of science]], [[patristics]], [[feminist theory]] and the intersections of law and medicine with religion.  Her contributions to these areas have generally been by way of co-ordinating research projects and editing or co-editing collections of papers. It was through these collaborative projects that her profile gained a level of international prominence. Indeed, at the time of her appointment to the Norris-Hulse chair in Cambridge, Coakley had not published a monograph subsequent to the 1988 publication of her doctoral thesis. She has been working on a four-volume systematic theology, the first volume of which was published in 2013 as ''God, Sexuality and the Self: An Essay 'On the Trinity'''.

From 2005 to 2008, Coakley co-directed, with [[Martin A. Nowak]], the "Evolution and Theology of Cooperation" project at Harvard University, sponsored by the [[Templeton Foundation]], out of which has come a co-edited volume, ''Evolution, Games, and God: The Principle of Cooperation''.  An earlier interdisciplinary project on "Pain and Its Transformations" undertaken with [[Arthur Kleinman]] at Harvard (as part of the Mind, Brain, Behavior Initiative), produced ''Pain and Its Transformations: The Interface of Biology and Culture'' (co-ed. with Kay Kaufman Shelemay, Harvard UP, 2007).

Coakley delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]] in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/gifford/about/|title=Gifford Lecture Series 2012/|publisher=[[University of Aberdeen]]|accessdate=1 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020122043/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/gifford/about/|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordained ministry===
Coakley was [[ordained]] in the [[Church of England]] as a [[Deacon#Anglicanism|deacon]] in 2000 and as a [[Priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="Crockford"&gt;{{Crockford| surname = COAKLEY (née FURBER) | forenames = Sarah Anne | id = 2133 | accessed = 11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has assisted in parishes in Waban, Massachusetts, and at [[Church of St Mary and St Nicholas, Littlemore]], Oxford, England (where she served her title).  Her training for the priesthood included periods working in a hospital and a prison.  In 2011 she was appointed an honorary canon of [[Ely Cathedral]] where she assists with the morning office and Eucharist.

In 2012, she was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to change Church of England rules to allow women to become bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/11/23/3639111.htm |title=Has the Church of England finally lost its reason?

==Personal life==
Coakley is married to  J. F. Coakley, a Syriac scholar and fine printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jericho-press.com|title=The Jericho Press|website=www.jericho-press.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have two daughters, who attended [[Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols|Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols school]] in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/12/09/private-schools-most-expensive-biz-cx_tvr_1211prep_slide_10.html |title=America's Most Expensive Prep Schools |publisher=Forbes |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2013-08-17 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120730224726/http://www.forbes.com/2006/12/09/private-schools-most-expensive-biz-cx_tvr_1211prep_slide_10.html |archivedate=2012-07-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her brother is a legal adviser to [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farrer.co.uk/people/james-furber/ |title=James Furber |publisher=Farrer |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her father, a wealthy lawyer and bon viveur, died in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/09/09/bobby-furber-lawyer-collector-sportsman-and-bon-viveur/|title=Bobby Furber, lawyer, collector, sportsman and bon viveur – obituary|date=9 September 2016|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secular arm''', in [[ecclesiastical law]], refers to the legal authority of the civil power, the State, or any [[Laity|lay]] authority, invoked by the Church to punish offenders in cases properly belonging to the jurisdiction of the Church. In the [[Middle Ages]] especially in Inquisition trials for [[heresy]], or grave immorality, ecclesiastical courts delivered convicted clerical and lay offenders over to the secular arm to administer severe capital punishments. The phrase "[[Spanish Inquisition#Sentencing|relaxed]] to the secular arm" was used by the [[Spanish Inquistion]] to describe the handover of the condemned heretic.

The medieval Latin phrase 'brachium seculare' was translated first into late Middle English.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, Religion&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Introduced circa 1180–1250 at the time of the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the church inquisitors delivered a [[Cathar]] heretic, or any heretic, to the secular arm, to be burnt at the stake. 
Under [[canon law]] church tribunals had no jurisdiction to impose penalties involving mutilation or death.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages p.260&lt;/ref&gt;
Notably the contrary circumstance of appeal by individuals to the secular authorities to interfere with, or hinder, the process of ecclesiastical jurisdiction was until recently punished in the [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholic]] [[Catholic Church|Church]] by [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (3 ed.)p.532&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal law requires states to have a minimum age of 18 years for sale/purchase of tobacco products (21 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;387f. (3)(a)(ii)). State and local laws may extend this ban and also prohibit supply, possession and consumption to/by person underage, or increase the age beyond 18. However, most states do not directly ban the consumption of tobacco by a minor. The federal law requiring states to have a minimum purchasing age at 18 is enforced by withholding [[FEMA]] disaster and non-disaster grants from states that have purchasing ages under 18, and currently no state falls under that category.

In addition, the store involved will have the tobacco license suspended for 6 months at the first offense, and permanently revoked for the second offense. However, if the store involved is caught selling to minors in school uniform, or to minors below the age of 12, the tobacco license will be permanently revoked even at its first offense.

Anyone caught buying tobacco products for an under-aged person will be charged in court can be fined up to 2,500 Singapore for the first offence, and up to 5,000 for the second and subsequent offences.

'''Substantive rights''' are basic [[human rights]] possessed by people in an ordered [[society]] and include [[rights]] granted by [[natural law]] as well as the [[substantive law]]. Substantive rights involve a right to the substance of being human (life, liberty, happiness), rather than a right to a procedure to enforce that right, which is defined by [[procedural law]].

'''Trial advocacy''' is the branch of knowledge concerned with making attorneys and other advocates more effective in trial proceedings.  Trial advocacy is taught in primary, secondary, and undergraduate schools (usually associated with a [[mock trial]] elective).&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, John E. ''Law for Business and Personal Use'' p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  It is taught as an essential trade skill for litigators in [[law school]]s and in [[continuing legal education]] programs.

The skills of trial advocacy can be broken into two categories: skills that accomplish individual tasks ([[Tactic (method)|tactical skills]]) such as selecting jurors, delivering opening statements and closing arguments, and examining witnesses, and those skills that integrate the individual actions to achieve greater effects and to drive unfolding events toward the advocate’s desired outcome ([[litigation strategy|strategy]]) .&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S., ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[law school]] trial advocacy courses focus on tactical skills, though some integrate basic methods of strategic planning.  Some academics have expressed disfavor with advanced strategic techniques because of the imbalance they create, especially against attorneys who are unaware of them.  Proponents of advanced strategic techniques argue that these methods are the only effective means to counter the already-existing imbalances in the system, as between [[indigent]] defendants and the state, and between working-class [[plaintiff]]s and well-resourced, [[wealth]]y [[Conglomerate (company)|corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://advocacyteaching.blogspot.com/2013/01/trial-advocacy-professors-tell-me-that.html Selby-Dreier Debate on ''Advocacy Teaching'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like most legal skills, trial advocacy evolved through the apprenticeship and practice of attorneys.  Even after 1900 (when the education of attorneys shifted to [[law schools]]&lt;ref&gt;Harno, Albert James (2004), ''Legal Education in the United States'' p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;) most law schools offered little education in advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Kutcher, Edward A.; Lee, Robert B. (1962) ''The Deterioration of Trial Advocacy-Are the Laws Schools Responsible?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Bar Association (1967) ''The Law School Curriculum and Advocacy Training''&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1969, in response to criticism within the judicial system that law schools were not properly preparing attorneys for trial practice, a group of lawyers and law professors combined to form the [[National Institute for Trial Advocacy]] (NITA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nita.org/About#History NITA website]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many law schools have added or improved their instruction in trial advocacy, and numerous [[Continuing Legal Education]] organizations have offered classes surveying the subject area, and on specific topics within the field.  Currently nearly one dozen law schools in the United States offer [[Master of Law]] (LL.M.) degrees in trial advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, Eric, Princeton Review (2013) ''The Best 168 Law Schools''&lt;/ref&gt;
Trial advocacy originally focused on individual actions within the trial, proposing methods for improved selection of jurors, delivery of argument, and direct and cross examination.  However, in the 1970s, NITA advanced the concepts of theme and theory as methods of integrating the various components into a cohesive whole.&lt;ref&gt;Lubet, Steven (2004) ''Modern Trial Advocacy''&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, [[Litigation Strategy|litigation strategy]] has blossomed with the importation of concepts from economic [[game theory]], [[Complexity theory and organizations|complexity theory]], [[Gestalt psychology]], and the application of [[maneuver warfare]] as a means not only of integrating the various actions within the trial into a comprehensive case, but also as a means of gaining a decisive advantage over opposing counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics in trial advocacy==
The topics commonly encompassed within Trial Advocacy are:

===Jury selection or ''voir dire''===
{{Main|Jury selection|Voir dire}}
The selection of jurors that will be receptive to the argument the attorney intends to make.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 529 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening statement===
{{Main|Opening statement}}
Presenting a non-argumentative overview of what the jury will see, often in the context of the attorney’s theme, theory and story.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 8 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct examination===
{{Main|Direct examination}}
Eliciting evidence from one’s own witnesses through non-[[leading question]]s.  Because studies have shown that people best remember the first and the most recent (last) information heard (methods referred to as [[Serial position effect|primacy and recency]]), the preferred method is to start with an engaging and favorable topic, move through more mundane matters, and to finish on a strong, favorable point.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 45 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross examination===
{{Main|Cross examination}}
Working with witnesses offered by the opposing party who may be [[hostile witness|hostile]] or uncooperative.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 83 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing argument===
{{Main|Closing argument}} 
Using [[argument]] to create within the jurors a perception of what they have seen and heard that influences them to find in favor of the attorney’s client.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 467 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persuasion===
{{Main|Persuasion}}
The general principles that enable an advocate to make the jurors more receptive to his claims.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Lubet, p. 16, 32 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mock trial===
{{Main|Mock trial}}
In mock trial, students take responsibility for the [[prosecution]]/[[plaintiff]] or [[defense counsel|defense]] case in a trial presented using fabricated evidence, and role-players as witnesses and faculty or volunteers as judge or jury.  It evaluates the participants’ skills in argument, evidence handling, and examination of witnesses, but omits jury selection and strategic matters.  Mock trial differs from [[moot court]] in that moot court practices appellate argument, and so involves no handling of witnesses or evidence, but rather is an exercise in legal research and oral advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Korzen, John (2010) ''Make Your Argument: Succeeding in Moot Court and Mock Trial''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic trial strategy===
{{Main|Litigation strategy}}
The means of organizing a case into a clear and complete presentation.
* Case Diagrams: In which the attorney charts the elements he / she intends to prove (or attack) and the evidence that will support each. These ensures the case is comprehensively addressed.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g. Indiana Law School web site [http://www.law.indiana.edu/instruction/tanford/web/reference/basictactics.html], accessed March 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theme and Theory: The theme is a sound bite that captures the emotional appeal of the case, and the theory is an explanation of events.  These serve as strategic focal points, allowing individual actions (opening, examination of each witness, etc.) to be united with a common focus, and in a way that clarifies and reinforces the perception of the case the attorney wants the jury or judge to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 411 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced trial strategy===
{{Main|Litigation strategy}}
The means of organizing the case to maximize the combined impact of every element, and to overwhelm or outmaneuver the opposing counsel while presenting a clear, decisive argument to the jury (or judge, in the case of bench trials).&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'' pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced strategic skills, based upon [[psychology]] and [[maneuver warfare|military maneuver philosophy]], are generally learned outside the classroom, as few law schools teach them.  In fact, [[academic]]s have criticized advanced strategic techniques for tipping [[verdict]]s through means unrelated to the [[merit (law)|merits of the case]].  For example, these techniques may be used to cause an advocate unfamiliar with them to take actions that unwittingly undermine his client’s interests.  There is particular concern regarding the use of advanced strategic techniques by [[prosecutor]]s, who already wield the substantial power of the State against often poorly resourced defendants.

The counterargument is that strategy can correct already-existing imbalances in the justice system, such as when inexperienced advocates must face highly experienced ones, when [[law firm|small firms]] oppose large ones, and when poor clients must litigate their rights against wealthy ones.  Under the current system, without a well-developed strategy, a small firm with a poor client stands almost no chance of success against a large firm with its greater resources, regardless of the merits of the case.
* [[Litigation strategy|Maneuver strategy]] An alternative to arguing the evidence or the law, maneuver strategies pursue solutions such as redirecting the focus of the trial, reshaping the way events are perceived, or disrupting or surprising the opposing counsel, rendering him ineffective at responding to unfolding events.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  While these methods are practiced widely, even by advocates not educated in strategy, some object to this as improper even when practiced ethically, as it subordinates the importance of the evidence and the law in determining a trial's outcome.  One proponent of maneuver strategy, however, has noted that regardless of whether the attorney intends to leverage the tools of maneuver strategy, the attorney must understand the methods or she will be ill-equipped to identify and counter them.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, pp. 86–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gestalt psychology]] This branch of psychology focuses on how things are perceived in whole as opposed to how individual components appear.  It aids in ensuring the jury (or judge, in bench trials) perceives events as the attorney desires, and it offers a means of shaping the way witnesses and opposing counsel will perceive the problems an attorney raises for them during trial.  When coupled with game theory, shaping perception allows an attorney to influence or shape the actions the hostile witness or counsel take.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 37–40, 83–4&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Game theory]] Game theory offers models of how people make decisions.  In trial practice, game theory is useful in predicting the likely actions witnesses will take when presented with a decision.  Because decisions are framed according to how they perceive a situation, when game theory is coupled with Gestalt psychology, attorneys can present problems to witnesses or opposing counsel in a way that increases the likelihood of them making decisions about their responses that improve the attorney's strategic position.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 62–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Litigation strategy|Lines of effort]] In the way a case diagram matches evidence to elements, the line of effort matches actions to specific effects the attorney intends to the various results that achieve her or his goal.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 47–65&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States v. Morgan''''', 346 U.S. 502 (1954), is a landmark decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] which provides the writ of [[coram nobis]] as the proper application to request federal post-conviction judicial review for those who have completed the conviction's incarceration.

==Background==
The ancient writ of [[coram nobis]] originated in the English judicial system during the sixteenth century. If a court discovered a factual mistake or error after the conclusion of a case, the writ could be issued by the court to correct the error.  The writ of coram nobis was identical to the [[Habeas corpus in the United States|writ of habeas corpus]]; except, the writ of habeas corpus was reserved exclusively for those who were held in prisons, and the writ of coram nobis was available to everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers|title=''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name''|last=Wolitz|first=David|date=July 2009|publisher=The BYU Law Review|access-date=April 30, 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] provided courts in the United States the authority to issue [[writ|writs]] to achieve justice as long as the writ does not conflict with constitutional rights or legislative statutes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judiciary Act of 1789]], 1 Stat. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;  (In 1911, the authorization of the federal judiciary to issue writs was modified into 28 U. S. C. § 1651(a) and is known as the [[All Writs Act|“all-writs section of the Judicial Code”]].) In 1946, the writ of coram nobis was considered obsolete when Congress added Rule 60(e) to the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] which specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_60|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 60|website=www.law.cornell.edu|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until this time, federal courts only used the writ of coram nobis to correct errors in federal civil cases because errors in federal criminal cases could be corrected with a writ of habeas corpus.  Thus, in its 1947 decision, ''United States v. Smith'', the Supreme Court observed “it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [the writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15350111847978931898|title=''United States v. Smith'', 331 US 469, 475 n.4 (1947)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions about whether the writ of coram nobis would be necessary or appropriate resurfaced just one year later with the Act of June 25, 1948 which codified existing federal habeas corpus statutes and provided only those individuals in-custody access to the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=62&amp;page=967# Act of June 25, 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the Act of June 25, 1948, the writ of habeas corpus was the sole application for United States federal courts to review convictions of those who had completed their incarceration.  Following the Act of June 25, 1948, federal courts were left to decide whether the act eliminated any review of convictions for those who had completed their incarceration or whether the writ of coram nobis (which had been limited to reviews of civil cases in US federal courts) could be expanded to include reviews of criminal cases for those who had completed their incarceration.

''Morgan'' resolved these questions by determining that those who had completed their incarceration could challenge their conviction through the writ of coram nobis.  Although the Supreme Court states in ''Carlisle v. United States'', “it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [the writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate [for prisoners and others serving out a term of a federal conviction],”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11483498398561074985|title=''Carlisle v. United States'', 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Morgan'' provides when the writ of coram nobis is necessary or appropriate for those who are no longer in-custody.

==Case==
In 1939, nineteen-year-old Robert Patrick Morgan pled guilty to stealing three letters from the US Post Office and was sentenced in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] to four years in federal prison; however, Morgan’s [[constitutional right|constitutional rights]] were violated because he was not provided an attorney nor did he waive his constitutional right to an attorney. Unfortunately for Morgan, he was unaware that his constitutional rights were violated until after he had completed his sentence. In 1950, Morgan was convicted of attempted burglary in a New York county court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers|title=''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name''|last=Wolitz|first=David|date=July 2009|publisher=The BYU Law Review|access-date=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his 1939 federal conviction, the county court applied New York’s Multiple Offenders Law and sentenced Morgan to seven to ten years at [[Attica Correctional Facility|Attica Prison]].

In 1952, Morgan first became aware of the constitutional violations related to his 1939 federal conviction. As a result, he petitioned the district court for the writ of coram nobis. If successful, his state sentence would be reduced because he would no longer be considered a multiple offender. The district court denied Morgan’s petition on the ground that the coram nobis petition was to be treated as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, which was unavailable to Morgan because he was no longer in federal custody. Morgan appealed the district court’s decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]]. The case was argued before the appellate court on January 13, 1953. On February 5, 1953, the three-judge panel unanimously determined that Morgan was entitled to the writ of coram nobis and reversed the district court’s decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11147499741758364560|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 202 F.2d 67, 69 (1953)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the appellate court’s decision, the attorney’s office for the United States petitioned and was granted a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Morgan'', 345 U. S. 974 (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
[[File:Warren Court 1953.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In a 5-4 decision, the United States Supreme Court held that federal courts have the authority to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.]]''United States v. Morgan'' was argued on October 19, 1953 and decided January 4, 1954. In a 5-4 decision, the Court agreed with the Second Circuit and held that federal courts have the authority under the all-writs section of the Judicial Code to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954) syllabus|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Forman Reed|Justice Stanley Reed]] wrote for the majority in ''Morgan'', which held:
* Federal District Courts, under the authority of the All-Writs Section, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), may issue the writ of coram nobis. ''id.'' at 506-510.
* A motion for a writ of coram nobis “is a step in the criminal case” and “is of the same general character as a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.” ''id.'' at 505, n.4.
* A writ of coram nobis should be allowed only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice. ''id.'' at 511.
* If no other remedy is available and sound reasons existing for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief, a motion of the writ of coram nobis must be heard by the federal court. ''id.'' at 512.
* Since adverse consequences resulting from the conviction persist after conclusion of a sentence, the petitioner is entitled to show that his conviction was invalid.  ''id.'' at 512-513.
* The writ of coram nobis may be issued to correct a constitutional violation. ''id.'' at 512-513.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/case.html|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954)|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''Morgan'' broadened the writ of coram nobis, which had historically been issued only to correct [[question of fact|errors of fact]], to allow courts to also correct [[question of law|errors of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18257773315166643768|title=''Hirabayashi v.

==Division of circuit courts==
[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|250px|right|Map of the United States Courts of Appeals]] Federal appellate courts are currently divided on the deadline to file an appeal of a district court’s decision of a case to petition for a writ of coram nobis. Most appellate courts provide 60 days to file an appeal; two other courts provide only 10 days to file an appeal. The source of this controversy is found in footnote 4 of the ''Morgan'' decision in which the Court held the writ of coram nobis “is a step in the criminal case” and also “of the same general character as one under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/case.html#F4|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954) footnote 4|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts held that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis is "of the same general character" as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] circuit courts held that a writ of coram nobis is governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals because it a "step in a criminal case." Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12590893338640158916|title=''United States v.

In [[law]] and [[ethics]], '''universal law''' or '''universal principle''' refers as concepts of legal [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] actions, whereby those [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] and rules for governing human beings' conduct which are most universal in their acceptability, their applicability, translation, and [[philosophical]] basis, are therefore considered to be most legitimate.  One type of Universal Law is the Law of Logic which prohibits logical contradictions known as sophistry.  The Law of Logic is based upon the universal idea that logic is defined as that which is not illogical and that which is illogical is that which involves a logical contradiction, such as attempting to assert that an apple and no apple can exist at and in the same time and in the same place, and attempting to assert that A and not A can exist at and in the same time and in the same place. What goes around , comes around.

'''''The Urbino European Law Seminar''''' is a summer course organized every year since 1959 by the Center for European Legal Studies of Urbino. The lectures are held in French, Italian and English at the Law Faculty of [[University of Urbino|Urbino University]], by visiting lecturers from many European countries and focus on current issues of [[European law]], [[private international law]], [[comparative law]] and Italian law. 

Following the seminar, participants are given a certificate as proof of their attendance. Depending on the specialty selected&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-paris1.fr/uploads/media/Certificate.and.diplomas.pdf Regulation of the Center for European Legal Studies of Urbino.]&lt;/ref&gt; and if successful in examination, participants are also awarded a diploma from the Law Faculty of [[University of Urbino|Urbino University]] in either comparative law, European studies, advanced studies in European Law, or advanced European studies.
