{{Politics}}
The term '''administration''', as used in the context of government, differs according to [[jurisdiction]].
==United States==&lt;!-- This section is linked from Government --&gt;

In [[Americans|American]] usage, the term generally refers to the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] under a specific [[President of the United States|president]] (or [[Governor#United States|governor]], [[Mayor#United States|mayor]], or other local executive);  or the term of a particular executive; for example: "President Y's administration" or "Secretary of Defense X during President Y's administration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/administration administration noun – definition in American English Dictionary – Cambridge Dictionary Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also mean an executive branch agency headed by an administrator, as the [[Small Business Administration]] or the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].

The term "administration" has been used to denote the executive branch in [[presidential system]]s of government.

==Europe==
The term's usage in [[Europe]] varies by country, but most typically the word "administration" refers to [[management | managerial functions]] in general, which may include local governments, or the hierarchy of national and local government, that applies to a town or district. More specifically, it may refer to [[public administration]], the business of administering [[Policy|public policy]] as determined by government. However, outside France and Romania, this usage of the word is uncommon.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

For the British sense{{which?|date=January 2018}} of the word, most countries (be they [[English language|English-speaking]] or not) use the term ''government'', referring to the "administration" of [[Winston Churchill]] as the "Churchill government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/government_1 government noun (GROUP) – definition in British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus – Cambridge Dictionary Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true of the non-European members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  An older, chiefly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] usage, is the term [[Ministry (collective executive)| "ministry"]], as in "Churchill Ministry", which is still in official and academic use in Britain, Australia and Canada to refer the terms of [[prime ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ministry Ministry – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the type of government, the word [[coalition]] may be used for a specific government. In the Netherlands, cabinet is the most-used term (as in "the [[fourth Balkenende cabinet]]"), although "coalition" or "government" are also used when one does not refer to a specific coalition (note that the two terms have slightly different meanings).

'''Advance SA''' is a [[political party]] in [[South Australia]]. It was founded in 2017 by [[John Darley (politician)|John Darley]]. Darley had been elected to the [[Legislative Council of South Australia]] as a member of the Nick Xenophon Group, named as [[Nick Xenophon Team]] from 2015. Darley quit that party early in 2017 and founded the Advance SA party later in 2017. It was registered as a party with the [[Electoral Commission of South Australia]] on 7 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecsa.sa.gov.au/parties-and-candidates/how-to-register-a-political-party/political-party-register |title=Register of political parties |publisher=[[Electoral Commission of South Australia]] |accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darley was elected to an eight-year term at the [[South Australian state election, 2014|2014 state election]], so was not due for reelection in the [[South Australian state election, 2018|2018 state election]].

'''Agrarian socialism''' is a political ideology which combines an [[agrarian society|agrarian]] way of life with a [[socialism|socialist]] economic system.

==Description==
When compared to standard [[socialist]] systems which are generally [[Urbanisation|urban]]/industrial  and more [[Progressivism|progressive]] in terms of social orientation, many agrarian socialist movements have tended to be [[Ruralism|rural]] (with an emphasis on decentralization and non-state forms of collective ownership), locally focused, and traditional/conservative.

The emphasis of agrarian socialists is therefore on control, ownership and utilisation of land rather than other [[means of production]].

A 17th-century movement called the [[diggers]] based their ideas on agrarian [[communism]].{{sfn|Campbell|2009|pp=127–129}}

== The Russian "populist" tradition and the Socialist Revolutionary Party ==
[[File:1917PartiyaSoz-Rev.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Socialist–Revolutionary election poster, 1917. The caption in red reads "партия соц-рев" (in Russian), short for Party of the Socialist Revolutionaries. The banner bears the party's motto "В борьбе обретешь ты право свое" ("In struggle you take your rights"), and the globe bears the slogan "земля и воля" ("land and freedom") expressing the agrarian socialist ideology of the party.]] The [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]] was a major political party in early 20th century Russia and a key player in the [[Russian Revolution]]. After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badcock|first=Sarah|date=2001|title='We're for the Muzhiks' Party!' Peasant Support for the Socialist Revolutionary Party during 1917|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|volume=53|issue=1|pages=133–149|jstor=826242}}&lt;/ref&gt;In November 1917, it [[Russian Constituent Assembly election, 1917|won a plurality of the national vote]] in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]), but soon split and the remaining faction of this party which remained loyal to [[Alexander Kerensky]] was defeated and destroyed by the [[Bolsheviks]] in the course of the [[Russian Civil War]] and subsequent persecution.

The party's ideology was built upon the philosophical foundation of Russia's [[narodnik]]–[[populism|Populist]] movement of the 1860s-70s and its worldview developed primarily by [[Alexander Herzen]] and [[Pyotr Lavrov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Macfarlane|first=Leslie J.|date=1998|pages=142–174|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-26987-7_9|isbn=9781349269891|title=Socialism, Social Ownership and Social Justice|chapter=From Russian Socialism to Soviet Communism}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of decline and marginalization in the 1880s, the Populist/narodnik school of thought about social change in Russia was revived and substantially modified by a group of writers and activists known as "neonarodniki" (neo-Populists), particularly [[Viktor Chernov]]. Their main innovation was a renewed dialogue with [[Marxism]] and the integration of some of the key Marxist concepts into their thinking and practice. In this way, with the economic spurt and industrialization in Russia in the 1890s, they attempted to broaden their appeal in order to attract the rapidly growing urban workforce to their traditionally peasant-oriented program. The intention was to widen the concept of the 'people' so that it encompassed all elements in the society that were opposed to the [[Tsar]]ist regime.

The party's program was both [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] and agrarian socialist in nature; it garnered much support among Russia's rural [[peasantry]], who in particular supported their program of ''land-socialization'' as opposed to the [[Bolshevik]] program of land-nationalization—division of land among peasant tenants rather than [[collectivization]] in state management. Their policy platform differed from that of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Russian Social Democratic Labour Parties]]—both [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]]—in that it was not officially [[Marxist]] (though some of its ideologues considered themselves such); the SRs believed that the 'laboring peasantry', as well as the industrial proletariat, would be the revolutionary class in Russia. Whereas Russian SDs defined class membership in terms of ownership of the means of production, Chernov and other SR theorists defined class membership in terms of extraction of surplus value from labor. On the first definition, small-holding subsistence farmers who do not employ wage labor are, as owners of their land, members of the petty bourgeoisie; on the second definition, they can be grouped with all who provide, rather than purchase, labor-power, and hence with the proletariat as part of the 'laboring class'. Chernov nevertheless considered the proletariat the 'vanguard', with the peasantry forming the 'main body' of the revolutionary army.&lt;ref&gt;Hildermeier, M., Die Sozialrevolutionäre Partei Russlands. Cologne 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anarcho-conservatism''' or '''conservative anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Anarcho-conservatism opposes the state and all government control, while supporting social conservative policies. Conservative anarchism opposes state coercion but does not necessarily object to a naturally occurring hierarchy in certain social situations, e.g. religious institutions. Finally, it advocates the abolition of the state and the wholesale replacement of state law by moral laws. Differently from [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]], anarcho-conservatives don't oppose all authority, but in consonance with them, they do oppose the authority of the modern nation state, which they deem artificial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/07/daniel-mccarthy/anarcho-conservatism/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism - LewRockwell LewRockwell.com|work=LewRockwell.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, conservative anarchists might oppose abortion, drug use and pornography, on moral grounds, while at the same time opposing their prohibition through government. This absolute rejection of the state legislation is what differentiates anarcho-conservatism from [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarianism conservatism]]. As conservatives typically do, conservative anarchists support traditional family structures and, much like all [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] orientations, support gun and property rights. These however take a backseat to traditional and religious morality, if a conflict between them arises. In particular, this differentiates anarcho-conservatism from anarcho-capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=conservative%20anarchist|title=Urban Dictionary: conservative anarchist|website=Urban Dictionary|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-conservatism has much in common with [[paleolibertarianism]], except the the support of right wing populists in political elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://libertarianuniverse.com/2015/08/20/anarcho-conservatism-explained-by-vincent-john/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism Explained|date=2015-08-20|work=LibertarianUniverse: A Right-Libertarian Blog|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian anarchism]] is an instance of anarcho-conservatism.

== History ==

=== Old Testament ===
[[Jacques Ellul]], a French philosopher and Christian anarchist, notes that the final verse of the [[Book of Judges]] (Judges 21:25) states that there was no king in Israel and that "everyone did as they saw fit".&lt;ref&gt;

[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%2021:25&amp;version=NIV BibleGateway.com - Passage Lookup: Judges 21:25]: "In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes."
&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, as recorded in the first [[Books of Samuel|Book of Samuel]] (1 Samuel 8) the [[Israelites|people of Israel]] wanted a king "so as to be like other nations".&lt;ref&gt;

God declared that the people had rejected him as their king. He warned that a human king would lead to [[militarism]], [[conscription]] and [[Tax#History|taxation]], and that their pleas for mercy from the king's demands would go unanswered. [[Samuel]] passed on God's warning to the Israelites but they still demanded a king, and [[Saul]] became their ruler.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Modern age ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Young England movement of the 1830s and ‘40s argued that the more feudal models of traditional aristocracy and land ownership within the framework of communities which are self-policing (i.e. each community is autonomous rather than imposed by the state) was the best path to liberty, rather than mainstream liberal models. In short, Tory anarchists might have defended traditional and hereditary institutions like monarchy and aristocracy, but they had anarchist sympathies in the sense that they did not believe in a centralised, unitary government, and sometimes saw a reactionary counterrevolution as the only path to political success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theburkean.co.uk/anarcho-conservatism-even-thing/|title=Anarcho-conservatism – Is that even a thing?|date=2017-10-01|work=The Burkean|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a Tory anarchist was first coined by Orwell to describe both Jonathan Swift and himself, and at its broadest it describes someone who is both a radical and a traditionalist. To be a Tory anarchist, then, is to embrace all manner of contradictions. It is a defence of good manners, good grammar, local customs and practices, respect for the individual and for privacy and an overwhelming hostility to the expanding power of the modern state. … Orwell saw Tory anarchism as a part of Britain's, mainly England's, rich social history, manifesting itself in particular figures at different times and places. These figures include not only Swift but Parson Bull, William Cobbett, Bishop Phillpotts and Richard Oastler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The strange case of Tory anarchism|last=1963-|first=Wilkin, Peter|date=2010|publisher=Libri Pub|isbn=9781907471100|location=Faringdon, Oxfordshire|oclc=662410383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There’s not a Tory anarchist tradition exactly, but the label has been applied, with good reason, to writers like Albert Jay Nock, Evelyn and Auberon Waugh, Mencken, Florence King, Dwight Macdonald, even Orwell and Max Beerbohm.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ordinary-times.com/2011/01/03/tory-anarchism-in-america-an-interview-with-daniel-mccarthy/|title=Tory Anarchism in America: An Interview with Daniel McCarthy - Ordinary Times|last=Kain|first=Erik|date=2011-01-03|work=Ordinary Times|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoppe generally describes himself as libertarian or anarcho-capitalist, but I cannot see that he would reject the ultra-conservative label, or I certainly do not see how can do so consistently, since he prefers monarchy to democracy. That is he prefers rule by one hereditary individual to rule by a representative assembly, or by direct democracy, and clearly regards the global move from monarchy to democracy as regrettable. His explanation is that a hereditary ruler has a great interest in maintaining the state since it belongs to that ruler and the descendants of that ruler in perpetuity. The hereditary ruler’s interest in maintaining the state is certainly greater than that of elected politicians, as these politicians are temporary and have a greater interest in extracting resources from the state than in maintaining it’s long term existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stephankinsella.com/2009/09/hoppe-habermas%E2%80%99s-anarcho-conservative-student/|title=Hoppe: Habermas’s Anarcho-Conservative Student|work=StephanKinsella.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
== Anarcho-conservative Quotes from Notable Authors ==

=== Albert Jay Nock (1870 – 1945) ===
[[Albert Jay Nock]] was the editor of ''[[The Freeman]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone knows that the State claims and exercises the monopoly of crime that I spoke of a moment ago, and that it makes this monopoly as strict as it can. It forbids private murder, but itself organizes murder on a colossal scale. It punishes private theft, but itself lays unscrupulous hands on anything it wants, whether the property of citizen or alien. There is, for example, no human right, natural or Constitutional, that we have not seen nullified by the United States Government. Of all the crimes that are committed for gain or revenge, there is not one that we have not seen it commit — murder, mayhem, arson, robbery, fraud, criminal collusion and connivance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Sosy1SDXYNUC|title=On Doing the Right Thing|last=Nock|first=Albert Jay|date=1956|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=9781610163781|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== J.R.R. Tolkien (1892 – 1973) ===
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] was [[Merton Professors|Professor of English Language and Literature]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], and the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning the abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs) — or to ‘unconstitutional’ Monarchy. I would arrest anybody who uses the word State (in any sense other than the inanimate real of England and its inhabitants, a thing that has neither power, rights nor mind); and after a chance of recantation, execute them if they remained obstinate! … Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so to refer to people … The most improper job of any many, even saints (who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on), is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity … There is only one bright spot and that is the growing habit of disgruntled men of dynamating factories and power-stations; I hope that, encouraged now as ‘patriotism’, may remain a habit! But it won’t do any good, if it is not universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9eLCAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Letters+of+J.R.R.+Tolkien|title=The Letters of J.R.R.

=== Paul Weyrich (1942 – 2008) ===
[[Paul Weyrich]] was the co-founder of [[The Heritage Foundation]], [[The Free Congress Foundation]], and the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]].&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that we probably have lost the culture war. That doesn’t mean the war is not going to continue, and that it isn’t going to be fought on other fronts. But in terms of society in general, we have lost. This is why, even when we win in politics, our victories fail to translate into the kind of policies we believe are important. Therefore, what seems to me a legitimate strategy for us to follow is to look at ways to separate ourselves from the institutions that have been captured by the ideology of Political Correctness, or by other enemies of our traditional culture. I would point out to you that the word "holy" means "set apart", and that it is not against our tradition to be, in fact, "set apart". You can look in the Old Testament, you can look at Christian history. You will see that there were times when those who had our beliefs were definitely in the minority and it was a band of hardy monks who preserved the culture while the surrounding society disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815232714/http://www.freecongress.org:80/fcf/specials/weyrichopenltr.htm|title=Free Congress Foundation Online ---|date=2000-08-15|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hans-Hermann Hoppe (b. 1949) ===
[[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] is Professor Emeritus of Economics at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], Senior Fellow of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], and founder and president of the [[Property and Freedom Society]].&lt;blockquote&gt;Many libertarians hold the view that all that is needed to maintain a libertarian social order is the strict enforcement of the non-aggression principle (NAP). Otherwise, as long as one abstains from aggression, according to their view, the principle of “live and let live” should hold. Yet surely, while this “live and let live” sounds appealing to adolescents in rebellion against parental authority and all social convention and control (and many youngsters have been initially attracted to libertarianism believing that this “live and let live” is the essence of libertarianism), and while the principle does indeed hold and apply for people living far apart and dealing with each other only indirectly and from afar, it does ''not'' hold and apply, or rather it is ''insufficient'', when it comes to people living in close proximity to each other, as neighbors and cohabitants of the same community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A simple example suffices to make the point. Assume a new next-door neighbor. This neighbor does not aggress against you or your property in any way, but he is a “bad” neighbor. He is littering on his own neighboring property, turning it into a garbage heap; in the open, for you to see, he engages in ritual animal slaughter, he turns his house into a “Freudenhaus,” a bordello, with clients coming and going all day and all night long; he never offers a helping hand and never keeps any promise that he has made; or he cannot or else he refuses to speak to you in your own language. Etc., etc.. Your life is turned into a nightmare. Yet you may not use violence against him, because he has not aggressed against you. What can you do? You can shun and ostracize him. But your neighbor does not care, and in any case you alone thus ‘punishing’ him makes little if any difference to him. You have to have the communal respect and authority, or you must turn to someone who does, to persuade and convince everyone or at least most of the members of your community to do likewise and make the bad neighbor a social outcast, so as to exert enough pressure on him to sell his property and leave. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The lesson? The peaceful cohabitation of neighbors and of people in regular direct contact with each other on some territory – a tranquil, convivial social order – requires also a commonality of culture: of language, religion, custom and convention. There can be peaceful co-existence of different cultures on distant, physically separated territories, but multi-culturalism, cultural heterogeneity, cannot exist in one and the same place and territory without leading to diminishing social trust, increased tension, and ultimately the call for a “strong man” and the destruction of anything resembling a libertarian social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://misesuk.org/2017/10/20/libertarianism-and-the-alt-right-hoppe-speech-2017/|title=Libertarianism and the Alt-Right (Hoppe Speech, 2017)|date=2017-10-19|work=The Ludwig von Mises Centre|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Daniel McCarthy ===
Daniel McCarthy is the editor of ''[[Modern Age (periodical)|Modern Age]],'' director of the Robert Novak Journalism Fellowship Program at [[The Fund for American Studies]], and former editor of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' (2010 – 2016).&lt;blockquote&gt;Conservatism and anarchism share some historical background, as reactions against liberalism, and they share some critiques of liberalism.&amp;nbsp; It’s not that liberalism — broadly construed to include the “classical” variety in practice as well as the modern version — is the worst socio-political system imaginable.&amp;nbsp; The various totalitarianisms of the 20th century were far worse, and anarchists and conservatives alike have to be careful that in making a deep critique of liberalism they’re not opening the door to something far deadlier. But liberalism is not the end of history, and it’s not the final picture of justice.&amp;nbsp;Under the guise of democracy and markets, and human rights, various kinds of powers and interests are able to run quite unchecked.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Alexander Salter ===
Alexander Salter is Assistant Professor of Economics in the [[Rawls College of Business]], and the Comparative Economics Research Fellow at [[Texas Tech University]]'s Free Market Institute.&lt;blockquote&gt;Embracing anarchy does not require conservatives to embrace violent revolution, or even civil disobedience. But for their own sake, as well as the sake of the civilization which they love, conservatives can and should deny the state’s legitimacy, on the grounds that it is destructive of the true, the good, and the beautiful. Affirming sovereignty in the hopes it may someday fall within conservative hands is a siren song that must be resisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2017/10/conservatism-seek-destroy-state-alexander-salter.html|title=Should Conservatism Seek to Destroy the State? ~ The Imaginative Conservative|date=2017-10-17|work=The Imaginative Conservative|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Arusha Agreement''' was a treaty signed on 24 September 1969 in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]], between the [[European Community]] and the three [[East Africa]]n states of [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and Tanzania. The agreement entered into force on 1 January 1971, concomitant with the second [[Yaoundé Convention]], with the aim of establishing better economic relations between the [[European Community|EC]] and the African states. At the end of their validity time, the [[Lomé Convention]] was signed which substituted the previous agreements and enlarged them to 46 [[ACP countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-ir.info/2011/03/11/from-association-policy-to-cotonou-eu-acp-trade-relations-environmental-protection-and-sustainable-development/ EU-ACP Trade Relations, Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development] Retrieved 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1967, three East African countries (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda) that were not members of the Associated African and Malagasy States (AAMS), but were instead member states of the Commonwealth of Nations combined to establish the East African Community (EAC). On 26 July 1968 the EEC signed an initial Association Agreement with the EAC. That Agreement did not enter into force because it was not ratified by all the countries involved. On 24 September 1969 in Arusha, a second Agreement was signed between the EEC and the EAC. That Agreement was signed at the same time as the Convention of Association between the EEC and the AAMS (Yaoundé II); both the Arusha Agreement and the Yaoundé II Convention entered into force on 1 January 1971 for a period of five years.

== Content ==

The Arusha Agreement established a [[trade association]] (partial free-trade areas and joint institutions) but, unlike the Yaoundé II Convention, without financial and technical cooperation. Accordingly, the Agreement covered trade (Title I), the right of establishment and the provision of services (Title II), payments and capital (Title III), institutional provisions (Title IV), and general and final provisions (Title V).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/cardoc/CAHIER_SPECIAL_2011-WEBEN.pdf] Pg. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:tocqueville.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Alexis de Tocqueville, considered by many to be the father of Associationalism.]]  --&gt;
'''Associationalism''' or '''associative democracy''' is a political movement in which "human welfare and liberty are both best served when as many of the affairs of a society as possible are managed by voluntary and democratically self-governing associations."&lt;ref name="Hirst112"&gt;Smith, M. K.; ''[http://www.infed.org/association/b-assoc.htm Association, la vie associative and lifelong learning]'' cites Hirst, P. [[#References|References]] page 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Associationalism "gives priority to freedom in its scale of values, but it contends that such freedom can only be pursued effectively if individuals join with their fellows"&lt;ref name="Hirst112"/&gt;

==The concept of associationalism==

===Roots===
Associationalism is a European political theory, stemming from 19th  and early 20th century social and political theorists from the continent.  In France, such political thinkers as de Tocqueville, Proudhon, Durkheim, and Duguit. In England, such pluralists as Cole, Figgis, Laski, Barker, and Maitland.   The theory provides an alternative to the previously popular doctrines of state-centered and collectivist ideals which had all but dominated  twentieth-century politics:  Western social democracy and Eastern bloc Marxist–Leninism.&lt;ref&gt;Kaspersen p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexis de Tocqueville's associationalism===
[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s idea of associationalism “...stressed volunteerism, community spirit and independent associational life as protections against the domination of society by the state, and indeed as a counterbalance which helped to keep the state accountable and effective”.&lt;ref name="Lewis p. 3"&gt;Lewis p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  In Tocqueville’s vision then, economic freedom fosters greed, which engenders political apathy, which results in excessive individualism and passive reliance on the state.  This political apathy will in turn result in the almost inevitable growth of government if left unchecked by associationalism. Thus, Tocqueville predicted that “It is easy to see the time coming in which men will be less and less able to produce, by each alone, the commonest bare necessities of life. The tasks of government must therefore perpetually increase, and its efforts to cope with them must spread its net ever wider. The more government takes the place of associations, the more will individuals lose the idea of forming associations and need the government to come to their help. That is a vicious cycle of cause and effect”.&lt;ref&gt;de Tocqueville p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanded definition===
Associational democracy is, in essence, both a political structure and system of relations with the goal of easing pluralist social negotiation and priorities.&lt;ref&gt;Kaspersen p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  It became an important aspect of public policy, countering previous laissez-faire traditions.  Critics considered laissez-faire, which essentially equated to liberal individualism, as not conducive to the fostering of upward mobility in society.  Associationalism, as opposed to liberal individualism, embodies a deliberate commitment to social cooperation as well as public well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Martell p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
	
"Association....grew out of a sense of difference; for the middle class, it meant crossing class lines to bring together people of diverse identities and conditions".&lt;ref&gt;McGerr p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  According to David Lewis, during the late 19th and early 20th century the new middle class required “...sanctioned private accumulation underwritten by a state which maintained legal order and stability"·&lt;ref name="Lewis p. 3"/&gt;  As a result, the state needed to become powerful enough to maintain order, but not so strong as to become oppressive; neither laissez-faire nor statist.  Finding this balance between transgressing autonomy and dangerous accumulation of power could prove difficult, and associationalism appeared to be a possible solution.&lt;ref&gt;Kaspersen p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Associationalism brought together several political ideologies which, until its conception, were frequently at odds: pluralism, socialism, and cooperative mutualism.  It provides for a pluralist rather than a statist or constraining collectivist socialism, yet it also provides for a mutualist and cooperative pluralism.  This, as opposed to pluralism which reacts so far to statist [[communitarianism]] that it slides into an unrestricted competitive asociality.&lt;ref&gt;Martell P. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Beginnings of American associationalism==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:roosevelt.jpg|275px|thumb|left|A poster for the election of 1900. ]]  --&gt;

===Setting the stage===
Urban politics in late 19th century America proved an ideal situation for the emergence of associationalism, ripe with several qualifications discussed by early associationalists.  In addition, voter turnout was relatively high, though usually confined to party lines.  Despite this fact, the two large national parties at the time (Democrats and Republicans) lacked significant ideological differences on specific issues.  Respected members of communities across the country began to propose associationalism as a solution to America's social political problems. Several Protestant ministers such as Lyman Abbot, Washington Gladden, Josiah Strong, and Walter Raushenbusch began to call for a “social gospel.”  “The next great principle,” Rauschenbusch proclaimed in 1896, “is association”.&lt;ref&gt;McGerr p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  These growing political currents in favor of associationalism perhaps culminated when voters elected William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, a left statist associationalist who would become president shortly thereafter, in 1900.

===Protective legislation===
“Associationalism is fundamentally about collective governance – about the legal constitution of groups and bodies politic and the rules and bylaws that regulate the interrelationships of members”.&lt;ref&gt;Novak p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  During the early 20th century Congress passed a great deal of “protective legislation,” which was, in essence, legislated associationalism.  Labor received improved work conditions resulting in fewer work-related injuries. Wages were increased while hours were decreased.  In addition, probably the most important protective legislation pertained to the legal establishment and organization of large labor unions.

On the other side of the coin, employer costs went up resulting in outsourcing and decreased cash flow into such areas as research and development, slowing technological progress.  Fewer hours and the fact that labor was more organized (allowing for an increase in strikes and protests) resulted in less production.  Finally, such strong government influence over labor could lead to an abuse of power, favoring certain unions.  The results of these legislated regulations suggested to critics that associationalism tends to benefit labor (the "people”) directly at the cost of both corporate management and technological progress.

==Early presidential associationalism==

===Theodore Roosevelt===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:photo59.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Members of the United Mine Workers Union striking in 1902.]] --&gt;
	[[Theodore Roosevelt]] (President 1901-1908) was the first true champion of American associationalism as evidenced by his intervention into the United Mine Workers strike of 1902.  For the first time representatives from government, labor, and management met collectively and were able to resolve the conflict.  When management was uncooperative, Roosevelt threatened to employ the military on behalf of labor to arrive at a resolution.

Instead, a five-member commission was established to communicate with the company management.  Also, wages were increased by ten percent and the length of the work day was cut from ten hours to nine, keeping union membership sound.  By demonstrating a new role for the state in such conflicts (aside from the previously held military positions) associationalism took root in American society and politics, and there wasn't another major coal strike in the country until the 1920s.

===Woodrow Wilson===
[[Woodrow Wilson]] (President 1913-1920), a regulatory liberal, employed associationalism during World War I to control and regulate capital, ensuring a steady flow of war supplies while minimizing the risk of breaks in manufacturing vital to the war effort.  The establishment of such government agencies as the [[National War Labor Board (1918–1919)|National War Labor Board]] were instrumental in preventing strikes and ensuring collective bargaining.  In addition, Wilson appointed the country's first Secretary of Labor that was pro labor ([[William B. Wilson]]).  The policies were implemented as America successfully met its goals in wartime production.  There were nearly no strikes, many companies saw enormous profits, and the Allies won the war.

The '''Assyrian Socialist Party''', the first [[Assyria]]n [[political party]], was founded in 1917 after the [[February Revolution|Russian revolution]], by Dr. [[Freydun Atturaya]], Rabbi Benjamin Bet Arsanis and Dr. Baba Bet Parhad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edessa.com/profiles/freydun.htm Esha Emmanuel Tamras , ''Dr. Freydun (Atturaya) Bit Abram'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betnahrain.net/Biographies/fraidoon.htm Dr. Fraidoon Atturaya Melta("The Word") 1995 Volume 1, No 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, an Assyrian Socialist Party (''Gaba Shawtapaya Atouraya'') was reestablished "by a group of Assyrian workers in northern [[Iraq]]", so is it stated on its website where its goals are defined as such: "The ASP(GSA) is a [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[democracy|democratic party]], which aims to resuscitate an Assyrian Nation for Assyrian people in an Independent and Popular Republic''".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030802204234/http://asp2.no.sapo.pt/index2.htm Website of the Assyrian Socialist Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Christian Liberation Movement''' ({{lang-es|Movimiento Cristiano Liberación}} or simply '''MCL''') is a [[Cuban dissident movement|Cuban dissident]] [[political party|party]] advocating political change in [[Cuba]]. MCL was founded in 1988 by a group of secular [[Catholics]] belonging to the Parish of [[Cerro, Havana|Cerro]], in [[Havana]]. From the movement's founding and until his death, it was led by [[Oswaldo Payá]].  At present (2018), it is led by [[Eduardo Cardet]]

MCL has urged the governments, parliaments, citizens of the [[European Union]] to support "in a public and sustained manner the release of those jailed in Cuba for defending, promoting and exercising peacefully their human rights; the dialogue between Cubans as a path toward achieving the changes the Cuban people desire and national reconciliation; and our demands for changes in the laws so that the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of all Cubans are respected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubademocraciayvida.org/web/article.asp?artID=6890|title=The Christian Liberation Movement: The members of the Coordinating Council of the Christian Liberation Movement, Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas and Minervo Chil Siret, met with representatives of the European Union Presidency in the French Embassy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian Liberation Movement is a member of the [[Centrist Democrat International]], the international organization promoting [[Christian democracy]].

[[File:Cleavage english.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cleavages in society according to Lipset/Rokkan]]
In [[political science]], '''cleavage''' is the division of voters into [[voting bloc]]s.  

The preliminary assumption is that voters do not come in predefined groups of pros and cons for or against a certain subject.  Ballot analysis assumes that voters opt for a certain party or decide for the solution or option that comes closest to their own position.  Cleavage separates the voters into advocates and adversaries on a certain issue, or voting for a certain party.  If you imagine parties on a horizontal line for a certain issue, cleavage is the vertical line that divides the parties into supporters and opponents of the issue.

==Examples==
There are numerous cleavages in society, but [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] and [[Stein Rokkan]] (1967) defined four basic cleavages for western civilization after the [[Industrial Revolution]]. According to Lipset and Rokkan, these cleavages determined the emergence and the content of all European political parties. 
* {{em|Centre versus periphery:}} between elites in the urban areas and those in more outlying areas.  This usually expresses itself in terms of [[Regionalism (politics)|regional nationalism]].  For example, in [[Spain]] many regions have regionalist or [[Separatism|separatist]] parties.  This division is, according to Lipset and Rokkan, caused by the creation of modern [[nation-state]]s, where some states were better than others at assimilating other cultures into the majority nation.
* {{em|State versus church:}} between religious and secular voters. In the Netherlands until the 1970s there were five major parties: the [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP), the Protestant [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP) and [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU), the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA), and the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD), the last two being secular.
* {{em|Owner versus worker:}} a class cleavage, causing the formation of parties of the left and parties of the right. Sometimes it is argued that this cleavage represents a conflict between the rich and poor.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, M., Laver, M., Mair, P. (2006), ''Representative Government in Modern Europe''. New York: McGraw-Hill, pp. 268-269.&lt;/ref&gt; Various parties have claimed to represent either interest, though this may or may not be genuine.
* {{em|Land versus industry:}} continued state exercise of control over tariffs, against freedom of control for industrial enterprise.

Contemporary ballot analysis speaks of the emergence of new cleavages. The traditional opposition between owner and worker (capital and labour) is being differentiated further among those who have work/are employable and those who are not. Further, sex becomes another cleavage, especially in regard to getting and maintaining a paid labour position.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

In some 21st century Western European countries like Austria, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland), a new cultural divide is suggested to have arisen, challenging the old primary political cleavage over economic conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oesch |first=Daniel |editor-last=Rydgren |editor-first=Jens |title=Class Politics and the Radical Right |publisher=Routledge |date=2012 |pages=31-52 |chapter=The Class Basis of the Cleavage between the New Left and the Radical Right: an analysis for Austria, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transformation has occurred since the late 1960s, with the [[New Left]] that arose in this period espousing [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and universalistic values, and a populist right reaction arising from the 1980s espousing traditionalist and [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornschier |first=Simon |last2=Kriesi |first2=Hanspeter |editor-last=Rydgren |editor-first=Jens |title=Class Politics and the Radical Right |publisher=Routledge |date=2012 |pages=10-29 |chapter=The populist right, the working class, and the changing face of class politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43174">[[File:Eirene Ploutos Glyptothek Munich 219 n1.jpg|thumb|The Greek goddess [[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]], personification of peace, holds [[Plutos]], the god of wealth, in her arms (Roman copy of a statue by [[Cephisodotus the Elder|Cephisodotus]]; [[Athens]] c. 370 BC]]
The idea of the '''Common Peace''' (Κοινὴ Εἰρήνη, ''Koinē Eirēnē'') was one of the most influential concepts of 4th century BC Greek political thought, along with the idea of [[Panhellenism]]. The term described both the concept of a desirable, permanent peace between the Greek city-states ([[polis|poleis]]) and a sort of [[peace treaty]] which fulfilled the three fundamental criteria of this concept: it had to include all the Greek city-states, it had to recognise the [[autonomy]] and equality of all city states without regard for their military power, and it had to be intended to remain in force permanently.

The advocates of the Common Peace saw it as a way to end the endemic warfare which engulfed the Greek ''poleis'' from the outbreak of the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431 BC. From the [[Peace of Antalcidas|King's Peace]] of 387/6 BC down to the foundation of the [[League of Corinth]] in 338 BC, the idea of the Common Peace influenced all peace treaties between Greek ''poleis''. In the end, however, it turned out that only a strong [[hegemony|hegemonic power]] could maintain a comprehensive peace for long. In modern times, the concept has been revived and in the 20th century, the principle of the Common Peace was a foundation stone of international organisations like the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]].

== The idea of the Common Peace ==
The idea of the Common Peace developed out of older ideas which had gradually taken form in the political interactions of the 5th century BC in Greece. Its temporary enforcement however owes less to the realisation of the need for a permanent peace, than to the fact that it seemed to serve the interests of several successive hegemonic powers. The history of the Common Peace is therefore not only part of the [[history of ideas]], but also of the diplomatic history of Greece in the decades between the Peloponnesian War and the arrival of king [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Alexander the Great]].

=== Development of the term===
[[File:Helmed Hoplite Sparta.JPG|thumb|Spartan [[hoplite]]]]
The [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''Eirene'', which originally only signified a 'state of peace', developed the related meaning of 'peace agreement' at the beginning of the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Diekhoff, ''Friedensreden'', p. 379–391&lt;/ref&gt; This was a consequence of a change in attitudes to war and peace more generally. Already in the 5th century BC, wars between Greek ''poleis'' were ended with treaties, which were known as ''spondai'' (σπονδαί), ''synthekai'' (συνθήκαι) or ''dialyseis polemou'' (διάλυσεις πολέμου). All these terms ultimately only indicated a truce or temporary break from war.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, ''Koine Eirene'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; But as a result of the unending warfare from the middle of that century, the idea gradually developed that a state of peace rather than war should be the normal state of international affairs. This is reflected in the increased prominence of the term ''Eirene'' and in its use as a term for peace treaties.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Diodorus]], XV.5.1 and XV.38.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'Common Peace' was first used in 391 BC, in reference to the failed negotiations between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] to end the [[Corinthian War]]. The Athenian politician [[Andocides]] advised his fellow citizens in a speech for the acceptance of a settlement which he called ''koine eirene''.&lt;ref&gt;Andokides, ''Orations'' III.17&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly the term had already come into general parlance before this, but this speech is the first attestation. The first treaty in which the terms ''eirene'' and ''koine eirene'' were actually used was the 'King's Peace' imposed by the Spartans and [[Achaemenids|Persians]] in 387/6 BC. The phrase ''koine eirene'' only appears in an official document for the first time in the peace treaty made after the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]] in 362 BC.

Generally, the term ''koine eirene'' is only sparsely attested in contemporary sources. Authors like [[Isocrates]], [[Demosthenes]] and [[Xenophon]] do not use it at all. But they do refer to its essential characteristics for each of the peace treaties which the 1st century BC historian [[Diodorus]] consistently refers to as a ''koine eirene''. The fact that Diodorus based his account of the period from 386 to 361 on the contemporary author [[Ephorus]] makes it very likely that the term was in general use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, ''Koine Eirene'', S. 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in mid-4th century BC inscription from [[Argos]], known as the [[Reply to the Satraps]], whose exact date and circumstances are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;''IG'' IV 556&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Characteristics ===
In the speech of Andocides and the provisions of the King's Peace&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'' V.1.31&lt;/ref&gt; two characteristics are revealed which were new for peace treaties at this time. One of these was that all Greek ''poleis'' (with a few exceptions) were to be autonomous. The other was that each of these draft treaties were sent to all ''poleis''. Peace is therefore no longer presented as a bilateral agreement between two formerly hostile ''poleis'' or leagues, but as a multilateral treaty, which would also encompass all the parties that were not involved in the conflict, as far as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Jehne, ''Koine Eirene'', pp. 39 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third characteristic is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the absence of set time limit. In the 5th century, it was the norm for peace treaties to have a specified period of validity. The [[Thirty Years' Peace]] of 446/5 BC between Athens and Sparta was named for the period of time it was expected to last. The [[Peace of Nicias]] of 421 BC was meant to last for fifty years, while treaties with a set period of one hundred years were practically intended to last forever. This derives from the idea that peace was not being made between the states as such, but rather between their populations, and thus the longest possible period of time that a treaty could last was the lifetime of a single generation - which could only make agreements for itself, not its descendants. By contrast, a ''koine eirene'' was in principle designed to endure forever.&lt;ref&gt;Jehne, ''Koine Eirene'', p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was not actually explicitly stated in the treaties, it is clear from the internal logic of the autonomy clauses, since an independence with chronological limits would not be independence.

==== Multilaterality ====
The bilateral peace treaties of the 5th century BC between Athens and Sparta largely ignored the interests of other parties - including their own allies, who were not even consulted. Even the treaty of 404 BC, which ended the Peloponnesian War and was in practice a diktat from the Spartan side, was formally a treaty between Sparta and Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Baltrusch: ''Symmachie'', pp. 23 f.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not contain any terms regarding the allies of Athens in the [[Delian League]] and was actually concluded despite the opposition of the Spartans' allies. The treaty therefore entirely reflects the conditions and ideas of the 5th century, in which there were only two major hegemonic powers in Greece, to which all other ''poleis'' were subordinated.
[[File:Pericles Pio-Clementino Inv269 n3.jpg|thumb|Bust of Pericles]]
The idea of a multilateral panhellenic agreement was not actually new, however. After the defeat of [[Persian Wars|Xerxes' invasion]], a general peace had been concluded in 481, although it was temporary. In 450 BC, [[Pericles]] is reported to have desired to convene a general peace conference in Athens. It is reported that the refusal of the Spartans to participate on account of their fear of Athenian hegemony meant that it never actually took place. Apart from some multilateral treaties between individual ''poleis'' in [[Sicily]] and [[Ionia]], the religious association of the [[Amphictyonic League]] was the only multilateral agreement of ancient Greece which was enduring and significant. The Amphictyonic oath forswore the destruction of member states in war or the removal of their water. ''Poleis'' that broke this oath would themselves be threatened with destruction. This might be a forerunner of the ''koine eirene''.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, ''Koine eirene'', pp. 3–6 &amp; Ehrenberg, ''Staat'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

That it became ever more common to make peace treaties on the basis of a ''koine eirene'' after 387 BC had a practical aspect. The successive hegemonial powers were not individual ''poleis'', but several opposing ''poleis'' or leagues of roughly equal strength. With them, peace was only possible if all agreed together. For the general acceptance of such a multilateral agreement, the autonomy clause was the first requirement.

==== Autonomy clause ====
The Greek term ''autonomia'' signified the right and ability of the citizens of a ''polis'' to use their own legal system or ''nomos'' (νόμος) and to be free from all submission to other ''poleis''.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, ''Staat'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''polis'' had become the characteristic form of the state in Greece, there was an unwritten law in their relationships with one another that each of them - even the most insignificant ones - should be autonomous. The only exceptions to this were the small cities of [[Attica]] and [[Laconia]], which hadlong been completely integrated into the Athenian and Spartan ''poleis''. It was a source of substantial tension in the 4th century, when the [[Thebans]] attempted to incorporate the cities of [[Boeotia]] into a single ''polis'' in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, ''Koine eirene'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Persian Wars, however, the willingness to form leagues, called ''koina'' or ''symmachiai'' under the leadership of a hegemonic power or ''hegemon'' increased. These were entered into voluntarily, so that the principle of autonomy was theoretically not infringed. But as the Persian threat declined in significance, it seemed that the Athenians wished to convert the Delian League which they controlled into a naval empire which they ruled. Thus the Athenians violated the foundations of ''autonomia'': the freedom of ''poleis'' to live under their own political systems, to be free of [[garrison]]s, [[cleruchy|cleruchies]], external legal jurisdiction, and tribute. The introduction of ''phoros'' (φόρος, i.e. contributions for military purposes), the relocation of league's treasury from [[Delos]] to Athens and the forced introduction of [[Athenian democracy|democratic]] constitutions based on the Athenian model in some members of the league all seemed to violate the principle of ''autonomia''.

The Spartans, whose [[Peloponnesian League]] was comparatively loosely organised, began to use the demand for ''autonomia'' as a diplomatic means to weaken the Athenian league from the middle of the 5th century BC. The took up the complaints of the Athenians' allies as their own: during and after the Peloponnesian War, the Spartans presented themselves as the protectors of the freedom of all Greek states. Thus the autonomy clause was not only a key component of every Common Peace because smaller ''poleis'' saw it as a way to ensure their independence,&lt;ref&gt;Pistorius, ''Hegemoniestreben'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; but also and more importantly because larger powers could use it to advance their own interests.

==Development of the Common Peace==
Whether a peace agreement was a Common Peace or not is uncertain for some treaties. In the following, a wide definition is used in order to make the development of the idea of the Common Peace clear. Criteria for inclusion are the autonomy clause and the permission for all Greek poleis to join, regardless of whether that option was actually taken up.

=== Failed peace of 391 BC===
In 392/1 BC, in the course of the [[Corinthian War]], Sparta submitted an initial peace offer to the [[Achaemenid|Persian]] [[satrap]] of [[Lydia]], [[Tiribazus]]. The Spartans were under pressure to extract themselves from their hopeless war in [[Asia Minor]] and simultaneously reassert their military supremacy in mainland Greece. For this it was necessary, firstly, to concede Persian control of the Greek cities of [[Ionia]], and, secondly, to end the Persians' alliances with the Greek opponents of Sparta, especially Athens. Simultaneously, the [[Great King]] needed to be convinced that no new Greek power would form in the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]] which might challenge Persian control of the Ionian cities.

The agreement that would solve all these problems was that Sparta and Persia would guarantee the autonomy of all Greek states (exceptthose in Asia Minor). The Spartans would then have been able to point to the protection of a generally recognised principle as the outcome of the war. At the same time, this would allow the Spartans to split the Greek world into a number of weak individual states, ensuring the Spartan hegemony and satisfying the Persian desire for security. The Greek city-states naturally rejected the treaty out of hand. The Persian king [[Artaxerxes II]] was also inclined to reject it. He recalled Tiribazus and replaced him with a new satrap, [[Struthas]], who strengthened the Persian alliance with Athens.

A few months later, the Spartans attempted to come to terms with their Greek enemies in a conference in their own city. Once more, they made the autonomy principle the basis of any agreement, this time with concessions to Athens and Thebes. The Athenians would have retained the islands of [[Lemnos]], [[Imbros]], and [[Skyros]], while the Thebans' possession of [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]] would have been recognised.

It was during these negotiations that the formula of a 'Common Peace' for all Greeks was first used. The Athenian orator Andocides used it in a speech, in which he vainly urged his countrymen to accept the Spartan offer:
{{quote|Consider this too, Athenians: right now you are negotiating peace and freedom common to all the Greeks and causing everyone to share control over everything.|Andokides, ''On the Peace'' 17}}
Andokides makes a distinction between treaties and a real peace. He invoked the panhellenic ideal, while idealising the project of the common peace. As he did this, however, he omitted the fact that the Ionian cities for whose freedom Athens had gone to war with Persia some hundred years earlier, would be abandoned as a result of this treaty. In the end the Athenians rejected the treaty because of this (and because after their alliance with [[Struthas]], they believed they were in a stronger position).

===Peace of Antalcidas===
[[File:Xenophon.jpg|thumb|150px|Xenophon]]
{{main|Peace of Antalcidas}}
The successes of the Athenian fleet in 390 BC, however, led to a reevaluation at the Persian court, which did not want the Athenians to get too strong. Struthas was replaced two years later by his predecessor [[Tiribazus]], who negotiated a peace with the Spartan envoy [[Antalcidas]]. The resulting agreement, known as the 'Peace of Antalcidas' or the 'King's Peace' essentially accepted the Spartan proposals of 392/1. The most important terms were the inclusion of all Greek states and the guarantee of their freedom and autonomy. Only the Ionian cities, [[Cyprus]] and [[Clazomenae]], which remained under Persian control, and the three aforementioned islands under Athenian rule were excluded. The Athenians had to surrender all other possessions and the dissolution of all leagues was the unavoidable consequence of the treaty. The key passage comes from [[Xenophon]], whose [[Hellenica]] is the most important source for this period:
{{quote|Artaxerxes the king thinks it is just that the cities in Asia be his as well as the islands of Clazomenae and Cyprus, but that all the Greek cities great and small should be allowed to be autonomous, except for Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros, which should be Athenian, as of old. And if anybody does not accept this peace, I will go to war against them, with those who want these things, on foot and by sea, with ships and with money.|Xenophon, ''Hellenica'' 5.1.31}}

Most scholars see the Peace of Antalcidas as the first example of a common peace. [[Hermann Bengtson]] viewed the common peace as a side-effect of the treaty, which was originally only a decree of the Great King (from which it derives its name).&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Griechische Geschichte.'' p.&amp;nbsp;271.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spartans were appointed as guardians (''prostatai'') of the peace, with the power to interpret and enforce its provisions. All the Greek states swore to abide by this decree at Sparta - in light of the Great King's threat to go to war with anyone who refused to do so. This fact and the aforementioned exceptions show that a common peace was not fully achieved. Nor would one be achieved subsequently. While the autonomy and the inclusion of all cities was guaranteed, they were entirely dependent on the interests of those same powers which initiated and guaranteed the common peace.

Artaxerxes did not intend to provide Greece with an enduring peace, but to divide and weaken it politically. The Spartans displayed a desire for peace, but also a wish to ensure their own hegemony. The Spartan interpretation of autonomy required the dissolution of all leagues except their own [[Peloponnesian League]],&lt;ref&gt;On the problem of the definition of autonomy, see Pistorius, ''Hegemoniestreben'', pp. 165–167&lt;/ref&gt; since this was not unified or centrally organised, but instead was a system of bilateral treaties which the Spartans had made with each individual member. In the Spartan view, bilateral treaties between individual states were not included in the ban on leagues controlled by a hegemonic power, although in practice this is exactly what the Peloponnesian League was.

Therefore, the Spartans remained the strongest military power in Greece. Under the pretext of protecting the autonomy principle, they maintained a hegemonic position over the next few years which greatly abused the autonomy of other states, such as the [[Chalcidian League]] and the city of [[Mantinea]].

=== The Common Peace of 375 BC ===
In 382 BC, the Spartans seized the [[Cadmea]], the citadel of Thebes, whose increasing strength was a thorn in their side. This act costed them the rest of their credit as protectors of autonomy and led to the [[Boeotian War]] with the Thebans and their Athenian allies. In the course of this, in spring 377 BC, the [[Second Athenian Confederacy]] was established. This league represented a violation of the clauses of the Peace of Antalcidas. But it is possible that a majority of the Aegean islands and coastal states now saw Athens as a better advocate of the principle of autonomy, as a result of their support for the Thebans. The league treaty was explicitly concluded:
{{quote|for the good fortune of the Athenians and the allies of the Athenians: so that the Spartans shall allow the Greeks 10 to be free and autonomous and to live at peace, possessing securely all their own (territory), &lt;nowiki&gt;[[and so that [the peace and the friendship which the Greeks] and the King [swore] shall be in force [and endure] in accordance with the 15 agreements]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Rhodes &amp; Osborne, ''Greek Historical Inscriptions 404-323 BC'' (2007), no 22.}}

The Athenians had thus taken clever advantage of the situation and the restoration of the naval confederacy clearly brought with it the undertaking to maintain the King's Peace. It had taken less than thirty years of Spartan hegemony to reverse attitudes on the Athenian empire. The first league had been presented as a threat to autonomy, but the second was claimed to be its protector. In order to prevent the Athenians from reassuming a hegemonic position, the new league was organised in accordance with the principles of the common peace. This is a sign that these principles were generally accepted by this time.

When the war with Sparta stagnated in 375 BC, the a willingness to make peace developed in Sparta and Athens. The Spartans could no longer hope for a victory and the Athenians had achieved their goals: the freedom of Thebes from Spartan control and the recognition of the sea league as compatible with the terms of the Peace of Antalcidas. [[Diodorus]] reports an embassy of the Great King came to secure a renewal of the peace, since the Persians needed peace in Greece in order to free the mercenaries up for a war they wanted to undertake in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 15.38.1&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek states accepted the agreement and the Common Peace was renewed.

At this point, the Common Peace was extended in one respect: as already foreseen in the terms of the Second Athenian Confederacy, it was required that all foreign garrisons be removed from all cities. This was directed particularly at the Spartans who had garrisons in some south [[Boeotia]]n cities, such as [[Thespiae]] (actually at their request, as protection against the Thebans). The Thebans were thus the main beneficiaries of the Common Peace of 375. The Spartans had begun the war on the same grounds that the Athenians now wished to end it: to prevent the further growth of Theban power. However, in the end the departure of the Spartan troops on the pretext of the autonomy principle left the Thebans with a free hand in Boeotia. Even so, the Athenians were clearly on the winning side: their success lay in the recognition of a new confederacy. Neither the Spartans nor the Persians could do anything about this, as they had done ten years earlier.

Despite the Persian diplomatic involvement, the Common Peace of 375 can be seen as the first which derived principally from Greek initiative and in which all parties were of roughly equal strength and thus received equal terms. For the first time, a peaceful system seemed to be possible without enforcement by a hegemonic power.

=== Failed negotiations of 371 BC ===
Two opposing political groups had already developed in Athens before the treaty of 375 BC: one sought an agreement with Sparta, the other a strengthening of the alliance with Thebes. However, the anti-Spartan forces over-estimated Athens' position after the peace and supported a democratic insurgency against the government of the island of [[Corcyra]], which was allied with Sparta. Thus the Spartans, who were anything but satisfied with the result of the preceding clashes, already had grounds to go back to war a year and a half after the peace. At the same time, the situation was further complicated by the fact that Thebes destroyed the city of [[Plataea]] in 374/3 BC, which had an ancient alliance with Athens and had also been allied with Sparta since 380 BC. The Spartans therefore sent troops to [[Phokis]], to threaten Thebes and undo the failures of the preceding years. Thus, 371 BC once more saw the outbreak of a general conflict.

In Athens, however, the moderate politicians considered the best outcome for their city to lie in a policy of neutrality and proposed a new common peace. To support Thebes would decisively strengthen their position. Support of Sparta, on the other hand, would have alarmed their allies, who say them as a threat to their right to autonomy. Further factors were also relevant: if the Spartans refused the proposed league, the Athenians would have been forced to fight two wars at once. Therefore, the Athenians decided to overlook the fate of Plataea and invited the Thebans to a peace conference in Sparta. The Spartans were even more willing to make peace now, since their actions in Phocis had been unsuccessful. Threatening Thebes thus became unlikely, but the Spartans did not consider themselves to be in any danger.

The common peace which was now proposed at the initiative of the Athenians, again saw critical innovation. The Athenian interpretation of autonomy prevailed and according to Xenophon, the Spartans committed to removing all their [[harmost]]s from cities of the peace.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 6.18–19&lt;/ref&gt; This was a difficult situation, since after 375 BC, only the cities in the Peloponnese (Sparta's chief area of influence) were relevant. Even more important for the continued development of idea of peace were rules which provided for all sides to demobilise their troops and fleets and which allowed the treaty partners to help one another in the event of an attack. The final clause, which did not impose a duty to help, was included at Athenian request. They intended to use it later to maintain the possibility of holding the balance of power between the other two powers.

Considered in isolation, this peace treaty could be taken as a skilled piece of Athenian diplomacy. But since it never actually came into effect, it can only be speculated whether it could have formed the basis of an enduring peace. After all, the treaty partners had taken account of the idea that sufficient force needed to be made available for use against potential treaty breakers in order to maintain the peace. In the Peace of Antalcidas, this had been accomplished by the threat of the Great King. In an agreement between free states, it had to be an agreement to oppose an attack on a treaty partner together.

At the planned swearing of the treaty, however, a serious rift arose between Thebes and Sparta. The Theban envoys had initially sworn to the agreement in the name of their own city and allowed that name to be placed on the treaty. But the next day, they demanded that the name of Thebes be replaced with that of the [[Boeotian League]], since they claimed to be entitled to represent it. The Spartans categorically rejected this, since in their view the Boeotian cities ought to be autonomous. The split led to war and only twenty days later, the [[Battle of Leuctra]] took place, which proved to be the first Spartan defeat in open battle and decisively altered the balance of power in Greece in Thebes' favour.

[[File:Griechenland 371-362.jpg|thumb|400px|Greece during the [[Theban Hegemony]], 371–362 BC.]]

After the battle, military activity ceased. At first, the Thebans undertook no further military action against the Spartans, who eventually sent troops to the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] to ward off any chance of a Theban attack on the Peloponnese. In this situation, the Athenians seized the initiative and called a peace conference, at which they could swear to the common peace once more and negotiate a new treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 6.5.2-3&lt;/ref&gt; This was motivated by the desire to prevent further increase in Theban power. An innovation in this new peace treaty was that the possibility of aiding a treaty partner in attacking a disturber of the peace was transformed into a duty. This was a logical development of the previous failed peace and was found at the start of all future common peace treaties. Some researchers see the second treaty of 371 as the foundation of a military alliance (''symmachia''), as a result of this duty to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Ernst Mayer in the review of Hampl, ''Staatsverträge'', in [[Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftung für Rechtsgeschichte|Zeitschrift für Rechtsgeschichte]], Romanische Abteilung 59 (1938), pp. 598–606&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spartans joined this new agreement immediately for their own sake. Their neighbours, the [[Elis|Eleans]] had already sought to take advantage of the defeat of Sparta in the meanwhile and they refused to recognise the autonomy of some of their border cities, which they had given up in 399 BC under Spartan compulsion, but had retaken after Leuctra.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 6.5.3&lt;/ref&gt; Fatally, the Thebans did not agree to the treaty, since a common peace was inconsistent with their ambitions for their newly won hegemony. H. Bengtson saw this common peace as nothing more than an Athenian "gesture against Thebes, without practical value."&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Geschichte'', p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

If the idea of the Common Peace had any chance to be based on equal rights for all states, it was in the short period between 375 BC and the Battle of Leuctra. Only then were there three Greek powers of roughly equal strength such that the strongest could be controlled by an alliance of the other two. Before and after this there was a clearly dominant hegemonic power (first Sparta, then Thebes) which either sought to use the common peace for their own purposes or rejected it altogether. Both approaches led to further military conflict. With the failure of the negotiations of 371 BC, the concept of the common peace largely lost credence as part of a practical policy.

===Peace treaties of 368 and 366 BC ===
In the year after Leuctra, the Thebans clearly established their hegemony. Through a campaign into the Peloponnese, they established the independence of the [[Messenians]], who had been ruled by the Spartans for centuries, and supported the establishment of the [[Arcadian League]]. A further war against an alliance of Sparta, Athens and [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]] proved inconclusive. Thus in 369/8 BC, all the Greek states responded to the call to meet in a peace conference at [[Delphi]], issued by [[Ariobarzanes of Phrygia|Ariobarzanes]], the satrap of [[Phrygia]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, Hellenica 7.1.27&lt;/ref&gt; However, the negotiations foundered in the face of the Spartans' refusal to accept Messenian independence - a position which was supported by the Athenians and by the Persian representative, Philiscus. Since Ariobarzanes went into rebellion against the Great King a little later, it is not entirely clear whether he was acting on the king's orders or in accordance with his own interests.&lt;ref&gt;See Ryder, ''Koine Eirene'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of further clashes, [[Dionysius II of Syracuse]] withdrew his aid from the Spartans, leading them to turn to the Persians for assistance once more. Thus, in 367/6 BC, Greek envoyse to the court of the Great king engaged in what the ancient historian [[Karl Julius Beloch]] referred to as the ''Wettkriechen'' (wager-creep), in which the Theban [[Pelopidas]] was ultimately successful. The Persians now recognised Thebes as the organising power in Greece in the same way that they had recognised Sparta in the King's Peace twenty years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ryder |first=T. T. B. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1957 |month= |title=The Supposed Common Peace of 366/5 BC |journal=The Classical Quarterly |volume=7 |issue=3/4 |pages=199–205 |doi=10.1017/S0009838800015275|quote= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |jstor= 637462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, the Messenians were to be independent from Sparta and [[Amphipolis]] from Athens, while the [[Elis|Eleans]] were granted the neighbouring area of [[Triphylia]]. Furthermore, all armies and the fleet of the Athenians were to be reduced in size.

This attempt at a common peace was rejected by Sparta and Athens. The Thebans did not manage to enthuse other city-states with the agreement either. These two attempts at a common peace under Theban hegemony represent a return to the idea of peace presented in 387 BC: the Persians attempted to use the influence of a Greek hegemonic power to force a common peace. That both attempts, unlike the King's Peace, were rejected is a result of the fact that the Great King had lost power as a peacebroker, as a result of the revolt of Ariobarzanes and other satraps. The most important reason for the course of events, however, may have been the experiences of the Greek cities with Paris after the King's Peace.

=== The Common Peace of 362 ===
Due to the growing Theban pressure on Athens (such as the seizure of [[Oropus]] in 366 BC), the Athenians became hostile once more, especially when actual help from their allies failed to materialise. None of the Greek states were able to gain full dominance in the following years. The conflict arising from the split in the Arkadian League also remained unresolved. This culminated in 362 BC with the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]], in which the Spartans, Athenians and their allies faced down the Thebans and their allies. After the battle, in which the foremost Theban commander [[Epaminondas]] was killed, both sides considered themselves the victors and again concluded a common peace.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 15.89.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, the agreement was reached neither at the instigation of one of more leading powers, nor as a result of the power of the Persian king. In this and in the refusal of the Greek states to support the [[Great Satraps' Revolt]] against the Persian king in Asia Minor, many scholars have seen a positive element.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Taeger, ''Friede'', pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt; According to this viewpoint, the Greeks had managed to control themselves and establish a peace on their own. The opposing view is that the basis of this new common peace was simply the military and economic exhaustion of all parties, which also made an intervention in Asia Minor completely unthinkable.&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Geschichte'', S. 385 f.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The terms of the agreement particularly indicate that they arose from widespread war weariness and a desire to make peace as quickly as possible. They allowed each state to hold whatever they actually possessed at the time when the treaty was concluded. Territorial conflicts were not resolved at all - they no longer even posed an obstacle to agreement. The Arcadian League remained split into a northern and a southern half and the Messenians continued to be independent. Since half the land owned by the Spartans lay within Messenia, they did not accede to this common peace, but they were in no condition to carry on the war.

=== The Common Peace as the basis of the League of Corinth ===
[[File:Demosthenes2.jpg|thumb|Demosthenes]]
{{main|League of Corinth}}
After Mantinea, Greek politics continued along the same lines as before. When conflict with the rising power of [[Philip II of Macedon]] became more intense in the 350s, the idea of the Common Peace was revived once more. Philip first made the suggestion of replacing the [[Peace of Philocrates]] which had ended the [[Third Sacred War]] with a common peace. In the next few years, [[Demosthenes]] and other advocates of a decidedly anti-Macedonian approach gained preeminence in Athens. They rejected the proposal and called for war against Philip of Macedon. In 340/39 BC, the Athenians successfully brought together an alliance of Greek states, but their forces were decisively defeated by Philip at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BC.

The Macedonians reacted harshly only against the Thebans, wishing instead to take advantage of the power of Athens and the other states by means of a league. The treaty establishing this league contained an express ban on interfering in the constitutions of other states by force (essentially an autonomy clause) and general bans on conflict and piracy for the first time, as well as a guarantee of free navigation. Only the Spartans refused to join this league. The other states were to send representatives, who would meet in a [[synedrion]] (council). They then entered into a personal alliance with Philip II, making him the Hegemon of the League.

Theoretically, the freedom and autonomy of the Greek state were thus assured. In practice, however, the general ban on conflict marked a striking limitation on independence. In addition, the Macedonians retained garrisons in the [[Cadmea]] of Thebes, the [[Acrocorinth]], and at [[Chalcis]] - ostensibly to maintain the common peace.

The League of Corinth therefore marked the end of the Common Peace as the foundation for full equality between states and linked the idea of peace strongly with the guarantee of a hegemonic power once more. The alliance and the common peace were interlinked in the league treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, ''Staat'', pp. 146 &amp; 322&amp;nbsp;f.&lt;/ref&gt; The Panhellenic idea of a unified Greece and a campaign of vengeance against Persia were enabled by this Common Peace.

==Reasons for failure==
With 'autonomy and freedom' the Greek states at the beginning of the fourth century found a formula for a inclusive peace system which was acceptable to all sides. After 387 BC no peace was possible without it, even if the individual attempts only held for a few years each. However, the principles of the common peace also found their way into league treaties, such as the Second Athenian Sea League and the League of Corinth. A major opportunity for the development of a true Common Peace lay in the fact that the peace idea proved flexible enough to be developed further in this way.

Scholars like [[Bengtson]] take the view that the Greek city states did not have enough time before the establishment of the Macedonian hegemony, to fully adopt the Common Peace as an instrument of peace and as the foundations of a new order in the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Geschichte'', S. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The best chance for an enduring peace on the basis of equality between city states was probably missed with the failure of the Common Peace of 371 BC. Nine years later, after the Battle of Mantinea, a Common Peace was seen only as a compromise solution. The revival of the concept by Philip of Macedon was undertaken only in the interests of Macedonian power, as it had previously been used to support the interests of Persia, Sparta, Athens, and Thebes.

A major aspect of the failure of the Common Peace lay in the formulation of the concept itself, especially the broad interpretation of the autonomy clause.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenda, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; The mutual control of Greek states by one another was only possible at the beginning of the fourth century. The idea that any limitations of the ability to wage war were restrictions on freedom and autonomy made any system of peace almost certain to fail.

The leaders of the city-states were aware that good will alone was not enough to guarantee a Common Peace. Depending on the political situation, they developed mechanisms of enforcement to prevent disturbances of the peace. They gradually came to the conclusion that a common peace on the basis of equal rights for all states was only possible if all participants were to immediately come to the aid of any member of the alliance under attack. This assumed a roughly equal balance of power between the Greek states, which actually only existed for a short period between 375 BC and the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC. Before and after these dates, a Common Peace would only have had a chance if a strong guaranteeing power was prepared to provide military support to the agreement as necessary.

==Afterlife==
The principles of the Common Peace developed by the Greeks in the fourth century BC, only developed once more in Europe in the 17th century when they became the basis for enduring peace agreements and systems. Thus, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] was the first European peace agreement in modern times to be based on priniciples of the equality of sovereign states and on the inviolability of their internal affairs - that is, on the idea of autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, ''Krieg''; S. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|Perpetual Peace]]'' of 1795, [[Immanuel Kant]] went one step further. He advocated not only the principle of non-intervention, but also called for a ''Volkerbund'' (People's league). In order to end the lawless natural situation between states, this would establish a federal relationship between them, in a manner similar to the common peace proposed after the Battle of Leuctra.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, ''Frieden'', pp 19 &amp; 30 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's ideas were appealed to in the twentieth century by the founders of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]].

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1971''' was the first [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (formerly named the British Commonwealth). It was held in [[Singapore]], between 14 January 1971 and 22 January 1971, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]].

British prime minister [[Edward Heath]] advised [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] not to attend the conference due to a row within the Commonwealth over Britain selling arms to [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=27 December 2013|title=Only the Queen understands the true value of the Commonwealth|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/10539479/Only-the-Queen-understands-the-true-value-of-the-Commonwealth.html|work=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the only CHOGM the Queen would miss until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Concern as the Queen misses Commonwealth summit in Sri Lanka|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/10041931/Queens-absence-from-Commonwealth-meeting-sign-of-changing-role.html|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugandan president [[Milton Obote]] was overthrown by [[Idi Amin]] in [[1971 Ugandan coup d'état|a military coup]], whilst he was attending the meeting.

At the meeting the [[Singapore Declaration|Singapore Declaration of Commonwealth Principles]] was agreed setting out the core political values that would form the main part of the Commonwealth's membership criteria.

The '''Constitution of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (1941)''' was the [[Constitution|fundamental law]] of the [[Moldovan SSR]], adopted in 1941.

== History ==

The Constitution of 1941 was adopted soon after the [[Elections in the Moldavian SSR, 1940|1940 Moldavian SSR elections]]. The Constitution was adopted at the first session of the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Moldavian SSR]], on January 12, 1941. It was based on the principles and provisions of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]]. 

[[Moldovans|Moldovan]] deputies represented 56% of the total number of representatives, although the titular ethnicity made up 65% of the republic's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/52-6-111.shtml "The New Constitution of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216093607/http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/52-6-111.shtml |date=2009-02-16 }}, ''[[Radio Free Europe]]'' background report&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution was superseded by a [[Constitution of the Moldovan SSR (1978)|new one in 1978]]

'''Countercurrent''' ({{lang-it|Controcorrente}}) is a small, Italian, [[trotskyism|trotskyist]] political party. It used to be a faction within the [[Communist Refoundation Party]].

The group emerged in 2006 as a split from [[Communist Project]], when their leader [[Marco Ferrando]] decided to leave the party in order to form his own [[Workers' Communist Party (Italy)|Workers' Communist Party]]. For the 24–27 July 2008 congress the faction formed a common list with [[The Ernesto]], another minority faction, and obtained 7.7% of the delegates. In that occasion they supported the election of [[Paolo Ferrero]], leader of the [[Refoundation in Movement]]-[[Being Communists]] motion, as party secretary, thus joining for the first time the majority of the party.

In 2010 the faction embraced the [[Committee for a Workers' International]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/4285&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the party was the most important promoter of the massive Genoa Public Transportation Strike, that went on for a week and was considered the biggest non-general strike of the year.

In 2017, Controcorrente left the CWI over disagreements regarding, among other issues, the role of the European Union and [[Brexit]]. A large minority including mostly younger members split from Controcorrente to remain part of the CWI, forming a new organisation named [[Resistenze Internazionali]].&lt;ref&gt;https://resistenzeinternazionali.it/2017/08/un-inizio-cwi-cil-italia/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Defensor minor''''' is a work by [[Marsilius of Padua]] written around 1342. The Defensor minor is a restatement and defense of Marsilius's best known work, the ''[[Defensor pacis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nederman, Cary J. [http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521408466 Marsiglio of Padua: 'Defensor minor' and 'De translatione imperii']&lt;/ref&gt; 

The text discusses civil and [[ecclesiastical]] jurisdiction, the [[Confession (religion)|confession]], [[penance]], [[indulgence]]s, the [[Crusades]], [[pilgrimage]]s, [[plenitudo potestatis]], legislative power, the origin of the sovereignty, [[wedding]], and [[divorce]].

==Civil jurisdiction==
With regard to jurisdiction, Marsilius distinguishes between divine and human laws, the first event which is independent of any human will and on the conduct of man in view of the afterlife, the second which determines the will of the people, endowed with coercive power and not modifiable by any clergyman.

This applies also to the Pope that even with his decrees may waive the law, manifestation of the people's sovereignty. While the beneficiaries of the two laws are identical, its object and purpose are different. The one seeks the good of the soul and the other cares for earthly well-being, with the result that the church is denied the power to make laws, even in the persistent silence of human legislation. The same applies to amendments and changes, which should remain solely with the people. The only thing that is relevant to the clergy is the non-legal rules that affect morality and resolve themselves into simple counsels and take effect with counsellors.

==The clergy==
The task and the main function of the clergy is to teach the sacred texts and preparing souls for the afterlife. The Church has repeatedly stated that for the sinner there is no other system of redemption from sin but confession. Marsilius, in an effort to bring man to God, regardless of any broker, says that confession should be done directly to God and that salvation comes only by true repentance. This anticipates what will be one of the tenets of Protestantism. The necessity of this Sacrament, that is only recommended and not required, is not detected from the Holy Scriptures. Only sincere repentance to the outside of any denominational gives you that peace in the soul that is the prelude of eternal salvation.  Absolution from sin belongs only to God and the priest, who may do so, does so only within the Church. ''Sufficit soli Deo confiteri peccata ipsa, videlicet recognoscendo, et de ipsis poenitendo cum proposito talia alterius non committendi.'' 
These words can be regarded as harbingers of what will be the principles of the Lutheran Reformation.

''Sufficit sola contritio et vera poenitentia de commisso absque omni confessione facta vel fienda sacerdoti, ut immediate absolvatur per Deum.'' Marsilio does not exclude absolutely confession: he says only that it is useful but not essential,  which it would be if it were a precept, therefore  he also denies the priestly power to inflict penalties.
Only contrition frees from sin not repentance of any material or spiritual character almost like a compensation for the sin.''Quamvis in hoc saeculo nullam realem aut personalem satisfactionem exhibeat pro peccatis.''

{{For|the legal doctrine|Judicial deference}}
{{hatnote|"Deferential" and "Submission" redirect here. Not to be confused with [[Difference (disambiguation)]] or [[Differential (disambiguation)]].}}
{{redirect-distinguish|Reverence (attitude)|Reverence (emotion)}}
'''Deference''' (also called '''submission''' or '''passivity''') is the condition of submitting to the espoused, [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] influence of one's superior or superiors.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Kirbya, "Early American Politics—The Search for Ideology: An Historiographical Analysis and Critique of the Concept of 'Deference,'" ''The Journal of Politics'', Volume 32, Issue 04, November 1970 pp 808–838&lt;/ref&gt; Deference implies a yielding or submitting to the judgment of a recognized superior, out of respect or reverence. Deference has been studied extensively by [[political scientists]], sociologists, and psychologists.

==Politics==
Smolenski (2005) examines deference in colonial Pennsylvania, to see how claims to political authority were made, justified, and accepted or rejected. He focuses on the "colonial speech economy," that is, the implicit rules that determined who was allowed to address whom and under what conditions, and describes how the qualities that inspired deference changed in the province from 1691 to 1764. The Quaker elite initially established a monopoly on political leadership based on what they believed to be their inherent civic virtue grounded in their religious and social class. By 1760, this view had been discredited and replaced with the consensus that civic virtue was an achieved, not an inherent, attribute and that it should be determined by the display of appropriate manliness and the valor of men who were willing to take up arms for the common defense of the colony. Further, Pennsylvanians came to believe that all white men, not just wealthy property owners, were equally capable of achieving political voice. Martial masculinity, therefore, became the defining characteristic of the ideal citizen and marked a significant transformation in the way individuals justified their right to represent the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;John Smolenski, "From Men of Property to Just Men," ''Early American Studies, An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Fall 2005, Vol. 3 Issue 2, pp 253–285&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==
[[Erving Goffman]], a Canadian-born [[sociology|sociologist]] and writer, explored the relationship between deference and demeanor in his 1967 essay "The Nature of Deference and Demeanor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erving Goffman|year=1967|title=Interaction Ritual|location=New York, NY|publisher=Anchor House|isbn=0-394-70631-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Goffman, a person with a poor demeanor will be held in lower esteem in the eyes of society. The same is true for people who behave in a good demeanor, however: society will hold them in a higher esteem. An example of this situation can be seen through the way a person acts in a social setting. e.g. a man pulling out a chair for a woman at a restaurant. On the other end of the spectrum, a person not bathing before they go to a fancy dinner party. These examples can be defined as presentational deference. Demeanor does not only limit itself to the actions of an individual, but also the appearance of an individual. A person offers themselves to a social group through a good appearance or a well demeanored appearance. When an individual has a well demeanored appearance it makes interaction between people easier. After a person is socially accepted to a group, it is expected that they will conform to interactional norms. Through acting on those norms, people receive deference.

==Psychology==
There is ongoing debate among psychologists as to the extent to which deference in a relationship is determined by a person's innate [[personality type]] or is the result of a person's experiences and [[classical conditioning|conditioning]]. In [[interpersonal relationships]], a partner can assume a submissive role to fit in or to make him or herself acceptable to the other partner,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=James J. Gross|title=Handbook of Emotion Regulation|publisher=Guilford Publications|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59385-148-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be a benign aspect of a relationship. On the other hand, it may be an indication of an interpersonal problem, such as [[Domestic violence|partner abuse]]. If one or both of the people are experiencing chronic, pervasive emotional distress then the sex partners or individuals may require psychological evaluation.

In interpersonal relationships, some people prefer or are willing to adopt a submissive role in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] or personal matters. The level and type of submission can vary from person to person, and from one context to another; and also is dependent on the other partner being willing to assume control in those situations. Some people can include occasional acts of submission in an otherwise [[conventional sex]] life, or adopt a submissive lifestyle.

The '''Democratic Representative Caucus''', also called the '''Democratic Representative Association''', was a [[parliamentary group]] in the [[37th Canadian Parliament]] consisting of Members of Parliament who left the [[Canadian Alliance]] in 2001 in protest against the leadership of [[Stockwell Day]]. Following the Alliance's disappointing performance in the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 election]], Day came under severe criticism from his own party.  Several high-profile Alliance MPs began publicly calling for him to step down.  Through the spring of 2001, several members of the Alliance resigned their shadow cabinet seats, the most high-profile resignation being that of deputy leader [[Deborah Grey]].

On May 2, [[Art Hanger]] was the first Alliance MP suspended from caucus for criticizing Day. Over the next two months, 11 other Alliance MPs were either suspended from caucus or resigned.  On May 16, Hanger was followed by [[Chuck Strahl]], [[Gary Lunn]], [[Jim Pankiw]], [[Val Meredith]], [[Grant McNally]], [[Jay Hill]] and [[Jim Gouk]]. In late June, they were joined by [[Monte Solberg]], [[Andy Burton (politician)|Andy Burton]] and [[Brian Fitzpatrick (Canadian politician)|Brian Fitzpatrick]], and in the first week of July by [[Inky Mark]] and Grey. Through the summer, this group of MPs sat as "Independent Alliance Caucus", and were jokingly dubbed the "[[Rebel Alliance]]" by political commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ibbitson|first1=John|authorlink1=John Ibbitson|title=Stephen Harper|date=2015|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|location=Toronto|isbn=9780771047091|page=146|quote=Others joined the 'Rebel Alliance' as reporters dubbed it. The Democratic Representative Caucus, as the dissidents preferred to be called...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September, an offer was made to the MPs in which they would be readmitted to the Alliance caucus if they promised to refrain from criticizing Day's leadership. The MPs surveyed their constituents, and on September 10, the offer was accepted by Hanger, Gouk, Solberg, Fitzpatrick and Burton. The remaining seven MPs refused, and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus on September 12, with Strahl as its parliamentary leader and Grey as deputy leader. This was not intended as a new political party, but simply as a group caucus.

==Coalition with the Progressive Conservatives==
Two weeks later, on September 24, the DRC members entered into a coalition with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]], known as the "Progressive Conservative - Democratic Reform Coalition Caucus."  Strahl was named deputy leader of the coalition caucus, with Grey as caucus chairwoman.  The PC-DRC Coalition was intended to be PC leader [[Joe Clark]]'s framework for proving that the two parties could be united on his terms rather than Day's.  Clark and Strahl tried to propose common policies that would appeal to both PC and Alliance members.

While the DRC members insisted that they remained loyal to the Canadian Alliance despite their opposition to Day's leadership, the group founded the Democratic Representative Association (DRA), presumably to support their re-election campaigns as DRC Members of Parliament.

On November 19, Lunn left the DRC to rejoin the Alliance shortly after Day agreed to hold a new Alliance leadership race.

==End of the coalition==
In March 2002, Day lost that leadership race to [[Stephen Harper]], and on April 10, five of the seven DRC members returned to the Alliance caucus, terminating their coalition agreement with the PCs after Clark rebuffed Harper's attempts to seek a greater union between the Alliance and the Tories. The DRA was disbanded.

Mark chose not to return to the Alliance caucus, instead sitting as an Independent Conservative, then joining the PC caucus in early 2003.

Pankiw's request for readmission to the Alliance caucus was denied, as he was embroiled in a political scandal involving a violent confrontation with an aboriginal constituent. He ran for mayor of [[Saskatoon]], in 2003, while still sitting as an independent MP, and again attracted controversy because his home was in fact outside of Saskatoon's city limits and not in the city's Forest Grove area as he claimed on his application.

==Conservative Party of Canada==
Clark's successor, [[Peter MacKay]], negotiated a merger with the CA in late 2003, and he, along with Mark and most of the PC caucus, joined with the CA caucus to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], fulfilling the DRC's main goal of a unified centre right. But, Clark and a few other prominent PC MPs and senators refused to join the new party, whilst Pankiw was again refused admission along with another Saskatchewan CA MP, [[Larry Spencer]].

In 2004, Grey, having retired from politics, noted in her published political memoirs that the PC-DRC's full name was constantly misreported by the press, political commentators and the media. The official title of the coalition was "Progressive Conservative - Democratic ''Reform'' Coalition Caucus" as opposed to ''Representative''.

{{short description|a person's choice to deny reality, as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable truth}}
In the psychology of [[human behavior]], '''denialism''' is a person's choice to [[denial|deny]] [[reality]], as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable [[truth]].{{sfn|Maslin|2009}} Denialism is an essentially [[irrational]] action that withholds the validation of a historical experience or event, when a person refuses to accept an [[empirical]]ly verifiable reality.{{sfn|O'Shea|2008|p=20}} In the sciences, denialism is the rejection of basic facts and concepts that are undisputed, well-supported parts of the [[scientific consensus]] on a subject, in favor of radical and controversial ideas.{{sfn|Scudellari|2010}} The terms ''[[Holocaust denialism]]'' and ''[[AIDS denialism]]'' describe the denial of the facts and the reality of the subject matters,&lt;ref&gt;Usages of Holocaust and AIDS denialism:
{{harvnb|Kim|2007}}; {{harvnb|Cohen|2007}}; {{harvnb|Smith|Novella|2007|p=e256}}; {{harvnb|Watson|2006|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Nature Medicine's editor|2006|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''[[climate change denial]]'' describes denial of the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] that the [[climate change]] of planet Earth is a real and occurring event primarily caused by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;Usages of global-warming denialism: {{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|page=425}} {{harvnb|Colquhoun|2009|p=b3658}}; {{harvnb|Connelly|2007}}; {{harvnb|Goodman|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms of denialism present the common feature of the person rejecting overwhelming evidence and the generation of political controversy with attempts to deny the existence of consensus.{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}}
The motivations and causes of denialism include religion and self-interest (economic, political, financial) and [[defence mechanisms]] meant to protect the psyche of the denialist against mentally disturbing facts and ideas.{{sfn|Hambling|2009}}{{sfn|Monbiot|2006}}

==Orthodoxy and heterodoxy==
Anthropologist [[Didier Fassin]] distinguishes between ''[[denial]]'', defined as "the empirical observation that reality and truth are being denied", and ''denialism'', which he defines as "an ideological position whereby one systematically reacts by refusing reality and truth".&lt;ref name="Fassin-115"&gt;Didier Fassin, ''When bodies remember: experiences and politics of AIDS in South Africa'', Volume 15 of California Series in Public Anthropology, [[University of California Press]], 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25027-7}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jn9yoyuEV1YC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;f=false p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons and social groups who reject propositions on which there exists a mainstream and [[scientific consensus]] engage in ''denialism'' when they use [[rhetoric]]al tactics to give the appearance of argument and legitimate debate, when there is none.{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}} Rick Stoff quoted [[Chris Hoofnagle]]—a senior staff attorney at the [[Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic]] and a senior fellow at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the [[UC Berkeley School of Law]]—as follows:
{{quote|Then there are those who engage in denialist tactics because they are protecting some "overvalued idea" which is critical to their identity. Since legitimate dialogue is not a valid option for those who are interested in protecting bigoted or unreasonable ideas from scientific facts, their only recourse is to use these types of rhetorical tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoff |first=Rick |date=June 2007 |title='Denialism' and muddying the waters |journal=St. Louis Journalism Review |volume=37 |issue=296 |pages=21–33, 2p.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2003 newspaper article, [[Edwin Cameron]]—a senior South African judge who has [[AIDS]]—described the tactics used by those who deny the Holocaust and by those who deny that the [[AIDS pandemic]] is due to infection with HIV. He states that "For denialists, the facts are unacceptable. They engage in radical controversion, for ideological purposes, of facts that, by and large, are accepted by almost all experts and lay persons as having been established on the basis of overwhelming evidence".&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Urgent_Action/apic-90503.html The dead hand of denialism] [[Edwin Cameron]]. [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] (Johannesburg), April 17, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; To do this they employ "distortions, half-truths, misrepresentation of their opponents' positions and expedient shifts of premises and logic."&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"/&gt;  Edwin Cameron notes that a common tactic used by denialists is to "make great play of the inescapable indeterminacy of figures and statistics",&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"/&gt; as scientific studies of many areas rely on probability analysis of sets of data, and in historical studies the precise numbers of victims and other facts may not be available in the primary sources.

A 2009 article published in the journal ''[[Globalization and Health]]'' also notes "recourse to data debates and [[pseudo-scientific]] 'evidence{{'"}} as a common feature of several types of denialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chazan M, Brklacich M, Whiteside A |title=Rethinking the conceptual terrain of AIDS scholarship: lessons from comparing 27 years of AIDS and climate change research |journal=[[Global Health]] |volume=5 |issue= |page=12 |year=2009 |pmid=19807923 |pmc=2764568 |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-5-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an area which British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] mentioned as part of his analysis of the [[David Irving]]'s work which he presented for the defence when Irving sued  [[Deborah Lipstadt]] for libel:
{{quote|Reputable and professional historians do not suppress parts of quotations from documents that go against their own case, but take them into account, and, if necessary, amend their own case, accordingly. They do not present, as genuine, documents which they know to be forged just because these forgeries happen to back up what they are saying. They do not invent ingenious, but implausible, and utterly unsupported reasons for distrusting genuine documents, because these documents run counter to their arguments; again, they amend their arguments, if this is the case, or, indeed, abandon them altogether. They do not consciously attribute their own conclusions to books and other sources, which, in fact, on closer inspection, actually say the opposite. They do not eagerly seek out the highest possible figures in a series of statistics, independently of their reliability, or otherwise, simply because they want, for whatever reason, to maximize the figure in question, but rather, they assess all the available figures, as impartially as possible, in order to arrive at a number that will withstand the critical scrutiny of others. They do not knowingly mistranslate sources in foreign languages in order to make them more serviceable to themselves. They do not willfully invent words, phrases, quotations, incidents and events, for which there is no historical evidence, in order to make their arguments more plausible.&lt;ref name="Evans-Pgrph-6-20"&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]. David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition, [http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/evans/6 6. General Conclusion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012140414/http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/evans/6 |date=October 12, 2007 }} Paragraphs 6.20,6.21&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Mark Hoofnagle]] (brother of [[Chris Hoofnagle]]) has described denialism as "the employment of rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate, when in actuality there is none".{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}}{{efn|"AIDS denialism is one of several incarnations of denialism. All denialism is defined by rhetorical tactics designed to give the impression of a legitimate debate among experts when in fact there is none. [[Holocaust deniers]] claim that historians disagree about the evidence for Nazi mass gassings and systematic murder of Jews. Global warming denialists say that climatologists are torn by the evidence about climate change. [[9/11 Truth movement|9/11 'Truth Seekers']], as clever a piece of branding as '[[pro-life]]', say the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] resulted from controlled demolition. Vaccine hysterics tell us that the science is split on whether vaccinations cause autism. And AIDS denialists say that scientists are in disagreement about whether HIV causes AIDS" {{harv|Kalichman|2009}}.}} It is a process that operates by employing one or more of the following five tactics in order to maintain the appearance of legitimate controversy:{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/mar/10/climate-change-denier |title= Climate change deniers: failsafe tips on how to spot them |publisher= ''[[The Guardian]]'' |author= Mark Hoofnagle |date= 11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Conspiracy theories]] – Dismissing the data or observation by suggesting opponents are involved in "a conspiracy to suppress the truth".
# [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|Cherry picking]] – Selecting an anomalous critical paper supporting their idea, or using outdated, flawed, and discredited papers in order to make their opponents look as though they base their ideas on weak research.
# [[False attribution|False experts]] – Paying an expert in the field, or another field, to lend supporting evidence or credibility.
# [[Moving the goalpost]] – Dismissing evidence presented in response to a specific claim by continually demanding some other (often unfulfillable) piece of evidence.
# Other [[logical fallacies]] – Usually one or more of [[false analogy]], [[appeal to consequences]], [[straw man]], or [[red herring]].

Tara Smith of the [[University of Iowa]] also stated that moving goalposts, conspiracy theories, and cherry-picking evidence are general characteristics of denialist arguments, but went on to note that these groups spend the "majority of their efforts critiquing the mainstream theory" in an apparent belief that if they manage to discredit the mainstream view, their own "unproven ideas will fill the void".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=310459&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The fanaticism of denial that must be exposed |publisher=''Times Higher Education'' |author=Tara Smith |date=14 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 author [[Michael Specter]] defined group denialism as "when an entire segment of society, often struggling with the trauma of change, turns away from reality in favor of a more comfortable lie".&lt;ref name="Specter 2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prescriptive and polemic==
If one party to a debate accuses the other of ''denialism'' they are framing the debate. This is because an accusation of denialism is both prescriptive and [[polemic]]. Prescriptive because it carries implications that there is truth to the denied claim; [[polemic]] since the accuser implies that continued denial in the light of presented evidence raises questions about the other's motives.&lt;ref name="Fassin-115"/&gt;

Some people have suggested that because denial of the Holocaust is well known, advocates who use the term "denialist" in other areas of debate may intentionally or unintentionally imply that their opponents are little better than holocaust deniers. For example, in an essay discussing the general importance of skepticism, [[Clive James]] objected to the use of the word denialist to describe climate change skeptics, stating that it "calls up the spectacle of a fanatic denying the Holocaust";{{sfn|James|2009}} and [[Celia Farber]] has objected to the term ''AIDS denialists'', arguing that it is unjustifiable to place this belief on the same moral level with the Nazi crimes against humanity.{{sfn|Farber|2006}} However, [[Robert Gallo]] ''et al.'' defended this latter comparison, stating that AIDS denialism is similar to Holocaust denial since it is a form of [[pseudoscience]] that "contradicts an immense body of research".{{sfn|Gallo|Geffen|Gonsalves|Jefferys|2006}}

Edward Skidelsky, a lecturer in philosophy at [[Exeter University]], has suggested that this is a new use for the word denial and it may have its origins in an old sense of "deny", akin to "disown" (as in the [[Apostle Peter]] [[Denial of Peter|denying Jesus]]), but that its more immediate antecedence is from the Freudian sense of deny as a refusal to accept a painful or humiliating truth. He writes that "An accusation of 'denial' is serious, suggesting either deliberate dishonesty or self-deception. The thing being denied is, by implication, so obviously true that the denier must be driven by perversity, malice or wilful blindness." He suggests that, by the introduction of the word ''denier'' into further areas of historical and scientific debate, "One of the great achievements of [[The Enlightenment]]—the liberation of historical and [[scientific enquiry]] from [[dogma]]—is quietly being reversed", and that this should worry liberal-minded people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Edward |last=Skidelsky |date=27 January 2010 |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/01/words-that-think-for-us-3/ |title=Words that think for us: The tyranny of denial |work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]| accessdate=10 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of use: scientific denialism==

===Flat Earth===
{{main|Flat Earth|Modern flat Earth societies}}

The [[superseded scientific theories|superseded belief]] that the [[Earth]] is [[flat Earth|flat]], and [[denial]] of all of the overwhelming evidence that supports an approximately [[spheroid]] [[globe]] that rotates around its axis and revolves around the [[Sun]], persists into the [[21st century]]. Modern proponents of flat-Earth [[cosmology]] (or [[flat-earther]]s) refuse to accept any kind of contrary evidence, dismissing all [[spaceflight]]s and images from space as [[hoax]]es and accusing all organizations and even private citizens of [[conspiracy theory|conspiring]] to "hide the truth". They also claim that no actual [[satellite]]s are [[orbit]]ing the Earth, that the [[International Space Station]] is fake, and that these are lies from all governments involved in this grand [[cover-up]].

[[belief perseverance|Adherents]] of the modern flat-Earth model propose that a dome-shaped [[firmament]] encloses a disk-shaped Earth. They commonly claim that the Sun is only [[Samuel Rowbotham|3,000 miles]] above the Earth and that the [[Moon]] and the Sun orbit above, but not around, a flat Earth. Modern flat-earthers believe that [[Antarctica]] is not a continent but a massive [[ice flow]], with a wall 150 feet or higher, which circles the perimeter of the Earth and keeps everything (including all the oceans' water) from falling off the edge.

Flat-earthers also assert that no one is allowed to fly over or explore [[Antarctica]], despite contrary evidence. According to them, all photos and videos of ships sinking under the horizon and of the bottoms of city [[skyline]]s and clouds below the horizon, revealing the [[curvature of the Earth]], have been [[photo manipulation|manipulated]], [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or somehow faked. Therefore, regardless of any scientific or [[empirical evidence]] provided, flat-earthers will [[delusion|stubbornly conclude]] it is fabricated or altered in some way.&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listverse.com/2016/02/01/10-absurd-claims-of-modern-flat-earth-conspiracy-theorists/ |title=10 Absurd Claims of Modern Flat Earth Conspiracy Theorists |last=Nixon |first=Eli |publisher=Listverse |date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When linked to other observed phenomena such as gravity, sunsets, tides, eclipses, distances and other measurements that challenge the flat earth model, claimants replace commonly-accepted explanations with piecemeal models that distort how perspective, mass, boyancy, light or other physical systems work.  These piecemeal replacements rarely conform with each other, finally leaving many flat-Earth claimants to agree that such phenomena remain "mysteries" and more investigation is to be done.  In this conclusion, adherents remain open to all explanations except the commonly accepted globular Earth model, shifting the debate from ignorance to denialism.

===AIDS===
{{main|HIV/AIDS denialism}}

Religious beliefs may prompt an individual to deny the validity of the scientific theory of evolution.

===Animal pain and suffering===
{{quote box
|title = ''Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness'' (2012)
|quote = The absence of a [[neocortex]] does not appear to preclude an organism from experiencing affective states. Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit [[Intention|intentional behaviors]]. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the [[neurological substrate]]s that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf|title=The Cambridge declaration on consciousness|date=July 7, 2012|author=Low, P.|editor1=Jaak Panksepp |editor2=Diana Reiss |editor3=David Edelman |editor4=Bruno Van Swinderen |editor5=Philip Low |editor6=Christof Koch |publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite wide scientific consensus that [[pain in animals|some animals can experience pain]] and suffering,&lt;ref name="CDC" /&gt; this is often denied when it is convenient for people to do so. Such denial occurs for animals on farms, in laboratories, and those used for entertainment,&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wicks, D.|title=Silence and denial in everyday life - The case of animal suffering|journal=Animals|volume=1|issue=1|year=2011|pages=186–199|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/1/1/186/htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reus"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reus, E.  |author2=Olivier, D.|year=2007|title=Mind-matter for animals matters: Science and the denial of animal consciousness|journal=[[Between the Species]]|volume=13|issue=7|pages=6|url=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&amp;context=bts|doi=10.15368/bts.2007v13n7.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sollund"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sollund, R.|editor=Sollund, R.|year=2008|chapter=Causes for speciesism: Difference, distance and denial|title=Global Harms: Ecological Crime and Speciesism|publisher=New York: Nova Science Publishers|pages=109–131|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=7439}}&lt;/ref&gt; where animals may come to be viewed as [[Commodity status of animals|commodities]]. A study in 2013 reported that male undergraduates in the US denied animal suffering to justify eating meat.&lt;ref name="Rothgerber"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rothgerber, H.|year=2013|title=Real men don’t eat (vegetable) quiche: Masculinity and the justification of meat consumption|journal=Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity|volume=14|issue=4|pages=363–375|doi=10.1037/a0030379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The denial of animal pain and suffering is often inconsistent between related species. Such beliefs have led to the publication of books such as ''[[Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows]]'' written by social psychologist [[Melanie Joy]] in which she popularised the term ''[[carnism]]''.&lt;ref name="Joy2011"&gt;{{cite book|year=2010|author=Joy, M.|title=Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows: An Introduction to Carnism|publisher=Conari Press|isbn=1573245054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denial of animal pain and suffering can also lead to denial of broader concepts, such as denial of moral status&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wilson, S.D.|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/|accessdate=July 9, 2016|publisher=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|title=Animals and ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the existence of "mind"&lt;ref name="Bastian"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bastian, B., Loughnan, S., Haslam, N. and Radke, H.R.|year=2012|title=Don’t mind meat?

The idea that animals might not feel pain goes back to the 17th-century French philosopher, [[René Descartes]], who argued that animals do not experience pain and suffering because they lack [[Animal consciousness|consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Carbone149"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carbone, L.|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Iheg3hkj99AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22What+Animal+Want:+Expertise+and+Advocacy+in+Laboratory+Animal+Welfare+Policy%22#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=What Animals Want: Expertise and Advocacy in Laboratory Animal Welfare Policy|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=149|isbn=9780195161960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radner"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Radner, D.|author2=Radner, M. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1989|title=Animal Consciousness|publisher=Prometheus Books: Buffalo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harrison, P.|year=1992|title=Descartes on animals|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|pages=219–227|volume=42|issue=167|doi=10.2307/2220217|jstor=2220217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite book|author=Murray, M.|year=2008|title=Nature Red in Tooth and Claw: Theism and the Problem of Animal Suffering|publisher=Oxford University Press on Demand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Holocaust===
{{main|Holocaust denial}}
The term has been used with "[[Holocaust denial]]ism" as "the refusal to accept an [[empiricism|empirically]] verifiable reality. It is an essentially [[Emotional|irrational]] action that withholds validation of a historical experience or event."&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Shea, ''A Cross Too Heavy: Eugenio Pacelli, Politics and the Jews of Europe 1917-1943'', Rosenberg Publishing, 2008. {{ISBN|1-877058-71-8}}.

'''Enrique Bolín Pérez-Argemí''' (27 February 1940 – 17 October 2018) was a Spanish industrialist and [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] politician who served as Mayor of [[Benalmádena]] and [[Senate of Spain|Senator]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senado.es/web/composicionorganizacion/senadores/composicionsenado/fichasenador/index.html?legis=3&amp;id1=10763 BOLÍN PÉREZ-ARGEMI, ENRIQUE] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1989 he was sentenced to prison for the crime of possession of cocaine, for which he was expelled from the party despite reducing the penalty to a fine, and in 2008 he was sentenced to eight years of disqualification for a crime of urban trespass.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-23-11-2008/abc/Nacional/condenan-a-enrique-bolin-a-ocho-a%C3%B1os-de-inabilitacion-por-delito-urbanistico_911445944735.html Condenan a Enrique Bolín a ocho años de inhabilitación por delito urbanístico] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of Enrique Bolín Bidwell, promoter of tourism and hospitality on the Costa del Sol, and nephew of [[Luis Bolín]], correspondent in London of the newspaper ABC, who rented the Dragon Rapide plane that took [[Francisco Franco]] from the Canaries to Tetouan so he could join to the coup d'état in Spain in July 1936 that led to the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the fall of the Second Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.diariosur.es/costadelsol/fallece-enrique-bolin-20181018094253-nt.html Fallece a los 78 años Enrique Bolín, histórico alcalde de Benalmádena] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.diariodesevilla.es/entrevistas/cometi-delito-quiere-vuelva-alcalde_0_465853449.html "No cometí ningún delito, la gente quiere que vuelva a ser alcalde"] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13874">In general, '''expansionism''' consists of policies of governments and states that involve territorial, military or economic expansion. While some have linked the term to promoting [[economic growth]] (in contrast to [[Steady-state economy|no growth]] or sustainable policies), more commonly expansionism refers to the doctrine of a state expanding its territorial base or economic influence. This occurs usually, though not necessarily, by means of military aggression. Compare [[empire-building]], [[colonialism]], and ''mensurable''.

[[Anarchism]], [[reunification]] or [[pan-nationalism]] are sometimes used to justify and legitimize expansionism, but only when the explicit goal is to reconquer territories that have been lost, or to take over ancestral lands. A simple territorial dispute, such as a border dispute, is not usually referred to as expansionism.

Countries with nuclear weapons are more likely to exhibit expansionist behavior; particularly, if the state is not a democracy, and even if such state's public ideology is non-interference. Depending on chosen strategy, expansionism manifests in brute force or any threat of it, or in economic measures (a debt trap through infrastructure "investments" via burdensome loans), active measures (such as espionage, sabotage, manipulation of critical infrastructure), or a combination thereof. With conflicts that involve war, mutual accusations of expansionism are inevitable between nuclear powers that have strategic overlap.

==Past examples==
{{expand section|more historical examples|date=November 2017}} 
The militarist and nationalistic reign of [[Czar Nicholas I]] (1825–1855) led to wars of conquest against [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Persia (1826–1828)]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Turkey (1828–1829)]]. Various rebel tribes in the [[Caucasus]] region were crushed. A [[November Uprising|Polish revolt]] in 1830 was ruthlessly crushed. Russian troops in 1848 crossed into [[Austria-Hungary]] to put down the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolt]]. [[Russification]] policies were implemented to weaken minority ethnic groups. Nicholas also built the [[Kremlin Palace]] and a new cathedral in Saint Petersburg. But [[Pan-slavism]] ambition led to further war with Turkey (the [[Sick man of Europe]]) in 1853 provoked Britain and France into [[Crimean War|invading Crimea]], and Nicholas died, supposedly of grief at his defeat. &lt;ref&gt; [[Orlando Figes]], Crimea, Penguin, 2011, chapter one &lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Second Reich]] (1871–1918) underwent an industrial revolution under [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], who also reformed and expanded the army. Poles and Catholics were persecuted. Colonies were acquired in Africa and China. In 1890, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] dismissed Bismarck and resolved to build a world-class Navy, which led to an [[arms race]] with Britain and thence to World War One. &lt;ref&gt; [[Allan Mallinson]], '1914; Fight the Good Fight', Bantam Press, 2013, chapter two &lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933 the [[Third Reich]] under Hitler laid claim to the [[Rhineland]], the [[Sudetenland]], unification (''[[Anschluss]]'') with Austria in 1938, and the whole of the Czech lands the following year. After war broke out, Hitler and Stalin divided Poland between Germany and the USSR. In a ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' aimed at achieving ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for the German people, Germany invaded the USSR in 1941. &lt;ref&gt; [[Sebastian Haffner]], [[The Meaning of Hitler]], Phoenix, 2000, chapters 2,3 and 4 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colonialism]], a form of expansionism is the policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories, generally with the aim of developing or exploiting them to the benefit of the colonizing country.&lt;ref&gt;''Colonialism'', Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1989 ed.) p. 291.; ''Colonialisme'', Nouveau Petit Robert de la langue française (1993 ed.), p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of colonialism|European colonial period]] was the era from the 15th century to the mid-20th century when several European powers had established colonies in the [[Americas]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].

[[Expansionist nationalism]] is an aggressive and radical form of [[nationalism]] that incorporates autonomous, patriotic sentiments with a belief in expansionism. The term was coined during the late nineteenth century as European powers indulged in the '[[Scramble for Africa]]' in the name of national glory, but has been most associated with militarist governments during the 20th century including [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist_regime_.281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Japanese empire]], and the [[Balkans]] countries of [[Albanian nationalism|Albania]] ([[Greater Albania]]), [[Bulgarian nationalism|Bulgaria]] ([[Greater Bulgaria]]), [[Croatian nationalism|Croatia]] ([[Greater Croatia]]), [[Hungarian nationalism|Hungary]] ([[Hungarian irredentism|Greater Hungary]]), [[Romanian nationalism|Romania]] ([[Greater Romania]]) and [[Serbian nationalism|Serbia]] ([[Greater Serbia]]).

==21st century==
===China===
The People's Republic of China is expanding its operations and influence in the [[South China Sea]], claiming possession of disputed offshore islands in the search for oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Tisdall]], 'Vietnam's fury at China's expansionism can be traced to a troubled history', [[The Guardian]], 15/5/2004&lt;/ref&gt; A major instrument of influence is the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].

===Israel===
[[Israel]] has tried to expand its territory and power through the occupation of the [[Syria|Syrian]] Golan Heights,&lt;ref&gt;https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/israel-syria-safe-buffer-zone-golan-heights/&lt;/ref&gt; the killing of [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] civilians in the [[Gaza Strip]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/gaza-protest-latest-updates-180406092506561.html&lt;/ref&gt; warring with neighbouring [[Lebanon]] (2006) and openly considering future wars,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2006/08/17/nasrallah-wins-the-war&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/a-new-war-could-erupt-as-tensions-rise-between-israel-and-lebanon-2017-10&lt;/ref&gt; striking Syrian and Iranian forces that purport to defend the Syria against [[Daesh]] terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rt.com/news/437647-israel-strikes-syria-iran/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]], the largest [[Shi'ite]] state, has extended its influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Arango]], 'Iran Dominates in Iraq after US 'handed the country over'', [[The New York Times]], 15/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
[[Russia]]'s behavior threatens the integrity and existence of [[NATO]] member states and Russia's non-NATO neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Peter |title=Russian expansionism may pose existential threat, says NATO general |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2015-02-20 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/russia-existential-threat-british-nato-general |accessdate=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events associated with Russia are: the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]] and Russia's [[Occupied territories of Georgia|occupation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia]]; the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], which began in 2014 with the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Annexation of Crimea]] and the [[War in Donbass]]; and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|military intervention in Syria]].

===United States===
The [[United States]] is seen to be using its power to expand its influence. Criticism is meted out for large-scale events (wars); for expressing support in favor of opposition groups, and for aiding the rebel groups' aspirations to remove governments. The war in [[Afghanistan]] was begun in response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] attacks; despite opposition by traditional allies such as [[France]], a war in [[Iraq]] was declared based on the inaccurate information of Iraq hosting weapons of mass destruction. No weapons of mass destruction were ever found, however a controversial [[Iraqi oil law|oil law]] was passed through American influence, largely privatising the valuable commodity of oil to foreign companies. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-afghanistan-announce-war-us-army-escalation-pakistan-a7905821.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2018/02/23/trump-administration-troops-can-stay-in-iraq-syria-indefinitely/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/opinion/13juhasz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the United States extends to: embargoing countries such as Cuba;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-economy-un/us-trade-embargo-has-cost-cuba-130-billion-un-says-idUSKBN1IA00T&lt;/ref&gt; building military bases around the world, especially in the [[Arab countries]] of the [[Persian Gulf]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americansecurityproject.org/national-security-strategy/u-s-bases-in-the-middle-east/&lt;/ref&gt; supporting opposition groups in [[Libya]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]] during the [[Arab Spring]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-usa-order/exclusive-obama-authorizes-secret-help-for-libya-rebels-idUSTRE72T6H220110330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey/turkey-to-u-s-end-support-for-syrian-kurd-ypg-or-risk-confrontation-idUSKBN1FE297&lt;/ref&gt; implementing sanctions against the leaderships of countries [[Venezuela]], [[Russia]], and Iran;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/world/europe/us-sanctions-turkey-pastor.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/us-senators-introduce-russia-sanctions-bill-from-hell-idUSKBN1KN22Q&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/trump-maduro-venezuela-sanctions.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/global-powers-condemn-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-encourage-business.html&lt;/ref&gt; deploying its navy in the [[South China Sea]], widely seen as a way to counter Chinese claims in the South China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2166910/us-navy-plans-major-show-strength-south-china-sea-warning&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit rhetoric of president [[Donald Trump|Trump]] and his political satellites has had a damaging effect on the United States itself. Examples of such are the overt rhetoric advocating the overthrow of democratically-elected governments deemed undemocratic by the United States, such as in [[Venezuela]], [[Iran]], and [[Syria]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/08/trump-nicolas-maduro-overthrow-venezuelan-meetings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-opposition/trump-lawyer-giuliani-says-irans-government-will-be-overthrown-idUSKCN1M3005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2016/12/08/officials-obama-prioritized-defeating-assad-above-defeating-jihadists.html&lt;/ref&gt; the influencing of the blockade of countries such as [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/timeline-gcc-egyptian-discord-qatar-170605063154230.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, the United States is also seen to be asserting its dominance economically. Faced by a rapidly-internationalising Renminbi and a growing eurozone, the United States is using the global dominance of the US dollar in worldwide trade to indiscriminately sanction [[NATO]] allies such as [[Turkey]], as well as rival countries such as [[Russia]], Venezuela and Iran;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/world/europe/us-sanctions-turkey-pastor.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/us-senators-introduce-russia-sanctions-bill-from-hell-idUSKBN1KN22Q &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/trump-maduro-venezuela-sanctions.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/global-powers-condemn-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-encourage-business.html &lt;/ref&gt; using protectionist measures against traditional allies and fellow [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]-members, [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[European Union]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-tariffs-in-us-canada-china-eu-mexico-world-2018-7&lt;/ref&gt; and initiating a major trade war with economic rival [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45294162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideologies==

In the nineteenth century, theories of racial unity such as [[Pan-Germanism]], [[Pan-Slavism]], [[Pan-Turkism]] and the related [[Turanism]], evolved. In each case, the dominant nation (respectively, [[Prussia]], [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Orlando Figes]], ''Crimea'', Penguin, 2011, p.89 &lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially under [[Enver Pasha]],) used these theories to legitimise their expansionist policies.

==In popular culture==

[[George Orwell]]'s satirical novel ''[[Animal Farm]]'' is a fictional depiction, based on [[Stalin]]'s [[USSR]], of a new elite seizing power, establishing new rules and hierarchies, then expanding economically while compromising their ideals; while [[Robert Erskine Childers]] in ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]'' portrayed the threatening nature of the German [[Second Reich]]. [[Elspeth Huxley]]'s novel [[Red Strangers]] shows the effects on local culture of colonial expansion into sub-Saharan Africa.

[[File:World Health Organisation building from west.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of the [[World Health Organization]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].]]

'''Health policy''' can be defined as the "decisions, plans, and actions that are undertaken to achieve specific [[healthcare]] goals within a society".&lt;ref name="WHO-HP"&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/topics/health_policy/en/ ''Health Policy''], accessed 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Health Organization]], an explicit health policy can achieve several things: it defines a vision for the future; it outlines priorities and the expected roles of different groups; and it builds consensus and informs people.&lt;ref name="WHO-HP"/&gt;

There are many categories of health policies, including global health policy, public health policy, mental health policy, health care services policy, [[insurance policy]], personal healthcare policy, [[pharmaceutical policy]], and policies related to [[public health]] such as [[vaccination policy]], [[Tobacco smoking#Public policy|tobacco control policy]] or [[breastfeeding promotion]] policy. They may cover topics of financing and delivery of healthcare, access to care, quality of care, and [[HealthEquity|health equity.]]&lt;ref&gt;Harvard School of Public Health, Department of Health Policy and Management [http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/about ''About Health Care Policy''], accessed 25 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Health-related policy and its implementation is complex. Conceptual models can help show the flow from health-related policy development to health-related policy and program implementation and to [[health system]]s and health outcomes. Policy should be understood as more than a national law or health policy that supports a program or intervention. Operational policies are the rules, regulations, guidelines, and administrative norms that governments use to translate national laws and policies into programs and services.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, H, N Jewell and Karen Hardee.  2001. [http://www.policyproject.com/pubs/occasional/op-7.pdf ''Reforming Operational Policies:  A Pathway to Improving Reproductive Health Programs''] POLICY Occasional Paper. No. 7.  Washington DC: The Futures Group International, POLICY Project&lt;/ref&gt; The policy process encompasses decisions made at a national or decentralized level (including funding decisions) that affect whether and how services are delivered. Thus, attention must be paid to policies at multiple levels of the health system and over time to ensure sustainable scale-up. A supportive policy environment will facilitate the scale-up of health interventions.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hardee, L. Ashford, E. Rottach, R. Jolivet, and R. Kiesel. 2012. [http://www.healthpolicyproject.com/index.cfm?ID=publications&amp;get=pubID&amp;pubID=83 ''The Policy Dimensions of Scaling Up Health Initiatives'']. Washington, DC: Futures Group, Health Policy Project&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many topics in the [[politics]] and [[evidence]] that can influence the decision of a government, private sector business or other group to adopt a specific policy. [[Evidence-based policy]] relies on the use of science and rigorous studies such as [[randomized controlled trial]]s to identify programs and practices capable of improving policy relevant outcomes. Most political debates surround personal health care policies, especially those that seek to [[health care reform|reform healthcare delivery]], and can typically be categorized as either [[philosophy|philosophical]] or [[economics|economic]]. Philosophical debates center around questions about [[individual rights]], ethics and government authority, while economic topics include how to maximize the efficiency of health care delivery and minimize costs.

The modern concept of healthcare involves access to [[health care provider|medical professionals]] from various fields as well as [[medical technology]], such as [[medication]]s and [[surgical instrument|surgical equipment]]. It also involves access to the latest information and evidence from research, including [[medical research]] and [[health services research]].

In many countries it is left to the individual to gain access to healthcare goods and services by paying for them directly as [[out-of-pocket expenses]], and to private sector players in the medical and [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] industries to develop research. Planning and production of [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]] is distributed among labour market participants.

Other countries have an explicit policy to ensure and support access for all of its citizens, to fund health research, and to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of health workers to meet healthcare goals. Many governments around the world have established [[universal health care]], which takes the burden of healthcare expenses off of private businesses or individuals through pooling of financial risk.  There are a variety of arguments for and against universal healthcare and related health policies. Healthcare is an important part of [[health systems]] and therefore it often accounts for one of the largest areas of spending for both [[government]]s and individuals all over the world.

== Personal healthcare policy options ==

=== Philosophy: right to health ===
{{See also|Philosophy of healthcare}}

Many countries and jurisdictions integrate a [[human rights]] philosophy in directing their healthcare policies. The [[World Health Organization]] reports that every country in the world is party to at least one human rights [[treaty]] that addresses health-related rights, including the [[right to health]] as well as other rights that relate to conditions necessary for good health.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/hhr/en/ ''Health and Human Rights''.] Geneva. Accessed 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]]' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) asserts that medical care is a right of all people:&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml ''The Universal Declaration of Human Rights''.] Adopted on December 10, 1948 by the General Assembly of the United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[UDHR]] Article 25:'' "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, illness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control."

In some jurisdictions and among different [[faith-based organizations]], health policies are influenced by the perceived obligation shaped by religious beliefs to care for those in less favorable circumstances, including the sick. Other jurisdictions and [[non-governmental organization]]s draw on the principles of [[humanism]] in defining their health policies, asserting the same perceived obligation and enshrined [[right to health]].&lt;ref name="NHCHC"&gt;National Health Care for the Homeless Council.[http://www.nhchc.org/humanright.html "Human Rights, Homelessness and Health Care."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610180442/http://www.nhchc.org/humanright.html |date=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CESR"&gt;Center for Economic and Social Rights. [http://cesr.org/ushealthright "The Right to Health in the United States of America: What Does it Mean?"] October 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the worldwide human rights organization [[Amnesty International]] has focused on [[health]] as a human right, addressing inadequate access to [[HIV]] drugs and women's [[reproductive health|sexual and reproductive]] rights including wide disparities in [[maternal mortality]] within and across countries. Such increasing attention to health as a basic human right has been welcomed by the leading medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = The Lancet | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60768-X | title = Half a century of Amnesty International | journal = The Lancet | volume = 377 | issue = 9780 | pages = 1808 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21621708 | pmc = | url    =  http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(11)60768-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There remains considerable controversy regarding policies on who would be paying the costs of medical care for all people and under what circumstances. For example, government spending on healthcare is sometimes used as a global indicator of a government's commitment to the health of its people.&lt;ref name="LANCET"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lu | first1 = C. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = M. T. | last3 = Gubbins | first3 = P. | last4 = Leach-Kemon | first4 = K. | last5 = Jamison | first5 = D. | last6 = Murray | first6 = C.

The argument furthers that universal health insurance denies the right of individual patients to dispose of their own income as per their own will.&lt;ref name="Sade"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sade | first1 = R. M. | title = Medical Care as a Right: A Refutation | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197112022852304 | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 285 | issue = 23 | pages = 1288–1292 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5113728 | pmc = }} (Reprinted as [http://www.aapsonline.org/brochures/sademcr.htm "The Political Fallacy that Medical Care is a Right."])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cato Institute. [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3057 ''Universal Health Care Won't Work – Witness Medicare.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue in the rights debate is governments' use of legislation to control competition among private medical insurance providers against national [[social insurance]] systems, such as the case in [[Canada's national health insurance program]]. [[Laissez-faire]] supporters argue that this erodes the [[cost-effectiveness]] of the health system, as even those who can afford to pay for private healthcare services drain resources from the public system.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner MD. [http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/08/23/revolt-against-canadian-health-care-system-continues/ ''Revolt Against Canadian Health Care System Continues''.] "Cato-at-liberty" – The Cato Institute, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue here is whether investor-owned medical insurance companies or [[health maintenance organization]]s are in a better position to act in the best interests of their customers compared to government regulation and oversight. Another claim in the United States perceives government over-regulation of the healthcare and insurance industries as the effective end of charitable home visits from doctors among the poor and elderly.&lt;ref name="David E. Kelley"&gt;David E. Kelley, "A Life of One's Own: Individual Rights and the Welfare State." [[Cato Institute]], October 1998, {{ISBN|1-882577-70-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics: healthcare financing===
Many types of health policies exist focusing on the financing of healthcare services to spread the economic risks of ill health. These include [[publicly funded health care]] (through taxation or insurance, also known as single-payer systems), mandatory or voluntary private [[health insurance]], and complete [[rights issue|capitalization]] of personal health care services through private companies, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kereiakes | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Willerson | first2 = J. T. | title = US Health Care: Entitlement or Privilege? | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.0000124795.36864.78 | journal = Circulation | volume = 109 | issue = 12 | pages = 1460–1462 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15051650 | pmc = |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/109/12/1460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/health_financing/en/ ''Health financing policy''.] Geneva. Accessed 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is ongoing on which type of health financing policy results in better or worse quality of healthcare services provided, and how to ensure allocated funds are used effectively, efficiently and [[health equity|equitably]].

There are many arguments on both sides of the issue of public versus private health financing policies:

'''''Claims that publicly funded healthcare improves the quality and efficiency of personal health care delivery:'''''
* Government spending on health is essential for the accessibility and sustainability of healthcare services and programmes.&lt;ref name="LANCET"/&gt;
* For those people who would otherwise go without care due to lack of financial means, any quality care is an improvement.
* Since people perceive universal healthcare as ''free'' (if there is no insurance premium or co-payment), they are more likely to seek [[preventive care]] which may reduce the disease burden and overall healthcare costs in the long run.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
* Single-payer systems reduce wastefulness by removing the middle man, i.e. private insurance companies, thus reducing the amount of bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;William F May. [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=106 "The Ethical Foundations of Health Care Reform."] ''The Christian Century'', June 1–8, 1994, pp. 572–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, reducing the amount of paperwork that medical professionals have to deal with for insurance claims processing allows them to concentrate more on treating [[patient]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

'''''Claims that privately funded healthcare leads to greater quality and efficiencies in personal health care:'''''
* Perceptions that publicly funded healthcare is ''free'' can lead to overuse of medical services, and hence raise overall costs compared to private health financing.&lt;ref&gt;
Heritage Foundation News Release, [http://www.heritage.org/Press/NewsReleases/NR092900.cfm "British, Canadian Experience Shows Folly of Socialized Medicine, Analyst Says."] Sept. 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. Gratzer"&gt;Heritage Foundation News Release,[http://www.heritage.org/Research/HealthCare/hl982.cfm "The Cure: How Capitalism Can Save American Health Care."] December 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Privately funded medicine leads to greater quality and efficiencies through increased access to and reduced waiting times for specialized health care services and technologies.&lt;ref name="Sade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;Goodman, John. [http://www.cato.org/pubs/catosletter/catosletterv3n1.pdf "Five Myths of Socialized Medicine."] Cato Institute: ''Cato's Letter''. Winter, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;Friedmen, David. ''The Machinery of Freedom.'' Arlington House Publishers: New York, 1978. pp. 65–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Limiting the allocation of public funds for personal healthcare does not curtail the ability of uninsured citizens to pay for their healthcare as [[out-of-pocket expenses]]. Public funds can be better rationalized to provide [[emergency care]] services regardless of insured status or ability to pay, such as with the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
* Privately funded and operated healthcare reduces the requirement for governments to increase taxes to cover healthcare costs, which may be compounded by the inefficiencies among government agencies due to their greater bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cato Institute.

== Other health policy options ==
Health policy options extend beyond the financing and delivery of personal health care, to domains such as [[medical research]] and [[health workforce]] planning, both domestically and internationally.

=== Medical research policy ===
[[Medical research]] can be both the basis for defining evidence-based health policy, and the subject of health policy itself, particularly in terms of its sources of funding. Those in favor of government policies for publicly funded medical research posit that removing profit as a motive will increase the rate of medical [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, the recent discovery that dichloroacetate (DCA) can cause regression in several cancers, including lung, breast and brain tumors.[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/01/17/cancer-chemo.html Alberta scientists test chemotherapy alternative Last Updated: Wednesday, January 17, 2007]  The DCA compound is not patented or owned by any pharmaceutical company, and, therefore, would likely be an inexpensive drug to administer, Michelakis added.  The bad news, is that while DCA is not patented, Michelakis is concerned that it may be difficult to find funding from private investors to test DCA in clinical trials.[http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=8153 University of Alberta – Small molecule offers big hope against cancer. January 16, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227080213/http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=8153 |date=February 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those opposed argue that it will do the opposite, because removing the incentive of profit removes incentives to innovate and inhibits new technologies from being developed and utilized.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Miller RL |author2=DK Benjamin |author3=DC North |title=The Economics of Public Issues |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2003 |isbn=0321118731 |edition=13th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of sound medical research does not necessarily lead to evidence-based policymaking. For example, in South Africa, whose population sets the record for [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|HIV infections]], previous government policy limiting funding and access for AIDS treatments met with strong controversy given its basis on a refusal to accept scientific evidence on the means of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826742.stm "Controversy dogs Aids forum."] ''BBC News'', 10 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A change of government eventually led to a change in policy, with new policies implemented for widespread access to HIV services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/aidssouthafrica.htm "HIV and AIDS in South Africa."] ''Avert''. Accessed 23 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue relates to [[intellectual property]], as illustrated by the case of Brazil, where debates have arisen over government policy authorizing the domestic manufacture of [[antiretroviral drug]]s used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS in violation of [[HIV/AIDS in Brazil#Drug patents|drug patents]].

=== Health workforce policy ===
{{Main|Health workforce}}
Some countries and jurisdictions have an explicit policy or strategy to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] to meet healthcare goals, such as to address [[physician supply|physician]] and [[nursing shortage]]s. Elsewhere, workforce planning is distributed among labour market participants as a [[laissez-faire]] approach to health policy. Evidence-based policies for workforce development are typically based on findings from [[health services research]].

=== Health in foreign policy ===
Many governments and agencies include a health dimension in their [[foreign policy]] in order to achieve [[global health]] goals. Promoting health in lower income countries has been seen as instrumental to achieve other goals on the global agenda, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kickbusch | first1 = I. | doi = 10.1136/bmj.d3154 | title = Global health diplomacy: How foreign policy can influence health | journal = BMJ | volume = 342 | pages = d3154 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21665931 | pmc = |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21665931}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promoting [[global security]] – linked to fears of global [[pandemic]]s, the intentional spread of [[pathogen]]s, and a potential increase in humanitarian conflicts, natural disasters, and emergencies;
* Promoting [[economic development]] – including addressing the economic effect of poor health on development, of pandemic outbreaks on the global market place, and also the gain from the growing global market in health goods and services;
* Promoting [[social justice]] – reinforcing health as a social value and human right, including supporting the United Nations' [[Millennium Development Goals]].

=== Global health policy ===
Global health policy encompasses the global governance structures that create the policies underlying public health throughout the world. In addressing [[global health]], global health policy "implies consideration of the health needs of the people of the whole planet above the concerns of particular nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = T.

'''''Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha''''', 462 U.S. 919 (1983), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case ruling in 1983 that the one-house [[legislative veto]] violated the constitutional [[separation of powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha|462|919|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Section 244(a)(1) of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]], {{USCSub|8|1254|a|1}}, authorized the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS) to suspend deportation of an alien continually residing in the United States for at least seven years where the [[U.S. Attorney General]], in his discretion, found that deportation would result in "extreme hardship." After making such a finding, the Attorney General would transmit a report to Congress pursuant to § 244(c)(1) and either house of Congress had the power to veto the Attorney General's determination pursuant to § 244(c)(2).

===Facts===
Respondent Jagdish Rai Chadha was born in the [[Kenya Colony|British colony of Kenya]] to Indian parents. Chadha was a [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] and entered the United States on a [[British passport]] when studying in Ohio as a [[foreign exchange student]]. After Kenya's declaration of independence from Britain in 1963 he was not recognized as a legitimate citizen or resident of Kenya (as his parents were Indian) or India (as he was born in Kenya). Furthermore, his [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode in the United Kingdom]] was stripped under the [[Immigration Act 1971]] due to his lack of connection with the United Kingdom. After his non-immigrant student visa expired in 1972, none of the three countries would accept him onto their territory, effectively making him ''[[de facto]]'' [[Statelessness|stateless]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Lena|title=Faces Behind Famous Cases|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/19/garden/faces-behind-famous-cases.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=26 April 2017|work=The New York Times|date=19 June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The INS initiated [[deportation]] proceedings against Chadha. Chadha sought to suspend his deportation, and the INS accommodated his request according to § 244(a)(1), and transmitted a report of the suspension to Congress according to § 244(c)(2). The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] vetoed the suspension of Chadha's deportation, and the INS resumed deportation proceedings. Chadha raised constitutional objections to § 244(c)(2), but the immigration judge found he lacked any authority to rule on such claims and ordered Chadha deported. Chadha then appealed to the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]], which also found it lacked any authority to consider constitutional objections to § 244(c)(2). Chadha appealed to the [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] for review of the deportation order, and the INS supported his challenge to the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2). The Ninth Circuit found § 244(c)(2) unconstitutional and ordered the [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] to suspend deportation proceedings. The INS appealed the Ninth Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court in order to obtain a final judgment on the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2).

The House and Senate, as ''[[amici curiae]]'', argued that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the resolution of the House of Representatives vetoing the Attorney General's determination was constitutionally invalid. It asked the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] to reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision.

Congress argued that: (1) Chadha lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2) because that section is not severable from § 244(a)(1). Therefore, if Chadha were to succeed in invalidating § 244(c)(2), his means of remedy in § 244(a)(1) would also be destroyed, and there would be no relief possible; (2) the Court did not have jurisdiction over the issue because the Attorney General and INS enforced the challenged statute and thereby effectively waived their right to challenge it; (3) the action was not a genuine [[case or controversy]], as both the original plaintiff and defendant challenged the statute without real opposition; (4) the action was a non-justiciable [[political question]].

==Holding==
The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' judgment. In an opinion by [[Warren Burger|Chief Justice Burger]], the Court held that the resolution of the House of Representatives vetoing the Attorney General's determination was constitutionally invalid, unenforceable, and not binding. Congress may not promulgate a statute granting to itself a [[legislative veto]] over actions of the executive branch inconsistent with the [[bicameralism]] principle and [[Presentment Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].

The Court rebutted Congress's assertions as follows: (1) § 244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is severable from the rest of the act pursuant to the express severability clause § 406. The legislative history of § 244 supports the proposition that Congress, frustrated with the process of passing [[private bill|private law]]s to provide relief for deportable individuals, would likely not have been willing to retain the private law mechanism rather than ceding all power to the Attorney General. (2) The Attorney General and INS did not waive their right to challenge the constitutionality of the statute by enforcing the statute. (3) The action is a genuine case with adequate representation in favor of sustaining the act provided by the houses of Congress as ''amici curiae''. (4) The case is a judicable question, not exempted by the political question doctrine; the constitutionality of a statute is a question for the courts.

The Court then presented its affirmative reasoning: (5) When the Constitution provides express procedures, such procedures must be strictly observed. Two such provisions are bicameralism and presentment in the enactment of law. (6) The presentment process—especially the President's veto power—was intended by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers]] to provide a mechanism by which the executive branch could defend itself against legislative encroachment and could prevent ill-conceived policies. (7) Similarly, the bicameralism requirement was formulated in order to hinder congressional action and thereby prevent legislative encroachment. (8) The action of the House of Representatives is legislative in nature because (a) it modifies rights and duties of individuals outside the legislative branch; (b) the enactment would otherwise have required a private law, which is a legislative function; and (c) the nature of the action is inherently legislative. (9) When the Framers intended to authorize Congress to exercise power outside of the bicameral and presentment principles, it provided alternate procedures explicitly; other procedures cannot be admitted. (10) Because the action of the House of Representatives was legislative, but did not conform to the mode of action specifically stated by the Constitution for legislative action; it is therefore invalid, unenforceable, and not binding.

===Concurrence===
[[Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr.|Justice Powell]], in a concurring opinion, argued that to invalidate all legislative veto provisions is a serious matter, as Congress views the legislative veto as essential to controlling the executive branch, and should therefore be undertaken with caution. However, Congress's action in this case is nonetheless unconstitutional. Contrary to the views of the majority, Congress's action is not legislative in character but adjudicative, and it therefore violates the principle (called the [[anti-aggrandizement principle]]) that Congress may not expand its own power into the areas of competence of the other branches. The Constitution specifically attempted to prevent this form of aggrandizement in the [[Bill of Attainder]] Clause, [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Art. I]], § 9, cl. 3, which prohibits Congress from undertaking legislative trials that lack the safeguards and accountability of judicial trials. For a house of Congress to force the deportation of Chadha would amount to such a legislative trial.

===Dissents===
[[Byron White|Justice White]], dissenting, argued that (1) the legislative veto power is absolutely necessary to modern government, as exemplified by the legislative veto powers granted in the [[War Powers Act of 1973]]. (2) The absence of constitutional provisions for alternate methods of action does not imply their prohibition by the Constitution, and the Court has consistently read the Constitution to respond to contemporary needs with flexibility. (3) The legislative veto power does not involve the ability of Congress to enact new legislation without bicameral consensus or presentation to the [[President of the United States|president]], but instead involves the ability of Congress to veto suggestions by the executive, a power that both houses of Congress already possess. (4) The Court has allowed Congress to delegate authority to executive agencies; lawmaking does not always require bicameralism or presentation. (5) The bicameralism and presentation provisions of the Constitution serve to ensure that no departure from the status quo takes place without consensus from both houses of Congress and the President or by a super-majority vote of both houses of Congress. In this case, the deportation of Chadha is the ''[[status quo]]'' situation, and the veto by House of Representatives of an alternative suggestion of the executive branch is reasonable given the purposes of bicameralism and the Presentment Clause.

[[William H. Rehnquist|Justice Rehnquist]], in a dissent joined by White, argued that it is unlikely that Congress would have promulgated § 244(a)(1) without the corresponding provisions of §§ 244(c)(1–2). Therefore, the provisions are not severable from one another, and holding one unconstitutional requires invalidating the other.

==Aftermath==

Chadha became a citizen of the United States and was living in Albany, California, as of October 2015.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

Legislative vetoes continued to be enacted after ''Chadha'', although various presidents have issued executive [[signing statement]]s disclaiming the unconstitutional legislative veto provisions. The consultation provisions of the [[War Powers Resolution|War Powers Act]], for example, while contested by every president since [[Richard M. Nixon]], are usually grudgingly obeyed. Other processes, such as [[Fast track (trade)|fast-track legislation]], have taken the place of the legislative veto and achieved the same effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Processes of Constitutional Decisionmaking: Cases and Materials |last=Brest |first=Paul |author2=Sanford Levinson |author3=Jack M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1256">The '''inherent bad faith model''' of [[information processing]] is a theory in [[political psychology]] that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between [[John Foster Dulles]]' beliefs and his model of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;The “Inherent Bad Faith Model” Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger, Douglas Stuart and Harvey Starr, Political Psychology, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3791139]&lt;/ref&gt;

They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness.  An example is [[John Foster Dulles]]' position regarding the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="IBFMR"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquiry was announced in 2009 by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] and published in 2016 with a public statement by Chilcot.

On 6 July 2016, Sir John Chilcot announced the report's publication, more than seven years after the inquiry was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Iraq Inquiry: Chilcot report to be published on 6 July |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36251346 |publisher=BBC News |date=9 May 2016 |access-date=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually referred to as the  '''Chilcot report''' by the news media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36721645 |title=Chilcot report: Findings at-a-glance |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=7 July 2016 |website=BBC |publisher=BBC |access-date=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the document stated that at the time of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003, [[Saddam Hussein]] did not pose an urgent threat to British interests, that intelligence regarding [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] was presented with unwarranted certainty, that peaceful alternatives to war had not been exhausted, that the United Kingdom and the United States had undermined the authority of the [[United Nations Security Council]], that the process of identifying the legal basis was "far from satisfactory", and that a war was unnecessary.&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-crushing-verdict-tony-blair-iraq-war|title=Chilcot delivers crushing verdict on Blair and the Iraq war |author=Luke Harding|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TelegraphReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/06/chilcot-inquiry-judgement-day-for-tony-blair-as-iraq-war-report/|title=Chilcot report: 2003 Iraq war was 'unnecessary', invasion was not 'last resort' and Saddam Hussein was 'no imminent threat'|author=Leon Watson|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|newspaper=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sands" &gt;[[Philippe Sands]],  [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n15/philippe-sands/a-grand-and-disastrous-deceit ''A Grand and Disastrous Deceit,''] [[London Review of Books]] Vol. 38 No. 15,28 July 2016 pp.9-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was made available under an [[Open Government Licence]].

==Build-up==
It was initially announced by Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] that the Iraq Inquiry would be held [[in camera]], excluding the public and press. However, the decision was later deferred to Sir [[John Chilcot]], the inquiry chairman, who said that it was "essential to hold as much of the proceedings of the inquiry as possible in public".&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2009/06/hold-public-inquiry-iraq|title=Chilcot calls for public Iraq inquiry|date=23 June 2009|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tele 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/5604841/Large-parts-of-Iraq-inquiry-to-be-heard-in-public.html|title=Large parts of Iraq inquiry to be heard in public|last=Whitehead|first=Tom|date=23 June 2009|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=15 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, when the inquiry commenced, it was announced that the committee would be able to request any British document and call any British citizen to give evidence.&lt;ref name="BBC 30/7"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8176698.stm|title=Will Iraq probe worry ministers?|last=Chakrabarti |first=Reeta|date=30 July 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the week before the inquiry began hearing witnesses, a series of documents including military reports were leaked to a newspaper which appeared to show poor post-war planning and lack of provisions.&lt;ref name="Tele 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/6625415/Iraq-report-Secret-papers-reveal-blunders-and-concealment.html|title=Iraq report: Secret papers reveal blunders and concealment|last=Gilligan|first=Andrew |date=21 November 2009|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]]|accessdate=15 February 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The inquiry was pursued by a committee of [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellors]] with broad [[terms of reference]] to consider Britain's involvement in Iraq between 2001 and 2009. It covered [[Lead-up to the Iraq War|the run-up to the conflict]], [[Operation Telic|the subsequent military action]] and [[Aftermath of the Iraq War|its aftermath]] to establish how decisions were made, to determine what happened and to identify lessons to ensure that, in a similar situation in future, the British government is equipped to respond in the most effective manner in the best interests of the country.&lt;ref name=BBC6&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7312757.stm |title=The key points of the Iraq war inquiry explained |publisher=BBC News |date=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The open sessions of the inquiry commenced on 24 November 2009 and concluded on 2 February 2011.

In 2012, the government vetoed the release to the inquiry of documents detailing minutes of Cabinet meetings in the days leading up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. Concurrently, the [[Foreign Office]] successfully appealed against a judge's ruling and blocked the disclosure of extracts of a conversation between [[George W. Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] days before the invasion. The government stated that revealing this conversation would present a "significant danger" to [[United Kingdom–United States relations|British–American relations]].&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;John Kampfner, ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 3 August 2012, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2182924/Chilcot-inquiry-Hypocrisy-insidious-culture-secrecy.html Hypocrisy and this insidious culture of secrecy]&lt;/ref&gt; The million-word report of the inquiry was due to be released to the public by 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/10191047/Foreign-Office-braced-for-criticism-in-Chilcot-report-over-its-record-keeping-around-Iraq-War.html|title=Foreign Office braced for criticism in Chilcot report over its record-keeping around Iraq War|date=27 July 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=27 January 2013|location=London|first=Christopher|last=Hope}}&lt;/ref&gt; but difficult negotiations were continuing with the United States over the publication of documents.&lt;ref&gt;James Cusick, ''[[The Independent]]'', 13 November 2011, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-us-blocks-publication-of-chilcots-report-on-how-britain-went-to-war-with-iraq-8937772.html Exclusive: US blocks publication of Chilcot's report on how Britain went to war with Iraq ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lord-in-waiting]] [[William Wallace, Baron Wallace of Saltaire|Lord Wallace of Saltaire]] said on behalf of the government that it would be "inappropriate" to publish the report in the months leading up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|next general election]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=BBCNov314&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29884094|title=Iraq Inquiry set to cost taxpayers £10m|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=3 November 2014|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, it transpired that the Report would in any event be further delayed, possibly into 2016, due to the legal requirement of "[[Maxwellisation]]", allowing any person who is to be criticised a fair opportunity to comment on a draft prior to finalisation and publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/iraq-war-chilcot-inquiry-sir-john-chilcot-a6969046.html|title=Iraq War: MPs launch investigation into legislation which delayed Chilcot Inquiry|author=Matt Broomfield|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|newspaper=Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilcot wrote a letter to [[David Cameron]] in October 2015, announcing that the text could be complete by April 2016, and furthermore proposed a release date of June or July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/55941/2015-10-28%20Chilcot%20to%20Cameron.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119144405/http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/55941/2015-10-28%20Chilcot%20to%20Cameron.pdf |archivedate=19 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings==
When the inquiry was announced on 15 June 2009 by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]], it was initially announced that proceedings would take place in private, a decision which was subsequently reversed after receiving criticism in the media and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8100432.stm Iraq war inquiry to be in private] BBC News, 15 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AlJ1&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2009/06/200961514301331360.html UK PM announces Iraq war inquiry] [[Al Jazeera]], 15 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/22/iraq-war-inquiry |title=Public Iraq war inquiry 'essential', says chairman |publisher=The Guardian |date= 22 June 2009|accessdate=24 November 2009| first=Haroon | last=Siddique |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquiry commenced in July 2009, with public hearings commencing on 24 November 2009 with [[Peter Ricketts]], chairman of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] at the time of the invasion of Iraq, as the first witness. Opening the proceedings, Sir John Chilcot announced that the inquiry was not seeking to apportion blame but that it would "get to the heart of what happened" and would not "shy away" from making criticism where it was justified.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 25/11"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/6645689/Iraq-Inquiry-British-officials-discussed-regime-change-two-years-before-war.html|title=Iraq Inquiry: British officials discussed regime change two years before war|date=25 November 2009|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=12 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission resumed its hearings in January 2011 with the former prime minister, [[Tony Blair]] as its prime witness.

==Witnesses==
{{main|List of witnesses of the Iraq Inquiry}}
The inquiry heard evidence from a variety of witnesses, such as politicians, including several cabinet ministers at the time of the invasion; senior civil servants, including lawyers and intelligence chiefs; diplomats, mostly composed of British ambassadors to Iraq and the United States; and high-ranking military officers including former Chiefs of the General Staff and Chiefs of the Defence Staff as well as senior operational commanders.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 25/11"/&gt;

The inquiry heard mostly from civil servants, intelligence and security officials, diplomats and military officers from the first public hearings up until it recessed for Christmas. Key witnesses included [[Christopher Meyer|Sir Christopher Meyer]], former ambassador to the United States; [[Michael Boyce, Baron Boyce|Admiral Lord Boyce]], former [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]]; [[John Scarlett|Sir John Scarlett]], Chief of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]]; [[Tim Cross|Major-General Tim Cross]], the most senior British officer on the ground in the aftermath of the invasion; and [[Brian Burridge|Air Chief Marshal Sir Brian Burridge]], overall commander of British forces in the invasion.

Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] was publicly questioned by the enquiry on 29 January 2010, and again on 21 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/hearings/timetable.aspx |title=Iraq Inquiry - Hearings - Timetable |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002113/http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/hearings/timetable.aspx |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On both of these occasions protests took place outside the conference centre.&lt;ref name="Tele 3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/8274202/Chilcot-Inquiry-Tony-Blair-heckled-as-he-expresses-regret-for-this-loss-of-life-in-the-Iraq-war.html|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=19 June 2011|location=London|first=Rosa|last=Prince|title=Chilcot Inquiry: Tony Blair heckled as he expresses regret for this loss of life in the Iraq war|date=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of widespread public interest in Blair's evidence, public access to the hearings had to be allocated by lottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/news/20101208-ballot.aspx |title=Public Ballot: Application to Attend the Public Hearing of Rt Hon Tony Blair |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506235431/http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/news/20101208-ballot.aspx |archivedate=6 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special dispensations to attend were allocated to those whose close family were casualties of the war, some of whom shouted angry accusations at Blair during his second appearance.&lt;ref name="Tele 3"/&gt;

From the inquiry's resumption in January 2010, it heard predominantly from politicians and former government officials, including [[Alastair Campbell]], Tony Blair's director of communications and on 2 February 2010, then-[[Secretary of State for International Development]] [[Clare Short]], when she repeatedly criticised Blair, Attorney General [[Peter Goldsmith]] and others in the UK Government for what she maintained was deceiving her and other MPs in an attempt to obtain consent for the invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/02/clare-short-warned-tony-blair Clare Short: Tony Blair lied and misled parliament in build-up to Iraq war], ''[[The Guardian]], James Sturcke,2 February 2010. Retrieved 7 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Brown]] had to retract his claim that spending on defence rose every year during the Iraq war, as this was found not to have been the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8573664.stm Brown misled Iraq inquiry over defence budget - Cameron] BBC News, 17 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a recess to avoid influencing the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election]], the inquiry resumed public hearings on 29 June 2010. The first witness was [[Douglas Brand]], chief police adviser to the Iraqi Interior Ministry from 2003 to 2005.&lt;ref name="BBC IV"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/politics/10437254.stm|title=Iraq inquiry told of post-war police training errors|date=29 June 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final witness in the public hearings, heard on 2 February 2011, was [[Jack Straw]], Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006.&lt;ref name="BBC-evidencetimeline"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12224606|title=Iraq inquiry - day by day timeline of evidence given|date=2 February 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==

The Inquiry's final report was published on 6 July 2016. Comprising 2.6 million words in 12 volumes, plus an [[executive summary]], a physical copy was priced at [[Pound sterling|£]]767. Bereaved families received a free copy.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36442521 | title=Chilcot Inquiry: Hard copy of Iraq inquiry report provided free to bereaved families | accessdate=9 July 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also published online. It was longer than the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]], the Complete Works of [[William Shakespeare]], and Tolstoy's [[War and Peace]] put together.

The report was made available under the [[Open Government Licence]] v3.0, although this excluded material supplied by third parties.

==Findings==
The report – described by [[BBC News]] as "damning",&lt;ref name="BBCCrystal"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36724704|title=Crystal clear, polite - but damning|author=Laura Kuenssberg |date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a "crushing verdict",&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt; and by ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' as "scathing"&lt;ref name="TelegraphReport"/&gt; – was broadly critical of the actions of the British government and military in making the case for the war, in tactics and in planning for the [[aftermath of the Iraq War]].&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TelegraphReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36721645|title=Chilcot report: Findings at a glance|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Norton-Taylor]] of ''The Guardian'' wrote that the report "could hardly be more damning" of [[Tony Blair]] and "was an unprecedented, devastating indictment of how a prime minister was allowed to make decisions by discarding all pretence at cabinet government, subverting the intelligence agencies, and making exaggerated claims about threats to Britain's national security".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Norton-Taylor, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/chilcot-indictment-of-tony-blair-could-hardly-have-been-more-serious Chilcot's indictment of Tony Blair could hardly be more damning], ''Guardian'' (6 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case for war was deficient===
The report found that in the [[lead-up to the Iraq War|run-up to the war]], peaceful diplomatic options to avoid instability and [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] proliferation had not been exhausted, and that the war was therefore "not a last resort".&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt; Intervention might have become necessary later, but at the time of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003, [[Saddam Hussein]] did not pose an immediate threat and the majority of the [[UN Security Council]] supported the continuation of UN weapons inspections and monitoring.&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt;

The report does not question Blair's personal belief that there was a case for war, only the way he presented the evidence that he had.&lt;ref name="IndependentReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-inquiry-tony-blair-iraq-war-weapons-of-mass-destruction-evidence-verdict-a7122361.html|title=Chilcot report: Blair didn't tell truth about WMDs, the deal with Bush or the warnings of fallout – how Britain went to war in Iraq|author=Andy McSmith, Charlie Cooper|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report cleared the [[10 Downing Street#Prime Minister.27s Office|Prime Minister's Office]] of influencing the [[Iraq Dossier]] (the "Dodgy Dossier"), which contained the claim that Iraq possessed the ability to launch WMD within 45 minutes, and instead laid the blame for the weaknesses in its evidence on the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-intelligence-was-exaggerated-and-omitted-to-justify-iraq-war-inquiry-finds-a7122481.html|title=Chilcot report: Intelligence on WMDs exaggerated to justify going to war, inquiry finds|author=Kim Sengupta|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehall had early sight of the report and sources say that some lessons are already being applied.

More specifically, the report blamed [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (better known as MI6) head [[Sir Richard Dearlove]] who presented so-called "hot" intelligence about alleged weapons of mass destruction provided by an Iraqi with "phenomenal access" to high levels in the Iraqi government directly to Blair, without first confirming its accuracy.&lt;ref name="Rawnsley"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rawnsley |first=Andrew |date=10 July 2016 |title=Ten things that Chilcot's verdict reveals about Tony Blair and the Iraq war  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/09/ten-things-chilcot-reveals-about-tony-blair-and-iraq |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |access-date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigators found that references to this intelligence in government reports were over-certain and did not adequately stress uncertainties and nuance. The informant was later found to have been lying. The Chilcot report states that "personal intervention [by Dearlove] and its urgency gave added weight to a report that had not been properly evaluated and would have coloured the perception of ministers and senior officials".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36737922 |title=Chilcot report: The flawed chain of intelligence that led to war |last=Taylor |first=Peter |date=7 July 2016 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the report was published, Blair conceded that he should have challenged such intelligence reports before relying on them to justify military action in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Rawnsley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tony-blair-chilcot-report-iraq-war-intelligence-wmds-inquiry-finds-bbc-radio-4-today-a7124506.html |title=Tony Blair admits he should have challenged intelligence that led to Iraq War |last=Cooper |first=Charlie |date=7 July 2016 |website=The Independent |publisher=The Independent |access-date=10 July 2016 |quote=Former Prime Minister again defends decision and insists it was taken 'out of good motives'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some MI6 staff had also expressed concerns about the quality of its source – in particular, noting that an inaccurate detail about storing chemical weapons in glass containers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kim |first=Sengupta |date=7 July 2016 |title=Chilcot report: MI6 may have got crucial intelligence on Iraq WMDs from a Nicolas Cage film |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-iraq-war-inquiry-wmds-mi6-evidence-tony-blair-richard-dearlove-a7124426.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London, UK |access-date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared to have been taken from [[Michael Bay]]'s film ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' – and expressed doubts about its reliability. Nonetheless, Foreign Secretary [[Jack Straw]] asked MI6 to use the source to provide "silver bullet intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/movie-plot-the-rock-inspired-mi6-sources-iraqi-weapons-claim-chilcot-report|title=The Rock movie plot 'may have inspired MI6 source's Iraqi weapons claim'|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016|author=Peter Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal basis for war was far from satisfactory===
The inquiry was not about the legality of military action and could not rule on this as it was not an internationally recognised court. However, the report did criticise the process by which the government investigated the legal basis for the war, finding it "far from satisfactory".&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt; [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]], the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], should have provided a detailed written report to Cabinet, but was instead asked to provide oral evidence without extensive questioning, and he did not explain what the basis would be for deciding whether Iraq had violated [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441]].&lt;ref name="prosecuted"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/06/iraq-war-inquiry-chilcot-tony-blair-prosecute|title=The Iraq war inquiry has left the door open for Tony Blair to be prosecuted|author=Joshua Rozenberg|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldsmith's advice changed between January 2003 – when he said that a second resolution was necessary – and March 2003 – when he said that Resolution 1441 was sufficient – and the report describes pressure being applied by the Prime Minister's Office to get Goldsmith to revise his opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b1d19340-439b-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d.html#axzz4Dil94DE7|title=Chilcot report: The government hid the legal case from view|author=[[David Allen Green]]|newspaper=Financial Times|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2016/07/06/lord-goldsmith-qc-named-as-chilcot-report-finds-legal-basis-for-iraq-invasion-far-from-satisfactory/?slreturn=20160607072043|title=Lord Goldsmith QC named as Chilcot report finds legal basis for Iraq invasion 'far from satisfactory'|author=Francis Ivens|newspaper=Legal Week|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By ultimately going to war without a [[United Nations Security Council resolution|Security Council resolution]], the UK was "undermining the Security Council's authority".&lt;ref name="NYTimesReport"/&gt;

===UK overestimated ability to influence US decisions on Iraq===
The report found that Blair had attempted to persuade Bush of the need to seek support from the UN, European allies and Arab states, but that he "overestimated his ability to influence US decisions on Iraq".&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt; The report accused Blair personally of being too conciliatory towards the US, saying: "Despite concerns about the state of US planning, he did not make an agreement on a satisfactory post-conflict plan a condition of UK participation in military action",&lt;ref name="NYTimesReport"/&gt; and drew attention to a sentence from a private memo from Blair to Bush which read "I will be with you whatever".&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt; Contrary to Tony Blair's claims, Chilcot found that the [[Special Relationship]] did not require unquestioning agreement between the UK and the US, and the report identified several previous occasions where one country had gone to war without the other without long-term damage to diplomatic relations, including the [[Vietnam War]] and [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt;

===War preparation and planning was "wholly inadequate"===
The report found that British planning for a post-[[Ba'athist Iraq]] was "wholly inadequate" and that the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) left UK forces in Iraq without any adequate equipment or a plan.&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Equipment"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/mod-left-uk-forces-in-iraq-ill-equipped-amid-lack-of-plan-chilcot-report-says|title=MoD left UK forces in Iraq lacking equipment and a plan, Chilcot says |author=Nick Hopkins|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that there was no ministerial oversight of post-conflict strategy.&lt;ref name="prosecuted"/&gt;

Initial planning for the war assumed an invasion from the north, but Turkey refused permission for UK troops to cross its border.&lt;ref name="Equipment"/&gt; Plans were therefore completely rewritten two months before the war began with insufficient time to assess the dangers or prepare the brigades.&lt;ref name="Equipment"/&gt;

Soldiers were not issued with key equipment, and there were shortfalls in the provision of helicopters, armoured vehicles and in reconnaissance and intelligence assets.&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt; In addition, the MoD was slow to respond to the threat of [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs).&lt;ref name="NYTimesReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/world/europe/chilcot-report.html|title=Chilcot Report on Iraq War Offers Devastating Critique of Tony Blair|author=Steven Erlanger and Stephen Castle|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although military officials presented several concerns about the risks of the war, the report found that this was not taken into account in planning. "The risks of internal strife in Iraq, active Iranian pursuit of its interests, regional instability and Al Qaeda activity in Iraq were each explicitly identified before the invasion".&lt;ref name="NYTimesReport"/&gt; A "can-do" attitude among military officials also led them to downplay dangers and setbacks during briefings.&lt;ref name="NYTimesReport"/&gt;

The report also described the situation in the city of [[Basra]], where British forces were forced to make a deal with insurgents to end attacks on British troops, as "humiliating".&lt;ref name="Equipment"/&gt;

===Military action did not achieve its goals===
According to the report, British military action did not achieve its goals,&lt;ref name="BBCReport"/&gt; and [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Baghdad and south-east Iraq destabilised rapidly in the wake of the invasion]].&lt;ref name="GuardianReport"/&gt;

At the time, the UK was also involved in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|War in Afghanistan]] and military commanders felt that there was more potential for success there, which meant that equipment, manpower and the attention of commanders were diverted from Iraq in the later stages of the war, exacerbating difficulties.&lt;ref name="Equipment"/&gt;

==Reactions and analysis==
In a statement to the House of Commons the afternoon after the inquiry's report was released, the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] refused to say whether the Iraq War was "a mistake" or "wrong" and rejected calls for an apology to be issued on behalf of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] for its role in the lead-up to the war. Cameron said that he did not see "a huge amount of point" in "replaying all the arguments of the day" and said that focus should instead be on learning "the lessons of what happened and what needs to be put in place to make sure that mistakes cannot be made in future".&lt;ref&gt;Jon Stone, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-iraq-war-chilcot-report-response-apology-refuses-live-latest-updates-a7122886.html David Cameron refuses to say the Iraq War was 'wrong' or 'a mistake' following damning Chilcot Report], ''The Independent'' (7 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, [[Spokesperson for the United States Department of State|US State Department spokesperson]] [[John Kirby (admiral)|John Kirby]] stated in the daily [[White House]] press briefing that the US would not respond to the report and that reporters should direct their questions to British officials instead, explaining that their focus was now on Syria rather than a decision made 13 years prior: "... we're not going to make a judgment one way or the other about this report, and I'll let British officials speak to the degree to which they intend to derive lessons learned from it. That's really, again, for them to talk to. We're not going to go through it, we're not going to examine it, we're not going to try to do an analysis of it or make a judgment of the findings one way or the other. Our focus, again, is on the challenges we have in Iraq and Syria right now, and that's where our focus is".&lt;ref&gt;[http://state.gov/md259402.htm#UK Daily Press Briefing - July 6 2016], ''[[United States Department of State]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/06/chilcot-report-how-the-world-reacted/ Chilcot report - how the world reacted: 'A very British masterclass in quiet, restrained but devastating critique'], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the report was issued, [[Jeremy Corbyn]], the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|leader of the opposition]] and [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|leader of the Labour Party]] - who had voted against military action - gave a speech in Westminster stating: "I now apologise sincerely on behalf of my party for the disastrous decision to go to war in Iraq in March 2003" which he called an "act of military aggression launched on a false pretext" something that has "long been regarded as illegal by the overwhelming weight of international opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36733979 |title=Tony Blair says world is better as a result of Iraq War |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=7 July 2016 |website=BBC |publisher=BBC |access-date=7 July 2016 |quote=He said the report proved the Iraq War had been an "act of military aggression launched on a false pretext", something he said which has "long been regarded as illegal by the overwhelming weight of international opinion"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbyn specifically apologised to "the people of Iraq"; to the families of British soldiers who died in Iraq or returned injured; and to "the millions of British citizens who feel our democracy was traduced and undermined by the way in which the decision to go to war was taken on".&lt;ref name="Corbyn"&gt;Andrew Grice, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-chilcot-report-iraq-war-inquiry-apology-tony-blair-labour-party-a7123461.html Jeremy Corbyn apologises on behalf of Labour for 'disastrous decision' to join Iraq War], ''The Independent'' (6 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement by [[Alex Salmond]] released after the inquiry's report was issued, the [[Scottish National Party]] said: "After such carnage, people will ask inevitable questions of was conflict inevitable and worthwhile? The answer from Chilcot is undoubtedly no. And who is responsible? The answer is undoubtedly Tony Blair. There must now be a consideration of what political or legal consequences are appropriate for those responsible".&lt;ref&gt;Siobhan Fenton, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-alex-salmond-tony-blair-legal-action-iraq-war-inquiry-a7122626.html Chilcot report: Alex Salmond calls for legal action against Tony Blair], ''The Independent'' (6 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Salmond, [http://www.snp.org/snp_statement_on_the_chilcot_report SNP statement on the Chilcot Report], Scottish National Party (July 6, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the inquiry's report was issued, [[Tony Blair]] acknowledged that the report made "real and material criticisms of preparation, planning, process and of the relationship with the United States" but cited sections of the report that he said "should lay to rest allegations of bad faith, lies or deceit". He stated: "whether people agree or disagree with my decision to take military action against Saddam Hussein, I took it in good faith and in what I believed to be the best interests of the country. ... I will take full responsibility for any mistakes without exception or excuse. I will at the same time say why, nonetheless, I believe that it was better to remove Saddam Hussein and why I do not believe this is the cause of the terrorism we see today whether in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-tony-blair-findings-lie-iraq-war-saddam-hussein-dodgy-dossier-inquiry-latest-a7122611.html Chilcot report: Tony Blair claims findings show he did not lie over Iraq War], ''The Independent'' (6 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonyblairoffice.org/news/entry/statement-from-tony-blair-on-chilcot-report/ Statement from Tony Blair on Chilcot Report], Office of Tony Blair (6 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of the report, [[John Prescott]], who was the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] at the time of the Iraq War, said that the war was illegal.&lt;ref name="Prescott"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36756878 |title=John Prescott: Ex-deputy PM says Iraq War was illegal |accessdate=10 July 2016| work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported, 'Every previous inquiry into Britain's decision to invade Iraq has swiftly been condemned by the public as a "whitewash".  Such a description hardly applies to the monumental inquest that has been published by Sir John Chilcot. ... After [[Hutton inquiry|Lord Hutton's report in 2003]] and the [[Butler Review|Butler report]] the following year, the one thing Sir John could not have afforded to produce was another report that was dismissed as a whitewash.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blitz|first1=James|title=Chilcot has ended 'whitewash' reports on Iraq war|url=https://www.ft.com/content/42987ccc-4374-11e6-9b66-0712b3873ae1|accessdate=2016-11-17|publisher=Financial Times|date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of deceit===

Political commentators were split as to what extent the report showed that Tony Blair had lied or deliberately misled Parliament and the public. [[NBC News]] said that the report "stops short of saying Blair lied",&lt;ref name="NBCReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chilcot-report-iraq-war-released-stops-short-saying-blair-lied-n604461|title=Chilcot Report on Iraq War Is Released, Stops Short of Saying Blair Lied|authors=Alexander Smith, Bill Neely|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016|publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; the chief political commentator for the ''[[Financial Times]]'', [[Philip Stephens (journalist)|Philip Stephens]], said that Blair's "sin was one of certitude rather than deceit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8da14dcc-438b-11e6-9b66-0712b3873ae1.html#axzz4DiJF24oF|title=Chilcot report exposes Tony Blair's sin of certitude|author=Philip Stephens|date=7 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writing for [[Bloomberg View]], [[Eli Lake]] said that the report proved Blair "didn't lie his way into Iraq".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-06/blair-didn-t-lie-his-way-into-iraq-neither-did-bush|title=Blair Didn't Lie His Way Into Iraq.

==Criticism==
The timing and nature of the inquiry&amp;mdash;and particularly the fact that it would not issue its report until after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]&amp;mdash;generated political controversy.&lt;ref name="Tele 1"/&gt; [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[David Cameron]] dismissed the inquiry as "an [[The Establishment|establishment]] stitch-up", and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] threatened a boycott.&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8102203.stm Anger over 'secret Iraq inquiry'] BBC News, 16 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In a parliamentary debate over the establishment of the inquiry, [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] from all the major parties criticised the government's selection of its members. MPs drew attention to the absence of anyone with first-hand military expertise, the absence of members with acknowledged or proven inquisitorial skills, and the absence of any elected representatives. Several MPs drew attention to the fact that Chilcot would be unable to receive evidence under oath.&lt;ref name=TWFY1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2009-06-24c.800.1#g808.1|date=24 June 2009|title=Iraq Inquiry|publisher=They Work For You}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert's appointment to the enquiry was criticised on the basis that he had once compared Bush and Blair to Roosevelt and Churchill.&lt;ref name=Observer1/&gt;

The criticism by the Liberal Democrats continued with the start of public hearings, with party leader [[Nick Clegg]] accusing the government of "suffocating" the inquiry, referring to the power given to government departments to veto sections of the final report. Meanwhile, a group of anti-war protestors staged a demonstration outside the conference centre.&lt;ref name="Times 25/11"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6931594.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000|title=Gordon Brown accused of suffocating the Chilcot Iraq Inquiry|date=25 November 2009|work=Times Online|publisher=[[Times Newspapers Ltd]]|accessdate=12 February 2010|location=London|first1=Anushka|last1=Asthana|author-link1=Anushka Asthana|first2=Jill|last2=Sherman|last3=Hines|first3=Nico|last4=Brown|first4=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 25/11"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk_politics/8375439.stm|title=Iraq inquiry being 'suffocated' - Lib Dem leader Clegg|date=25 November 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were also raised about the expertise of the panel, particularly with regard to issues of legality by senior judges.&lt;ref name="Telegraph II"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/6637328/Iraq-inquiry-civil-servant-Sir-John-Chilcot-incapable-of-addressing-legal-issues.html|title=Iraq inquiry: civil servant Sir John Chilcot 'incapable of addressing legal issues'|last=Laing |first=Aislinn|date=24 November 2009|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=12 February 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 22 November 2009, former British Ambassador [[Oliver Miles]] published an article in the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/oliver-miles-the-key-question-ndash-is-blair-a-war-criminal-1825374.html |title=The key question – is Blair a war criminal? | location=London | work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he questioned the appointment to the inquiry panel of two British historians on the basis of their previous support for [[Israel]]. In a diplomatic cable from the US embassy in London, released as part of [[Cablegate]], Jon Day, director general for security policy at the British Ministry of Defence is cited having promised the US to have "put measures in place to protect your interests" regarding the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=09LONDON2198, U/S TAUSCHER'S MEETINGS WITH FS MILIBAND AND OTHER| url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09LONDON2198&amp;version=1291138620  | accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted as an indication that the inquiry is restricted "to minimize embarrassment for the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title=WikiLeaks cable reveals secret pledge to protect US at Iraq inquiry | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/30/wikileaks-chilcot-iraq-war-inquiry | work=The Guardian | first=Robert | last=Booth| accessdate=30 November 2010 | location=London | date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/news/wikileaks/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2010/11/30/wikileaks_uk_iraq_inquiry | title=Is Britain's Iraq war inquiry compromised? | work=www.salon.com | first=Justin | last=Elliott | accessdate=30 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Dominic Grieve]] was criticised when he vetoed the release of documents to the inquiry detailing minutes of Cabinet meetings in the days leading up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. Concurrently, the Foreign Office successfully appealed against a judge's ruling and blocked the disclosure of extracts of a conversation between Bush and Blair moments before the invasion. The British government stated that revealing the content of a phone call between Bush and Blair moments before the invasion would later present a "significant danger" to [[United Kingdom–United States relations|British–American relations]].&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; In his submission to the inquiry, [[Philippe Sands]] observed that:

{{Quote|an independent Dutch Inquiry has recently concluded – unanimously and without ambiguity – that the war was not justified under international law. The Dutch inquiry Committee was presided by W.J.M. Davids, a distinguished former President of the Dutch Supreme Court, and four of its seven members were lawyers.

In 2011, the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' published an article with 15 charges that have yet to be answered by the inquiry.&lt;ref name="Independent 1/11"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Michael Savage|date=21 January 2011|title=The case against Blair: 15 charges that have yet to be answered|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-case-against-blair-15-charges-that-have-yet-to-be-answered-2190375.html|publisher=[[The Independent|independent.co.uk]]|accessdate=29 August 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at a public meeting in 2013, [[David Owen]] said that the inquiry "is being prevented from revealing extracts that they believe relevant from exchanges between President Bush and Prime Minister Blair". He blamed Blair and Cameron for this state of affairs, who he believed have entered into a private deal to prevent the publication of important documents out of mutual self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Oborne | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Oborne | date = 29 May 2013 | title = The whiff of suspicion over the Chilcot Inquiry grows stronger | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/10086837/The-whiff-of-suspicion-over-the-Chilcot-Inquiry-grows-stronger.html | publisher = [[The Daily Telegraph|telegraph.co.uk]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged that the Cabinet Office was resisting the release of "more than 130 records of conversations" between Bush and Blair, as well as "25 notes from Mr Blair to President Bush" and "some 200 cabinet-level discussions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Doward | first = Jamie | date = 10 November 2013 | title = Iraq war inquiry blocked in bid to make Bush-Blair 'kick ass' memo public | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/10/iraq-war-tony-blair-george-bush | accessdate = 10 November 2013 | publisher = ''[[The Observer]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of time taken for the inquiry to complete its report is seen by many as excessive, and has been widely criticised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33163916 "Cameron 'losing patience' with Chilcot Iraq Inquiry delay"], ''BBC News'', 17 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11808788/Retired-High-Court-judge-questions-inordinate-Chilcot-delay.html "Retired High Court judge questions 'inordinate' Chilcot delay as Defence Secretary intervenes"], ''The Telegraph'', 18 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34072126 "Sir John Chilcot facing legal action over report delays"], ''BBC News'', 27 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also criticisms that the inquiry's final report had been published electronically only as [[Portable Document Format]] files, including images of scans of photocopies of printouts of electronic documents, and not in an [[open format]].&lt;ref name="Styles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.newstatesman.com/big-data/tried-searching-chilcot-report-good-luck|title=What do you mean Chilcot isn't a technology story?|last=Styles|first=Kirsty|date=7 July 2016|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1444">The '''Società Italiana di Filosofia Politica''' (English: Italian Association for Political Philosophy) is an association of academic and non-academic practitioners of [[political philosophy]] in [[Italy]].  The association's aim is to further the study of political philosophy in its various orientations and to promote dialogue among Italian and other intellectual communities of scholars interested in the current debate in political philosophy.

The Association was founded in 2001 by a number of philosophers, including [[Giuliano Marini]], [[Giulio M. Chiodi]], [[Sebastiano Maffettone]], [[Giacomo Marramao]], [[Giovanni Fiaschi]], [[Raimondo Cubeddu]], [[Salvatore Veca]], [[Michelangelo Bovero]], [[Alessandro Ferrara]], [[Roberto Gatti]]—some of whom had significant contact with the Italian political philosopher [[Norberto Bobbio]].

The first President of the Association (after a temporary provisional [[steering committee]] led by Giuliano Marini) was Sebastiano Maffettone (2002–04). Roberto Gatti served as President from 2004 to 2005. From 2005 to 2010, for two terms, the President was Alessandro Ferrara, and from 2010 to 2013 Laura Bazzicalupo. The current President of the Association is Stefano Petrucciani.

An early theory of justice was set out by the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Plato]] in his work ''The Republic''. Advocates of divine command theory say that justice issues from God. In the 17th century, theorists like [[John Locke]] advocated [[natural rights]] as a derivative of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zuckert |first=Michael |title=The Natural Rights Republic |year=1996 |publisher=Notre Dame University Press |pages=73–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers in the [[social contract]] tradition state that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 19th century, [[utilitarian]] thinkers including [[John Stuart Mill]] said that justice is what has the best consequences. Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the ''proper'' distribution. [[Egalitarianism|Egalitarians]] state that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. [[John Rawls]] used a theory of [[social contract]] to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like [[Robert Nozick]]) take a deontological view of distributive justice and state that property rights-based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with [[punishment]] for wrongdoing. Restorative justice (also sometimes called "reparative justice") is an approach to justice that focuses on restoring what is good, and necessarily focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laurence |first=Timothy |editor-last=Laurence |editor-first=Timothy |title=Good News for the Public Square |publisher=LCF |date=2014 |page=xxii |chapter=Overview |isbn=978-0-9506454-3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harmony==

{{Main|The Republic (Plato)}}
[[File:Luca Giordano 013.jpg|thumb|''Justice'' by [[Luca Giordano]]]]
In his dialogue ''Republic'', [[Plato]] uses [[Socrates]] to argue for justice that covers both the just person and the just [[City State]]. Justice is a proper, harmonious relationship between the warring parts of the person or city. Hence, Plato's definition of justice is that justice is the having and doing of what is one's own. A just man is a man in just the right place, doing his best and giving the precise equivalent of what he has received. This applies both at the individual level and at the universal level. A person's soul has three parts&amp;nbsp;– reason, spirit and desire. Similarly, a city has three parts&amp;nbsp;– Socrates uses the parable of the chariot to illustrate his point: a chariot works as a whole because the two horses' power is directed by the charioteer. Lovers of wisdom&amp;nbsp;– philosophers, in one sense of the term&amp;nbsp;– [[Philosopher king|should rule]] because only they understand what is [[goodness and evil|good]]. If one is ill, one goes to a medic rather than a farmer, because the medic is expert in the subject of health. Similarly, one should trust one's city to an expert in the subject of the good, not to a mere [[politician]] who tries to gain power by giving people what they want, rather than what's good for them. Socrates uses the parable of the ship to illustrate this point: the unjust city is like a ship in open ocean, crewed by a powerful but drunken captain (the common people), a group of untrustworthy advisors who try to manipulate the captain into giving them power over the ship's course (the politicians), and a [[navigator]] (the philosopher) who is the only one who knows how to get the ship to port. For Socrates, the only way the ship will reach its destination&amp;nbsp;– the good&amp;nbsp;– is if the navigator takes charge.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'' trans. Robin Waterfield (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divine command==

{{Main|Divine command theory}}{{See also|Divine command}}
[[File:Domenico Beccafumi 012.jpg|thumb|Allegorical fresco cycle (cardinal virtues) by [[Renaissance]] painter [[Domenico di Pace Beccafumi]] from the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, scene: ’’Justitia’’]]
Advocates of divine command theory argue that justice, and indeed the whole of morality, is the authoritative command of God. Murder is wrong and must be punished, for instance, because God says it so. Some versions of the theory assert that God must be obeyed because of the nature of his relationship with humanity, others assert that God must be obeyed because he is goodness itself, and thus doing what he says would be best for everyone.

A meditation on the Divine command theory by [[Plato]] can be found in his dialogue, [[Euthyphro]]. Called the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], it goes as follows: "Is what is morally good commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally good because it is commanded by God?" The implication is that if the latter is true, then justice is arbitrary; if the former is true, then morality exists on a higher order than God, who becomes little more than a passer-on of moral knowledge. A [[Argument from morality|response]], popularized in two contexts by [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[C. S. Lewis]], is that it is deductively valid to argue that the existence of an objective morality implies the existence of God and vice versa.

==Natural law==

{{Main|Natural law}}
[[File:VD-04-3.jpg|thumb|''Lex, justitia, pax'' ([[Latin]] for "Law, justice, peace") on the pediment of the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Supreme Court of Switzerland]]]]

For advocates of the theory that justice is part of natural law (e.g., [[John Locke]]), it involves the system of consequences that naturally derives from any action or choice. In this, it is similar to the laws of physics: in the same way as the Third of Newton's laws of Motion requires that for every action there must be an equal and opposite reaction, justice requires according individuals or groups what they actually deserve, merit, or are entitled to.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Justice, on this account, is a universal and absolute concept: laws, principles, religions, etc., are merely attempts to codify that concept, sometimes with results that entirely contradict the true nature of justice.

===Despotism and skepticism===

In ''Republic'' by [[Plato]], the character [[Thrasymachus]] argues that justice is the interest of the strong&amp;nbsp;– merely a name for what the powerful or cunning ruler has imposed on the people.
{{further|The Republic (Plato)}}

===Mutual agreement===

{{Main|Social contract}}
Advocates of the social contract agree that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned; or, in many versions, from what they would agree to under ''hypothetical'' conditions including equality and absence of bias. This account is considered further below, under 'Justice as fairness'. The absence of bias refers to an equal ground for all people concerned in a disagreement (or trial in some cases).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Subordinate value===
According to utilitarian thinkers including [[John Stuart Mill]], justice is not as fundamental as we often think. Rather, it is derived from the more basic standard of rightness, [[consequentialism]]: what is right is what has the best consequences (usually measured by the total or average [[Quality of life|welfare]] caused). So, the proper principles of justice are those that tend to have the best consequences. These rules may turn out to be familiar ones such as keeping [[contract]]s; but equally, they may not, depending on the facts about real consequences. Either way, what is important is those consequences, and justice is important, if at all, only as derived from that fundamental standard. Mill tries to explain our mistaken belief that justice is overwhelmingly important by arguing that it derives from two natural human tendencies: our desire to retaliate against those who hurt us, or the feeling of self-defense and our ability to put ourselves imaginatively in another's place, sympathy. So, when we see someone harmed, we project ourselves into her situation and feel a desire to retaliate on her behalf. If this process is the source of our feelings about justice, that ought to undermine our confidence in them.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''Utilitarianism'' in ''On Liberty and Other Essays'' ed. John Gray (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of distributive justice==
{{Main|Distributive justice}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Theories of distributive justice need to answer three questions:
# ''What goods'' are to be distributed? Is it to be [[wealth]], [[Political power|power]], [[respect]], opportunities or some combination of these things?
# ''Between what entities'' are they to be distributed? Humans (dead, living, future), [[Sentience|sentient]] beings, the members of a single society, [[nation]]s?
# What is the ''proper'' distribution? Equal, [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]], according to [[social status]], according to [[need]], based on property rights and non-aggression?

Distributive justice theorists generally do not answer questions of ''who has the right'' to enforce a particular favored distribution.  On the other hand, property rights theorists argue that there is no "favored distribution."  Rather, distribution should be based simply on whatever distribution results from lawful interactions or transactions (that is, transactions which are not illicit).

This section describes some widely held theories of distributive justice, and their attempts to answer these questions.

===Social justice===
{{Main|Social justice}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Social justice is concerned with the just relationship between individuals and their society, often considering how privileges, opportunities, and wealth ought to be distributed among individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/social_justice|title=social justice {{!}} Definition of social justice in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social justice is distinct from egalitarianism, which is the idea that all people are equal in terms of status, value, or rights, as social justice theories do not all require equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/egalitarianism|title=egalitarianism {{!}} Definition of egalitarianism in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sociologist [[George C. Homans]] suggested that the root of the concept of justice is that each person should receive rewards that are proportional to their contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubinstein|first=David|date=1988|title=The Concept of Justice in Sociology|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/657654|journal=Theory and Society|volume=17|issue=4|pages=527–550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2668194|title=Social behavior; its elementary forms.|last=Homans|first=George Caspar|publisher=Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich|year=1974|isbn=0155814176|edition= Rev.|location=New York,|pages=246–249|oclc=2668194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the egalitarian, justice can exist only within the parameters of equality. This basic view can be elaborated in many ways, according to what goods are to be distributed&amp;nbsp;– wealth, respect, opportunity&amp;nbsp;– and who or what they are to be distributed equally among&amp;nbsp;– individuals, families, nations, races, species. Egalitarian theories are typically less concerned with discussing who exactly will do the distributing or what effects their recommended policies will have on the production of the goods, services, or resources they wish to distribute.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Commonly held egalitarian positions include demands for [[equality of opportunity]], though equality of opportunity is often defended by adherents of nonegalitarian conceptions of justice as well. Some variants of egalitarianism affirm that justice without equality is hollow and that equality itself is the highest justice, though such a formulation will have concrete meaning only once the main terms have been fleshed out.

At a cultural level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are communism, socialism, [[left-libertarianism]], and progressivism, which propound economic, political, and legal egalitarianism, respectively.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Fairness===
{{More citations needed|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Justice statue.jpg|thumb|J. L. Urban, statue of [[Lady Justice]] at court building in [[Olomouc]], [[Czech Republic]]]]

In his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', [[John Rawls]] used a [[social contract]] argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness: an impartial distribution of goods. Rawls asks us to imagine ourselves behind a [[veil of ignorance]] that denies us all knowledge of our personalities, social statuses, moral characters, wealth, talents and life plans, and then asks what theory of justice we would choose to govern our society when the veil is lifted, if we wanted to do the best that we could for ourselves. We don't know who in particular we are, and therefore can't bias the decision in our own favour. So, the decision-in-ignorance models fairness, because it excludes selfish [[bias]]. Rawls argues that each of us would reject the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] theory of justice that we should maximize welfare (see below) because of the risk that we might turn out to be someone whose own good is sacrificed for greater benefits for others. Instead, we would endorse Rawls's ''two principles of justice'':
* Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.
* Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both
** to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and
** attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''A Theory of Justice'' (revised edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

This imagined choice justifies these principles as the principles of justice for us, because we would agree to them in a fair decision procedure. Rawls's theory distinguishes two kinds of goods&amp;nbsp;– (1) [[Freedom (political)|the good of liberty rights]] and (2) social and economic goods, i.e. wealth, income and power&amp;nbsp;– and applies different distributions to them&amp;nbsp;– equality between citizens for (1), equality unless inequality improves the position of the worst off for (2).

In one sense, theories of distributive justice may assert that everyone should get what they deserve. Theories disagree on the meaning of what is "deserved". The main distinction is between theories that argue the basis of just deserts ought to be held equally by everyone, and therefore derive egalitarian accounts of distributive justice&amp;nbsp;– and theories that argue the basis of just deserts is unequally distributed on the basis of, for instance, hard work, and therefore derive accounts of distributive justice by which some should have more than others.

According to ''[[Meritocracy|meritocratic]]'' theories, goods, especially wealth and [[social status]], should be distributed to match individual ''merit'', which is usually understood as some combination of talent and hard work. According to ''[[need]]s''-based theories, goods, especially such basic goods as food, shelter and medical care, should be distributed to meet individuals' [[basic needs]] for them. [[Marxism]] is a needs-based theory, expressed succinctly in [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] slogan "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, 'Critique of the Gotha Program' in ''Karl Marx: Selected writings'' ed. David McLellan (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977): 564–70, p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''contribution''-based theories, goods should be distributed to match an individual's contribution to the overall social good.

===Property rights===
{{further|Libertarianism|Constitutional economics}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
In ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', [[Robert Nozick]] argues that distributive justice is not a matter of the whole distribution matching an ideal ''pattern'', but of each individual entitlement having the right kind of ''history''. It is just that a person has some good (especially, some [[Property rights|property right]]) if and only if they came to have it by a history made up entirely of events of two kinds:
* Just ''acquisition'', especially by working on unowned things; and
* Just ''transfer'', that is free gift, sale or other agreement, but not [[theft]] (i.e. by force or fraud).

If the chain of events leading up to the person having something meets this criterion, they are entitled to it: that they possess it is just, and what anyone else does or doesn't have or need is irrelevant.

On the basis of this theory of distributive justice, Nozick argues that all attempts to redistribute goods according to an ideal pattern, without the consent of their owners, are theft. In particular, [[redistribution (economics)|redistributive taxation]] is theft.

Some property rights theorists (like Nozick) also take a consequentialist view of distributive justice and argue that property rights based justice also has the effect of maximizing the overall wealth of an economic system.  They explain that voluntary (non-coerced) transactions always have a property called [[Pareto efficiency]]. The result is that the world is better off in an absolute sense and no one is worse off.  Such consequentialist property rights theorists argue that respecting property rights maximizes the number of Pareto efficient transactions in the world and minimized the number of non-Pareto efficient transactions in the world (i.e. transactions where someone is made worse off).  The result is that the world will have generated the greatest total benefit from the limited, scarce resources available in the world.  Further, this will have been accomplished without taking anything away from anyone unlawfully.

===Welfare-maximization===
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
According to the utilitarian, justice requires the maximization of the total or average welfare across all relevant individuals. This may require sacrifice of some for the good of others, so long as everyone's good is taken impartially into account. Utilitarianism, in general, argues that the standard of justification for actions, institutions, or the whole world, is ''impartial welfare consequentialism'', and only indirectly, if at all, to do with [[Human rights|rights]], [[property]], [[need]], or any other non-utilitarian criterion. These other criteria might be indirectly important, to the extent that human welfare involves them. But even then, such demands as human rights would only be elements in the calculation of overall welfare, not uncrossable barriers to action.

==Theories of retributive justice==
{{Main|Retributive justice}}

[[File:Justicia Ottawa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Seymour Allward]]'s ''Justitia'' (Justice), outside [[Supreme Court of Canada]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]] [[Canada]]]]
Theories of retributive justice are concerned with [[punishment]] for wrongdoing, and need to answer three questions:
# ''why'' punish?
# ''who'' should be punished?
# ''what punishment'' should they receive?
This section considers the two major accounts of retributive justice, and their answers to these questions. ''Utilitarian'' theories look forward to the future consequences of punishment, while ''retributive'' theories look back to particular acts of wrongdoing, and attempt to balance them with deserved punishment.

===Utilitarianism===
According to the utilitarian, justice requires the maximization of the total or average welfare across all relevant individuals. Punishment fights crime in three ways:
# ''[[Deterrence (legal)|Deterrence]]''. The credible [[coercion|threat]] of punishment might lead people to make different choices; well-designed threats might lead people to make choices that maximize welfare. This matches some strong [[intuition]]s about just punishment: that it should generally be proportional to the crime.
# ''[[Rehabilitation (penology)|Rehabilitation]]''. Punishment might make bad people into better ones. For the utilitarian, all that 'bad person' can mean is 'person who's likely to cause bad things (like suffering)'. So, utilitarianism could recommend punishment that changes someone such that they are less likely to cause bad things.
# ''[[Incapacitation (penology)|Security/Incapacitation]]''. Perhaps there are people who are irredeemable causers of bad things. If so, [[Prison|imprisoning]] them might maximize welfare by limiting their opportunities to cause harm and therefore the benefit lies within protecting society.
So, the reason for punishment is the maximization of welfare, and punishment should be of whomever, and of whatever form and severity, are needed to meet that goal. This may sometimes justify punishing the innocent, or inflicting disproportionately severe punishments, when that will have the best consequences overall (perhaps executing a few suspected [[Shoplifting|shoplifters]] live on television would be an effective deterrent to shoplifting, for instance). It also suggests that punishment might turn out ''never'' to be right, depending on the facts about what actual consequences it has.&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Ten, 'Crime and Punishment' in Peter Singer ed., ''A Companion to Ethics'' (Oxford: [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell Publishing]], 1993): 366–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retributivism===
The retributivist will think [[consequentialism]] is mistaken. If someone does something wrong we must respond by punishing for the committed action itself, regardless of what outcomes punishment produces. Wrongdoing must be balanced or made good in some way, and so the criminal ''deserves'' to be punished. It says that all guilty people, and only guilty people, deserve appropriate punishment. This matches some strong [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitions]] about just punishment: that it should be ''proportional'' to the crime, and that it should be of ''only'' and ''all of'' the guilty.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However, it is sometimes argued that retributivism is merely [[revenge]] in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, ''Punishment: The supposed justifications'' (London: Hutchinson &amp; Co., 1969), Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are differences between retribution and revenge: the former is impartial and has a scale of appropriateness, whereas the latter is personal and potentially unlimited in scale.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Restorative justice===
{{Main|Restorative justice}}

Restorative justice (also sometimes called "reparative justice") is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders, instead of satisfying abstract legal principles or punishing the offender. Victims take an active role in the process, while offenders are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, "to repair the harm they've done&amp;nbsp;– by apologizing, returning stolen money, or community service". It is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against an individual or community rather than the state. Restorative justice that fosters dialogue between victim and offender shows the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Braswell, and John Fuller, ''Corrections, Peacemaking and Restorative Justice: Transforming Individuals and Institutions'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed theories===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Some modern philosophers have argued that Utilitarian and Retributive theories are not mutually exclusive. For example, [[Andrew von Hirsch]], in his 1976 book ''Doing Justice'', suggested that we have a moral obligation to punish greater crimes more than lesser ones. However, so long as we adhere to that constraint then utilitarian ideals would play a significant secondary role.

==Theories==

===Rawls' theory of justice===
{{further|Justice (virtue)|Cardinal virtues}}
It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Eric Heinze, ''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013), pp. 4–10, 50–60.&lt;/ref&gt; that 'systematic' or 'programmatic' political and moral philosophy in the West begins, in [[Plato]]'s [[Plato Republic|Republic]], with the question, 'What is Justice?'&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', Book I, 331b–c.&lt;/ref&gt; According to most contemporary theories of justice, justice is overwhelmingly important: [[John Rawls]] claims that "Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought."&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''A Theory of Justice'' (revised edn, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In classical approaches, evident from [[Plato]] through to [[John Rawls|Rawls]], the concept of 'justice' is always construed in logical or 'etymological' opposition to the concept of injustice. Such approaches cite various examples of injustice, as problems which a theory of justice must overcome.  A number of post-World War II approaches do, however, challenge that seemingly obvious dualism between those two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;
*See, e.g., Eric Heinze, ''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013).
*Clive Barnett ''The Priority of Injustice: Locating Democracy in Critical Theory''&lt;/ref&gt; Justice can be thought of as distinct from [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]], [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], [[prudence (virtue)|prudence]], [[mercy]], [[generosity]], or [[compassion]], although these dimensions are regularly understood to also be interlinked. Justice is the concept of [[cardinal virtue]]s, of which it is one.  Metaphysical justice has often been associated with concepts of [[destiny|fate]], [[reincarnation]] or [[Divine Providence]], i.e., with a life in accordance with a cosmic plan. The association of justice with fairness is thus historically and culturally inalienable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daston|first=Lorraine|year=2008|journal=Daedalus|pages=5–14|title=Life, Chance and Life Chances|doi=10.1162/daed.2008.137.1.5|volume=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equality before the law===
Law raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice. There is an old saying that '[[All are equal before the law]]'. The belief in equality before the law is called legal egalitarianism. In criticism of this belief, the author [[Anatole France]] said in 1894, "In its majestic equality, the law forbids [[rich and poor alike]] to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, and steal loaves of bread."&lt;ref&gt;(France, ''The Red Lily'', [http://www.online-literature.com/anatole-france/red-lily/8/ Chapter VII]).&lt;/ref&gt; With this saying, France illustrated the fundamental shortcoming of a theory of legal equality that remains blind to social inequality;
the same law applied to all may have disproportionately harmful effects on the least powerful.

===Classical liberalism===
Equality before the law is one of the basic principles of [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref name=kukathas/&gt;&lt;ref name=evans/&gt; Classical liberalism calls for equality before the law, not for [[equality of outcome]].&lt;ref name=kukathas&gt;[[Chandran Kukathas]], "Ethical Pluralism from a Classical Liberal Perspective," in ''The Many and the One: Religious and Secular Perspectives on Ethical Pluralism in the Modern World'', ed. Richard Madsen and Tracy B. Strong, Ethikon Series in Comparative Ethics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003), 61 ({{ISBN|0-691-09993-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Classical liberalism opposes pursuing [[group rights]] at the expense of [[individual rights]].&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Mark Evans, ed., ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'' (London: Routledge, 2001), 55 ({{ISBN|1-57958-339-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and spirituality===

====Abrahamic justice====
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 079.jpg|thumbnail|''Moses with the [[Tablets of Law]]'', by [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]]]]

[[Judaism|Jews]], [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Christianity|Christians]] traditionally believe that justice is a present, real, right, and, specifically, governing concept along with [[mercy]], and that justice is ultimately derived from and held by [[God]]. According to the [[Bible]], such [[institution]]s as the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]] were created by God to require the [[Israelites]] to live by and apply His standards of justice.

The Hebrew Bible describes God as saying about the Judeo-Christian [[patriarch]] [[Abraham]]: "No, for I have chosen him, that he may charge his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice;...." ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18:19, [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV)]]. The [[Psalms|Psalmist]] describes God as having "Righteousness and justice [as] the foundation of [His] throne;...." (Psalms 89:14, NRSV).

The [[New Testament]] also describes God and [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as having and displaying justice, often in comparison with God displaying and supporting [[mercy]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:7).

===Theories of sentencing===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
In [[criminal law]], a [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] forms the final explicit act of a [[judge]]-ruled process, and also the symbolic principal act connected to his function. The sentence can generally involve a decree of [[prison|imprisonment]], a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] and/or other [[punishment]]s against a [[defendant]] [[conviction (law)|convicted]] of a [[crime]]. Laws may specify the range of penalties that can be imposed for various offenses, and sentencing guidelines sometimes regulate what punishment within those ranges can be imposed given a certain set of offense and offender characteristics. The most common purposes of sentencing in legal theory are:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:#b0c4de; text-align:center;"
! Theory
! Aim of theory
! Suitable punishment
|-
|[[Retributive justice|Retribution]]
| Punishment imposed for no reason other than an offense being committed, on the basis that if [[Eye for an eye|proportionate]], punishment is morally acceptable as a response that satisfies the aggrieved party, their intimates and society.

|-
|[[Denunciation (penology)|Denunciation]]
|Society expressing its disapproval reinforcing moral boundaries
|
* Reflects blameworthiness of offense
* punishment in public
* punishment reported to public

|-
|}

In [[civil law (common law)|civil cases]] the decision is usually known as a [[verdict]], or judgment, rather than a sentence. Civil cases are settled primarily by means of monetary compensation for harm done ("[[damages]]") and orders intended to prevent future harm (for example [[injunction]]s). Under some legal systems an award of damages involves some scope for retribution, denunciation and deterrence, by means of additional categories of damages beyond simple compensation, covering a [[Punitive damages|punitive effect, social disapprobation, and potentially, deterrence]], and occasionally [[Disgorgement (law)|disgorgement]] (forfeit of any gain, even if no loss was caused to the other party).

===Evolutionary perspectives===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Gerechtigkeit-1537.jpg|thumb|"Justice as a naked woman with a [[sword]] and [[Weighing scale|balance]]" by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1537]]

[[Evolutionary ethic]]s and an argued [[evolution of morality]] suggest [[evolutionary]] bases for the concept of justice. [[Biosocial criminology]] research argues that human perceptions of what is appropriate criminal justice are based on how to respond to crimes in the ancestral small-group environment and that these responses may not always be appropriate for today's societies.

===Reactions to fairness===
[[File:Justitia, Jost Amman.png|thumb|‘’Justitia’’, copper engraving by [[Jost Amman]], made between 1539 and 1591]]
Studies at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in 2008 have indicated that reactions to fairness are "wired" into the brain and that, "Fairness is activating the same part of the brain that responds to food in rats... This is consistent with the notion that being treated fairly satisfies a basic need".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/brain-reacts-to-fairness-as-it-49042.aspx?link_page_rss=49042 |title=Brain reacts to fairness as it does to money and chocolate, study shows |work=UCLA Newsroom |publisher= UCLA |date=April 21, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted in 2003 at [[Emory University]] involving capuchin monkeys demonstrated that other cooperative animals also possess such a sense and that "[[inequity aversion]] may not be uniquely human".&lt;ref&gt;Nature 425, 297–99 (18 September 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions and justice===
{{Main|Law}}

In a world where people are interconnected but they disagree, institutions are required to instantiate ideals of justice. These institutions may be justified by their approximate instantiation of justice, or they may be deeply unjust when compared with ideal standards&amp;nbsp;– consider the institution of [[slavery]]. Justice is an ideal the world fails to live up to, sometimes due to deliberate opposition to justice despite understanding, which could be disastrous. The question of institutive justice raises issues of [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]], [[Legal procedure|procedure]], [[Codification (law)|codification]] and [[statutory interpretation|interpretation]], which are considered by legal theorists and by [[Philosophy of law|philosophers of law]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

{{Libertarian socialism}}
'''Libertarian socialism''' (or '''socialist libertarianism''')&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Wilbur R. (2012). ''The social history of crime and punishment in America. An encyclopedia.'' 5 vols. London: Sage Publications. p. 1007. {{ISBN|1412988764}}.

[[Roderick T. Long]]. "Toward a libertarian theory of class." ''Social Philosophy and Policy''. Volume 15. Issue 02. Summer 1998. p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian socialism also rejects the [[State (polity)|state]] itself,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"So, libertarian socialism rejects the idea of state ownership and control of the economy, along with the state as such. Through workers' self-management it proposes to bring an end to authority, exploitation, and hierarchy in production." [http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionI1 "I1.

As true socialists oppose wage labour, they must also oppose the state for the same reasons. Similarly, libertarians must oppose wage labour for the same reasons they must oppose the state."

A politics that is completely revolutionary because it seeks to transform all of reality. We do not think that capturing the economy and the state lead automatically to the transformation of the rest of social being, nor do we equate liberation with changing our life-styles and our heads.

Anarchism is distinguished, philosophically, by its scepticism towards such moral relations – by its questioning of the claims made for such normative power – and, practically, by its challenge to those "authoritative" powers which cannot justify their claims and which are therefore deemed illegitimate or without moral foundation."[https://books.google.com/books?id=kkj5i3CeGbQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage ''Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism'' by Paul McLaughlin.

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations." [[Emma Goldman]]. "What it Really Stands for Anarchy" in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows "They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, – follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

I have labelled this negative pole 'socialist orthodoxy', composed of both Leninists and social democrats...What I suggested was that these Left communist thinkers differentiated their own understandings of communism from a strand of socialism that came to follow a largely electoral road in the West, pursuing a kind of social capitalism, and a path to socialism that predominated in the peripheral and semi- peripheral countries, which sought revolutionary conquest of power and led to something like state capitalism. Generally, the Left communist thinkers were to find these paths locked within the horizons of capitalism (the law of value, money, private property, class, the state), and they were to characterize these solutions as statist, substitutionist and authoritarian."

== Overview ==
[[File:Le libertaire 25.png|thumb|left|250px|The August 17, 1860 edition of [[libertarian communist]] publication ''Le Libertaire'' edited by [[Joseph Déjacque]]]]
Libertarian socialism is a Western philosophy with diverse interpretations, though some general commonalities can be found in its many incarnations. It advocates a worker-oriented system of production and organization in the workplace that in some aspects radically departs from [[neoclassical economics]] in favor of democratic [[cooperative]]s or [[common ownership]] of the means of production (socialism).&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Frank H. ''The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty'' Transaction Publishers (1994) p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; They propose that this economic system be executed in a manner that attempts to maximize the [[liberty]] of individuals and minimize [[Elite|concentration of power]] or authority ([[libertarianism]]).

Libertarian socialists are strongly critical of coercive institutions, which often leads them to reject the legitimacy of the state in favor of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel, Henry. ''The Growth of Economic Thought'' Duke University Press (1991) p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents propose achieving this through decentralization of political and economic power, usually involving the socialization of most large-scale private property and enterprise (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]). Libertarian socialism tends to deny the legitimacy of most forms of economically significant private property, viewing capitalist property relation as a form of domination that is antagonistic to individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Ellen Frankel et al. ''Problems of Market Liberalism'' Cambridge University Press (1998) p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, libertarian socialism retains respect for personal property.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first anarchist journal to use the term "libertarian" was ''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social'' and it was published in New York City between 1858 and 1861 by French anarcho-communist [[Joseph Déjacque]].&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/The_Anarchist_FAQ_Editorial_Collective__150_years_of_Libertarian.html The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective]. "150 years of Libertarian".&lt;/ref&gt; The next recorded use of the term was in Europe, when "libertarian communism" was used at a French regional anarchist Congress at Le Havre (16–22 November 1880). January 1881 saw a French manifesto issued on "Libertarian or Anarchist Communism". Finally, 1895 saw leading anarchists [[Sébastien Faure]] and [[Louise Michel]] publish ''La Libertaire'' in France".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary"/&gt; The word stems from the [[French language|French]] word ''libertaire'', which was used to evade the [[lois scélérates|French ban on anarchist publications]].&lt;ref name="Graham2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Graham|title=We Do Not Fear Anarchy—We Invoke It: The First International and the Origins of the Anarchist Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRdjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT8|date=23 June 2015|publisher=AK Press|isbn=978-1-84935-211-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this tradition, the term "libertarianism" in "libertarian socialism" is generally used as a synonym for anarchism, which some say is the original meaning of the term; hence "libertarian socialism" is equivalent to "socialist anarchism" to these scholars.&lt;ref name="Noam Chomsky 2004, p. 739"&gt;Chomsky, Noam (2004). ''Language and Politics''. In Otero, Carlos Peregrín. AK Press. p. 739.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perlin|first=Terry M.|title=Contemporary Anarchism|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1979|page=40|isbn=978-0-87855-097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of the European socialist movement, "libertarian" has conventionally been used to describe those who opposed [[state socialism]], such as Mikhail Bakunin.

The association of socialism with libertarianism predates that of capitalism and many anti-authoritarians still decry what they see as a mistaken association of [[capitalism]] with [[libertarianism in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray, ''The Modern Crisis'', Black Rose Books (1987), pp. 154–55 {{ISBN|0-920057-61-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Noam Chomsky]] put it, a consistent libertarian "must oppose [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and [[wage slavery]], which is a component of this system, as incompatible with the principle that labor must be freely undertaken and under the control of the producer".&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2003) p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Noam chomsky cropped.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky is one of the most well-known contemporary libertarian socialist thinkers]]
In a chapter recounting the history of libertarian socialism, economist [[Robin Hahnel]] relates that thus far the period where libertarian socialism has had its greatest impact was at the end of the 19th century through the first four decades of the 20th century: {{cquote|Early in the twentieth century, libertarian socialism was as powerful a force as social democracy and [[communism]]. The [[Anarchist St. Imier International|Libertarian International]]—founded at the Congress of Saint Imier a few days after the split between Marxist and libertarians at the congress of the [[First International|Socialist International]] held in [[Hague Congress (1872)|The Hague in 1872]]—competed successfully against social democrats and communists alike for the loyalty of anticapitalist activists, revolutionaries, workers, unions and political parties for over fifty years. Libertarian socialists played a major role in the Russian revolutions of [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905]] and [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917]]. Libertarian socialists played a dominant role in the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1911. Twenty years after World War I was over, libertarian socialists were still strong enough to spearhead the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|social revolution that swept across Republican Spain]] in 1936 and 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnel, Robin. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CI5d2CpL60oC ''Economic Justice and Democracy''], Routledge Press, 2005, p. 138 {{ISBN|0-415-93344-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, a libertarian trend also developed within [[Marxism]] which gained visibility around the late 1910s mainly in reaction against [[Bolshevism]] and Leninism rising to power and establishing the [[Soviet Union]].

Libertarian socialists are anti-capitalist and can thus be distinguished from [[Right-libertarianism|right-wing libertarians]]. Whereas capitalist (and right-libertarian) principles concentrate economic power in the hands of those who own the most capital, libertarian socialism aims to distribute power more widely amongst members of society. A key difference between libertarian socialism and [[Neoliberalism|capitalist libertarianism]] is that advocates of the former generally believe that one's degree of freedom is affected by one's economic and social status whereas advocates of the latter focus on freedom of choice within a capitalist framework. This is sometimes characterized as a desire to maximize "free creativity" in a society in preference to "free enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2003) pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Within anarchism, there emerged a critique of [[wage slavery]] which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[[voluntary slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |publisher= [[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |publisher= [[dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and [[employment|renting]] a person. The term "wage slavery" has been used to criticize [[economic exploitation]] and [[social stratification]], with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in [[sweatshops]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandel|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&amp;pg=PA184 184]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter as a lack of [[workers' self-management]], fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy.&lt;ref name="globetrotter.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky |page=2|publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallgrimsdottir|Benoit|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spunk.org"&gt;{{cite web |title= The Bolsheviks and Workers Control, 1917–1921: The State and Counter-revolution |url= http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html |publisher= [[Spunk Library]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian socialists believe that by valuing freedom society works towards a system in which individuals have the power to decide economic issues along with political issues. Libertarian socialists seek to replace unjustified authority with direct democracy, voluntary federation and popular autonomy in all aspects of life,&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Austin, et al. 'Encyclopedia of Social Theory' Routledge (2006) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; including physical communities and economic enterprises. With the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], thinkers such as [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Karl Marx]] elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Proudhon|1890}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marx 1863 c7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1969|loc=[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch07.htm Chapter VII]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luddite]]s emphasized the [[dehumanization]] brought about by machines while later [[Emma Goldman]] famously denounced wage slavery by saying: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldman|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IF7CusxuMcC&amp;pg=PA283 283]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many libertarian socialists believe that large-scale voluntary associations should manage industrial production while workers retain rights to the individual products of their labor.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann, Albert S. 'A History of European Socialism' Yale University Press (1983) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; They see a distinction between concepts of "private property" and "[[Personal property|personal possession]]". "Private property" grants an individual exclusive control over a thing whether it is in use or not; and regardless of its productive capacity, "possession" grants no rights to things that are not in use.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, Richard et al. 'Property and Contract in Their Relations to the Distribution of Wealth' The Macmillan Company (1914)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "[[Refusal of work|the separation of work and life is questioned]] and alternatives suggested that are underpinned by notions of dignity, self-realization and freedom from domination and exploitation. Here, a [[Negative liberty|freedom that is not restrictively negative]] (as in [[neo-liberal]] conceptions) but is, as well, [[Positive liberty|positive – connected, that is, to views about human flourishing]] – is important, a profoundly embedded understanding of freedom, which ties freedom to its social, communal conditions and, importantly, refuses to separate questions of freedom from those of equality".&lt;ref&gt;Chamsy el- Ojeili.

=== Anti-authoritarianism and opposition to the state ===
{{main|Anti-statism|anti-authoritarianism}}
{{Anarchism sidebar|Related}}
{{Libertarianism sidebar|Schools}}
Libertarian socialists generally regard concentrations of power as sources of oppression that must be continually challenged and justified. Most libertarian socialists believe that when power is exercised as exemplified by the economic, social, or physical dominance of one individual over another, the burden of proof is always on the authoritarian to justify their action as legitimate when taken against its effect of narrowing the scope of human freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2004) p. 775&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian socialists typically oppose rigid and stratified structures of authority, be they [[political power|political]], [[economic power|economic]], or social.&lt;ref&gt;Ed, Andrew. 'Closing the Iron Cage: The Scientific Management of Work and Leisure' Black Rose Books (1999) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In lieu of corporations and states, libertarian socialists seek to organize society into voluntary associations (usually [[collective]]s, [[intentional community|communes]], [[Municipality|municipalities]], [[cooperative]]s, [[commons]], or [[Syndicalism|syndicates]]) that use direct democracy or [[consensus]] for their decision-making process. Some libertarian socialists advocate combining these institutions using rotating, recallable [[Wiktionary:Delegate|delegates]] to higher-level federations.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F06arcQyYEgC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Social Anarchism Or Lifestyle Anarchism''], AK Press (1995), pp. 71–72, {{ISBN|1-873176-83-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spanish anarchism]] is a major example of such federations in practice.

Contemporary examples of libertarian socialist organizational and decision-making models in practice include a number of anti-capitalist and global justice movements&lt;ref&gt;Purkis, Jon. Bowen, James. 'Changing Anarchism' Manchester University Press (2004) pp. 165, 179&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] [[Councils of Good Government]] and the global [[Indymedia]] network (which covers 45 countries on six continents). There are also many examples of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies around the world whose political and economic systems can be accurately described as anarchist or libertarian socialist, each of which is unique and uniquely suited to the culture that birthed it.&lt;ref&gt;Graeber, David. "Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology" Prickly Paradigm Press (2004) pp. 22–23, 26–29&lt;/ref&gt; For libertarians, that diversity of practice within a framework of common principles is proof of the vitality of those principles and of their flexibility and strength.

Contrary to popular opinion, libertarian socialism has not traditionally been a [[utopia]]n movement, tending to avoid dense theoretical analysis or prediction of what a future society would or should look like. The tradition instead has been that such decisions cannot be made now and must be made through struggle and experimentation, so that the best solution can be arrived at democratically and organically; and to base the direction for struggle on established historical example. They point out that the success of the [[scientific method]] comes from its adherence to open rational exploration, not its conclusions, in sharp contrast to [[dogma]] and predetermined predictions. Noted anarchist [[Rudolf Rocker]] once stated: "I am an anarchist not because I believe anarchism is the final goal, but because there is no such thing as a final goal".&lt;ref&gt;''The London Years'', 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Because libertarian socialism encourages exploration and embraces a diversity of ideas rather than forming a compact movement, there have arisen inevitable controversies over individuals who describe themselves as libertarian socialists yet disagree with some of the core principles of libertarian socialism. For example, [[Peter Hain]] interprets libertarian socialism as minarchist rather than anarchist, favoring radical decentralization of power without going as far as the complete abolition of the state&lt;ref&gt;Hain, Peter "Rediscovering our Libertarian Roots" Chartist (August 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and libertarian socialist Noam Chomsky supports dismantling all forms of unjustified social or economic power while also emphasizing that state intervention should be supported as a temporary protection while oppressive structures remain in existence.

Proponents are known for opposing the existence of states or government and refusing to participate in coercive state institutions. Indeed, in the past many refused to swear oaths in court or to participate in trials, even when they faced imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray.

Cornell University Press (1999) pp. 127–30 {{ISBN|0-8014-8618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Chamsy el-Ojeili, "it is frequently to forms of working-class or popular self-organization that Left communists look in answer to the questions of the struggle for socialism, revolution and post-capitalist social organization. Nevertheless, Left communists have often continued to organize themselves into party-like structures that undertake agitation, propaganda, education and other forms of political intervention. This is a vexed issue across Left communism and has resulted in a number of significant variations – from the absolute rejection of separate parties in favour of mere study or [[affinity groups]], to the critique of the naivety of pure spontaneism and an insistence on the necessary, though often modest, role of disciplined, self- critical and popularly connected communist organizations".&lt;ref&gt;Chamsy el- Ojeili.

=== Civil liberties and individual freedom ===
{{main|Free love|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|Anarchism and religion|Anarcha-feminism|Anarchism and education|Queer anarchism|Individualist anarchism}}
Libertarian socialists have been strong advocates and activists of [[civil liberties]] that provide an individual specific rights such as the freedom in issues of love and sex (free love) (see [[anarchism and issues related to love and sex]]) and of thought and conscience ([[freethought]]). In this activism, they have clashed with state and religious institutions which have limited such rights (see [[anarchism and religion]]). Anarchism has been an important advocate of free love since its birth. A strong tendency of free love later appeared alongside [[anarcha-feminism]] and advocacy of [[LGBT rights]] (see [[Queer anarchism|anarchism and issues related to LGBTI persons]]). In recent times, anarchism has also voiced opinions and taken action around certain sex related subjects such as [[pornography]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceXYA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Boston_Anarchist_Drinking_Brigade__An_Anarchist_Defense_of_Pornography.html |title="An Anarchist Defense of Pornography" by Boston Anarchist Drinking Brigade |publisher=Theanarchistlibrary.org |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BDSM]]&lt;ref name="bdsm"&gt;[http://info.interactivist.net/node/1530 "Interview with an anarchist dominatrix" by ''Organise''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731144101/http://info.interactivist.net/node/1530 |date=July 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[sex industry]].&lt;ref name="bdsm"/&gt;

[[File:Emma Goldman seated.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Anarchism in the United States|American anarchist]] Emma Goldman, prominent [[anarcha-feminist]], free love and [[freethought]] activist]]
Anarcha-feminism developed as a synthesis of radical feminism and anarchism that views patriarchy (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government. It was inspired by the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], Emma Goldman, [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] and [[Virginia Bolten]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticise and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and gender roles. Council communist [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] was also a feminist activist as well as a [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]]. Anarchists also took a pioneering [[Queer anarchism|interest in issues related to LGBTI persons]]. An important current within anarchism is free love.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html |title=The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy |publisher=Ncc-1776.org |date=1996-12-01 |accessdate=2010-09-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101231195631/http://ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html| archivedate= 31 December 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to the early anarchist Josiah Warren and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's [[self-ownership]].

A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the...free-thought / free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''".&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;[[Wendy McElroy]].

Later in the 20th century, Austrian [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] [[Wilhelm Reich]] became a consistent propagandist for sexual freedom going as far as opening free sex-counselling clinics in Vienna for working class patients&lt;ref&gt;Sex-Pol stood for the German Society of Proletarian Sexual Politics. Danto writes that Reich offered a mixture of "psychoanalytic counseling, Marxist advice and contraceptives," and argued for a sexual permissiveness, including for young people and the unmarried, that unsettled other psychoanalysts and the political left. The clinics were immediately overcrowded by people seeking help. Danto, Elizabeth Ann (2007). ''Freud's Free Clinics: Psychoanalysis &amp; Social Justice'', 1918–1938, Columbia University Press, first published 2005., pp. 118–20, 137, 198, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as coining the phrase "[[sexual revolution]]" in one of his books from the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;The Sexual Revolution, 1945 (Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf, translated by Theodore P. Wolfe)&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1970s, the anarchist and pacifist [[Alex Comfort]] achieved international celebrity for writing the sex manuals ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' and ''More Joy of Sex''.

=== Violent and non-violent means ===
{{see also|Anarchism and violence}}
Some libertarian socialists see violent revolution as necessary in the abolition of capitalist society while others advocate non-violent methods. Along with many others, [[Errico Malatesta]] argued that the use of violence was necessary. As he put it in ''[[Umanità Nova]]'' (no. 125, September 6, 1921): {{cquote|It is our aspiration and our aim that everyone should become socially conscious and effective; but to achieve this end, it is necessary to provide all with the means of life and for development, and it is therefore necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence that denies these means to the workers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Umanità Nova]], n. 125, September 6, 1921. A translation can be found at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1921/09/haste.htm The revolutionary haste by Errico Malatesta]. Retrieved June 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon argued in favor of a [[non-violent revolution]] through a process of [[dual power]] in which libertarian socialist institutions would be established and form associations enabling the formation of an expanding network within the existing state capitalist framework with the intention of eventually rendering both the state and the capitalist economy obsolete. The progression towards violence in anarchism stemmed in part from the massacres of some of the communes inspired by the ideas of Proudhon and others. Many anarcho-communists began to see a need for revolutionary violence to counteract the violence inherent in both capitalism and government.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Emma. 'Anarchism and Other Essays' Mother Earth (1910) p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] is a tendency within the anarchist movement which rejects the use of violence in the struggle for social change.&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"&gt;Woodcock&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence "Resisting the Nation State, the pacifist and anarchist tradition" by Geoffrey Ostergaard]. Ppu.org.uk (1945-08-06). Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The main early influences were the thought of [[Henry David Thoreau]]&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; and [[Leo Tolstoy]].&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; It developed "mostly in {{Sic|[[Netherlands|Holland]]}}, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War".&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, p. 21: "Finally, somewhat aside from the curve that runs from [[anarchist individualism]] to [[anarcho-syndicalism]], we come to [[Tolstoyanism]] and to pacifist anarchism that appeared, mostly in [[Netherlands|Holland]] ''(sic)'', Britain, and the United states, before and after the Second World War and which has continued since then in the deep in the anarchist involvement in the protests against nuclear armament."&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the use of violence has not prohibited anarcho-pacifists from accepting the principle of resistance or even [[Nonviolent revolution|revolutionary action]], provided it does not result in violence; it was in fact their approval of such forms of opposition to power that lead many anarcho-pacifists to endorse the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] concept of the general strike as the great revolutionary weapon. Anarcho-pacifists have also come to endorse to non-violent strategy of dual power.

Other anarchists have believed that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified as a way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a [[social revolution]].

{{Green anarchism|Related}}
Green anarchism, or ecoanarchism, is a [[Anarchist schools of thought|school of thought]] within anarchism which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]].

De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]].

For Roderick T. Long, libertarian socialists claim the 17th century [[Levellers|English Levellers]] among their ideological forebears.&lt;ref name="Roderick T 1998. Pg. 310"&gt;Roderick T. Long. "Toward a libertarian theory of class." ''Social Philosophy and Policy''. Volume 15. Issue 02. Summer 1998. p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Various libertarian socialist authors have identified the written work of English Protestant social reformer [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and the social activism of his group (the Diggers) as anticipating this line of thought.&lt;ref&gt;"It was in these conditions of class struggle that, among a whole cluster of radical groups such as the Fifth Monarchy Men, the Levellers and the Ranters, there emerged perhaps the first real proto-anarchists, the Diggers, who like the classical 19th-century anarchists identified political and economic power and who believed that a social, rather than political revolution was necessary for the establishment of justice. Gerrard Winstanley, the Diggers' leader, made an identification with the word of God and the principle of reason, an equivalent philosophy to that found in [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]''. In fact, it seems likely Tolstoy took much of his own inspiration from Winstanley "[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Marlow__Anarchism_and_Christianity.html Marlow. "Anarchism and Christianity"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"While the ideal commonwealth conceived by [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] tried to combine the existence of a powerful state with respect for the political rights of the citizens, [[Thomas Hobbes]] and Gerrard Winstanley, for opposite reasons, denied the possibility of power being shared between the state and the people...Before defining the government of a true Commonwealth Winstanley denounces the kingly government based on property and like Proudhon he believes that "[[property is theft]]". [[Marie Louise Berneri]] "[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Marie_Louise_Berneri__Utopias_of_the_English_Revolution.html#toc10 "Utopias of the English Revolution"]&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchist historian George Woodcock, although Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was [[Gerrard Winstanley]] (1609–c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the [[English Civil War]] and against the inequality that the grandees of the [[New Model Army]] seemed intent on preserving.&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary1"&gt;George Woodcock [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/George_Woodcock__Anarchism.html "Anarchism"]. ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1649–1650, the Diggers squatted on stretches of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on work on the land and the sharing of goods. The communities failed, but a series of pamphlets by Winstanley survived, of which ''The New Law of Righteousness'' (1649) was the most important. Advocating a rational Christianity, Winstanley equated Christ with "the universal liberty" and declared the universally corrupting nature of authority. He saw "an equal privilege to share in the blessing of liberty" and detected an intimate link between the institution of property and the lack of freedom.&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary1"/&gt;

Murray Bookchin said: "In the modern world, anarchism first appeared as a movement of the peasantry and yeomanry against declining feudal institutions. In Germany its foremost spokesman during the Peasant Wars was [[Thomas Muenzer]]. The concepts held by Muenzer and Winstanley were superbly attuned to the needs of their time – a historical period when the majority of the population lived in the countryside and when the most militant revolutionary forces came from an agrarian world. It would be painfully academic to argue whether Muenzer and Winstanley could have achieved their ideals. What is of real importance is that they spoke to their time; their anarchist concepts followed naturally from the rural society that furnished the bands of the peasant armies in Germany and the New Model in England".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Lewis_Herber__Murray_Bookchin___Ecology_and_Revolutionary_Thought.html Lewis Herber.

==== The Enlightenment ====
[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[William Godwin]]]]
For Long, libertarian socialists also often share a view of ancestry in the 18th century [[French Encyclopédistes|French encyclopedists]] alongside [[Thomas Jefferson]]&lt;ref&gt;"It was the great service of liberal thinkers like Jefferson and Paine that they recognized the natural limitations of every form of government. That is why they did not want to see the state become a terrestrial Providence which in its infallibility would make on its own every decision, thereby not only blocking the road to higher forms of social development, but also crippling the natural sense of responsibility of the people which is the essential condition for every prosperous society." Rudolf Rocker. ''[[Pioneers of American Freedom]]: Origin of Liberal and radical thought in America.'' J. J. Lttle Ives &amp; Ives Company, New York. 1949. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Anarchists are simply unterrified Jeffersonian Democrats. They believe that the best government is that which governs least," and that that which governs least is no government at all." Benjamin Tucker. ''Individual Liberty''. New York. Vanguard Press. MCMXXVI. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"At one end of an institutional continuum one can place the total institutions that routinely destroy the autonomy and initiative of their subjects. At the other end of this continuum lies, perhaps, some ideal version of Jeffersonian democracy composed of independent, self-reliant, self-respecting, landowning farmers, managers of their own small enterprises, answerable to themselves, free of debt, and more generally with no institutional reason for servility or deference. Such free-standing farmers, Jefferson thought, were the basis of a vigorous and independent public sphere where citizens could speak their mind without fear or favor. Somewhere in between these two poles lies the contemporary situation of most citizens of Western democracies: a relatively open public sphere but a quotidian institutional experience that is largely at cross purposes with the implicit assumptions behind this public sphere and encouraging and often rewarding caution, deference, servility, and conformity." [[James C. Scott]]. ''[[Two Cheers for Anarchism: Six Easy Pieces on Autonomy, Dignity, and Meaningful Work and Play]]''. Princeton University Press, 2012, pp. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Paine]].&lt;ref name="Roderick T 1998.

Wenzer [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Kenneth_C._Wenzer__Godwin_s_Place_in_the_Anarchist_Tradition___a_Bicentennial_Tribute.html "Godwin's Place in the Anarchist Tradition – a Bicentennial Tribute"]. The anarchist library (2011-02-12). Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; For Woodcock, a more elaborate sketch of anarchism—although still without the name—was provided by [[William Godwin]] in his ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]'' (1793). Godwin was a gradualist anarchist rather than a revolutionary anarchist as he differed from most later anarchists in preferring above revolutionary action the gradual and—as it seemed to him—more natural process of discussion among men of good will, by which he hoped truth would eventually triumph through its own power. Godwin, who was influenced by the English tradition of Dissent and the French philosophy of the Enlightenment, put forward in a developed form the basic anarchist criticisms of the state, of accumulated property and of the delegation of authority through democratic procedure.&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary1"/&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], [[Sylvain Maréchal]] in his ''Manifesto of the Equals'' (1796) demanded "the communal enjoyment of the fruits of the earth" and looked forward to the disappearance of "the revolting distinction of rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors and governed".&lt;ref name="Graham-2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="graham2005-v1"/&gt; The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642 during the English Civil War as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]], used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] against their [[Roundhead]] opponents.&lt;ref name=BBC-Anarchism/&gt; By the time of the French Revolution, some such as the ''[[Enragés]]'' began to use the term positively&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean.

==== Romantic era and utopian socialism ====
[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|thumb|200px|Charles Fourier]]
In his preface to Peter Kropotkin's book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', Kent Bromley considered early French socialist Charles Fourier to be the founder of the libertarian branch of socialist thought as opposed to the [[Authoritarian socialism|authoritarian socialist]] ideas of [[François-Noël Babeuf]] and [[Philippe Buonarroti]].&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter. ''The Conquest of Bread'', preface by Kent Bromley, New York and London, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist [[Hakim Bey]] describes Fourier's ideas as follows: "In Fourier's system of Harmony all creative activity including industry, craft, agriculture, etc. will arise from liberated passion – this is the famous theory of "attractive labor." Fourier sexualizes work itself – the life of the [[Phalanstère|Phalanstery]] is a continual orgy of intense feeling, intellection, &amp; activity, a society of lovers &amp; wild enthusiasts". Fourierism manifested itself in the middle of the 19th century, where hundreds of communes (phalansteries) were founded on Fourierist principles in France, North America, Mexico, South America, Algeria, and Yugoslavia. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, [[Friedrich Engels]] and Peter Kropotkin all read him with fascination as did [[André Breton]] and [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hakim Bey]] (1991) [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__The_Lemonade_Ocean___Modern_Times.html "The Lemonade Ocean &amp; Modern Times"]&lt;/ref&gt; In his influential work ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', [[Herbert Marcuse]] praised Fourier by saying that he "comes closer than any other utopian socialist to elucidating the dependence of freedom on non-repressive [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Marcuse]]. ''[[Eros and Civilization]]''. Beacon Press, Boston, MA, 1955. p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist Peter Sabatini reports that in the United States of early to mid-19th century, "there appeared an array of communal and "utopian" counterculture groups (including the so-called free love movement). [[William Godwin]]'s anarchism exerted an ideological influence on some of this, but more so the socialism of [[Robert Owen]] and Charles Fourier. After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at [[New Harmony, Indiana]] during 1825. One member of this commune was Josiah Warren (1798–1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Peter_Sabatini__Libertarianism__Bogus_Anarchy.html Peter Sabatini.

=== Anarchism ===
{{main|Anarchism}}
As [[Albert Meltzer]] and [[Stuart Christie]] stated in their book ''The Floodgates of Anarchy'':
{{quote|[Anarchism] has its particular inheritance, part of which it shares with socialism, giving it a [[family resemblance]] to certain of its enemies. Another part of its inheritance it shares with [[liberalism]], making it, at birth, kissing-cousins with American-type radical [[individualism]], a large part of which has married out of the family into the [[Right Wing]] and is no longer on speaking terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Floodgates of Anarchy |author1-link=Albert Meltzer|first1=Albert|last1=Meltzer |author2-link=Stuart Christie|first2=Stuart|last2=Christie |year=1970 |page=39}} A Second Edition with a new foreword by the authors was published in 2010 by PM Press, {{ISBN|978-1604861051}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who is often considered the father of modern anarchism, coined the phrase "[[Property is theft]]" to describe part of his view on the complex nature of ownership in relation to freedom. When he said property is theft, he was referring to the capitalist who he believed stole profit from laborers. For Proudhon, the capitalist's employee was "subordinated, exploited: his permanent condition is one of obedience".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://fair-use.org/p-j-proudhon/general-idea-of-the-revolution/organization-of-economic-forces#s3p5 General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'' (1851), Sixth Study, § 3 ¶ 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Kropotkin circa 1900.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Peter Kropotkin, main theorist of [[anarcho-communism]]]]
Seventeen years (1857) after Proudhon first called himself an anarchist (1840), [[anarcho-communist]] [[Joseph Déjacque]] was the first person to describe himself as a libertarian.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Déjacque, [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm "De l'être-humain mâle et femelle–Lettre à P.J. Proudhon"] (1857).&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the United States, "libertarian" generally refers to anti-authoritarian [[anticapitalist|anti-capitalist]] ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126081805/http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA1.html |archivedate=2009-01-26 |title=An Anarchism FAQ – A.1 What is anarchism? |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=January 26, 2009 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian socialism has its roots in both [[classical liberalism]] and socialism, though it is often in conflict with [[liberalism]] (especially [[neoliberalism]] and right-libertarianism) and authoritarian [[state socialism]] simultaneously. While libertarian socialism has roots in both socialism and liberalism, different forms have different levels of influence from the two traditions. For instance, [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] anarchism is more influenced by liberalism while communist and syndicalist anarchism are more influenced by socialism. However, mutualist anarchism has its origins in 18th and 19th century European socialism (such as Fourierian socialism)&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. ''What is Mutualism?''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[Ricardian socialism]]". The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought. 1987. p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; while communist and syndicalist anarchism has its earliest origins in early 18th century liberalism (such as the [[French Revolution]]).&lt;ref name="graham2005-v1"&gt;[[Robert Graham (historian)|Graham, Robert]]. [[Anarchism - A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]] – Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300 CE to 1939), Black Rose Books, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchism posed an early challenge to the [[vanguardism]] and [[statism]] it detected in important sectors of the socialist movement. As such: "The consequences of the growth of parliamentary action, ministerialism, and party life, charged the anarchists, would be de-radicalism and embourgeoisiement. Further, state politics would subvert both true individuality and true community. In response, many anarchists refused Marxist-type organisation, seeking to dissolve or undermine power and hierarchy by way of loose political-cultural groupings, or by championing organisation by a single, simultaneously economic and political administrative unit (Ruhle, [[Syndicalism]]). The power of the intellectual and of science were also rejected by many anarchists: "In conquering the state, in exalting the role of parties, they [intellectuals] reinforce the hierarchical principle embodied in political and administrative institutions". Revolutions could only come through force of circumstances and/or the inherently rebellious instincts of the masses (the "instinct for freedom" (Bakunin, Chomsky)). Thus, in Bakunin's words: "All that individuals can do is to clarify, propagate, and work out ideas corresponding to the popular instinct".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ojeili |first=Chamsy |date= November 2001|title= The "Advance Without Authority": Post-modernism, Libertarian Socialism, and Intellectuals |url=http://www.democracynature.org/vol7/ojeili_intellectuals.htm |journal=Democracy &amp; Nature |volume=7 |issue= 3|doi= 10.1080/10855660120092294|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages= 391–413|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marxism ===
{{main|Libertarian Marxism}}
{{see also|Anarchism and Marxism}}
[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Morris]], early English [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]]]]
Marxism started to develop a libertarian strand of thought after specific circumstances. Chamsy Ojeili said: "One does find early expressions of such perspectives in [[William Morris|(William) Morris]] and the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (the SPGB), then again around the events of 1905, with the growing concern at the bureaucratisation and de-radicalisation of international socialism".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt; Morris established the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] in December 1884, which was encouraged by Friedrich Engels and [[Eleanor Marx]]. As the leading figure in the organization, Morris embarked on a relentless series of speeches and talks on street corners in working men's clubs and lecture theatres across England and Scotland. From 1887, anarchists began to outnumber socialists in the Socialist League.&lt;ref name="Beer, p. 256"&gt;Beer, ''A History of British Socialism,'' vol. 2, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd Annual Conference of the League, held in London on 29 May 1887, marked the change with a majority of the 24 branch delegates voting in favor of an anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring: "This conference endorses the policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto pursued by the League, and sees no sufficient reason for altering it".&lt;ref&gt;''Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 48.'' New York: International Publishers, 2001; p. 538, fn. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris played peacemaker, but he sided with the anti-Parliamentarians, who won control of the League, which consequently lost the support of Engels and saw the departure of Eleanor Marx and her partner [[Edward Aveling]] to form the separate [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)#Anarchist control|Bloomsbury Socialist Society]].
[[File:Zetkin luxemburg1910.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Clara Zetkin]] and Rosa Luxemburg, 1910]]
However, "the most important ruptures are to be traced to the insurgency during and after the First World War. Disillusioned with the capitulation of the social democrats, excited by the emergence of workers' councils, and slowly distanced from Leninism, many communists came to reject the claims of socialist parties and to put their faith instead in the masses". For these socialists, "[t]he intuition of the masses in action can have more genius in it than the work of the greatest individual genius". [[Rosa Luxemburg]]'s workerism and spontaneism are exemplary of positions later taken up by the far-left of the period—[[Antonie Pannekoek]], Roland Holst and [[Herman Gorter]] in the Netherlands, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] in Britain, [[Antonio Gramsci]] in Italy and [[György Lukács]] in Hungary. In these formulations, the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was to be the dictatorship of a class, "not of a party or of a clique".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt; However, within this line of thought "[t]he tension between anti-vanguardism and vanguardism has frequently resolved itself in two diametrically opposed ways: the first involved a drift towards the party; the second saw a move towards the idea of complete proletarian spontaneity...The first course is exemplified most clearly in Gramsci and [[György Lukács|Lukacs]]...The second course is illustrated in the tendency, developing from the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined towards the complete eradication of the party form".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt;

In the emerging [[Soviet Union]], there appeared [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks]] which were a series of [[rebellion]]s and uprisings against the [[Bolsheviks]] led or supported by left-wing groups including [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]],&lt;ref name="carr1985"&gt;Carr, E.H. – The Bolshevik Revolution 1917–1923. W. W. Norton &amp; Company 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], [[Mensheviks]] and [[anarchists]].&lt;ref name="avrich1968"&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]]. "Russian Anarchists and the Civil War", ''Russian Review'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Jul., 1968), pp. 296–306. [[Blackwell Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some were in support of the [[White Movement]] while some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the [[Russian Civil War]] and after until 1922. In response, the Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the government and suppressed them with force. ''[["Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' is a work by [[Vladimir Lenin]] himself attacking assorted critics of the Bolsheviks who claimed positions to their left.

For many Marxian libertarian socialists, "the political bankruptcy of socialist orthodoxy necessitated a theoretical break. This break took a number of forms. The [[Bordigism|Bordigists]] and the SPGB championed a super-Marxian intransigence in theoretical matters. Other socialists made a return "behind Marx" to the [[anti-positivist]] programme of [[German idealism]]. Libertarian socialism has frequently linked its anti-authoritarian political aspirations with this theoretical differentiation from orthodoxy... [[Karl Korsch]]... remained a libertarian socialist for a large part of his life and because of the persistent urge towards theoretical openness in his work. Korsch rejected the eternal and static, and he was obsessed by the essential role of  practice in a theory's truth. For Korsch, no theory could escape history, not even Marxism. In this vein, Korsch even credited the stimulus for Marx's Capital to the movement of the oppressed classes".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt;

In rejecting both capitalism and the state, some libertarian Marxists align themselves with anarchists in opposition to both capitalist [[representative democracy]] and to authoritarian forms of Marxism. Although anarchists and Marxists share an ultimate goal of a stateless society, anarchists criticise most Marxists for advocating a transitional phase under which the state is used to achieve this aim. Nonetheless, libertarian Marxist tendencies such as [[autonomist Marxism]] and council communism have historically been intertwined with the anarchist movement. Anarchist movements have come into conflict with both capitalist and Marxist forces, sometimes at the same time—as in the [[Spanish Civil War]]—though as in that war Marxists themselves are often divided in support or opposition to anarchism. Other political persecutions under bureaucratic parties have resulted in a strong historical antagonism between anarchists and libertarian Marxists on the one hand and Leninist Marxists and their derivatives such as [[Maoism|Maoists]] on the other. In recent history, libertarian socialists have repeatedly formed temporary alliances with [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] groups for the purposes of protest against institutions they both reject. Part of this antagonism can be traced to the [[International Workingmen's Association]], the First International, a congress of [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] workers, where Mikhail Bakunin, who was fairly representative of anarchist views; and [[Karl Marx]], whom anarchists accused of being an "authoritarian", came into conflict on various issues. Bakunin's viewpoint on the illegitimacy of the state as an institution and the role of [[electoral politics]] was starkly counterposed to Marx's views in the First International. Marx and Bakunin's disputes eventually led to Marx taking control of the First International and expelling Bakunin and his followers from the organization. This was the beginning of a long-running feud and schism between libertarian socialists and what they call "authoritarian communists", or alternatively just "authoritarians". Some Marxists have formulated views that closely resemble [[syndicalism]] and thus express more affinity with anarchist ideas. Several libertarian socialists, notably Noam Chomsky, believe that anarchism shares much in common with certain variants of Marxism such as the council communism of Marxist [[Anton Pannekoek]]. In Chomsky's ''[[Notes on Anarchism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Anarchism: From Theory to Practice|date=1970|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=0-85345-128-1|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1970----.htm|authorlink=Noam Chomsky|editor1-last=Guérin |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-link= Daniel Guérin|accessdate=22 May 2014|chapter=Notes on Anarchism}}&lt;/ref&gt; he suggests the possibility "that some form of council communism is the natural form of [[revolutionary socialism]] in an [[industrialization|industrial]] society. It reflects the belief that democracy is severely limited when the industrial system is controlled by any form of autocratic elite, whether of owners, managers, and technocrats, a '[[Vanguard party|vanguard' party]], or a State bureaucracy".

In the mid-20th century, some libertarian socialist groups emerged from disagreements with [[Trotskyism]] which presented itself as Leninist anti-Stalinism. As such, the French group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] emerged from the [[Trotskyist]] [[Fourth International]], where [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Claude Lefort]] constituted a Chaulieu–Montal tendency in the French [[Internationalist Communist Party|Parti Communiste Internationaliste]] in 1946. In 1948, they experienced their "final disenchantment with Trotskyism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; leading them to break away to form Socialisme ou Barbarie, whose journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later said of this period that "the main audience of the group and of the journal was formed by groups of the old, radical left: Bordigists, council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German "left" of the 1920s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Castoriadis |first= Cornelius |title=An Interview | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23}}, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the United Kingdom, the group [[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]] was founded in 1960 by a small group of expelled members of the [[Trotskyist]] [[Socialist Labour League]]. Almost from the start it was strongly influenced by the French Socialisme ou Barbarie group, in particular by its intellectual leader Cornelius Castoriadis, whose essays were among the many pamphlets Solidarity produced. The intellectual leader of the group was [[Chris Pallis]], who wrote under the name Maurice Brinton.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Pallis|Brinton, Maurice]] (Goodway, David ed). ''For Workers' Power: the selected writings of Maurice Brinton''. [[AK Press]]. 2004. {{ISBN|1-904859-07-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) since 1967, the terms [[Ultra-leftism|ultra-left]] and [[Left communism|left communist]] refers to political theory and practice self-defined as further "[[Left-wing politics|left]]" than that of the central Maoist leaders at the height of the GPCR ("[[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]]"). The terms are also used retroactively to describe some early 20th century [[Chinese anarchist]] orientations. As a slur, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has used the term "ultra-left" more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further "left" than the [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. According to the latter usage, in 1978 the CPC [[Central Committee]] denounced as "ultra-left" the line of [[Mao Zedong]] from 1956 until his death in 1976. "Ultra-left" refers to those GPCR rebel positions that diverged from the central Maoist line by identifying an [[antagonistic contradiction]] between the CPC-PRC [[party-state]] itself and the [[Hoi polloi|masses]] of workers and "peasants"&lt;ref&gt;"Peasant (农民)" was the official term for workers on [[people's commune]]s. According to the Ultra-Left, both peasants and (urban) workers together composed a [[proletarian]] [[Social class|class]] divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution.&lt;/ref&gt; conceived as a single proletarian class divorced from any meaningful control over production or distribution. Whereas the central Maoist line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the party's mediation, the ultra-left argued that the objective interests of bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however "red" a given bureaucrat's "thought" might be. Whereas the central Maoist leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary "ideas" and "habits" among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to "turn over a new leaf" after they had undergone "[[Mind control|thought reform]]", the ultra-left argued that "cultural revolution" had to give way to "political revolution" —"in which one class overthrows another class".&lt;ref&gt;See for instance [http://www.marxists.de/china/sheng/whither.htm "Whither China?"] by Yang Xiguang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 70s Collective, ed. 1996.

In 1969, French [[platformist]] anarcho-communist [[Daniel Guerin]] published an essay called "Libertarian Marxism?" in which he dealt with the debate between Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin at the First International and afterwards he suggested that "Libertarian marxism rejects determinism and fatalism, giving the greater place to individual will, intuition, imagination, reflex speeds, and to the deep instincts of the masses, which are more far-seeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings of the 'elites'; libertarian marxism thinks of the effects of surprise, provocation and boldness, refuses to be cluttered and paralysed by a heavy 'scientific' apparatus, doesn't equivocate or bluff, and guards itself from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Libertarian_Marxism_.html |title=Libertarian Marxism? by Daniel Guerin |publisher=Theanarchistlibrary.org |date=2011-04-23 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, from 1970 to 1981 there existed the publication ''Root &amp; Branch''&lt;ref&gt;[https://libcom.org/tags/root-branch Root &amp; Branch at libcom.org]&lt;/ref&gt; which had as a subtitle "A Libertarian Marxist Journal".&lt;ref&gt;[https://libcom.org/library/root-branch-7 ''Root &amp; Branch'' # 7 at libcom.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the journal ''[[Libertarian Communism (journal)|Libertarian Communism]]'' was started in the United Kingdom by a group inside the SPGB.&lt;ref&gt;"papers relating to Libertarian Communism (a splinter group of the SPGB) including journals and miscellaneous correspondence, 1970–1980 (1 box)"[[Socialist Party of Great Britain|"Socialist Party of Great Britain" at Archives Hub at the Great Research Centre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonomist Marxism, [[neo-Marxism]] and [[Situationist International|Situationist theory]] are also regarded as being [[anti-authoritarian]] variants of Marxism that are firmly within the libertarian socialist tradition. As such, "[i]n New Zealand, no situationist group was formed, despite the attempts of Grant McDonagh. Instead, McDonagh operated as an individual on the periphery of the anarchist milieu, co-operating with anarchists to publish several magazines, such as Anarchy and KAT. The latter called itself 'an anti-authoritarian spasmodical' of the 'libertarian ultra-left (situationists, anarchists and libertarian socialists)'".&lt;ref&gt;Toby Boraman.

== Notable libertarian socialist tendencies ==
=== Classical anarchist tendencies ===
In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical—those created throughout the 19th century—and post-classical anarchist schools, i.e. those created since the mid-20th century and after.

==== Mutualism ====
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]
Mutualism is a political and economic theory largely associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Proudhon argued that "all capital, whether material or mental, being the result of collective labour, is, in consequence, collective property".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. 'What is Property?'&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that artisans would manage the tools required for their own work while in large-scale enterprises this meant replacing wage labour by workers' co-operatives. He argued "it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers... because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two... castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''The General Idea of the revolution'' Freedom Press (1923)&lt;/ref&gt; As he put it in 1848: "Under the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour, so cannot become a cause of inequality.... We are socialists... under universal association, ownership of the land and of the instruments of labour is ''social'' ownership... We want the mines, canals, railways handed over to democratically organised workers' associations... We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies, joined together in the common bond of the democratic and social Republic".&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. 'Oeuvres Complètes' (Lacroix edition), volume 17, pp. 188–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutualists believe that a free labor market would allow for conditions of equal income in proportion to exerted labor.&lt;ref name="Tandy-96 paragraphs"&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10, 15, 19 &amp; 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Meek &amp; Oppenheimer) {{ISBN|1-4196-5869-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Jonathan Beecher puts it, Proudhon's aim was to "emancipate labor from the constraints imposed by capital".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beecher |first=Jonathan F. |title=Victor Considerant and the Rise and Fall of French Romantic Socialism |year=2001 |page=155 |publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-22297-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon supported individual possession of land and argued that the "land is indispensable to our existence, consequently a common thing, consequently insusceptible of appropriation".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He believed that an individual only had a right to land while he was using or occupying it. If the individual ceases doing so, it reverts to unowned land.&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. [http://www.panarchy.org/swartz/mutualism.6.html What is Mutualism? VI. Land and Rent]&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists hold a [[labor theory of value]], arguing that in exchange labor should always be worth "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility"&lt;ref name="Tandy-96 para15"&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and considering anything less to be exploitation, theft of labor, or [[usury]]. Mutualists oppose the institutions by which individuals gain income through loans, investments and rent as they believe the income received through these activities is not in direct accord with labor spent.&lt;ref name="Tandy-96 para19"&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb &amp; Oppenheimer) {{ISBN|1-4196-5869-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In place of these capitalist institutions, they advocate [[Worker cooperative|labor-owned cooperative firms]] and associations.&lt;ref&gt;Hymans, E., ''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', pp. 190–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, pp. 110, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists advocate mutual banks, owned by the workers, that do not charge interest on secured loans. Most mutualists believe that anarchy should be achieved gradually rather than through revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutualist.org/ Free Market Anti-Capitalism]. Mutualist.Org. Retrieved on 2011-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[individualist anarchists]], such as Benjamin Tucker, were influenced by Proudhon's mutualism, but they did not call for "association" in large enterprises like him.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutualist ideas found a fertile ground in the 19th century in Spain. In Spain, [[Ramón de la Sagra]] established anarchist journal ''El Porvenir'' in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon's ideas.&lt;ref name="britannica.com Spain"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22753/anarchism/66525/Anarchism-in-Spain#ref539322 "Anarchism" at the ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]'' online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Catalan politician [[Francesc Pi i Margall]] became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: a history of libertarian movements''. p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to George Woodcock, "[t]hese translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; According to the ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]'': "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralized, or "[[Cantonalism|cantonalist]]", political system on Proudhonian lines".&lt;ref name="britannica.com Spain"/&gt; [[Kevin Carson]] is a contemporary mutualist theorist who is the author of ''[[Studies in Mutualist Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Carson]]. [http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'']. {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v8wrbTrn?url=http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html|date=December 21, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Collectivist anarchism ====
{{main|Collectivist anarchism}}
[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|left|upright|Mikhail Bakunin]]
Collectivist anarchism (also known as anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. Marx in Context. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; doctrine that advocates the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]] and private ownership of the [[means of production]]. Instead, it envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers would revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref&gt;Bakunin Mikail. Bakunin on Anarchism. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with anarcho-communism where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods "to each according to his need". Notwithstanding the title, Bakunin's collectivist anarchism is thus seen as a blend of individualism and [[collectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Morriss, Brian. Bakukunin: The Philosophy of Freedom. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin, the anti-authoritarian sections of the [[First International]]; and the early [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist movement]].

==== Anarcho-communism ====
{{main|Anarcho-communism}}
[[File:ErricoMalatesta.gif|thumb|upright|Errico Malatesta, influential Italian activist and theorist of anarcho-communism]]
Anarcho-communism (also known as anarchist communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state, markets, money, capitalism and private property (while retaining respect for [[personal property]])&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"&gt;"The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business.

It is nonsense to speak of "emphatically prioritizing the social over the individual,"... You may as well speak of prioritizing the chicken over the egg. Anarchy is a "method of individualization."

I am a Communist because I am an Individualist.

{{Anarcho-communism sidebar|Related}}
To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e. established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon) are the anarchist territories during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;"This process of education and class organization, more than any single factor in Spain, produced the collectives. And to the degree that the CNT-FAI (for the two organizations became fatally coupled after July 1936) exercised the major influence in an area, the collectives proved to be generally more durable, communist and resistant to Stalinist counterrevolution than other republican-held areas of Spain". Murray Bookchin.

Through the efforts and influence of the [[Spanish anarchists]] during the Spanish Revolution within the [[Spanish Civil War]], starting in 1936 anarcho-communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia and in the stronghold of [[anarchist Catalonia]] before being crushed by the combined forces of [[Francoism]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Communist Party of Spain]] repression (backed by the [[Soviet Union]]) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the [[Spanish Republic]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin.

During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as [[Nestor Makhno]] worked to create and defend—through the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]—anarcho-communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921. Anarcho-communist currents include [[platformism]] and insurrectionary anarchism.

==== Within individualist anarchism ====
{{main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and his or her [[will (philosophy)|will]] over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems.&lt;ref name="ryner"&gt;"What do I mean by individualism? I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience."[https://web.archive.org/web/20171017134540/https://www.marxists.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty.

While not against the market and property he was firmly against capitalism as it was, in his eyes, a state-supported monopoly of social capital (tools, machinery, etc.) which allows owners to exploit their employees, i.e., to avoid paying workers the full value of their labour. He thought that the "labouring classes are deprived of their earnings by usury in its three forms, interest, rent and profit", therefore "''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' will abolish interest; it will abolish profit; it will abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any labourer can be deprived of any of his product". This stance puts him squarely in the libertarian socialist tradition and Tucker referred to himself many times as a socialist and considered his philosophy to be "Anarchistic socialism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG5 "Benjamin Tucker: Capitalist or Anarchist"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107013451/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionG5 |date=2012-01-07 }} in ''An Anarchist FAQ'' by Various Authors&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The economic principles of Modern Socialism are a logical deduction from the principle laid down by Adam Smith in the early chapters of his "Wealth of Nations," – namely, that labor is the true measure of price...Half a century or more after Smith enunciated the principle above stated, Socialism picked it up where he had dropped it, and in following it to its logical conclusions, made it the basis of a new economic philosophy...This seems to have been done independently by three different men, of three different nationalities, in three different languages: Josiah Warren, an American; Pierre J. Proudhon, a Frenchman; Karl Marx, a German Jew...That the work of this interesting trio should have been done so nearly simultaneously would seem to indicate that Socialism was in the air, and that the time was ripe and the conditions favorable for the appearance of this new school of thought...So far as priority of time is concerned, the credit seems to belong to Warren, the American, – a fact which should be noted by the stump orators who are so fond of declaiming against Socialism as an imported article."

[[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Émile Armand]] shows clearly opposition to capitalism and centralized economies when he said that the individualist anarchist "inwardly he remains refractory – fatally refractory – morally, intellectually, economically (The capitalist economy and the directed economy, the speculators and the fabricators of single are equally repugnant to him.)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/library/emile-armand/life-activity.html |title="Anarchist Individualism as a Life and Activity" by Emile Armand |publisher=Spaz.org |date=March 1, 2002 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish individualist anarchist [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] thought that "capitalism is an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired.

La lucha, pero de conciencias, es contra el Estado."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; His view on class division and [[technocracy]] are as follows: "Since when no one works for another, the profiteer from wealth disappears, just as government will disappear when no one pays attention to those who learned four things at universities and from that fact they pretend to govern men. Big industrial enterprises will be transformed by men in big associations in which everyone will work and enjoy the product of their work. And from those easy as well as beautiful problems anarchism deals with and he who puts them in practice and lives them are anarchists.... The priority which without rest an anarchist must make is that in which no one has to exploit anyone, no man to no man, since that non-exploitation will lead to the limitation of property to individual needs".&lt;ref&gt;"¿La propiedad? ¡Bah! No es problema. Porque cuando nadie trabaje para nadie, el acaparador de la riqueza desaparece, como ha de desaparecer el gobierno cuando nadie haga caso a los que aprendieron cuatro cosas en las universidades y por ese sólo hecho pretenden gobernar a los hombres. Porque si en la tierra de los ciegos el tuerto es rey, en donde todos ven y juzgan y disciernen, el rey estorba. Y de lo que se trata es de que no haya reyes porque todos sean hombres. Las grandes empresas industriales las transformarán los hombres en grandes asociaciones donde todos trabajen y disfruten del producto de su trabajo. Y de esos tan sencillos como hermosos problemas trata el anarquismo y al que lo cumple y vive es al que se le llama anarquista...El hincapié que sin cansancio debe hacer el anarquista es el de que nadie debe explotar a nadie, ningún hombre a ningún hombre, porque esa no-explotación llevaría consigo la limitación de la propiedad a las necesidades individuales."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt;

The anarchist&lt;ref&gt;"The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]''. Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890s, and he greatly admired [[Kropotkin]], whom he had met. Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one "of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience" and talked of him as "a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia." But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant." George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (p. 447)&lt;/ref&gt; writer and [[bohemianism|Bohemian]] [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote in his famous essay ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' that "[a]rt is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/hist_texts/wilde_soul.html |title=The soul of man under Socialism by Oscar Wilde |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |accessdate=2013-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914032335/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/hist_texts/wilde_soul.html |archivedate=2013-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchist historian George Woodcock, "Wilde's aim in ''The Soul of Man under Socialism'' is to seek the society most favorable to the artist... for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated.... Wilde represents the anarchist as [[aesthete]]".&lt;ref&gt;George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (p. 447)&lt;/ref&gt; In a socialist society, people will have the possibility to realise their talents as "each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society". Wilde added that "upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments "armed with economic power as they are now with political power" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that "of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type" a critique which is "quite true".&lt;ref name="The Soul of Man"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde |title=The Soul of Man |publisher=Libcom.org |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul. He ended by declaring: "The new individualism is the new hellenism".&lt;ref name="The Soul of Man"/&gt;

==== Anarcho-syndicalism ====
{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
[[File:Manifestación CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|[[International Workers' Day|May Day]] demonstration of Spanish anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in [[Bilbao]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] in 2010]]
Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the [[labor union|labor movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Sorel, Georges. 'Political Theorists in Context' Routledge (2004) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-syndicalists view [[trade union|labor unions]] as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers.

The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers' [[Wiktionary:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[direct action]] and [[workers' self-management]]. Workers' solidarity means that anarcho-syndicalists believe all workers—no matter their race, gender, or ethnic group—are in a similar situation in regard to their [[Wiktionary:Boss|boss]] ([[class consciousness]]). Furthermore, it means that within capitalism any gains or losses made by some workers from or to bosses would eventually affect all workers. Therefore, to [[Wiktionary:Liberate|liberate]] themselves all workers must support one another in their [[class conflict]]. Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action—that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—will allow workers to liberate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which in anarcho-syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.

Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The [[International Workers Association]] (IWA) is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries. The Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labor movement. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

=== Libertarian Marxist tendencies ===
{{main|Libertarian Marxism}}
Libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the anti-authoritarian aspects of [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Outside and against this process of turning of Marxism into an ideology of domination, however, were various revolutionary tendencies which still drew on Marx's work to inform their struggles and which rejected both social- democratic and [[Marxist-Leninist]] versions of his theory. The most interesting of these, those that are relevant to my current purpose, have been those which insisted on the primacy of the self-activity and creativity of people in struggle against capitalism. Within the space of these tendencies there has developed a coherent critique of "orthodox Marxism" that includes not only a rejection of the concept of "the transition" but a reconceptualization of the process of transcending capitalism that has remarkable similarities to Kropotkin's thinking on this subject. ... Thus one of the earliest political tendencies within which this approach appeared after the Russian revolution of 1917 was that of "[[Council Communism]]" which saw the "workers councils" in Germany (see [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]), or the [[soviets]] in Russia, as new organizational forms constructed by the people. As with the anarchists, they too saw the Bolshevik take-over of the soviets (like that of the trade unions) as subverting the revolution and beginning the restoration of domination and exploitation. ... Over the years this emphasis on working class autonomy has resulted in a reinterpretation of Marxist theory that has brought out the two-sided character of the class struggle and shifted the focus from capital (the preoccupation of orthodox Marxism) to the workers. ... As a result, not only has there been a recognition that capitalism seeks to subordinate everyone's life (from the traditional factory proletariat to peasants, housewives and students) but that all those peoples' struggles involve both the resistance to this subordination and the effort to construct alternative ways of being."[[Harry Cleaver|Cleaver, Harry]].

==== De Leonism ====
{{main|De Leonism}}
De Leonism, occasionally known as Marxism–De Leonism, is a form of [[syndicalist]] Marxism developed by [[Daniel De Leon]]. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] (SLP). De Leon combined the rising theories of syndicalism in his time with [[orthodox Marxism]]. According to De Leonist theory, militant [[industrial unions]] (specialized trade unions) are the vehicle of [[class struggle]]. Industrial unions serving the interests of the [[proletariat]] will bring about the change needed to establish a socialist system. The only way this differs from some currents in anarcho-syndicalism is that according to De Leonist thinking a revolutionary political party is also necessary to fight for the proletariat on the political field. De Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. It predates Leninism as De Leonism's principles developed in the early 1890s with De Leon's assuming leadership of the SLP whereas Leninism and its [[vanguard party]] idea took shape after the 1902 publication of Lenin's ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]''. The highly [[decentralized]] and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the [[democratic centralism]] of Marxism–Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other [[communist state]]s. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution.

==== Council communism ====
{{main|Council Communism}}
&lt;!-- [[File:Antonie Pannekoek.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Antonie Pannekoek, one of the main theorists of council communism]] --&gt;
Council communism was a radical left-wing movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD). Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within Marxism and also within libertarian socialism. In contrast to those of social democracy and Leninist communism, the central argument of council communism is that [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural and legitimate form of [[working class]] organisation and government power. This view is opposed to the reformist and [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] stress on [[Vanguardism|vanguard parties]], parliaments, or the state. The core principle of council communism is that the state and the economy should be managed by [[workers' councils]], composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose state-run "bureaucratic socialism". They also oppose the idea of a "revolutionary party" since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party [[dictatorship]]. Council communists support a workers' democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.

The Russian word for council is "[[Soviet (council)|soviet]]" and during the early years of the revolution worker's councils were politically significant in Russia. It was to take advantage of the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of workplace power that the word became used by [[Vladimir Lenin]] for various political organs. Indeed, the name "[[Supreme Soviet]]", by which the parliament was called; and that of the Soviet Union itself make use of this terminology, but they do not imply any decentralization. Furthermore, council communists held a critique of the Soviet Union as a capitalist state, believing that the Bolshevik revolution in Russia became a "[[bourgeois]] revolution" when a party bureaucracy replaced the old [[feudal]] [[aristocracy]]. Although most felt the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] was working class in character, they believed that since capitalist relations still existed (because the workers had no say in running the economy), the Soviet Union ended up as a [[state capitalist]] country, with the state replacing the individual capitalist. Council communists thus support workers' revolutions, but oppose one-party dictatorships. Council communists also believed in diminishing the role of the party to one of [[agitprop|agitation]] and [[propaganda]], rejected all participation in elections or parliament and argued that workers should leave the reactionary trade unions and form one big revolutionary union.

==== Left communism ====
{{main|Left communism}}
{{Left communism sidebar|Related}}
Left communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks at certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first and during its second congress. Left communists see themselves to the left of Leninists (whom they tend to see as "left of capital", not socialists), anarchists (some of whom they consider internationalist socialists) as well as some other revolutionary socialist tendencies (for example [[De Leonism|De Leonists]], who they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances). Although she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has heavily influenced most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga, [[Herman Gorter]], Anton Pannekoek, [[Otto Rühle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Paul Mattick]].

Prominent [[list of left communist internationals|left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Current]] and the [[International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party]]. Different factions from the old Bordigist [[International Communist Party]] are also considered left communist organizations.

==== Johnson–Forest tendency ====
{{main|Johnson–Forest tendency}}
The Johnson–Forest tendency, sometimes called the Johnsonites, refers to a radical left tendency in the United States associated with Marxist theorists [[C. L. R. James|C.L.R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], who used the pseudonyms J. R. Johnson and Freddie Forest respectively. They were joined by [[Grace Lee Boggs]], a Chinese American woman who was considered the third founder. After leaving the trotskist [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], Johnson–Forest founded their own organization for the first time, called Correspondence. This group changed its named to the [[Correspondence Publishing Committee]] the next year.  However, tensions that had surfaced earlier presaged a split, which took place in 1955. Through his theoretical and political work of the late 1940s, James had concluded that a vanguard party was no longer necessary because its teachings had been absorbed in the masses. In 1956, James would see the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] as confirmation of this. Those who endorsed the politics of James took the name [[Facing Reality]] after the 1958 book by James co-written with Grace Lee Boggs and Pierre Chaulieu (a pseudonym for [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) on the Hungarian working class revolt of 1956.

==== Socialisme ou Barbarie ====
{{main|Socialisme ou Barbarie}}
[[File:Cornelius Castoriadis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Cornelius Castoriadis]], libertarian socialist theorist]]
Socialisme ou Barbarie ("Socialism or Barbarism") was a French-based radical libertarian socialist group of the post-[[World War II]] period (the name comes from a phrase Friedrich Engels used and was cited by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] in the 1916 essay ''The Junius Pamphlet'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg: The Junius Pamphlet (Chap.1) |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It existed from 1948 until 1965. The animating personality was [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], also known as Pierre Chaulieu or Paul Cardan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dick Howard | title=Introduction to Castoriadis | journal=Telos | year=1975 | issue=23 | page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he explicitly both rejected Leninist vanguardism and criticised spontaneism, for Castoriadis "the emancipation of the mass of people was the task of those people; however, the socialist thinker could not simply fold his or her arms". Castoriadis argued that the special place accorded to the intellectual should belong to each autonomous citizen. However, he rejected ''attentisme'', maintaining that in the struggle for a new society intellectuals needed to "place themselves at a distance from the everyday and from the real".&lt;ref name="Advance Without Authority"/&gt; Political philosopher [[Claude Lefort]] was impressed by Cornelius Castoriadis when he first met him. They published ''On the Regime and Against the Defence of the USSR'', a critique of both the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] supporters. They suggested that the Soviet Union was dominated by a social layer of bureaucrats and that it consisted of a new kind of society as aggressive as Western European societies. Later, he also published in ''Socialisme ou Barbarie''.

==== Situationist International ====
{{main|Situationist International}}
The Situationist International was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957 and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented [[general strike|general]] [[wildcat strikes]] of [[May 1968 in France]].

With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th century European artistic [[avant-garde]]s, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the capitalist order, for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose, they suggested and experimented with the "construction of situations", namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. In this vein, a major theorectical work which emerged from this group was [[Raoul Vaneigem]]'s ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raoul Vaneigem]]. [http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/raoul-vaneigem-the-revolution-of-everyday-life '[The Revolution of Everyday Life''].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Situationists|Related}}
They fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in [[advanced capitalism]]. Their critical theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]]. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like [[mass media]] and advertising have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. To overthrow such a system, the Situationist International supported the May 1968 revolts and asked the workers to [[Council for Maintaining the Occupations|occupy the factories]] and to run them with direct democracy through [[workers' councils]] composed by instantly revocable delegates.

==== Autonomism ====
{{main|Autonomism}}
[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|upright|Antonio Negri, main theorist of Italian autonomism]]
Autonomism refers to a set of left-wing political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency|Johnson–Forest tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]. Later, post-Marxist and anarchist tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian far-left movements in the 1970s and the emergence of a number of important theorists including Antonio Negri, who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'' as well as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Paolo Virno]] and [[Franco Berardi|Franco "Bifo" Berardi]].

Unlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a "bottom up" theory which draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working and socialization in the workplace.

All this influenced the German and Dutch autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]] and today is influential in Italy, France and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The autonomist Marxist and autonomen movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English-speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as autonomists. The Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]]. Today, it is associated also with the publication ''[[Multitudes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multitudes.samizdat.net/ Webpage of ''[[Multitudes]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who signed it there was the CNT General Secretary (1922–1923) Joan Peiro, [[Angel Pestaña]] (General Secretary in 1929) and Juan Lopez Sanchez. Their current was called ''treintismo'' and they called for a more moderate political line within the Spanish anarchist movement. In 1932, they established the [[Syndicalist Party]] which participated in the [[Spanish general election, 1936|1936 Spanish general election]] and proceeded to be a part of the leftist coalition of parties known as the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]], obtaining two congressmen (Pestaña and Benito Pabon). In 1938, Horacio Prieto, general secretary of the CNT, proposed that the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]] transform itself into a libertarian socialist party and that it participate in national elections.&lt;ref name=Renof&gt;Israël Renof, ''Possibilisme libertaire'', [[Noir et Rouge]], n°41, mai 1968, pp. 16–23, [http://archivesautonomies.org/IMG/pdf/anarchismes/noiretrouge/NR-n41.pdf lire en ligne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311055515/http://archivesautonomies.org/IMG/pdf/anarchismes/noiretrouge/NR-n41.pdf |date=2016-03-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1936, the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front government]] appointed the prominent anarcha-feminist [[Federica Montseny]] as Minister of Health.

In 1950, a clandestine group formed within the Francophone [[Anarchist Federation (France)|Anarchist Federation]] (FA) called Organisation Pensée Bataille (OPB) led by the [[Platformism|platformist]] George Fontenis.&lt;ref name="public.federation-anarchiste.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014916/http://public.federation-anarchiste.org/IMG/pdf/Cedric_Guerin_Histoire_du_mvt_libertaire_1950_1970.pdf Cédric Guerin. "Pensée et action des anarchistes en France : 1950–1970"]&lt;/ref&gt; The OPB pushed for a move which saw the FA change its name into the Fédération Communiste Libertaire (FCL) after the 1953 Congress in Paris while an article in ''Le Libertaire'' indicated the end of the cooperation with the French [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] Group led by André Breton. The new decision-making process was founded on [[unanimity]], as each person had a right of veto on the orientations of the federation. The FCL published the same year the ''Manifeste du communisme libertaire''. Several groups quit the FCL in December 1955, disagreeing with the decision to present "revolutionary candidates" at the legislative elections. On 15–20 August 1954, the 5th intercontinental plenum of the CNT took place. A group called Entente anarchiste (Anarchist Agreement) appeared, which was formed of militants who did not like the new ideological orientation that the OPB was giving the FCL, considering it authoritarian and almost Marxist.&lt;ref&gt;''"Si la critique de la déviation autoritaire de la FA est le principal fait de ralliement, on peut ressentir dès le premier numéro un état d'esprit qui va longtemps coller à la peau des anarchistes français. Cet état d'esprit se caractérise ainsi sous une double forme : d'une part un rejet inconditionnel de l'ennemi marxiste, d'autre part des questions sur le rôle des anciens et de l'évolution idéologique de l'anarchisme. C'est Fernand Robert qui attaque le premier : "Le LIB est devenu un journal marxiste. En continuant à le soutenir, tout en reconnaissant qu'il ne nous plaît pas, vous faîtes une mauvaise action contre votre idéal anarchiste. Vous donnez la main à vos ennemis dans la pensée. Même si la FA disparaît, même si le LIB disparaît, l'anarchie y gagnera. Le marxisme ne représente plus rien. Il faut le mettre bas ; je pense la même chose des dirigeants actuels de la FA.

There was a strong left-libertarian current in the British labour movement and the term "libertarian socialist" has been applied to a number of [[democratic socialist]]s, including some prominent members of the [[British Labour Party]]. The [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] was formed in 1885 by [[William Morris]] and others critical of the authoritarian socialism of the [[Social Democratic Federation]]. It was involved in the [[New Unionism]], the rank-and-file union militancy of the 1880s–1890s, which anticipated syndicalism in some key ways ([[Tom Mann]], a New Unionist leader, was one of the first British syndicalists). The Socialist League was dominated by anarchists by the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Quail |title=The Slow-Burning Fuse |publisher= Paladin |date= 1978 |ISBN=0-586-08225-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) formed at that time drew more on the [[nonconformist]] religious traditions in the British working class than on Marxist theory and had a libertarian socialist strain. Others in the tradition of the ILP and described as libertarian socialists included [[Michael Foot]] and most importantly, [[G. D. H. Cole]]. Labour Party minister [[Peter Hain]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.chartist.org.uk/articles/britpol/july_hain.html "Rediscovering our libertarian roots" by Peter Hain]&lt;/ref&gt; has written in support of libertarian socialism, identifying an axis involving a "bottom-up vision of socialism, with anarchists at the [[revolutionary]] end and democratic socialists [such as himself] at its [[reformism|reformist]] end" as opposed to the axis of [[state socialism]] with Marxist–Leninists at the revolutionary end and social democrats at the reformist end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hain |first=Peter |title=Ayes to the Left: A Future for Socialism |year=1995 |publisher=Lawrence and Wishart|isbn=978-0-85315-832-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent mainstream Labour politician who has been described as a libertarian socialist is [[Robin Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]] said in 2005 that in recent years Cook had been setting out a vision of "libertarian, democratic socialism that was beginning to break the sometimes sterile boundaries of 'old' and 'New' Labour labels.".{{cite news |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article304442.ece |title=Chris Smith: The House of Commons was Robin Cook's true home – Commentators, Opinion – Independent.co.uk |publisher=Comment.independent.co.uk |date=2005-08-08 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930170828/http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article304442.ece |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Defined in this way, libertarian socialism in the contemporary political mainstream is distinguished from modern social democracy and democratic socialism principally by its political decentralism rather than by its economics.

Negative freedom is according to Halsema the freedom citizens from government influence; she applies this concept especially to the multicultural society and the rechtsstaat, where the government should protect the rights of citizens and not limit them. Positive freedom is the emancipation of citizens from poverty and discrimination. Halsema wants to apply this concept to welfare state and the environment where government should take more action.

In the Spanish autonomous community of [[Catalonia]], ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' reports about the contemporary political party [[Popular Unity Candidacy|Candidatura d'Unitat Popular]] (or CUP) that:
{{quote|A libertarian socialist and even anarcho-syndicalist character permeates CUP, in the anti-authoritarian tradition of the Catalan left — embodied by Civil War-era organizations like the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT), which was anarcho-syndicalist, or Trotskyists like [[Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista]] (POUM). [...] cooperatives and popular cultural centers (''casals'' and ''ateneus populars'') flourished in the late 1990s and 2000s as safe havens for radical socialist communities, economic alternatives, and ideological formations. Many revolutionary youth organizations were born in these cultural centers. [...] In addition to the network of popular cultural centers, the emergence of squatted houses — also known as "self-managed social centers" — further extended this radical sensibility in Catalonia. While not all squatted houses are aligned with separatist socialism, some of the most emblematic houses are more identified with the separatist movement, like the squatted house of [[Can Vies]] in Barcelona. [...] Every local assembly represents the essential unit of this popular unity. It represents the neighborhood, the village, the town. [...] Assemblies are sovereign and potentially powerful.

==== Georgism ====
{{main|Georgism|Henry George}}
Georgism (also called Geoism or Geonomics) is an [[Economics|economic philosophy]] and [[ideology]] which holds that people own what they create, but that things found in nature, most importantly [[land (economics)|land]], belong equally to all.&lt;ref name=Heavey&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heavey  |first=Jerome F. |title=Comments on Warren Samuels' "Why the Georgist movement has not succeeded" |journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology |date=July 2003  |volume=62 |series= |issue=3 |pages=593–99 |jstor=3487813 |quote=human beings have an inalienable right to the product of their own labor |doi=10.1111/1536-7150.00230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgist philosophy is based on the writings of the economist [[Henry George]] (1839–1897) and is usually associated with the idea of a [[single tax]] on the value of land. His most famous work, ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' (1879), is a treatise on inequality, the [[business cycle|cyclic nature]] of [[industrialized country|industrialized economies]] and the use of the land value tax as a remedy. Georgists argue that a [[Land value tax|tax on land value]] is [[Economic efficiency|economically efficient]], [[Justice|fair]] and [[Equity (economics)|equitable]]; and that it can generate sufficient revenue so that other taxes (e.g. taxes on profits, sales or income), which are less fair and efficient, can be reduced or eliminated. A tax on land value has been described by many as a [[Progressive taxation|progressive tax]] since it would be [[tax burden|paid]] primarily by the wealthy and would reduce [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref name="McCluskey and Franzsen"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jkogP2U4k0AC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=disadvantages+of+land+value+taxation#PPA4,M1 |title=Land Value Taxation: An Applied Analysis, William J.

Georgist ideas heavily influenced the politics of the early 20th century. Political parties that were formed based on Georgist ideas include the [[Commonwealth Land Party (United States)|Commonwealth Land Party]], the [[Justice Party of Denmark]], the [[Henry George Justice Party]] and the [[Single Tax League]]. Several communities were also initiated with Georgist principles during the height of the philosophy's popularity. Two such communities that still exist are [[Arden, Delaware]], which was founded in 1900 by [[George Francis Stephens|Frank Stephens]] and [[Will Price]]; and [[Fairhope, Alabama]], which was founded in 1894 by the auspices of the [[Fairhope Single Tax Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairhopesingletax.com |title=Fairhope Single Tax Corporation |publisher=Fairhopesingletax.com |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy was enthused by the economic thinking of Henry George, incorporating it approvingly into later works such as ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'', the book that played a major factor in his [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wenzer |first= Kenneth C. |year= 1997 |title= Tolstoy's Georgist Spiritual Political Economy (1897–1910): Anarchism and Land Reform |journal= [[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]] |volume= 56 |issue= 4, Oct |jstor= 3487337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Guild socialism ====
{{main|Guild socialism}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:George-douglas-howard-cole.jpg|thumb|left|G. D. H. Cole, theorist of guild socialism]] --&gt;
Guild socialism is a political movement advocating [[workers' control]] of industry through the medium of trade-related [[guilds]] "in an implied contractual relationship with the public".&lt;ref name="britannica.com Guild Socialism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248652/Guild-Socialism |title="Guild Socialism". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 31 May. 2012 |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in the United Kingdom and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="britannica.com Guild Socialism"/&gt; It was strongly associated with G. D. H. Cole and influenced by the ideas of [[William Morris]].

Guild socialism was partly inspired by the guilds of [[artisan|craftsmen]] and other skilled workers which had existed in [[England in the Middle Ages|England during the Middle Ages]]. In 1906, [[Arthur Penty]] published ''Restoration of the Gild System'' in which he opposed factory production and advocated a return to an earlier period of artisanal production organised through guilds. The following year, the journal ''[[The New Age]]'' became an advocate of guild socialism, although in the context of modern industry rather than the medieval setting favoured by Penty. The guild socialists "stood for state ownership of industry, combined with "workers' control" through delegation of authority to national guilds organized internally on democratic lines. About the state itself they differed, some believing it would remain more or less in its existing form and others that it would be transformed into a federal body representing the workers' guilds, consumers' organizations, local government bodies, and other social structures".&lt;ref name="britannica.com Guild Socialism"/&gt; In 1914, [[Samuel George Hobson|S. G. Hobson]], a leading contributor to ''The New Age'', published ''National Guilds: An Inquiry into the Wage System and the Way Out''. In this work, guilds were presented as an alternative to state-control of industry or conventional trade union activity. Unlike the existing trade unions, guilds would not confine their demands to matters of wages and conditions, but would seek to obtain control of industry for the workers whom they represented. Ultimately, industrial guilds would serve as the organs through which industry would be organised in a future socialist society. The theory of guild socialism was developed and popularised by G. D. H. Cole who formed the National Guilds League in 1915 and published several books on guild socialism, including ''Self-Government in Industry'' (1917) and ''Guild Socialism Restated'' (1920). For scholar Charles Masquerade, "[i]t is by meeting such a twofold requirement that the libertarian socialism of G.D.H. Cole could be said to offer timely and sustainable avenues for the institutionalization of the liberal value of autonomy...By setting out to 'destroy this predominance of economic factors' (Cole 1980, 180) through the re-organization of key spheres of life into forms of associative action and coordination capable of giving the 'fullest development of functional organisation'...Cole effectively sought to turn political representation into a system actually capable of giving direct recognition to the multiplicity of interests making up highly complex and differentiated societies".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Masquelier.

==== Revolutionary syndicalism ====
{{main|Revolutionary syndicalism}}
{{Syndicalism sidebar}}
Revolutionary syndicalism is a type of [[economic system]] proposed as a replacement for capitalism and an alternative to [[state socialism]], which uses federations of collectivised [[trade unions]] or [[industrial unions]]. It is a form of socialist economic [[corporatism]] that advocates interest aggregation of multiple non-competitive categorised units to negotiate and manage an economy.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J. ''Corporatism and comparative politics''. M.E. Sharpe, 1996. pp. 65–66, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; For adherents, labour unions are the potential means of both overcoming economic aristocracy and running [[society]] fairly in the interest of the majority through [[union democracy]]. Industry in a syndicalist system would be run through [[co-operative economics|co-operative]] confederations and [[Mutual aid (politics)|mutual aid]]. Local syndicates would communicate with other syndicates through the [[Bourse du Travail]] (labor exchange) which would manage and transfer [[Commodity|commodities]].

Syndicalism is also used to refer to the tactic of bringing about this social arrangement, typically expounded by anarcho-syndicalism and [[De Leonism]] in which a general strike begins and workers seize their means of production and organise in a federation of trade unionism, such as the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT).&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Syndcicalism'', Brown, Tom. Retrieved July 6, 2010: http://libcom.org/library/principles-of-syndicalism-tom-brown&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its history, the reformist section of syndicalism has been overshadowed by its revolutionary section, typified by the [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] in [[France]], the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] section of the CNT.,&lt;ref&gt;info on the FAI http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/f/10748453.php&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana]] and the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]].

==== Christian anarchism ====

[[File:Leo Tolstoy, portrait.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Leo Tolstoy, important theorist of [[Christian anarchism]] and anarcho-pacifism]]
Christian anarchism is a [[Christian movement|movement]] in [[political theology]] that combines anarchism and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Christoyannopoulos, pp. 2–4: "Locating Christian anarchism.... In political theology"&lt;/ref&gt; It is the belief that there is only one source of authority to which Christians are ultimately answerable, the authority of God as embodied in the teachings of Jesus. More than any other Bible source, the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and Jesus' call to not resist evil but [[turning the other cheek|turn the other cheek]], are used as the basis for Christian anarchism.&lt;ref name=Sermon&gt;Christoyannopoulos, pp. 43–80: "The Sermon on the Mount: A manifesto for Christian anarchism"&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian anarchists are [[Christian pacifism|pacifists]] and oppose the use of violence, such as war.&lt;ref name=CritiqueofViolence&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/alexpaper.pdf |title=A Christian Anarchist Critique of Violence: From Turning the Other Cheek to a Rejection of the State |first=Alexandre |last=Christoyannopoulos |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |date=12 March 2010 |conference=Evil, Law, and the State |location=Salzburg |accessdate=23 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523064356/http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/alexpaper.pdf |archive-date=2014-05-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of Christian anarchism is a rejection of violence, with Leo Tolstoy's ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' regarded as a key text.&lt;ref name=CritiqueofViolence /&gt;&lt;ref name=tolstoy&gt;Christoyannopoulos, pp. 19 and 208: "Leo Tolstoy"&lt;/ref&gt; Christian anarchists denounce the state as they claim it is violent, deceitful and when glorified a form of [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name=CritiqueofViolence /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christoyannopoulos, p. 254: "The state as idolatry"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tolstoyanism|Tolstoyans]] were a small Christian anarchist group formed by Tolstoy's companion [[Vladimir Chertkov]] (1854–1936) to spread Tolstoy's religious teachings. Prince Peter Kropotkin wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] while in hundreds of essays over the last twenty years of his life Tolstoy reiterated the anarchist critique of the state and recommended books by Kropotkin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to his readers whilst rejecting anarchism's espousal of [[propaganda of the deed|violent revolutionary means]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 1900 essay, "On Anarchy", he wrote; "The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution – a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man." Despite his misgivings about [[anarchist violence]], Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of [[anarchism in Russia|anarchist thinkers in Russia]], and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin's "Words of a Rebel", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.

==== Gandhism ====
{{main|Gandhism|Gandhian economics|Gandhian socialism}}
Gandhism is the collection of inspirations, principles, beliefs and philosophy of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi), who was a major political leader of India and the [[Indian independence movement]]. It is a body of ideas and principles that describes the inspiration, vision and the life work of Gandhi. It is particularly associated with his contributions to the idea and practice of [[nonviolent resistance]], sometimes also called [[civil resistance]]. [[Gandhian economics]] are the socio-economic principles expounded by Gandhi. It is largely characterised by its affinity to the principles and objectives of nonviolent humanistic socialism, but with a rejection of violent [[class conflict|class war]] and promotion of socio-economic harmony. Gandhi's economic ideas also aim to promote spiritual development and harmony with a rejection of [[materialism]]. The term "Gandhian economics" was coined by [[J. C. Kumarappa]], a close supporter of Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kumarappa|first=Joseph Cornelius|title=Gandhian economic thought|publisher=Vora|location=Bombay, India|year=1951|edition=1st|series=Library of Indian economics|oclc=3529600|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3529600?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhian economics places importance to means of achieving the aim of development and this means must be non-violent, ethical and truthful in all economic spheres. In order to achieve this means, he advocated [[Trusteeship (Gandhism)|trusteeship]], decentralization of economic activities, labour intensive technology and priority to weaker sections. Gandhi also had letter communication with Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy and saw himself as his disciple.&lt;ref&gt;In 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote ''[[A Letter to a Hindu]]'', which said that only by using love as a weapon through [[passive resistance]] could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish ''A Letter to a Hindu'' in Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death in 1910. The letters concern practical and theological applications of non-violence.{{cite book|title=Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy: Letters |editor=Murthy, B.

Gandhi challenged future Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and the modernizers in the late 1930s who called for rapid industrialization on the Soviet model, which Gandhi denounced as dehumanizing and contrary to the needs of the villages where the great majority of the people lived.&lt;ref&gt;Bidyut Chakrabarty, "Jawaharlal Nehru and Planning, 1938–1941: India at the Crossroads", ''Modern Asian Studies'' (March 1992) 26#2 pp. 275–87&lt;/ref&gt; After Gandhi's death, Nehru led India to large-scale planning that emphasized modernization and heavy industry while modernizing agriculture through irrigation. Historian Kuruvilla [[Pandikattu]] says that "it was Nehru's vision, not Gandhi's, that was eventually preferred by the Indian State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kuruvila Pandikattu|title=Gandhi: the meaning of Mahatma for the millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YrGadHsc1bUC&amp;pg=PA237|year=2001|publisher=CRVP|isbn=978-1-56518-156-4|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi was a self-described [[Philosophical anarchism|philosophical anarchist]]&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Edgar.

Gandhian activists such as [[Vinoba Bhave]] and [[Jayaprakash Narayan]] were involved in the ''[[Sarvodaya]]'' movement, which sought to promote self-sufficiency amidst India's rural population by encouraging [[land redistribution]], socio-economic reforms and promoting [[cottage industries]]. The movement sought to combat the problems of class conflict, unemployment and poverty while attempting to preserve the lifestyle and values of rural Indians, which were eroding with [[industrialisation]] and modernisation. ''Sarvodaya'' also included ''[[Bhoodan]]'', or the gifting of land and agricultural resources by the landlords (called ''[[zamindar]]s'') to their tenant farmers in a bid to end the medieval system of ''zamindari''. ''The Conquest of Violence: An Essay on War and Revolution'' is a book written by dutch anarcho-pacifist [[Bart de Ligt]] which deals with nonviolent resistance in part inspired by the ideas of Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;"Gandhi's ideas were popularised in the West in books such as Richard Gregg's The Power of Nonviolence (1935), (34) and Bart de Ligt's The Conquest of Violence (1937)."[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Geoffrey_Ostergaard__Resisting_the_Nation_State._The_pacifist_and_anarchist_tradition.html Geoffrey Ostergaard.

==== Within the New Left ====
{{main|New Left}}
[[File:Herbert Marcuse in Newton, Massachusetts 1955.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Herbert Marcuse]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]], was an influential libertarian socialist philosopher of the [[New Left]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellner|first=Douglas|title=Herbert Marcuse|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/illuminations/kell12.htm|work=Illuminations|publisher=University of Texas at Arlington|accessdate=23 May 2014|authorlink=Douglas Kellner|quote=During the 1960s, Marcuse achieved world renown as "the guru of the New Left," publishing many articles and giving lectures and advice to student radicals all over the world. He travelled widely and his work was often discussed in the mass media, becoming one of the few American intellectuals to gain such attention. Never surrendering his revolutionary vision and commitments, Marcuse continued to his death to defend the Marxian theory and libertarian socialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The emergence of the New Left in the 1950s and 1960s led to a revival of interest in libertarian socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Hahnel]], ''Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation'' Part II {{ISBN|0-415-93344-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Left's critique of the [[Old Left]]'s authoritarianism was associated with a strong interest in [[personal liberty]] and [[autonomy]] (see the thinking of [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]) which led to a rediscovery of older socialist traditions, such as left communism, council communism, and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. In the United States, this was caused by a renewal of anarchism from the 1950s forward through writers such as [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] and anarcho-pacifism which became influential in the [[anti-nuclear movement]] and [[anti war movement]]s of the time and which incorporated both the influences of [[Gandhism]] and Tolstoyan [[Christian anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;. As such "In the forties and fifties, anarchism, in fact if not in name, began to reappear, often in alliance with pacifism, as the basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War.[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/] The anarchist/pacifist wing of the peace movement was small in comparison with the wing of the movement that emphasized electoral work, but made an important contribution to the movement as a whole. Where the more conventional wing of the peace movement rejected militarism and war under all but the most dire circumstances, the anarchist/pacifist wing rejected these on principle."[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm "Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement" by Barbara Epstein] "In the 1950s and 1960s anarcho-pacifism began to gel, tough-minded anarchists adding to the mixture their critique of the state, and tender-minded pacifists their critique of violence. Its first practical manifestation was at the level of method: nonviolent direct action, principled and pragmatic, was used widely in both the Civil Rights movement in the USA and the campaign against nuclear weapons in Britain and elsewhere."[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Geoffrey_Ostergaard__Resisting_the_Nation_State._The_pacifist_and_anarchist_tradition.html#toc13 Geoffrey Ostergaard.  ''Resisting the Nation State. The pacifist and anarchist tradition''] as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] [[Alex Comfort]] or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists [[Ammon Hennacy]] and [[Dorothy Day]]. Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the [[Cold War]]."[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm "Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement" by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the [[Sydney Push]] was a predominantly left-wing intellectual [[subculture]] in Sydney from the late 1940s to the early 1970s which became associated with the label "Sydney libertarianism".&lt;ref&gt;See Baker A J [http://www.takver.com/history/aia/aia00026.htm "Sydney Libertarianism and the Push"] or at [http://www.nealemorison.com/wlmorison/sydlib.htm "Sydney Libertarians and the Push"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230052/http://www.nealemorison.com/wlmorison/sydlib.htm |date=2016-03-03 }} on Prof. W L Morison memorial site&lt;/ref&gt; The New Left also led to a revival of anarchism in the 1960s in the United States.

==== Social ecology and Communalism ====
{{main|Social ecology (theory)|Communalism}}
[[File:Murray Bookchin.jpg|thumb|upright|Murray Bookchin]]
Social ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of Murray Bookchin and influenced by anarchist Peter Kropotkin. Social ecologists assert that the present [[ecological crisis]] has its roots in human social problems and that the domination of human-over-nature stems from the domination of human-over-human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bookchin |first=Murray |title=The Philosophy of Social Ecology: Essays on Dialectical Naturalism |year=1994 |pages=119–20 |publisher=Black Rose Books|isbn=978-1-55164-018-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin later developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology which he called Communalism (spelled with a capital ''C'' to differentiate it from other forms of communalism). While originally conceived as a form of [[social anarchism]], he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism and radical ecology.

Politically, Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities or cities organized in a [[Confederation|confederated]] fashion. The method used to achieve this is called [[libertarian municipalism]] and involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions which grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state. Unlike anarchists, Communalists are not opposed to taking part in parliamentary politics&amp;mdash;especially municipal elections&amp;mdash;as long as candidates are libertarian socialist and [[Anti-statism|anti-statist]] in outlook.

==== Participism ====
{{main|Participism}}
[[File:NLN Michael Albert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Michael Albert]]]]
[[Participism]] is a 21st century form of libertarian socialism. It comprises two related economic and political systems called [[participatory economics]] or "parecon" and [[participatory politics]] or "parpolity".

Parecon is an economic system proposed primarily by activist and political theorist [[Michael Albert]] and radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]], among others. It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society. Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist market economies and also an alternative to centrally planned socialism or coordinatorism, it is described as "an anarchistic economic vision" and it could be considered a form of socialism as under parecon the means of production are owned by the workers. It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions: workers' and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for decision making, balanced job complexes, remuneration according to effort and sacrifice and participatory planning. Under parecon, the current monetary system would be replaced with a system of non-transferable "credit" which would cease to exist upon purchase of a commodity.

Parpolity is a theoretical political system proposed by [[Stephen R. Shalom]]. It was developed as a political vision to accompany parecon. Participism as a whole is critical of aspects of modern [[representative democracies]] and capitalism arguing that the level of political control by the people is not sufficient. To address this problem, parpolity suggests a system of "Nested Councils", which would include every adult member of a given society. Under [[participism]], the state as such would dissolve into a mere coordinating body made up of delegates which would be recallable at any time by the nested council below them.

==== Inclusive Democracy ====
{{main|Inclusive Democracy}}
Inclusive Democracy (ID) is a political theory and political project that aim for direct democracy, [[economic democracy]] in a [[stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] (democracy in the social realm) and [[ecological democracy]]. As distinguished from the political project which is part of the democratic and autonomy traditions, the theoretical project of ID emerged from the work of political philosopher, former academic and activist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal ''Democracy &amp; Nature'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', an [[electronic journal]] freely available and published by the International Network for ID.

According to [[Arran Gare]], ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy'' "offers a powerful new interpretation of the history and destructive dynamics of the market and provides an inspiring new vision of the future in place of both neo-liberalism and existing forms of socialism".&lt;ref&gt;Arran Gare, [http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin:989/SOURCE1 "Beyond Social Democracy? Takis Fotopoulos' Vision of an Inclusive Democracy as a New Liberatory Project"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706115814/http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin%3A989/SOURCE1 |date=2011-07-06 }} ''Democracy &amp; Nature'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (November 2003), pp. 345–58(14)&lt;/ref&gt; As David Freeman points out, although Fotopoulos' approach "is not openly anarchism, yet anarchism seems the formal category within which he works, given his commitment to direct democracy, municipalism and abolition of state, money and market economy".&lt;ref&gt;David Freeman, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol1/vol1_no3_freeman.htm "Inclusive democracy and its prospects"] review of book ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy: The Crisis of the Growth Economy and the Need For a New Liberatory Project'', published in ''Thesis Eleven'', Sage Publications, no. 69 (May 2002), pp. 103–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

An artificial market is proposed by this tendency as a solution to the problem of maintaining freedom of choice for the consumer within a marketless and moneyless economy, an artificial market operates in much the same way as traditional markets, but uses [[labour voucher]]s or personal credit in place of traditional money. According to Takis Fotopoulos, an artificial market "secures real freedom of choice, without incurring the adverse effects associated with real markets".&lt;ref name="inclusivedemocracy.org"&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/brtid/IDBook.pdf Towards an Inclusive Democracy: the crisis of the growth economy and the need for a new liberatory project], (London &amp; NY: Cassell, 1997), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insurrectionary anarchism ====
{{main|Insurrectionary anarchism}}
Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes the theme of [[insurrection]] within anarchist practice. It is critical of formal organizations such as labor unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization and small [[affinity group]]-based organization. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent [[class conflict]] and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.

Contemporary insurrectionary anarchism inherits the views and tactics of anti-organizational anarcho-communism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php "Say you want an insurrection"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013152611/http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/insurrection.php |date=2016-10-13 }} by [[Crimethinc]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[illegalism]].

They were opposed not only to political and statist struggles, but also to strikes which put forward wage or other claims, or which were organised by trade unions.&lt;ref name="Alain Pengam"/&gt; However, "[w]hile they were not opposed to strikes as such—they were opposed to trade unions and the struggle for the [[eight-hour day]]. This anti-reformist tendency was accompanied by an [[Individualist anarchism in Italy|anti-organisational tendency]], and its partisans declared themselves in favour of agitation amongst the unemployed for the expropriation of foodstuffs and other articles, for the expropriatory strike and, in some cases, for '[[individual recuperation]]' or acts of terrorism".&lt;ref name="Alain Pengam"/&gt; A resurgence of such ideas happened "in the peculiar conditions of postwar [[History of the Italian Republic#The First Republic (1948–1992)|Italy]] and [[History of Greece#Greek Civil War Greek Civil War (1944–1949)|Greece]]".&lt;ref name="joeblack"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ainfos.ca/06/jul/ainfos00232.html |title="Anarchism, insurrections and insurrectionalism" by Joe Black |publisher=Ainfos.ca |date=19 July 2006 |accessdate=20 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101206162459/http://www.ainfos.ca/06/jul/ainfos00232.html| archivedate= 6 December 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neozapatismo and Magonism ====
{{main|Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Emiliano Zapata|Magonism|Neozapatismo}}
[[File:SubMarcosHorseFromAfar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Subcomandante Marcos]]]]
The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (''Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional'', EZLN) often referred to as the ''zapatistas'' is a revolutionary leftist group based in [[Chiapas]], the southernmost state of Mexico. Since 1994, the group has been in a declared war "against the Mexican state", though this war has been primarily [[nonviolent]] and defensive against [[Military of Mexico|military]], [[paramilitary]] and [[Corporation|corporate]] incursions into Chiapas. Their social base is mostly rural [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous people]], but they have some supporters in urban areas and internationally. Their former spokesperson was [[Subcomandante Marcos]] (also known as Delegate Zero in relation to [[The Other Campaign]]). Unlike other Zapatist spokespeople, Marcos is not an indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]]. Since December 1994, the Zapatistas had been gradually forming several autonomous municipalities, called Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities (MAREZ). In these municipalities, an assembly of local representatives forms the ''Juntas de Buen Gobierno'' or [[Councils of Good Government]] (JBGs). These are not recognized by the federal or state governments and they oversee local community programs on food, health and education as well as taxation. The EZLN political formations have happened in two phases generally called ''Aquascalientes'' and ''Caracoles''.

The group takes its name from [[Emiliano Zapata]] (the agrarian reformer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/zapata-emiliano-1879-1919 |title=Zapata, Emiliano, 1879–1919 |publisher=libcom.org |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commander of the [[Liberation Army of the South]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]]) and sees itself as his ideological heir. ''Zapatista'' originally referred to a member of the revolutionary [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement founded about 1910 by Zapata. His Liberation Army of the South (''Ejército Libertador del Sur'') fought during the Mexican Revolution for the [[Land reform|redistribution of agricultural land]]. Zapata and his army and allies, including [[Pancho Villa]], fought for agrarian reform in Mexico. Specifically, they wanted to establish [[communal]] [[land rights]] for Mexico's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population, which had mostly lost its land to the wealthy elite of European descent. Zapata was partly influenced by an anarchist from [[Oaxaca]] named [[Ricardo Flores Magón]]. The influence of Flores Magón on Zapata can be seen in the Zapatist' [[Plan de Ayala]], but even more noticeably in their slogan (this slogan was never used by Zapata) ''Tierra y libertad'' or "Land and liberty", the title and maxim of Flores Magón's most famous work. Zapata's introduction to anarchism came via a local schoolteacher, Otilio Montaño Sánchez—later a general in Zapata's army, executed on 17 May 1917—who exposed Zapata to the works of Peter Kropotkin and Flores Magón at the same time as Zapata was observing and beginning to participate in the struggles of the peasants for the land.

==== Communization ====
{{main|Communization}}
Communization mainly refers to a contemporary communist theory in which we find is a "mixing-up of [[insurrectionist anarchism]], the communist ultra-left, post-autonomists, anti-political currents, groups like [[The Coming Insurrection|the Invisible Committee]], as well as more explicitly 'communizing' currents, such as ''Théorie Communiste'' and ''Endnotes''. Obviously at the heart of the word is communism and, as the shift to communization suggests, communism as a particular activity and process".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Noys (ed). [http://www.minorcompositions.info/?p=299 ''Communization and its Discontents: Contestation, Critique, and Contemporary Struggles.''] Minor Compositions, [[Autonomedia]]. 2011. 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of the term communization with a self-identified "[[ultra-left]]" was cemented in France in the 1970s, where it came to describe not a transition to a higher phase of communism, but a vision of communist revolution itself. The 1975 Pamphlet ''A World Without Money'' thus states: "insurrection and communisation are intimately linked. There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality. The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation itself".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/world-without-money-les-amis-de-4-millions-de-jeunes-travailleurs "A World Without Money"] by Les amis de 4 millions de jeunes travailleurs. (Quoted passage not included in this English extract.)&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still used in this sense in France today and has spread into English usage as a result of the translation of texts by [[Gilles Dauvé]] and ''Théorie Comuniste'', two key figures in this tendency. In collaboration with other left communists such as François Martin and Karl Nesic, Dauvé has attempted to fuse, critique and develop different left communist currents, most notably the Italian movement associated with Amadeo Bordiga (and its heretical journal ''[[Invariance (magazine)|Invariance]]''), German Dutch council communism and the French perspectives associated with [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] and the [[Situationist International]].&lt;ref&gt;"The text surveys the Italian and German lefts, Socialisme Ou Barbarie and the Situationist International and describes the theoretical development of the French ultra-left."[http://libcom.org/library/re-collecting-our-past-la-banquise Re-collecting our past – La Banquise]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, a close yet not identical sense of "communization" was developed by the French post-situationist group [[Tiqqun]]. In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors, Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with "the revolution" considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities—from squatting and setting up communes to simply "sharing"—that would typically be understood as "pre-revolutionary".&lt;ref&gt;"As we apprehend it, the process of instituting communism can only take the form of a collection of acts of ''communisation'', of making common such-and-such space, such-and-such machine, such-and-such knowledge. That is to say, the elaboration of the mode of sharing that attaches to them. Insurrection itself is just an accelerator, a decisive moment in this process." Anonymous, [http://www.bloom0101.org/call.pdf ''Call''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212804/http://www.bloom0101.org/call.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From an ultra-left perspective, such a politics of "dropping-out" or, as Tiqqun put it, "desertion"—setting up spaces and practices that are held to partially autonomous from capitalism—is typically dismissed as either naive or reactionary.&lt;ref&gt;For a critique of Tiqqun from an ultra-left perspective, as well as a description of the opposition between the two sense of "communization" see "[http://libcom.org/library/reflexions-around-call Reflexions Around Call] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912181348/http://libcom.org/library/reflexions-around-call |date=2011-09-12 }}" Letters Journal #3. See also Dauvé and Nesic, [http://troploin0.free.fr/ii/index.php/textes/19-communisation-un-appel-et-une-invite "Un Appel et une Invite"].&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the popularity of the Tiqqun-related works ''Call'' and ''[[The Coming Insurrection]]'' in the American anarchist circles, it tended to be this latter sense of "communization" that was employed in American anarchist and "[[insurrectionist]]" communiques, notably within the [[2009 California college tuition hike protests|Californian student movement of 2009–2010]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://afterthefallcommuniques.info/ "After the Fall: Communiqués from Occupied California"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126222020/http://afterthefallcommuniques.info/ |date=2011-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies.

[[Verso Books|Verso]]. 2007. p. 125''&lt;/ref&gt; This might also have been motivated by "the collapse of '[[Real socialism|really existing socialism]]' and the capitulation to [[neo-liberalism]] of Western social democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Chamsy el- Ojeili. ''Beyond post-socialism. Dialogues with the far-left.'' Palgrave Macmillan. 2015. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

International anarchist federations in existence include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]] (IAF), the [[International Workers' Association]] (IWA) and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]] (ILS). The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain in the form of the [[Confederacion General del Trabajo de España|Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT). CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark "Trade union membership 1993–2003" (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian socialists in the early 21st century have been involved in the [[alter-globalization]] movement, squatter movement; [[social centers]]; [[infoshop]]s; anti-poverty groups such as [[Ontario Coalition Against Poverty]] and [[Food Not Bombs]]; [[Leasehold estate|tenants']] unions; [[housing cooperative]]s; [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] generally and [[egalitarian communities]]; [[anti-sexist]] organizing; grassroots media initiatives; digital media and computer activism; experiments in [[participatory economics]]; [[anti-racist]] and [[anti-fascist]] groups like [[Anti-Racist Action]] and [[Anti-Fascist Action]]; activist groups protecting the rights of [[immigrant]]s and promoting the free movement of people, such as the [[No Border network]]; [[worker co-operative]]s, [[countercultural]] and artist groups; and the [[peace movement]]. Libertarian socialism has also more recently played a large part in the global [[Occupy movement]],&lt;ref&gt;"If any radical left tendency has been responsible for inspiring action, the palm should go to Marxism's historic antagonist on the Left – anarchism. Wherever movements have been provoked against neoliberalism, black flags have tended to outnumber red. Autonomista and other kinds of left-libertarian thought were major currents running through movements in Greece and Spain. The cornerstone for the occupation of Zuccotti Park was laid by anarchists, who also developed the consensus procedures by which the movement participants made (or occasionally failed to make) decisions." [http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/cheerleaders-for-anarchism "Cheerleaders for Anarchism" by Nikil Saval in] ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]] magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In November 2011, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine credited American anarchist [[David Graeber]] with giving the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement its theme: "[[We are the 99 percent]]". ''Rolling Stone'' says Graeber helped create the first [[New York City General Assembly]], with only 60 participants, on August 2. Sharlet, Jeff (10 November 2011).

This is a '''list of [[revolutions]] and [[rebellion]]s'''.
&lt;!-- It is not meant to include every instance of violent conflict. Do not add battles and wars which are unconnected to a revolution or rebellion. Do not add "revolutions" mandated from above. Do not add every riot and violent demonstration in the history of mankind, and do not accord recent events undue weight. Note: there is a section at the end, "Cultural, intellectual, philosophical and technological revolutions", which does list some significant events, phenomenae or trends which are not violent rebellions or revolutions.  That may be split off later.--&gt;

'''Meritocracy''' (''merit'', from [[Latin]] ''mereō'', and ''-cracy'', from [[Ancient Greek]] κράτος ''{{transl|el|kratos}}'' "strength, power") is a [[political philosophy]] which holds that certain things, such as [[Goods|economic goods]] or [[Power (social and political)|power]], should be [[vested]] in [[individual]]s on the basis of talent, effort, and achievement, rather than factors such as sexuality, race, gender, or wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of merit|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/meritocracy?s=t|publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancement in such a system is based on performance, as measured through examination or demonstrated achievement. Although the concept of meritocracy has existed for centuries, the term itself was first created in 1958 by the sociologist [[Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington|Michael Young]].&lt;ref name="riseofmeri" /&gt; The Oxford English Dictionary shows the first use in 1956 and gives this citation. "1956 A. Fox in Socialist Comm. May 13/1 The ‘meritocracy’; the society in which the gifted, the smart, the energetic, the ambitious and the ruthless are carefully sifted out and helped towards their destined positions of dominance."  Young's entry is listed as "1958 M. Young Rise of Meritocracy iv. 71 Before the meritocracy was fully established, age-stratification as a substitute for the hereditary order may have been necessary for the sake of social stability."

==Definitions==
===Early definitions===
The "most common definition of meritocracy conceptualizes merit in terms of tested competency and ability, and most likely, as measured by [[IQ]] or standardized achievement tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=David|last2=Cookson|first2=Peter W.|last3=Sadovnik|first3=Alan R.|title=Education and Sociology: An Encyclopedia|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=436|quote=most common definition of meritocracy conceptualizes merit in terms tested competency and power, and most likely as measured by IQ or standardized achievement tests}}&lt;/ref&gt; In government and other administrative systems, "meritocracy" refers to a system under which advancement within the system turns on "merits", like performance, intelligence, [[credential]]s, and education. These are often determined through evaluations or examinations.&lt;ref name="riseofmeri" /&gt;

In a more general sense, meritocracy can refer to any form of evaluation based on achievement. Like "[[utilitarianism|utilitarian]]" and "[[pragmatism|pragmatic]]", the word "meritocratic" has also developed a broader connotation, and is sometimes used to refer to any government run by "a ruling or influential class of educated or able people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/meritocracy|title=Definition of Meritocracy|work=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is in contrast to the original, condemnatory use of the term in 1958 by Michael Young in his work "''[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]''", who was satirizing the ostensibly merit-based [[Tripartite System]] of education practiced in the United Kingdom at the time; he claimed that, in the Tripartite System, "merit is equated with intelligence-plus-effort, its possessors are identified at an early age and selected for appropriate intensive education, and there is an obsession with quantification, test-scoring, and qualifications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought|year=1988|publisher=Fontana Press|page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meritocracy in its wider sense, may be any general act of judgment upon the basis of various demonstrated merits; such acts frequently are described in [[sociology]] and [[psychology]]. Supporters of meritocracy do not necessarily agree on the nature of "merit"; however, they do tend to agree that "merit" itself should be a primary consideration during evaluation. Thus, the merits may extend beyond intelligence and education to any mental or physical [[wikt:talent#Noun|talent]] or to [[work ethic]]. As such meritocracy may be based on [[soft skills|character]] or [[intelligence|innate abilities]]. Meritocrats therefore reject evaluation on the basis of race, wealth, family circumstances, and similar criteria.

In [[rhetoric]], the demonstration of one's merit regarding mastery of a particular subject is an essential task most directly related to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] term ''[[Ethos]]''. The equivalent Aristotelian conception of meritocracy is based upon [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] or [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] structures, rather than in the context of the modern [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristot. Pol. 2.1261b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, (351 BC) ''Politics''. Book Three Part IV. (Jowett, B., Trans)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the assassination of President [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881 prompted the replacement of the American [[Spoils System]] with a meritocracy. In 1883, The [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] was passed, stipulating government jobs should be awarded on the basis of merit through competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt;

The most common form of meritocratic screening found today is the college degree. Higher education is an imperfect meritocratic screening system for various reasons, such as lack of uniform standards worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;What's College For?: The Struggle To Define American Higher Education; Zachary Karabell; {{ISBN|978-0-465-09152-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journal of College Teaching &amp; Learning – May 2008 Volume 5, Number 5 AACSB Accreditation&lt;/ref&gt; lack of scope (not all occupations and processes are included), and lack of access (some talented people never have an opportunity to participate because of the expense, most especially in [[developing country|developing countries]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Higher education and social justice |author1=Furlong, Andy|author2=Cartmel, Fred|isbn=978-0-335-22362-6|publisher=Open University Press|location =Maidenhead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, academic degrees serve some amount of meritocratic screening purpose in the absence of a more refined methodology. Education alone, however, does not constitute a complete system, as meritocracy must automatically confer power and authority, which a degree does not accomplish independently.

==Etymology==
Although the concept has existed for centuries, the term "meritocracy" is relatively new. It was used pejoratively by [[United Kingdom|British]] politician and [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] in his 1958 [[satire|satirical]] [[essay]]&lt;ref name="riseofmeri"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Young (politician)|title=The rise of the meritocracy, 1870-2033: An essay on education and inequality|year=1958|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London| oclc=3943639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Down with meritocracy: The man who coined the word four decades ago wishes Tony Blair would stop using it|last=Young|first=Michael|date=29 June 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ford, Boris|year=1992|title=The Cambridge cultural history of Britain|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34|isbn=978-0-521-42889-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamolnick, Paul|year=2005|title=The just meritocracy: IQ, class mobility, and American social policy|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport CT|page=87|isbn=978-0-275-97922-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Best, Shaun|year=2005|title=Understanding Social Divisions|publisher=Sage|page=32|location=London|isbn=978-0-7619-4296-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]'', which pictured the United Kingdom under the rule of a government favouring intelligence and aptitude (merit) above all else, being the combination of the root of Latin origin "merit" (from "mereō" meaning "earn") and the Ancient Greek suffix "-cracy" (meaning "power", "rule").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=meritocracy|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|accessdate=3 July 2013|title="meritocracy" in the Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The ''purely'' Greek word is axiocracy (αξιοκρατία), from axios (αξιος, worthy) + "-cracy" (-κρατία, power).)
In this book the term had distinctly negative connotations as Young questioned both the legitimacy of the selection process used to become a member of this elite and the outcomes of being ruled by such a narrowly defined group.
The essay, written in the first person by a fictional historical narrator in 2034, interweaves history from the politics of pre- and post-war Britain with those of fictional future events in the short (1960 onward) and long term (2020 onward).&lt;ref name="young_p11"&gt;Young, Michael (1958). p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay was based upon the tendency of the then-current governments, in their striving toward intelligence, to ignore shortcomings and upon the failure of education systems to utilize correctly the gifted and talented members within their societies.&lt;ref name="young_p13"&gt;Young, Michael (1958). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young's fictional narrator explains that, on the one hand, the greatest contributor to society is not the "stolid mass" or majority, but the "creative minority" or members of the "restless elite".&lt;ref name="young_p15"&gt;Young, Michael (1958). p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he claims that there are casualties of progress whose influence is underestimated and that, from such stolid adherence to natural science and intelligence, arises arrogance and complacency.&lt;ref name="young_p15" /&gt; This problem is encapsulated in the phrase "Every selection of one is a rejection of many".&lt;ref name="young_p15" /&gt;

It was also used by [[Hannah Arendt]] in her essay "Crisis in Education",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instituteofideas.com/documents/PGF_Arendt_Education.pdf "Crisis in Education"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014030134/http://www.instituteofideas.com/documents/PGF_Arendt_Education.pdf |date=14 October 2013 }} (p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; which was written in 1958 and refers to the use of meritocracy in the English educational system.  She too uses the term pejoratively.  It was not until 1972 that [[Daniel Bell]] used the term positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Littler|first1=Jo|title=Meritocracy: the great delusion that ingrains inequality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/20/meritocracy-inequality-theresa-may-donald-trump|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times: China===
{{further information|Chinese Legalism}}
According to scholarly consensus, the earliest example of an administrative meritocracy, based on civil service examinations, dates back to Ancient China.&lt;ref name="APHq"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142. ''One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed in the imperial bureaucracy of China.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Chung|first2=Yinzheng|last2=Geng|title=

This sets in motion the creation of the imperial examinations and bureaucracies open only to those who passed tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sienkewicz|first=Thomas J.|title=Encyclopedia of the Ancient World:|year=2003|publisher=Salem Press|page=434|quote=Confucius invented the notion that those who govern should so because of merit and not inherited status, setting in motion the creation of the imperial examinations and bureaucracies open only to those who passed tests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Qin and Han dynasties developed a meritocratic system in order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt; Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the [[civil service examination]]s, and education became the key for social mobility.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;Burbank and Cooper (2010), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the [[nine-rank system]] was established during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

According to the [[Princeton University|Princeton Encyclopedia on American History]]:&lt;ref name="APH"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed in the imperial bureaucracy of China. Tracing back to 200 B.C., the Han Dynasty adopted Confucianism as the basis of its political philosophy and structure, which included the revolutionary idea of replacing nobility of blood with one of virtue and honesty, and thereby calling for administrative appointments to be based solely on merit. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position that would bring wealth and honor to the whole family. In part due to Chinese influence, the first European civil service did not originate in Europe, but rather in India by the British-run East India Company... company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism.}}

Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] advocated meritocracy, Plato in his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', arguing that the wisest should rule, and hence the rulers should be [[philosopher king]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See Estlund (2003) for a summary and discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century: spread to Europe===
The concept of meritocracy spread from China to British India during the seventeenth century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="APH"/&gt; With the translation of Confucian texts during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ''[[ancient regime]]'' of Europe.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;Schwarz (1996), 229&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] and [[François Quesnay]] wrote favourably of the idea, with Voltaire claiming that the Chinese had "perfected moral science" and Quesnay advocating an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.&lt;ref name="EE" /&gt;

The first European power to implement a successful meritocratic civil service was the [[British Empire]], in their administration of India: "company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism."&lt;ref name="APH"/&gt; British colonial administrators advocated the spread of the system to the rest of the commonwealth, the most "persistent" of which was Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]]. Meadows successfully argued in his ''[[Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China]]'', published in 1847, that "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bodde,|first=Derke|title=China: A Teaching Workbook|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_ideas.htm|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice later was adopted in the late nineteenth century by the British mainland, inspired by the "Chinese mandarin system".&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;Huddleston, Mark W. Boyer, William W.''The higher civil service in the United States: quest for reform''. (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1996), 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[philosopher]] and [[polymath]] [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated meritocracy in his book, ''[[Considerations on Representative Government]]''. His model was to give more votes to the more [[Education|educated]] voter. His views are explained in Estlund (2003:57–58):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Mill's proposal of plural voting has two motives. One is to prevent one group or class of people from being able to control the political process even without having to give reasons in order to gain sufficient support. He calls this the problem of class legislation. Since the most numerous class is also at a lower level of education and social rank, this could be partly remedied by giving those at the higher ranks plural votes. A second, and equally prominent motive for plural voting is to avoid giving equal influence to each person without regard to their merit, intelligence, etc. He thinks that it is fundamentally important that political institutions embody, in their spirit, the recognition that some opinions are worth more than others. He does not say that this is a route to producing better political decisions, but it is hard to understand his argument, based on this second motive, in any other way.

So, if Aristotle is right that the deliberation is best if participants are numerous (and assuming for simplicity that the voters are the deliberators) then this is a reason for giving all or many citizens a vote, but this does not yet show that the wiser subset should not have, say, two or three; in that way something would be given both to the value of the diverse perspectives, and to the value of the greater wisdom of the few. This combination of the Platonic and Aristotelian points is part of what I think is so formidable about Mill's proposal of plural voting. It is also an advantage of his view that he proposes to privilege not the wise, but the educated. Even if we agreed that the wise should rule, there is a serious problem about how to identify them. This becomes especially important if a successful political justification must be generally acceptable to the ruled. In that case, privileging the wise would require not only their being so wise as to be better rulers, but also, and more demandingly, that their wisdom be something that can be agreed to by all reasonable citizens. I turn to this conception of justification below.

Mill's position has great plausibility: good education promotes the ability of citizens to rule more wisely. So, how can we deny that the educated subset would rule more wisely than others. But then why shouldn't they have more votes?&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Estlund goes on to criticize Mill's education-based meritocracy on various grounds.

===19th century===
In the United States, the federal bureaucracy used the [[Spoils System]] from 1828 until the assassination of United States President [[James A. Garfield]] by a disappointed office seeker in 1881 proved its dangers. Two years later in 1883, the system of appointments to the United States Federal Bureaucracy was revamped by the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]], partially based on the British meritocratic civil service that had been established years earlier. The act stipulated that government jobs should be awarded on the basis of merit, through competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation. It also made it illegal to fire or demote government employees for political reasons.&lt;ref name=penl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3115 |title=Civil Service Reform |work=Digital History |publisher=[[University of Houston]] |accessdate=2016-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To enforce the merit system and the judicial system, the law also created the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; In the modern American meritocracy, the president may hand out only a certain number of jobs, which must be approved by the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]].

Australia began establishing public universities in the 1850s with the goal of promoting meritocracy by providing advanced training and credentials. The educational system was set up to service urban males of middle-class background, but of diverse social and religious origins. It was increasingly extended to all graduates of the public school system, those of rural and regional background, and then to women and finally to ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Horne, and Geoffrey Sherington, "Extending the educational franchise: the social contract of Australia's public universities, 1850-1890,"  ''Paedagogica Historica'' (2010) 46#1 pp 207-227&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the middle classes and the working classes have promoted the ideal of meritocracy within a strong commitment to "mate-ship" and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam Henry|title=Understanding Schooling: An Introductory Sociology of Australian Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-_FSMpdmK3oC&amp;pg=PA81|year=1988|publisher=Psychology Press|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century to today===
[[Singapore]] describes meritocracy as one of its official guiding principles for domestic public policy formulation, placing emphasis on academic credentials as objective measures of merit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.mfa.gov.sg/data/paris/statements/REMARKS_FOR_MEDEF_28_Aug_08.html Speech by Singapore Ambassador to France], 28 August 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193448/http://app.mfa.gov.sg/data/paris/statements/REMARKS_FOR_MEDEF_28_Aug_08.html|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singaporean academics are continuously re-examining the application of meritocracy as an ideological tool and how it's stretched to encompass the ruling party's objectives. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy asserts that  "Meritocracy, in trying to 'isolate' merit by treating people with fundamentally unequal backgrounds as superficially the same, can be a practice that ignores and even conceals the real advantages and disadvantages that are unevenly distributed to different segments of an inherently unequal society, a practice that in fact perpetuates this fundamental inequality. In this way, those who are picked by meritocracy as having merit may already have enjoyed unfair advantages from the very beginning, ignored according to the principle of nondiscrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|date=January 2008|title=Meritocracy and Elitism in a Global City: Ideological Shifts in Singapore|journal=International Political Science Review|volume=29|issue=7-27|doi=10.1177/0192512107083445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meritocracy in the Singaporean context relates to the application of pragmatism as an ideological device which combines strict adherence to market principles ''without'' any aversion to social engineering and little propensity for classical social welfarism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/04/16/how-singapore-is-fixing-its-meritocracy/|title=Opinion {{!}} How Singapore is fixing its meritocracy|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is further illustrated by Kenneth Paul Tan in subsequent articles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a strong ideological quality in Singapore's pragmatism, and a strongly pragmatic quality in ideological negotiations within the dynamics of hegemony. In this complex relationship, the combination of ideological and pragmatic maneuvering over the decades has resulted in the historical dominance of government by the PAP in partnership with global capital whose interests have been advanced without much reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|date=9 Dec 2011|title=The Ideology of Pragmatism: Neo-liberal Globalisation and Political Authoritarianism in Singapore|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|volume=42|issue=1|doi=10.1080/00472336.2012.634644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Within the [[Ecuador]]ian Ministry of Labor, the Ecuadorian Meritocracy Institute&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130305014509/http://www.meritocracia.gob.ec/ Web page of "Instituto Nacional de Meritocracia de Ecuador"] , 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was created under the technical advice of the [[Singapore]]an government.

Most contemporary political theorists, including [[John Rawls]], reject the ideal of meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Theory of Justice|last=Rawls|first=John|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=91-92}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years, Thomas Mulligan has defended meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice and the Meritocratic State|last=Mulligan|first=Thomas|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulligan|first=Thomas|date=|title=Plural Voting for the Twenty First Century|url=https://academic.oup.com/pq/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pq/pqx046/4157866|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Handbook of Libertarianism|last=Mulligan|first=Thomas|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=What's Wrong with Libertarianism: A Meritocratic Diagnosis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a just society is one in which there is equal opportunity and people are judged on their merits.

==Modern meritocratic movements==

===The Meritocracy Party===
In 2007 an anonymous British group called The Meritocracy Party published its first manifesto, to which they have now added more than two million words on the subject (discussing [[Hegel]], [[Rousseau]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], and various other philosophers, scientists, reformers, and revolutionaries). In summary, The Meritocracy Party wants to achieve the following:

# A world in which every child gets an equal chance to succeed in life.
# The abolishment of party politics.
# Only those with a relevant education and work experience should be allowed to vote, rather than just anyone who has reached the age of 18 or 21.
# The introduction of 100% inheritance tax, so that the super-rich can no longer pass on their wealth to a select few (their privileged children). This would mean the end of the elite dynasties and hereditary monarchy.
# A radically reformed educational system, based on the [[MBTI]] personality types, and insights from radical innovators such as [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Maria Montessori]].
# To replace [[free market capitalism]] with [[social capitalism]] and to replace democracy with a fully transparent meritocratic republic, under a meritocratic constitution.
# The end of [[nepotism]], [[cronyism]], discrimination, privilege and unequal chances.

On their website The Meritocracy Party lists five meritocratic principles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=ug4xDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143&amp;lpg=PT143&amp;dq=meritocracy+party+uk+principles+and+goals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bqxj2wdXhH&amp;sig=g7sp7-a428BizCKj3GroxrLX4LQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ0KaV4KTWAhVF3IMKHQ9lBhMQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=meritocracy%20party%20uk%20principles%20and%20goals&amp;f=false|title=The Citizen Army|last=Spartacus|first=Brother|date=2016-04-30|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|year=|isbn=9781326642167|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thirteen primary aims. The Meritocracy International is the host of all meritocratic political parties in the world and the place where these may be found by country of origin.&lt;ref name="keran"/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{see also|Just-world hypothesis}}
The term "meritocracy" was originally intended as a negative concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Margalit|title=Michael Young, 86, Scholar; Coined, Mocked 'Meritocracy'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/25/world/michael-young-86-scholar-coined-mocked-meritocracy.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the primary concerns with meritocracy is the unclear definition of "merit".&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, Bowles and Durlauf. ''Meritocracy and Economic Inequality''. Princeton, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered as meritorious can differ with opinions as on which qualities are considered the most worthy, raising the question of which "merit" is the highest—or, in other words, which standard is the "best" standard. As the supposed effectiveness of a meritocracy is based on the supposed competence of its officials, this standard of merit cannot be arbitrary and has to also reflect the competencies required for their roles.

The reliability of the authority and system that assesses each individual's merit is another point of concern. As a meritocratic system relies on a standard of merit to measure and compare people against, the system by which this is done has to be reliable to ensure that their assessed merit accurately reflects their potential capabilities. [[Standardized test]]ing, which reflects the meritocratic sorting process, has come under criticism for being rigid and unable to accurately assess many valuable qualities and potentials of students. Education theorist [[Bill Ayers]], commenting on the limitations of standardized testing, writes that "Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning."&lt;ref&gt;To teach: the journey of a teacher, by William Ayers, Teachers College Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8077-3985-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8077-3985-3}}, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Merit determined through the opinionated evaluations of teachers, while being able to assess the valuable qualities that cannot be assessed by standardized testing, are unreliable as the opinions, insights, biases, and standards of the teachers vary greatly. If the system of evaluation is corrupt, non-transparent, opinionated or misguided, decisions regarding who has the highest merit can be highly fallible.

The level of education required in order to become competitive in a meritocracy may also be costly, effectively limiting candidacy for a position of power to those with the means necessary to become educated. An example of this was Chinese student self-declared messiah, [[Hong Xiuquan]], who despite ranking first in a preliminary, nationwide [[imperial examination]], was unable to afford further education. As such, although he did try to study in private, Hong was ultimately noncompetitive in later examinations and unable to become a bureaucrat. This economic aspect of meritocracies has been said to continue nowadays in countries without free educations, with the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], for example, consisting only of justices who attended [[Harvard]] or [[Yale]] and generally only considering clerkship candidates who attended a top-five university, while in the 1950s the two universities only accounted for around one fifth of the justices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death by Degrees|url=https://nplusonemag.com/issue-14/the-intellectual-situation/death-by-degrees/|website=[[n+1]]|publisher=n+1 Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if free education were provided, the resources that the parents of a student are able to provide outside of the curriculum, such as tutoring, exam preparation, and financial support for living costs during higher education will influence the education the student attains and the student's social position in a meritocratic society. This limits the fairness and justness of any meritocratic system.

Another concern regards the principle of incompetence, or the "[[Peter Principle]]". As people rise in a meritocratic society through the social hierarchy through their demonstrated merit, they eventually reach, and become stuck, at a level too difficult for them to perform effectively; they are promoted to incompetence. This reduces the effectiveness of a meritocratic system, the supposed main practical benefit of which is the competence of those who run the society.

In his book ''Meritocratic Education and Social Worthlessness'' (Palgrave, 2012), the philosopher [[Khen Lampert]] argued that educational meritocracy is nothing but a [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] version of social Darwinism. Its proponents argue that the theory justifies [[social inequality]] as being meritocratic. This [[social theory]] holds that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] is a model, not only for the development of biological traits in a population, but also as an application for human [[social institution]]s—the existing social institutions being implicitly declared as [[normative]]. Social Darwinism shares its roots with early [[progressivism]], and was most popular from the late nineteenth century to the end of [[World War II]]. Darwin only ventured to propound his theories in a biological sense, and it is other thinkers and theorists who have applied Darwin's model normatively to unequal endowments of human ambitions.

In [[public policy]], '''outrage factor''' is public opposition to a policy that is not based on the knowledge of the technical details. The term "outrage factor" originates from Peter Sandman's 1993 book, ''Responding to Community Outrage: Strategies for Effective Risk Communication''.&lt;ref name="nebel"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Nebel|first=Bernard J.|author2=Richard T. Wright |title=Environmental science: the way the world works  |publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|year=1993 |edition=4th|pages=392–3|isbn=0-13-285446-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wjxeUeaRnMC&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;dq=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;pg=PA393#v=onepage&amp;q=%22OUTRAGE%20FACTOR%22&amp;f=false}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

"Outrage factors" are the emotional factors that influence perception of risk. The risks that are considered involuntary, industrial and unfair are often given more weight than factors that are thought of as voluntary, natural and fair.

Sandman gives the formula:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Risk communications ==
While [[policy analysis]] by institutional [[Stakeholder analysis|stakeholder]]s typically focuses on [[risk-benefit analysis]] and [[cost-benefit analysis]], popular [[risk perception]] is not informed by the same concerns. The successful implementation of a policy relying on public support and cooperation must address the outrage factor when informing the public about the policy.

In an interview with ''[[New York Times]]'' [[journalist]] and [[Freakonomics]] author [[Stephen J. Dubner]], Sandman emphasized "the most important truth in risk communication is the exceedingly low correlation between whether a risk is dangerous, and whether it's upsetting".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/11/29/risk-hazard-outrage-a-conversation-with-risk-consultant-peter-sandman/

{{Libertarian socialism}}

'''Participism''' is a [[libertarian socialist]] political philosophy consisting of two independently created economic and political systems: [[participatory economics]] or "parecon" and [[participatory politics]] or "parpolity". Participism is intended as an alternative to both [[capitalism]] and centrally-planned [[state socialism]]. Participism has significantly informed the International Organization for a Participatory Society.
{{Socialism sidebar}}

==Overview==
Advocates of participism envision remaking all of [[human]] [[society]] from the bottom up according to principles of [[Radical democracy|direct participatory democracy]] and replacing economic and social competition with cooperation. Supporters of what is termed a "participatory society" support the eventual dissolution of the centralized [[Sovereign state|state]], [[market (economics)|market]]s, and [[money]] (in its current form) placing it in the tradition of anti-authoritarian libertarian socialism. To elucidate their vision for a new society, advocates of participism categorize their aspirations into what they term a "liberating theory".

Liberating theory is a [[holistic]] framework for understanding society that looks at the whole of society and the interrelations among different parts of people's social lives. Participism groups human society into four primary "spheres", all of which are set within an international and [[ecological]] context, and each of which has a set of defining functions:

*The [[Participatory politics|political]] sphere: policy-making, administration, and collective implementation.
*The [[Participatory Economics|economic]] sphere: production, consumption, and allocation of the material means of life.
*The [[Femminism|kinship]] sphere: procreation, nurturance, socialisation, gender, sexuality, and organisation of daily home life.
*The [[Polyculturalism|community]] sphere: development of collectively shared historical identities, culture, religion, spirituality, linguistic relations, lifestyles, and social celebrations.

Within each sphere there are two components. The first component is the ''Human Centre'', the collection of people living within a society. Each person has needs, desires, personalities, characteristics, skills, capacities, and consciousness. The second component is the ''Institutional Boundary'', all of society’s social institutions that come together to form interconnected roles, relationships, and commonly held expectations and patterns of behaviour, that produce and reproduce societal outcomes. These institutions come together to help shape who people are as individuals.

===Participatory politics===

{{Main|Participatory politics}}

''Parpolity'' is the political system first proposed by [[Stephen R. Shalom]], professor of [[political science]] at William Paterson University in New Jersey. Shalom has stated that Parpolity is meant as a long range vision of where [[social justice]] should reach its apex within the field of politics and should complement the level of participation in the economy with an equal degree of participation in policy and administrative matters.
[[File:Nested council.png|thumb|right|upright=2.0|A diagram of the nested council structure.]]
The values on which parpolity is based are:
*[[Political freedom|freedom]]
*[[Workers' self-management|self-management]]
*[[justice]]
*[[solidarity]]
*and [[Toleration|tolerance]].

The goal, according to Shalom, is to create a political system that will allow people to participate, as much as possible in a direct and face to face manner. The proposed decision-making principle is that every person should have say in a decision proportionate to the degree to which she or he is affected by that decision.

The vision is critical of aspects of modern representative democracies arguing that the level of political control by the people isn't sufficient. To address this problem parpolity suggests a system of Nested Councils, which would include every adult member of a given society.

In a country or society run according to participism, there would be local councils of voting citizens consisting of 25-50 members. These local councils would be able to pass any law that affected only the local council. No higher council would be able to override the decisions of a lower council, only a council court would be able to challenge a local law on [[human rights]] grounds. The councils would be based on [[consensus]], though majority votes are allowed when issues cannot be agreed upon.

Each local council would send a delegate to a higher level council, until that council fills with 25-50 members. These second level councils would pass laws on matters that effect the 625 to 2500 citizens that it represents. A delegate to a higher level council is bound to communicate the views of her or his sending council, but is not bound to vote as the sending council might wish. Otherwise, Shalom points out that there is no point in having nested councils, and everyone might as well vote on everything. A delegate is recallable at any time by her or his sending council. Rotation of delegates would be mandatory, and delegates would be required to return to their sending councils frequently.

The second level council sends a delegate to a third level council, the third level councils send delegates to a fourth level and so on until all citizens are represented. Five levels with 50 people on every council would represent 312,500,000 voters (around the population of the United States). However, the actual number of people represented would be even higher, given that young children would not be voting. Thus, with a further sixth level nested council, the entire human population could be represented. This would not however be equatable to a global world state, but rather would involve the dissolution of all existing [[nation-states]] and their replacement with a worldwide [[confederal]] "coordinating body" made of delegates immediately recallable by the nested council below them.

Lower level councils have the opportunity to hold referendums at any time to challenge the decisions of a higher level council. This would theoretically be an easy procedure, as when a threshold of lower level councils call for a referendum, one would then be held. Shalom points out that sending every issue to lower level councils is a waste of time, as it is equivalent to [[referendum]] democracy.

There would be staff employed to help manage council affairs. Their duties would perhaps include minute taking and researching issues for the council. These council staff would work in a balanced job complex defined by a participatory economy.

===Participatory economics===

{{Main|Participatory economics}}

''Parecon (participatory economics)'' is an economic system proposed primarily by activist and political theorist [[Michael Albert]] and radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]]. It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the [[Production (economics)|production]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[Resource allocation|allocation]] of resources in a given society. It is described as "an anarchistic economic vision", and a form of [[socialism]], the means of production are [[common ownership|owned in common]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The theory is proposed as an alternative to both contemporary capitalist market economies and centrally planned socialism. It distinguishes between two parts of the working class. The 'coordinator class' that does the conceptual, creative and managerial work and the rest of the class doing rote work. This situation is deemed 'coordinatorism', which the theory claims it to be a major flaw with [[Marxism]].{{r|looking|p=4-8}}

The underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are equity, solidarity, diversity, [[workers' self-management]] and efficiency. (Efficiency here means accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets.) It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions:
* [[Workers councils|workers' and consumers' councils]] utilizing self-managerial methods for making decisions,
* balanced job complexes,
* remuneration according to effort and sacrifice, and
* [[Economic democracy|participatory planning]].

In place of money parecon would have a form of currency in which [[Labour voucher|personal vouchers]] or "credits" would be awarded for work done to purchase goods and services. Unlike money, credits would disappear upon purchase, and would be non-transferable between individuals, making bribery and monetary theft impossible. Also, the only items or services with a price attached would most likely be those considered wants or non-essentials and anything deemed a need would be completely free of charge (e.g.: health care, public transportation).

Albert and Hahnel have stressed that parecon is only meant to address an alternative ''economic'' theory and must be accompanied by equally important alternative visions in the fields of politics, culture and kinship. The authors have also discussed elements of [[social anarchism]] in the field of politics, [[polyculturalism]] in the field of culture, and [[feminism]] in the field of family/kinship and gender relations as being possible foundations for future alternative visions in these other spheres of society. Since the publication of Albert's book "Parecon", other thinkers have come forward and incorporated these concepts which have rounded participism into a more fully formed political and social ideology.

===Feminist kinship===
''See also [[Nurture kinship]] and [[Free love]]''

Outside of both political and economic relations there still exists the sphere of human kinship. Participism sees this as a vital component in a liberated society and applies feminist principles to this aspect of human relations. Feminist kinship relations are seen to seek to free people from oppressive definitions that have been socially imposed and to abolish all sexual divisions of labour and [[sexist]] and [[heterosexist]] demarcation of individuals according to gender and sexuality.

Participism holds that a participatory society must be respectful on an individual’s nature, inclinations, and choices and all people must be provided with the means to pursue the lives they want regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, or age. Feminist kinship relations are dependent on the liberation of women, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] persons, youth, the elderly, and intersex ([[true hermaphroditism|hermaphroditic]] and [[pseudohermaphroditism|pseudohermaphroditic]]) individuals.

To extend liberation into daily home life, a participatory society aims to provide the means for traditional couples, single parents, [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transsexualism|transsexual]], [[transgender]], and [[intersex]] parents, communal parenting, [[polygamy]] (especially [[polyandry]]), [[polyamory|polyamorous]] and multiple parenting arrangements to develop and flourish. It is believed that within the home and the community, the task of raising children must be elevated in status. Highly personalised interaction between children and adults should be encouraged, and responsibilities for these interactions must be distributed equitably throughout society without segregating tasks by gender. A participatory society would provide parents with access to high quality day-care, flexible work hours, and parental leave options allowing them to play a more active role in the lives of their children.

The liberation of women and society from patriarchal and [[heteronormativity|heteronormative]] oppression, according to participism, requires total reproductive freedom. Society must provide all members with the right to family planning, without shame or guilt for performing or soliciting an abortion or for engaging in alternative sexual behavior and without fear of sterilization or economic deprivation; the right to have or not to have children and to terminate undesired pregnancies through unhindered access to [[birth control]] and unregulated [[abortion]], respectively; and the right to comprehensive sexual education and [[healthcare]] that provide every citizen with information and resources to live a healthy and fulfilling sex life.

In such [[sex-positivity|sex-positive]] participatory societies the full exploration of human sexuality, with the possible exception of [[child sexuality]], would be accepted and embraced as normative. Participism encourages the exercise of and experimentation of different forms of sexuality by consenting partners.

===Polycultural community===
Human society is held to have long and brutal history of conquest, [[colonisation]], [[genocide]], and slavery which cannot be transcended easily. To begin the step-by-step process of building a new historical legacy and set of behavioural expectations between [[community|communities]], a participatory society would construct intercommunalist institutions to provide communities with the means to assure the preservation of their diverse cultural traditions and to allow for their continual development. With [[Polyculturalism|polycultural]] intercommunalism, all material and psychological privileges that are currently granted to a section of the population at the expense of the dignity and standards of living for oppressed communities, as well as the division of communities into subservient positions according to culture, ethnicity, nationality, and religion, will be dissolved.
 
The multiplicity of cultural communities and the historical contributions of different communities would be respected, valued, and preserved by guaranteeing each sufficient material and communicative means to reproduce, self-define, develop their own cultural traditions, and represent their culture to all other communities. Through construction of intercommunalist relations and institutions that guarantee each community the means necessary to carry on and develop their traditions, a pariticipatory society assists eliminating negative inter-community relations and encourages positive interaction between communities that can enhance the internal characteristics of each.
 
In a participatory society, individuals would be free to choose the cultural communities they prefer and members of every community would have the right of dissent and to leave. Intervention would not be permitted except to preserve this right for all. Those outside a community would also be free to criticize cultural practices that they believe violate acceptable social norms, but the majority would not have the power to impose its will on a vulnerable minority.

==Criticisms==

===Anarchism===
Certain [[anarchism|anarchists]] of the libcom community (an internet community of [[Anarcho-communism|libertarian communists]]) have criticized the [[parpolity]] aspect of participism for deciding beforehand the scale and scope of the councils whilst only practice, they argue, can accurately indicate the size and scale of anarchist confederations and other organizational platforms, especially since each region is unique with unique residents and unique solutions and unique wants. Anarchists argue that such blueprints containing detailed information are either dangerous or pointless. Furthermore, some anarchists have criticized the potential use of referendums to challenge decisions taken by higher councils as this implies both a top-down structure and an absence of [[participatory democracy|vis-à-vis democracy]] as they argue that referendums are not participatory.&lt;ref name="libcom1"&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/participatory-society-or-libertarian-communism Parecon or libertarian communism?]. libcom.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also criticized the enforcement of laws passed by councils rather than the use of supposed voluntary custom or [[customary law]] which develops through mutual recognition rather than being enforced by an external authority, as they argue the laws passed by such councils would need to be.&lt;ref name="libcom1"/&gt;

===Capitalism===
The [[criticism of socialism]] could be applied to participism as well, as advocates of capitalism object to the absence of a market and [[private property]] in a hypothetical participatory society. However, in a debate with David Horowitz, Michael Albert argued that those criticisms could not apply to parecon, as it was especially designed to take them into account. New specific criticisms should then be formulated. For instance, in an answer to the comments of David Kotz and John O'Neill about one of their articles on the subject, Albert and Hahnel assert that they designed parecon understanding "that knowledge is distributed unequally throughout society",&lt;ref&gt;Albert, Michael and Robin Hahnel. 2002.

The '''[[political philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]]''' (1724–1804) favoured a [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=358 Kant’s Principles of Politics, including his essay on Perpetual Peace. A Contribution to Political Science]'', translation by W. Hastie, Edinburgh: Clark, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'' (1795), Kant listed several conditions that he thought necessary for ending wars and creating a lasting peace. They included a world of constitutional republics  by establishment of political [[community]].&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Perpetual Peace''. Trans. Lewis White Beck (377). For a summary and&lt;/ref&gt; His [[classical republicanism|classical republican]] theory was extended in ''Doctrine of Right'' (1797), the first part of ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Riedel]] ''Between Tradition and Revolution: The Hegelian Transformation of Political Philosophy'', Cambridge 1984&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century Kant's political philosophy had been enjoying a remarkable renaissance in English-speaking countries with more major studies in a few years than had appeared in the preceding many decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Kant's Political Philosophy: Rechtsstaat or Council Democracy?|jstor = 1406673|journal = The Review of Politics|date = 1985-04-01|pages = 253–280|volume = 47|issue = 2|first = A. Anthony|last = Smith|doi=10.1017/s003467050003672x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Kant's most significant contribution to political philosophy and the [[philosophy of law]] is the doctrine of ''[[Rechtsstaat]]''. According to this doctrine, the power of the state is limited in order to protect [[citizen]]s from the arbitrary exercise of [[authority]]. The ''Rechtsstaat'' ({{lang-de|[[:de:Rechtsstaat|Rechtsstaat]]}}) is a concept in [[continental Europe]]an legal thinking, originally borrowed from [[Germany|German]] [[jurisprudence]], which can be translated as "the legal state" or "state of rights". It is a  "constitutional [[State (polity)|state]]" in which the exercise of [[government]]al power is constrained by the [[law]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Schmitt]], ''The Concept of the Political'', ch. 7; ''Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy''&lt;/ref&gt; and is often tied to the [[Anglo-America]]n concept of the [[rule of law]]. Kant's political philosophy has been described as [[liberalism|liberal]] for its presumption of limits on the state based on the [[social contract]] as a regulative matter.&lt;ref&gt;• Gerald Gaus and Shane D. Courtland,  2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/  "Liberalism"], 1.1, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Immanuel Kant, ([1797]). ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', Part 1), Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Rechtsstaat'', the citizens share legally based [[civil liberties]] and they can use the [[court]]s. A country cannot be a [[liberal democracy]] without first being a ''Rechtsstaat''. German writers usually place [[Immanuel Kant]]'s theories at the beginning of their accounts of the movement toward the ''Rechtsstaat''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Constitution of Liberty]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rechtsstaat'' in the meaning of "constitutional state" was introduced in the latest works of Immanuel Kant after US and French constitutions were adopted in the late 18th century.  Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of a country’s written constitution. This supremacy must create guarantees for implementation of his central idea:  a permanent peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness of its people and their prosperity.  Kant was basing his doctrine on none other but [[constitutionalism]] and constitutional government. Kant had thus formulated the main problem of constitutionalism, “The constitution of a state is eventually based on the morals of its citizens, which, in its turns, is based on the goodness of this constitution.”{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Kant’s idea is the foundation for the constitutional theory of the twenty century.

The ''Rechtsstaat'' concept is based on the ideas, discovered by Immanuel Kant, for example, in his ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'': "The task of establishing a universal and permanent peaceful life is not only a part of the theory of law within the framework of pure reason, but per se an absolute and ultimate goal. To achieve this goal, a state must become the community of a large number of people, living provided with legislative guarantees of their property rights secured by a common constitution. The supremacy of this constitution… must be derived a priori from the considerations for achievement of the absolute ideal in the most just and fair organization of people’s life under the aegis of public law."&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, in ''History of Political Philosophy'', edited by [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Joseph Cropsey]], University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the ''Rechtsstaat'' appeared in the German context in [[Robert von Mohl]]'s book ''Die deutsche Polizeiwissenschaft nach den Grundsätzen des Rechtsstaates'' ("German police science according to the principles of the constitutional state", 1832–1834), and was contrasted with the [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[police state]].

Kant opposed "democracy"{{spaced ndash}}which, in that era, meant [[direct democracy]]{{spaced ndash}}believing that [[majority rule]] posed a threat to individual liberty. He stated, "…democracy is, properly speaking, necessarily a despotism, because it establishes an executive power in which "all" decide for or even against one who does not agree; that is, "all", who are not quite all, decide, and this is a contradiction of the general will with itself and with freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Perpetual Peace''. Trans. Lewis White Beck (352).&lt;/ref&gt; As most writers at the time he distinguished three forms of government: democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy with [[mixed government]] as the most ideal form of government.

A distinctive feature of Kant's political philosophy is his conviction that the university should be a model of creative conflict: the philosopher's role within the university should be to "police" the higher faculties (which in his day were theology, law and medicine), making sure their teaching conforms to the principles of reason; likewise, the goal of perpetual peace in society can be achieved only when the rulers consult with philosophers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;For an explanation and defense of these two aspects of Kant's political theory, see Stephen Palmquist's essays: [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/KIUMWP.htm "Kant's Ideal of the University as a Model for World Peace"], in ''Papers of International Conference on Two Hundred Years after Kant'' (Tehran, Iran: Allame Tabataba'i University Press, 2005), pp.207-222; and [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/PSAP.htm "The Philosopher as a 'Secret Agent' for Peace: Taking Seriously Kant's Revival of the 'Old Question'"], in Valerio Rohden, Ricardo R. Terra and Guido A. de Almeida (eds.), ''Recht und Frieden in der Philosophie Kants'', vol. 4 of ''Akten des X. Internationalen Kant-Kongresses'' (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2008), pp.601-612.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3142">'''"Public Official A"''' is a high-ranking public official alleged to be involved in [[political corruption]] during [[United States]] [[United States Attorney|Attorney]] [[Patrick Fitzgerald]]'s investigation of corruption in the [[Illinois|State of Illinois]]. The identity of Public Official A has not been officially released and the official has not been indicted, but a judge has confirmed that the person is former [[Governor of Illinois|Illinois Governor]] [[Rod Blagojevich]].&lt;ref name="chicago tribune"&gt;[[Chicago Tribune]]. [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-rezkofeb26,0,3564222.story Judge reveals Blagojevich is 'Public Official A']. By Jeff Coen, Bob Secter and John Chase, Chicago Tribune. Tribune reporters Ray Long and David Jackson contributed to this report. February 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculation on the identity of Public Official A==
In 2005, "Public Official A" was alleged to have selected consultants for private equity funds that appeared before the Illinois State Pension Funds via two close associates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Illinois Times]]. [http://www.illinoistimes.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A4697 “Public Official A”] - The feds leave no doubt who they’re after, but do they have the goods? by Rich Miller. September 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Those associates - Stuart Levine and [[Tony Rezko]] - were [[indictment|indicted]] by Attorney Fitzgerald. This led to considerable public speculation in 2006 that Blagojevich was “Public Official A” and that he would therefore be a key subject of an ongoing criminal investigation.&lt;ref name="CBS2"&gt;CBS2 Chicago, [[WBBM-TV]]. [http://cbs2chicago.com/local/blagojevich.corruption.rezko.2.663481.html Blagojevich Denies Being 'Public Official A']{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Mike Flannery. February 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ruling on February 26, 2008, confirmed the suspicion that Blagojevich was “Public Official A” when a federal judge referenced Blagojevich's campaign as the beneficiary of the activity for which previous legal documents had used the non-specific term.&lt;ref name="chicago tribune"/&gt; According to the [[Associated Press]], "News organizations including The Associated Press have long reported Blagojevich was Public Official A."&lt;ref&gt;[[The State Journal-Register]]. [http://www.sj-r.com/News/stories/25912.asp Judge: Blagojevich is 'Public Official A']. MIKE Robinson, Associated Press. February 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After the ruling, Blagojevich continued to deny he was "Public Official A".&lt;ref name="CBS2"&gt;CBS2 Chicago, [[WBBM-TV]].

The concept of the '''public trust''' relates back to the origins of [[democratic government]] and its seminal idea that within the public lies the true power and future of a society; therefore, whatever ''trust'' the public places in its officials must be respected.
One of the reasons that [[bribery]] is regarded as a notorious [[evil]] is that it contributes to a culture of [[political corruption]] in which the public trust is eroded. Other issues related to political corruption or betrayal of public trust are [[lobbying]], special [[interest group]]s and the public [[cartel]].

In the Philippines, "betrayal of public trust" is one of the impeachable offenses. In ''Francisco, Jr. vs. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Pilipino, Inc.,'' the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] ruled that the definition of "betrayal of public trust" is "a non-justiciable political question which is beyond the scope of its judicial power" under the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Francisco, Jr. v. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Pilipino, Inc. |vol=415 |reporter= SCRA |opinion=44 |pinpoint=105 |court=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] |date=2003 |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2003/nov2003/160261.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not prescribe which branch of government has the power to define it, but implies that Congress, which handles impeachment cases, has the power to do so.

'''Rational economic exchange''' also called goods exchange economy is an [[economic]] transaction where goods or services are transferred from the provider for a return of relative value (compensation) from the receiver in a manner that advances the economic interests of both parties. Rational economic exchange is implied in voluntary economic transactions between private parties (i.e., regular commerce) where it is assumed that an economic transaction would not occur unless both parties believed they would be better off after the trade.  Rational economic exchange can be implied in governmental taxation and spending where the agents of the citizen—government legislators and administrators—implement fiscal policy where tax assessment to the citizen is related, substantially, to an [[implied level of government service]].

[[File:Income Tax Germany 2010.png|thumb|German [[progressive tax]] rates for different incomes. Progressive tax systems require the rich to pay taxes at higher rates, to make it possible to raise larger total sums to pay for governmental functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Investopedia|title=The Advantages of a Progressive Tax|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue such systems are primarily for wealth redistribution.]]

'''Redistribution of income''' and '''redistribution of wealth''' are respectively the transfer of [[income]] and of [[wealth]] (including physical [[property]]) from some [[individual]]s to others by means of a social mechanism such as [[taxation]], [[charity (practice)|charity]], [[welfare]], [[public services]], [[land reform]], [[monetary policies]], [[confiscation]], [[divorce]] or [[tort]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/redistribution/ |title=Redistribution |date=2 July 2004 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |publisher=Stanford University |quote=The ''social mechanism'', such as a change in tax laws, monetary policies, or tort law, that engenders the redistribution of goods among these subjects|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term typically refers to redistribution on an economy-wide basis rather than between selected individuals.

Interpretations of the phrase vary, depending on personal perspectives, political ideologies and the selective use of statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|title=Fact Checker: Elizabeth Warren’s claim that the bottom 90 percent got ‘zero percent’ of wage growth after Reagan.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/23/elizabeth-warrens-claim-that-the-bottom-90-percent-got-zero-percent-of-wage-growth-after-reagan/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is frequently heard in politics, usually referring to perceived redistributions from those who have more to those who have less.  Occasionally, however, it is used to describe laws or policies that cause opposite redistributions that shift monetary burdens from wealthy to low-income individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Robert|title=Trump’s Stock in Trade is Cruelty. Count the ways.|url=http://www.newsweek.com/robert-reich-trumps-stock-trade-cruelty-count-ways-594472|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase can be emotionally charged and used to exaggerate or misconstrue the motivations of opponents during political debates.  For example, if an individual politician calls for increased taxes on higher income individuals, their sole focus may be to raise funds for specific government programs, tapping the largest available sources while realizing that low-wage workers have little or no excess income to draw tax revenues from. Political opponents might argue that this politician's prime motivation is to redistribute wealth, when redistribution is not their goal.

The phrase is often coupled with the term "[[Class conflict|class warfare]]," with high income earners and the wealthy portrayed as victims of unfairness and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FAIR|title=For Media, ‘Class War’ Has Wealthy Victims, Rich getting richer seldom labeled as belligerents.|url=http://fair.org/extra/for-media-class-war-has-wealthy-victims/|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redistribution tax policy should not be confused with [[predistribution]] policies.  "Predistribution" is the idea that the state should try to prevent inequalities occurring in the first place rather than through the tax and benefits system once they have occurred.  For example, a government predistribution policy might require employers to pay all employees a [[living wage]], not just a [[minimum wage]], as a "bottom-up" response to widespread income inequalities or high poverty rates.

Many alternate taxation proposals have been floated without the political will to alter the status quo. One example is the proposed "[[Buffett Rule]]", which is a hybrid taxation model composed of opposing systems, intended to minimize the favoritism of the special interest tax design.

The effects of a redistribution system are actively debated on ethical and economic grounds. The subject includes analysis of its rationales, objectives, means, and policy effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Cowell ([1987] 2008).  "redistribution of income and wealth," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_R000067&amp;edition=current&amp;q= TOC.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20140127"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rugaber |first1=Christopher S. |last2=Boak |first2=Josh |title=Wealth gap: A guide to what it is, why it matters |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140127/DABJ40P00.html |date=January 27, 2014 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=January 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 survey among 264 members of the [[American Economic Association]] found that 71.2% of them support redistribution, while 20.4% oppose it, and 7.2% had mixed feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Stern|first2=Charlotta|title=Economists’ policy views and voting|journal=Public Choice|date=2006|volume=126|issue=3-4|page=337|doi=10.1007/s11127-006-7509-6|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/klein/PdfPapers/KS_PublCh06.pdf|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient times, redistribution operated as a [[palace economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lukas|last=de Blois |author2=R.J. van der Spek |translator=Susan Mellor |title=An Introduction to the Ancient World|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|pages=56–60|isbn=0-415-12773-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These economies were centrally based around the administration, so the dictator or pharaoh had both the ability and the right to say who was taxed and who got special treatment.

Another early form of wealth redistribution occurred in [[Plymouth Colony]] under the leadership of [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]].&lt;ref name=commoncourse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/william-bradford|title=William Bradford – Facts &amp; Summary |publisher=History.com|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradford records in his diary that this "common course"&lt;ref name=commoncourse /&gt; bred confusion, discontent, distrust, and the colonists looked upon it as a form of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tYecOAN1cwwC&amp;pg=PA135 ''History of Plymouth Plantation''], p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term [[Distributism]] (also known as distributionism or distributivism) is an economic ideology that developed in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century based upon the principles of [[Catholic social teaching]], especially the teachings of [[Pope Leo XIII]] in his encyclical ''Rerum novarum'' and [[Pope Pius XI]] in ''Quadragesimo anno''.  More recently, [[Pope Francis]] in his ''Evangelii Gaudium'', echoed the earlier Papal statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunt III|first1=Arthur W.|title=Pope Francis Needs Distributism: Americans and popes alike can embrace a humane alternative to modern capitalism.|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/pope-francis-needs-distributism/|publisher=The American Conservative|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in economic systems ==
Different types of [[economic system]]s feature varying degrees of interventionism aimed at redistributing income, depending on how unequal their initial distributions of income are. Free-market [[capitalist]] economies tend to feature high degrees of income redistribution. However, Japan's government engages in much less redistribution because its initial wage distribution is much more equal than Western economies. Likewise, the [[socialist]] planned economies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc featured very little income redistribution because private [[Property income|capital and land income]] – the major drivers of income inequality in capitalist systems – was virtually nonexistent; and because the wage rates were set by the government in these economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rosser|first= Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title= Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher= MIT Press|date=July 23, 2003|isbn= 978-0262182348|page = 11|quote=Economies vary based on the extent to which and the methods by which governments intervene to redistribute income. This depends partly on how unequal income is to begin with before any redistributive policies are implemented. Thus the Japanese government does much less redistributing than the governments of many other capitalist countries because Japan has a more equal distribution of wages than most other capitalist countries. Command socialist economies also have had less income redistribution because governments initially control the distribution of income by setting wages and forbidding capital or land income.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern forms of redistribution ==
Today, income redistribution occurs in some form in most [[Democracy|democratic]] countries through economic policies. Some redistributive policies attempt to take wealth, income, and other resources from the “haves” and give them to the “have-nots,” but many redistributions go elsewhere.

In his article ''Redistribution'',&lt;ref name="Redistribution"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Dwight R.|title=Redistribution|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwight R. Lee states:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 
“…most government transfers are not from the rich to the poor. Instead, government takes from the relatively unorganized (e.g., consumers and general taxpayers) and gives to the relatively organized (groups politically organized around common interests, such as the elderly, sugar farmers, and steel producers). The most important factor in determining the pattern of redistribution appears to be political influence, not poverty. “

“The direct transfer of cash and services is only one way that government transfers income. Another way is by restricting competition among producers. The inevitable consequence—indeed, the intended consequence—of these restrictions is to enrich organized groups of producers at the expense of consumers. Here, the transfers are more perverse than with Medicare and Social Security. They help relatively wealthy producers at the expense of relatively poor (and, in some cases, absolutely poor) consumers. Many government restrictions on agricultural production, for example, allow farmers to capture billions of consumer dollars through higher food prices (see [[agricultural subsidy]] programs). Most of these dollars go to relatively few large farms, whose owners are far wealthier than the average taxpayer and consumer (or the average farmer). Also, wealthy farmers receive most of the government’s direct agricultural subsidies."

|}

Some consider the U.S. government’s progressive-rate [[income tax]] policy as redistributive, because some of the tax revenue goes to social programs such as welfare and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Christine, and Gerald C. Wright. ''Keeping the Republic: Power and Citizenship in American Politics.'' 7th ed.: CQ, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Progressive tax|progressive income tax]] system, a high income earner will pay a higher tax rate (a larger percentage of their income) than a low income earner; and therefore, will pay more total dollars per person.&lt;ref&gt;Prante, Gerald, and Scott A. Hodge. "The Distribution of Tax and Spending Policies in the United States." Tax Foundation. N.p., 13 Nov. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other taxation-based methods of redistributing income are the [[negative income tax]] for very low income earners and [[tax loopholes]] (tax avoidance) for the better-off.

Two other common types of governmental redistribution of income are [[subsidies]] and [[vouchers]] (such as [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]). These [[transfer payment]] programs are funded through general taxation, but benefit the poor or influential special interest groups and corporations.&lt;ref name="Redistribution"/&gt; While the persons receiving transfers from such programs may prefer to be directly given cash, these programs may be more palatable to society than cash assistance, as they give society some measure of control over how the funds are spent.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey S. Rosen &amp; Ted Gayer, Public Finance pp. 271–72 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the U.S. [[Social security|Social Security]] program redistributes income from the rich to the poor,  but the majority of those receiving Social Security earned their benefits through tax withholding from their paychecks or quarterly income statements, and most benefits are indexed to the actual earning levels of individual workers.  Only the highest- and lowest-income workers fall outside normal rates.  In addition, Social Security deductions are only taken from the first $200,000 in income, with nothing further taken from higher incomes over that amount. In other words, a person who earns $100 million a year pays the same Social Security tax as another worker who earns $200,000 a year.

Contrary to popular belief, a recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balls|first1=Andrew|title=Social Security Does Not Redistribute Income|url=https://www.nber.org/digest/may00/w7520.html#navDiv=6|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, overall, the Social Security System was slightly regressive against the poor and not redistributive, once important factors were taken into account (for example, the longer life expectancy of the wealthy when compared to the poor gives them more years to collect benefits).

Governmental redistribution of income may include a direct benefit program involving either cash transfers or the purchase of specific services for an individual. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;Rector, Robert. "The Redistributive State: The Allocation of Government Benefits, Services, and Taxes in the United States." The Heritage Foundation. N.p., 15 Sept. 2015. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare is a government-run health insurance program that covers people age 65 or older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with [[end-stage renal disease]] (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, sometimes called ESRD). This is a direct benefit program because the government is directly providing health insurance for those who qualify.

The difference between the [[Gini index]] for the [[income distribution]] before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Wealth redistribution can be implemented through [[land reform]] that transfers ownership of land from one category of people to another, or through [[inheritance tax]]es or direct [[wealth tax]]es. Before-and-after Gini coefficients for the [[distribution of wealth]] can be compared.

==Objectives==
The objectives of income redistribution are to increase economic stability and opportunity for the less wealthy members of society and thus usually include the funding of [[public services]].

One basis for redistribution is the concept of [[distributive justice]], whose premise is that money and resources ought to be distributed in such a way as to lead to a [[socially just]], and possibly more financially [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]], society. Another argument is that a larger [[middle class]] benefits an economy by enabling more people to be [[consumer]]s, while providing equal opportunities for individuals to reach a better standard of living. Seen for example in the work of [[John Rawls]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} another argument is that a truly fair society would be organized in a manner benefiting the least advantaged, and any inequality would be permissible only to the extent that it benefits the least advantaged.

Some proponents of redistribution argue that [[capitalism]] results in an [[externality]] that creates unequal wealth distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. A. ,''Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy''. Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=December 2011}} argue that wealth and income inequality are a cause of [[economic crises]], and that reducing these inequalities is one way to prevent or ameliorate economic crises, with redistribution thus benefiting the economy overall. This view was associated with the [[underconsumptionism]] school in the 19th century, now considered an aspect of some schools of [[Keynesian economics]]; it has also been advanced, for different reasons, by [[Marxian economics]]. It was particularly advanced in the US in the 1920s by [[Waddill Catchings]] and [[William Trufant Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dorfman|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgoewer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Allgoewer|first=Elisabeth|date=May 2002|title= Underconsumption theories and Keynesian economics.

There is currently a great debate concerning the extent to which the world's extremely rich have become richer over recent decades. Thomas Piketty's ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'' is at the forefront, critiqued in certain publications such as ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Forget the 1%; Free Exchange", ''The Economist'', 8 November 2014, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral obligation ===
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
[[Peter Singer]]'s argument contrasts to Thomas Pogge's in that he states we have an individual moral obligation to help the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utilitarianism.net/singer/by/1972----.htm|title=Famine, Affluence, and Morality, by Peter Singer|first=Pablo|last=Stafforini|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201106/fighting-poverty|title=Fighting Poverty|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, British researchers [[Richard G. Wilkinson]] and [[Kate Pickett]] show a correlation between income inequality and higher rates of health and social problems ([[obesity]], [[mental illness]], [[homicide]]s, [[teenage birth]]s, [[List of countries by incarceration rate|incarceration]], child conflict, drug use), and lower rates of social goods ([[List of countries by life expectancy|life expectancy]], educational performance, [[Trust (social sciences)|trust among strangers]], [[Women's rights#2011 study of status by country|women's status]], [[social mobility]], even numbers of [[patent]]s issued per capita), on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/resources/slides|title=The Spirit Level - The Equality Trust|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue inequality leads to the social ills through the psychosocial [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], [[Social status|status]] anxiety it creates.&lt;ref name=thinktanks&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/14/the-spirit-level-equality-thinktanks "The Spirit Level: how 'ideas wreckers' turned book into political punchbag"], Robert Booth, ''The Guardian'', 13 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[International Monetary Fund]] by Andrew G. Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry found a strong association between lower levels of inequality and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries (such as Brazil, Cameroon, Jordan) with high inequality have "succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years" but "longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2011/sdn1108.pdf "Inequality and Unsustainable Growth: Two Sides of the Same Coin?"] Andrew G.

==Criticism==
[[Public choice]] theory states that redistribution tends to benefit those with political clout to set spending priorities more than those in need, who lack real influence on government.&lt;ref&gt;Plotnick, Robert (1986) "An Interest Group Model of Direct Income Redistribution", ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'', vol. 68, no. 4, pp. 594–602.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] criticize redistribution via taxation in the context of [[Nordic model|Nordic-style]] [[social democracy]], highlighting its limited success at promoting relative egalitarianism and its lack of sustainability. They point out that social democracy requires a strong labor movement to sustain its heavy redistribution, and that it is unrealistic to expect such redistribution to be feasible in countries with weaker labor movements. They point out that, even in the Scandinavian countries, social democracy has been in decline since the labor movement weakened. Instead, Roemer and Bardhan argue that changing the patterns of enterprise ownership and [[market socialism]], obviating the need for redistribution, would be more sustainable and effective at promoting egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;"Market socialism, a case for rejuvenation", by Pranab Bardhan and Johen E. Roemer. 1992. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', vol. 6, no. 3, p. 104: "Since it (social democracy) permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labor movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxian economics|Marxian economists]] argue that social democratic reforms – including policies to redistribute income – such as unemployment benefits and high taxes on profits and the wealthy create more contradictions in capitalism by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system via reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.&lt;ref name="Market Socialism 1998. P.60-61"&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', by Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell. 1998. pp. 60–61: "The Marxist answers that...it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the [[reserve army of labour]], taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion)."&lt;/ref&gt; In the Marxist view, redistribution cannot resolve the fundamental issues of capitalism – only a transition to a socialist economy can.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2982">The '''Scottish Militia Bill''' (known formerly as the '''Scotch Militia Bill''') is the usual name given to a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] that was passed by the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and [[House of Lords]] of the Parliament of  [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in early 1708. However, on 11 March 1708,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/parliament/1705 |title=Parliaments: 1705 |author= |website=The History of Parliament |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |access-date=6 November 2016 |quote="On 11 Mar. 1708, when the Queen attended the Lords to give assent to several bills, she used her prerogative of veto against one, the bill for settling the Scottish militia."}} &lt;!-- Note that per WP:OSNS we record this as 11 March 1708, but contemporary records would put it in 1707 as the legal year did not start until 25 March. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] withheld [[royal assent]] on the advice of her ministers for fear that the proposed [[militia]] would be disloyal.&lt;ref&gt;Queen Anne's veto is recorded as "La Reine se avisera" ("The Queen will consider it") in 18 H.L. Jour. 506 (1707).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The bill's long title was "An Act for settling the Militia of that Part of Great Britain called Scotland". Its object was to arm the Scottish militia, which had not been recreated at the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]]. This happened as the unification between Scotland and England under the [[Acts of Union 1707]] had been passed.

On the day the bill was meant to be signed, news came that the French were sailing toward Scotland for the [[Planned_French_invasion_of_Britain_(1708)|planned invasion of 1708]] and there was suspicion that the Scottish might be disloyal. Therefore, support for a veto was strong.

==Significance==
The Scottish Militia Bill is the last bill to have been refused royal assent. Before this, [[William III of England|King William III]] had vetoed bills passed by Parliament six times. Royal assent to bills and governments generally came to be viewed as a mere formality once both Houses of Parliament had successfully read a bill three times, or a general election had taken place.

In the British colonies, the denial of royal assent had continued past 1708, and was one of the primary complaints of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776: that the King "has refused his Assent to Laws, most wholesome and necessary for the public Good" and "He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing Importance".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24767">{{Governance}}The concepts of '''security sector governance and reform''' ('''SSG/R''', or '''SSG''' and '''SSR''') generally refer to a process in [[Western world|Western]]-based [[international development]] and [[democratization]] to amend the [[national security|security sector]] of a state towards [[good governance]] and its principles, such as [[freedom of information]] and the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_1_Security_Sector_Governance_EN.pdf|title=Security Sector Governance: Applying the principles of good governance to the security sector|last=|first=|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915023424/http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_1_Security_Sector_Governance_EN.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Security System Reform and Governance|last=|first=|publisher=OECD DAC|year=2005|isbn=92-64-00786-5|series=DAC Guidelines and Reference Series|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of security sector reform (SSR) is to achieve good security sector governance (SSG)—where security actors are effective and accountable to their people. For example, SSR might guide decision-making on what form should the oversight of armed forces take or how transparent will intelligence agencies be according to legislation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2151(2014)|title=UN Security Council Resolution 2151 (S/RES/2151) on Security sector reform: challenges and opportunities|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121073122/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2FRES%2F2151%282014%29|archivedate=2017-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different nomenclature of the same overall framework include '''security system reform''' ('''SSR'''), '''security sector reconstruction''' ('''SSR''') and '''justice and security sector reform''' ('''JSSR''').&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_2_Security%20Sector%20Reform.pdf|title=Security Sector Reform: Applying the principles of good governance to the security sector|last=|first=|publisher=DCAF|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183845/http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_2_Security%20Sector%20Reform.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1994, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) adopted a Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security stating that the democratic control of the security sector as essential to stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.osce.org/fsc/41355?download=true|title=Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security|last=|first=|publisher=OSCE|year=1994|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829145812/http://www.osce.org/fsc/41355?download=true|archivedate=2017-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A framework for security sector reform (SSR) emerged in 1999 after [[international development]] actors observed from examples in [[South Africa]], [[Indonesia]] and countries in Eastern Europe that national security and its components were considered crucial in a state recovering from [[War|conflict]] or an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian regime]]. Reportedly, the increasing number of [[Civil war|civil wars]] led development actors to look at the problem of insecurity from the perspective of good governance. The conclusion was that the security sector should adhere to the same rules of good governance as any other public service to curb conflict and violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clingendael.nl/publication/ssr-securing-its-success-justifying-its-relevance|title=SSR: Securing its success, justifying its relevance|last=Price|first=Megan|date=2014-08-19|work=Clingendael|access-date=|last2=van Veen|first2=Erwin|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234737/https://www.clingendael.nl/publication/ssr-securing-its-success-justifying-its-relevance|archivedate=2017-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==
[[File:Female police officer of Denmark.jpg|thumb|The [[Service quality|quality of the service]] provided by the police, such as the pictured [[Police of Denmark]], is a component of security sector governance and reform]]There is no single globally accepted definition of security sector reform (SSR), but it generally refers to a process to reform or rebuild a state's [[National security|security sector]] towards good security sector governance (SSG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/joint-communication-ssr-20160705-p1-854572_en.pdf|title=Elements for an EU-wide strategic framework to support security sector reform, JOIN(2016) 31 final|last=|first=|publisher=European Commission|year=2016|isbn=|location=Strasbourg|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825234526/https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/joint-communication-ssr-20160705-p1-854572_en.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/115810.pdf|title=Security Sector Reform|last=|first=|publisher=USAID, US Departments of Defense and State|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107024030/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/115810.pdf|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good SSG is usually defined as a number of idealized principles and good practices of a healthy security sector servicing its people. Likewise, the objective of SSR is defined as the application of the same principles of [[good governance]] to the security sector as to any other public sector service delivery, such as [[public health]] or [[education]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dcaf.ch/about-ssgr|title=About SSG/R|last=|first=|date=|website=DCAF (Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces)|language=en|access-date=2017-11-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012716/http://dcaf.ch/about-ssgr|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (]]OECD) has defined four standards that SSR should strive for:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Establishment of effective governance, oversight and accountability in the security system; 2) improved delivery of security and justice services; 3) development of local leadership and ownership of the reform process; and 4) sustainability of justice and security service delivery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The target of SSR are the components of the state that uphold [[national security]]. Although the security sector is therefore a wide term open to interpretation, it is generally used to describe the structures, institutions and personnel responsible for the management, provision and oversight of security in a certain country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/ssr/ssr_perspective_2012.pdf|title=The United Nations SSR Perspective|last=|first=|publisher=UN SSR Unit|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519215426/http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/ssr/ssr_perspective_2012.pdf|archivedate=2017-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the scope and target of SSR has usually been defined comprising the following four groups:
* Core security actors, such as armed forces, police, gendarmerie, border guards, customs and immigration, and intelligence and security services;
* security management and oversight bodies, such as ministries of defence and internal affairs, financial management bodies and public complaints commissions;
* justice and law enforcement institutions, such as the judiciary, prisons, prosecution services, traditional justice systems; and
* non-statutory security forces, such as private security companies, guerrilla armies and private militia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/deza/en/documents/themen/fragile-kontexte/224402-oecd-handbook-security-system-reform_EN.pdf|title=The OECD DAC Handbook on Security System Reform (SSR) - Supporting Security and Justice|last=|first=|publisher=OECD DAC|year=2007|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821172956/https://www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/deza/en/documents/themen/fragile-kontexte/224402-oecd-handbook-security-system-reform_EN.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/%28httpAssets%29/904B9EE812B7591FC12573F400322816/$file/Joint+Seminar_A-62-659_S-2008-39.pdf|title=Securing peace and development: the role of the United Nations in supporting security sector reform - Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/659)|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905032133/http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/904B9EE812B7591FC12573F400322816/$file/Joint+Seminar_A-62-659_S-2008-39.pdf|archivedate=2014-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fba.se/en/how-we-work/security-sector-reform/|title=Security Sector Reform|last=|first=|date=|work=Folke Bernadotte Academy|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826130304/https://fba.se/en/how-we-work/security-sector-reform/|archivedate=2016-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objective ==
[[File:SSG and SSR.png|thumb|A diagram of the relationship between security sector reform and governance relative to time and quality|left]]To observe and measure the quality of SSG as well as set more definite objectives, [[international development]] actors generally break down good security sector governance into different principless that are believed to showcase different subparts of a healthy security sector under democratic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/resources/what-good-governance|title=What is Good Governance?|last=|first=|date=2009-06-10|website=United Nations ESCAP|language=en|access-date=2017-04-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423153306/http://www.unescap.org/resources/what-good-governance|archivedate=2017-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While exact configurations vary, some of the most common principles or objectives of good SSG that are commonly used include [[accountability]], [[rule of law]], and [[effectiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.osce.org/secretariat/231176|title=Security Sector Governance and Reform: Guidelines for OSCE Staff|last=|first=|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)|year=2016|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825185357/http://www.osce.org/secretariat/231176|archivedate=2017-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Thomas G.|date=2000-10-01|title=Governance, good governance and global governance: Conceptual and actual challenges|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713701075|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=21|issue=5|pages=795–814|doi=10.1080/713701075|issn=0143-6597}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A multitude of different practical situations of good SSG exist according to development actors: For example, in a security sector lead by good governance, the [[use of force]] is defined by a legal framework. This subsequently requires, among others, that publicly transparent [[law]]s are in place; oversight and [[separation of powers]] mechanisms are established and working; and the state's [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] use of force is regulated through strategies and policies.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An operational level example would be improved and open interaction between the public and the security sector, including functioning [[freedom of information]] and [[complaint]] institutes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

SSR is aimed at the existence of both national security and [[human security]]. However, the goals of providing national and human security can be conflictual in the context of conflict-torn societies which lack the framework of democratic governance. According to Florian Weigand, the experiences of SSR in [[Afghanistan]], for example, have prompted a debate on the advantages of providing human rather than state security in the process of state-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/pdf/WP/WP135.pdf|title=How can security sector reforms contribute to State-Building?

==Implementation==

SSR is not understood by researchers to be limited to a single political situation, but rather can be introduced in various contexts. The circumstances under which reform efforts are undertaken are often classified as three different reform environments: post-conflict, [[Provisional government|transitional]] and [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Nevertheless, security sector reform is most commonly introduced in post-conflict settings after [[war]] has ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/security-governance-post-conflict-peacebuilding|title=Security Governance in Post-Conflict Peacebuilding|last=Bryden|first=Alan|last2=Hänggi|first2=Heiner|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2005|isbn=978-3-8258-9019-3|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915024200/http://www.dcaf.ch/security-governance-post-conflict-peacebuilding|archivedate=2017-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its insensitive application to such contexts has raised criticism. For example, Jane Chanaa has argued that there is a concept–context divide because conceptualisation overshadowed the understanding on how the idea adapts to the local situations whereas Safal Ghimire has noted that such a chasm exists also because the 'SSR' concept does not talk about reforms in the benefactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chanaa, Jane.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2009}}
'''Seniority''' is the concept of a person or group of people taking precedence over another person or group because the former is either older than the latter or has occupied a particular position longer than the latter. Seniority is present between parents and children and may be present in other common relationships, such as among siblings of different ages or between workers and their managers.

Under a seniority system, control is often granted to senior persons due to length of service in a given position. When persons of senior rank have less length of service than their subordinates, "seniority" may apply to either concept.

== In armed forces ==&lt;!--linked from [[Adrian Johns]]--&gt;

In some military [[command structure]]s, the length of time someone has held a particular rank is called "seniority in grade" and determines whether that person is senior to another person of the same [[military rank|rank]]. For instance, a captain who was promoted five years ago can give orders to a captain who was promoted three years ago.

== In politics ==

Seniority in [[United States politics]], when used out of context, is informally defined as the number of years one member of a group has been a part of the group. For example, as of January 2015, [[John Conyers]] from [[Michigan]] is the most senior member of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;http://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/seniority&lt;/ref&gt; However, "seniority" can also refer to political power attained by position within the United States Government. For further details, see:
* [[United States Order of Precedence]]
* [[United States Presidential Line of Succession]]
* [[Seniority in the United States Senate]]
* [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives]]
Seniority is viewed sometimes both positively and negatively. Many elected officials are viewed as retaining their position only because they have been there for many years, which can reflect voter stagnancy and the benefits of incumbency. On the other hand, long years of [[Incumbent|incumbency]] can also be seen as a sign of the person's ability to continue pleasing voters or the use of seniority to deliver benefits to constituents.

In some countries the [[Dean of the Diplomatic Corps]] receives special treatment.

== In employment ==
In [[trade union|unionised]] companies, employees with more seniority may enjoy more work privileges. Here are examples: 
* [[Shift work]] at more favourable times
* Work that is deemed easier or more pleasurable
* Working hours at a more convenient time (convenience being relative to the employee)
* Assignment to work, when a work reduction, or a reduction in available work hours results in layoffs

Seniority also has an influence over [[bump (union)|bumping]] rights, which is a reassignment of jobs, possibly for many people at a time.

Some traditionalist employers, common in smaller, single-operated business, take a "last in, first out" ([[LIFO (education)|LIFO]]) perspective, meaning those who have been there longest or who have [[tenure]] have the right to stay, whereas other employers take a "first in, first out" ([[FIFO (disambiguation)|FIFO]]) or "inverse seniority" viewpoint, which tends to emphasize a new or "fresh start" for the company.

Seniority does have several positive factors to its name.  Individuals may be draws toward specific field or occupation with the knowledge that seniority is obtainable.  If seniority were to be banished as a whole, many higher paid employees would be fired first just because they make more money than their peers.  Seniority does an effective job in helping people, interested in staying at one organization, in working towards having a "marathon" career.  One of the goals of a seniority system is [[employee retention]], which ensures an organization is retaining institutional knowledge, erudite employees, and a wealth of wisdom within an organization for new hires to pool from.  It's important to make sure employees are here to stay. 

Though the principle of seniority does an effective job of protecting long-term employees, in some scenarios, it can fail to address several critical factors.  Firstly, spots secured by seniority casts aside some of the most appealing perspectives.  Individuals will become less driven to enter a field that does not reinforce their efforts with employment.  Secondly, the security of [[tenure]] often encourages mediocrity.  Employees with the knowledge that their spot in the workplace is secured will naturally become less likely to improve their working ethics as they may no longer view improvement as a necessity.  Lastly, a system rewarding individuals for their hiring date does not encourage professional growth.  If individuals are aware they only have to reach a certain time-span of employment to have a guaranteed position in a company, they will not grow professionally once they have reached their mark.   &lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/heather-wolpertgawron/pros-and-cons-of-the-seni_b_831740.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In transport ===
[[Commercial aviation]] pilots working for a carrier have their privileges determined by their seniority or generally known as the "pilot seniority list." These privileges can be income level, routes flown, types of aircraft, work schedules and positions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airlineempires.net/blog/2008/03/pilot-seniority-101-part-1-the-sacred-cow/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/6984637.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://science.howstuffworks.com/pilot6.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://science.howstuffworks.com/pilot7.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Seniority is most important when deciding which pilots to upgrade to a larger, more complex aircraft type; or for upgrading a [[First Officer (civil aviation)|First Officer]] to the rank of a [[Captain (civil aviation)|Captain]].

[[Engine driver]]s with many [[railway]]s also have a seniority list, but it is focused on work scheduling. Younger engine drivers often serve as back-up personnel and must help out on a very short notice – for example when a colleague calls in sick or has a delay.

'''Spatial justice''' links together [[social justice]] and space, most notably in the works of geographers [[David Harvey]] and [[Edward W. Soja]]. The organization of space is a crucial dimension of human societies and reflects social facts and influences social relations ([[Henri Lefebvre]], 1968, 1972). Consequently, both [[justice]] and injustice become visible in space. Therefore, the analysis of the interactions between space and society is necessary to understand social injustices and to formulate territorial policies aiming at tackling them. It is at this junction that the concept of spatial justice has been developed.

== Social justice ==

According to this political theory, space being a fundamental dimension of human societies, [[social justice]] is embedded in it. So the understanding of interactions between space and societies is essential to the understanding of social injustices and to a reflection on planning policies that aims at reducing them. This reflection can be guided by the concept of spatial justice, which ties Social Justice with space.
Spatial justice is a crucial challenge because it is the ultimate goal of many planning policies. However, the diversity of definitions of "[[Justice]]" (and of the possible "[[social contract]]s" that legitimate them), is high and the political objectives of [[regional planning]] or [[urban planning]] can be quite different and even contradictory.

Therefore, it is important to analyze the concept of spatial justice, which is still rarely questioned (particularly since the work of Anglo-American [[critical geography|radical geographers]] in the 1970s–1980s&lt;ref&gt;See [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], ''Social Justice and the City'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;) to the extent that it has been taken for granted. These past few years, several events and publications have demonstrated the rising interest of human and social sciences for the concept of spatial justice.&lt;ref&gt;A conference investigating the concept of spatial justice was held in March 2008 at the University Paris-Ouest Nanterre, France. Moreover, ''justice spatiale - spatial justice'', a scientific Journal centered on Spatial Justice has been created in 2009: http://jssj.org/. A book focused on Spatial Justice has also been written by [[Edward W. Soja]] in 2010 : 
SOJA Edward W., 2010, ''Seeking Spatial Justice'', Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Between issues of redistribution and decision-making processes ==
The concept of spatial justice opens up several perspectives for social sciences. Building on the work of several famous Justice philosophers ([[John Rawls]], 1971; [[Iris Marion Young]], 1990, 2000), two contrasting approaches of justice have polarized the debate: one focuses on redistribution issues, the other concentrates on decision-making processes. 
A first set of approaches consists in asking questions about spatial or socio-spatial distributions and working to achieve an equal geographical distribution of society's wants and needs, such as [[Employment|job opportunities]], [[Health disparities|access to health care]], [[Air Quality Index|good air quality]], et cetera.  This is of particular concern in regions where the population has difficulty moving to a more spatially just location due to poverty, discrimination, or political restrictions (such as apartheid [[pass laws]]).  Even in free, developed nations, access to many places are limited.  Geographer [[Don Mitchell (geographer)|Don Mitchell]] points to the mass [[privatization]] of once-public land as a common example of spatial injustice. In this distributive justice perspective, the access to material and immaterial goods, or to social positions indicates whether the situation is fair or not. At the scale of urban space, questions of accessibility, walkability and transport equity can also be seen as matters of distribution of spatial resources.

Another way of tackling the concept of spatial justice is to focus on decision-making procedures: this approach also raises issues of representations of space, of territorial or other identities and of social practices. For instance, focusing on minorities allows to explore their spatial practices but also to investigate how these are experienced and managed by various agents: this may lead to reveal forms of [[oppression]] or [[discrimination]] that a universalist approach might disregard otherwise.
In sum, depending on the chosen approach, either questions are asked about spatial distributions because justice is evaluated from "results", or questions are asked about space representations, (spatial or not) identities and experiences because justice is defined as a process. Spatial justice stands as a unifying concept for the social sciences: its coherence stems from a reflection on the modalities of the political decision-making and on the policies implemented in order to improve spatial distributions.

== Environmental justice ==
The emergence of the concept of [[sustainable development]] has also fostered a debate on environmental equity. It questions our ontological relationship to the world, and the possibility of a fair policy addressing the needs of mankind, present and future, local and global, and of new forms of governance. The notion of "Environmental Justice" was created in the 1970s–1980s in North American cities to denounce the spatial overlapping between forms of [[racial discrimination]] and social-economic exclusion, industrial pollutions and vulnerability to natural hazards.

A '''straw donor''' is a person who illegally uses another person's [[money]] to make a [[political contribution]] in their own name.&lt;ref&gt;NewsOn6, The Associated Press, "Stipe Investigated In Alleged 'Straw Donor' Scheme," http://kotv.com/news/local/story/?id=122067#, Accessed 8/6/2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

==United States==
In the United States, making a political contribution in another person's name is illegal, as is agreeing to be the named donor with someone else's money.&lt;ref&gt;NewsOK.com, Tony Thornton and Nolan Clay, "FBI says straw donors backed others," http://newsok.com/article/3024944?pg=2, Accessed 8/10/08&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a straw donor may contribute to a political campaign before being reimbursed by another, who is using that person as a conduit to exceed the limits on campaign contributions under the laws of a jurisdiction.

In federal elections in the United States, straw donor schemes are illegal under [[Title 52 of the United States Code|52 U.S.C.]] § 30122, which states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No person shall make a contribution in the name of another person or knowingly permit his name to be used to effect such a contribution, and no person shall knowingly accept a contribution made by one person in the name of another person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Title 52 of the United States Code|52 U.S.C. § 30122]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30122]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This section was enacted as part of the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] in 1971.

===Massachusetts 2016===
{{POV section|date=February 2017}}
A Massachusetts law firm,  Thornton Law, has been accused of funneling funds to the Democrats through a massive and illegal straw-donor scheme.

Law firm partners donated nearly $1.6 million to mostly Democratic candidates and committees between 2010 through 2014. They were reimbursed ten days later $1.4 million listed as '''bonuses,''' including more than 280 in amounts that precisely matched their donations.

The case was closed without any prosecution. “While our investigation did not find sufficient evidence to support a criminal charge, we are recommending enhancements to current state campaign finance laws to address the ambiguities in the law that gave rise to these allegations,”  Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said.

The small firm made donations to Democrats [[Barack Obama]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[ Elizabeth Warren]] and Sen. [[Harry Reid]], and others. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3899648/Massachusetts-law-firm-reimbursed-partners-political-donations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dinesh D'Souza===
In 2014, [[Dinesh D'Souza]], an outspoken political commentator, author, and filmmaker was charged and convicted for reimbursing others $20,000 for donations to 2012 Senate candidate Wendy Long, a New York Republican.

President Trump pardoned D'Souza May 31, 2018.

===Jeffrey E. Thompson===
In 2016, Jeffrey E. Thompson, was sentenced to three months in prison, 3 years of probation, and a $10,000 fine for the illegal funding through straw donors of several political candidates, including Hilary Clinton in her 2008 presidential bid and Vincent Gray in his 2010 run for mayor of Washington, D.C. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/shadow-campaign-donor-and-mastermind-set-for-sentencing-in-federal-court/2016/08/13/66df47a6-5a52-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html?noredirect=on&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synoecism''' or '''synecism''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ᵻ|ˈ|n|iː|s|ɪ|z|əm}} {{respell|si|NEE|siz-əm}}; {{lang-grc|συνοικισμóς}}, ''sunoikismos'', {{IPA-el|syːnɔi̯kismós|anc}}), also spelled '''synoikism''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ᵻ|ˈ|n|ɔɪ|k|ɪ|z|əm}} {{respell|si|NOY|kiz-əm}}), was originally the amalgamation of villages in [[Ancient Greece]] into ''poleis'', or city-states.  Etymologically the word means "dwelling together (''syn'') in the same house (''oikos'')." Subsequently, any act of civic union between polities of any size was described by the word ''synoikismos''. The closest analogy today is the incorporation of a city; in fact, "incorporation" is often used to translate synoikismos, in addition to the Latinized synoecism. Synoecism is opposed to Greek dioecism (διοικισμóς, ''dioikismos''), the creation of independent communities within the territory of a polis.

Synoecism is the result of a few major factors, mainly an increase in population density of adjacent settlements, with an incorporation proposed for economic, political or ideological advantages, such as the synoecism of the communities of [[Attica]] into [[Athens]], or by imposition of a ruling power, such as the synoecism of [[Messenia]] into the newly built city of [[Messene]]. 

A dioecism is essentially the inverse of a synoecism, the releasing of cities, towns or villages from their association with a polis. This process might manifest itself in several ways, such as the settling of new but independent communities within former territory of [[Constantinople]] on land abandoned due to a contraction of population, or the contraction of [[Thessaloniki]] out of its former neighborhoods outside the city walls due to the occupation of the countryside by the Turks.&lt;ref name="dop57"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.doaks.org/DOP57/DP57ch03.pdf |title=Dumbarton Oaks, Papers, No. 57: Symposium on Late Byzantine Thessaloniki |type=extract |first=Charalambos |last=Bakirtyis |contribution=The Urban Continuity and Size of Late Byzantine Thessalonike |editor-first=Alice-Mary |editor-last=Talbot |year=2004 |origyear=2003 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Trustees for Harvard University, Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection |pages=40–41, 64 |accessdate=2007-04-03 |format=[[PDF]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221202637/http://www.doaks.org/DOP57/DP57ch03.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A conqueror might break up a polis for various reasons. As part of the settlement of the [[Third Sacred War]] in 346 BC, the [[Amphictyonic League]] was commissioned to destroy 21 or 22 cities of [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]], many of which had already been burned. They chose the method of dioecism, returning the ''poleis'' to their constituent ''kōmai'', or villages. The city fortifications were then dismantled. This relatively mild destruction was reversed by Athens and Thebes several years later. They were sympathetic to Phocis but their hands had been legally tied. The cities were re-synoecized. The larger states assisted Phocis to rebuild the fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=An inventory of archaic and classical poleis | editor1-first= Mogens Herman | editor1-last= Hansen | editor2-first= Thomas Heine | editor2-last=Nielsen | contribution= Phokis | first = Jacques | last=Oulhen | year=2004 | location= Oxford | publisher= Oxford University Press | pages = 400–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General concept==

Although there were differences between synoecism in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], the same general concept is deduced from the history of both civilizations. Before political union, the future (combined) population of the polity constituted smaller settlements that were not obligated to each other, or at least not by the contract that was later to institute their political union. A settlement or group of settlements might be constituents of another polity from which they would be annexed or transferred.

==In ancient Greece==
In [[ancient Greece]], society was divided into the ''[[deme|demos]]'' (δῆμοι, κῶμαι; "country people" or "country villages") and the "asty" (ἄστυ) or "[[polis]]" (πόλις). The polis was the situs of the princely [[nobility]], gentry, and aristocracy and the sacerdotal and martial families. The distinction between the "demos" and the "polis" was politically very important in these ancient states. There was much antagonism between the two bodies of the country and city. Where commerce and trade came to dominate culture and ideology, they encouraged men to live together in larger towns and develop democracies. In the city states of classical Greece, synoecism occurred when the "demos" combined with and subordinated, usually by force, the "politiea" in one polity.&lt;ref name="rahe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rahe|first=Paul A |title= Republics Ancient and Modern|year=1994|series=I|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location= Chapel Hill and London |chapter=20 | page = 323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''poleis'', the ''synoikistes'' was the person who according to tradition executed the synoecism, either by charisma or outright conquest; he was subsequently worshiped as a demi-god. The most famous ''synoikistes'' was the mythic and legendary [[Theseus]], who liberated [[Attica, Greece|Attica]] from [[Knossos|Cretan]] hegemony and restored the independence of [[Greece]] under the leadership of [[Athens]].

===In Greek democracies===
In ancient [[Athens]], the villages of [[Attica]] combined with the polis of Athens; consequently the "demos" and "polis" became identical in Athens and the former word assumed preference to denote the whole polity. Popular government was first established in the wealthy and populous Greek cities in [[Ionia]].&lt;ref name ="muller1"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Müller | first1 = Karl Otfried | author1-link = Karl Otfried Müller| first2 = Henry | last2 = Tufnell | author2-link = Henry Tufnell | first3 = George Cornewall | last3 = Lewis | author3-link = George Cornewall Lewis | title = The History and Antiquities of the Doric Race | edition = 2nd | series = 2 | year = 1839 | publisher = John Murray | pages = 72, 72–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this history the word and concept of "democracy" is derived. This synoecism was one of the primary causes of [[the Kyklos]] in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Hellas]].

Synoecism also occurred in the history of [[Mantineia]]. In the fifth century, after its synoecism, it became a democracy; in the fourth century, it was again divided ("''dioikismos''") and an [[oligarchy]] formed. Later, more political upheaval caused another synoecism, thus instituting another democracy.&lt;ref name="rahe" /&gt; This further occurred in the other [[Arcadia|Arcadian]] towns of [[Tegea]] and [[Heraia, Arcadia|Heraia]].

===In Greek oligarchies===
Ancient Greek states not democratically governed used the word "polis" in their public documents to signify sovereign power. The [[Dorians|Doric]] states of [[Crete]] and [[Sparta]] preserved the polis separate from the demos. As late as the second century AD, Cretan towns continued to denote themselves with "polis". [[Sparta]], however, deviating from this use of the word, denominated itself "damos" (δᾶμoς) in ancient laws, because it never thought of itself as a body opposed to the Perioeci.&lt;ref name="muller1" /&gt;

[[Karl Otfried Müller|Müller]] states: "In [[Oligarchy|oligarchical]] states, as in Elis, the people in later times remained almost constantly in the country; and it frequently happened that grandfathers and grandchildren had never seen the town: there were also country courts of justice, and other regulations intended to make up for the advantages of a city life. Where the courts of justice were at a distance, and there was no inducement to mechanical industry and internal commerce (see the term [[banausos]]), the ancient habits of life continued much longer in existence."&lt;ref name="muller1" /&gt;

== In ancient Rome ==
In [[ancient Rome]], some of the kinds of settlement that were incorporated by synoecism into greater municipal polities were the prefecture (''praefectura''), a non-autonomous village administered by a prefect; the ''oppidum'', a fortified, autonomous town; the ''castellum'', a small fortified place under or previously under martial jurisdiction; the ''forum'', being a marketplace; the ''conciliabulum'', being a meeting place; the ''vicus'', being a small, private settlement without government; the ''[[canabae]]'', being a settlement of dependents in the vicinity of a base; the ''[[pagus]]'', being a rural village; the ''gens'', being a tribal canton; the ''saltus'', being a settlement of ''coloni'' (farmers) on a large estate, part of which they leased from the ''conductor'' (manager); and the ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'', being a settlement of colonists from [[Rome]].{{Sfn | Abbott |Johnson|1926|pp= 10-20}}

== As an archaeological site ==
"Synoecism" also denominates an ancient [[Minoan civilization|Cretan]] archaeological site on the western fringes of [[Troullos]]. Artifacts discovered at the site include a [[terracotta]] bull figurine, a bronze statuette, and [[Minoan pottery|Late Minoan I pottery]].

* In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] introduced the practice of limiting Jewish population to a small number of the most wealthy families, known as "[[protected Jew]]s" (''Schutzjuden'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=571 Certificate Confirming Payment of Protection Money (''Schutzgeld'') for a Jewish Resident (1833)]&lt;/ref&gt; The first-born son in such families inherited this [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]; other children were considered useless by the authorities and had the choice of either abstaining from marriage or leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Simon Dubnow |first=Simon |last=Dubnow |title=The Newest History of the Jewish People, 1789–1914 |location= |publisher= |isbn= }}{{Full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following the establishment of the [[Pale of Settlement]] by [[Imperial Russia]], only "useful Jews" ({{lang-ru|полезные евреи}}) were allowed to live outside the Pale; these included Jews such as wealthy first-rung merchants ({{lang-ru|купцы первой гильдии}}), persons who had received [[higher education]], [[cantonist]]s (after serving their full term in the army), and some other categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How Russia Shaped the Modern World: From Art to Anti-Semitism, Ballet to Bolshevism |first=Steven G. |last=Marks |page=142 |isbn=0-691-11845-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive4/russia/russia.htm Russia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120013849/http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive4/russia/russia.htm |date=2008-11-20 }} at Institute for Jewish Policy Research&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Soviet Union]], Jewish members of the [[Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public]] were colloquially known as "useful Jews" or "pocket Jews" ({{lang-ru|карманные евреи}}), implying their corruption by high positions in the state [[hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.sem40.ru/anti/history/1501/ The infamous AZCSP (in Russian)] Prepared by Moscow Bureau for human rights.
